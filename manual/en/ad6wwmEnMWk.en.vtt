00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.990
With over 66 million passengers a year passing
through LA airport it should be a gateway

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.099
experience for the city and state.

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.560
But, in the past, if your journey took you
through the Tom Bradley International terminal

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.800
the experience has been far from uplifting.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.150
Thankfully that's now all changed with the
opening of a new terminal building designed

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.000
by Curtis Fentress of Fentress Architects.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.760
The starting point for the design was a wave-like
structure reminiscent of the city's famous

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.760
beaches. In response, Fentress has created
a distinctive arching sectional roofline which

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:55.280
also references the arches of the iconic LAX
control tower.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.489
The statistics behind the new Tom Bradley
are impressive.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.220
At nearly 112,000 square metres, it's double
the size of the previous terminal and is the

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.610
largest public works program in the history
of Los Angeles.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.210
It contains 15,500 tonnes of steel, and the
steel structure allows for a column-free interior

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.979
that rises to height of 31m at the central
Great Hall.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.240
It also has double the processing capacity
of the old terminal, with the ability to handle

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.850
4000 people an hour through Federal Inspection
Services. And that should add up to 8.6 million

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.539
passengers passing comfortably through the
terminal annually.

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.060
Of course, these days, airport terminals are
more than just a place where passengers transit.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.009
They've become a destination revenue source
in their own right.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.700
The new Tom Bradley centre is no exception.
The enormous electronic billboards inside

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.189
are one revenue source ... as well as the
shopping pavilions and food and beverage outlets

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.560
that have been incorporated into spaces created
by the impressive interior architecture.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.639
With the new terminal now fully operational,
international passengers passing through LAX

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:09.090
can expect an infinitely more pleasant and
relaxed experience to start or end their journey.
