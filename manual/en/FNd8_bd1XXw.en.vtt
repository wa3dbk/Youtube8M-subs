Hi, I'm Derek with thehealthytrucker.net.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.870
Today, I'm gonna show you a dumbbell routine
that you can do out on the road, anytime,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.720
anywhere, and all you need are these dumbbells.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.150
Being a truck driver, you're always looking
for equipment that you can take with you that's

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.710
relatively inexpensive.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.749
You can pick up these dumbbells nearly any
store.

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:31.339
And when you have time, maybe it's during
your new mandatory 30 minute break that you

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.460
have to take.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.670
Pop out of your cab, get in a dumbbell routine.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.360
I'm gonna show you a spin on three different
exercises that will actually use your cab

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360
as a prop.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.359
Let's talk about form really quick.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.660
When you go to a gym, you'll likely see people
swinging like this.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.989
They're using their back a lot to do a bicep
exercise.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.450
So what we're gonna show you is how you can
actually use the cab of your truck to do isolate

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.739
your biceps.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.969
So lets start with some standard curls.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.550
I've got ten pounders, just for demonstration
purposes.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.890
But by putting your back up against the cab,
you're going to force yourself to really use

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.280
your biceps and not your back.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.810
So go nice and slow here, i recommend starting
out with a weight that's comfortable for you.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.810
Something you can do 10-12 reps, and then
you can go from there.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.280
Another spin on these dumbbell curl exercises,
is gonna be your hammer curls.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.420
So instead of the traditional grip, you're
just going to hold it in a more vertical style.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.450
Come up like this.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.450
Again, find a weight that's comfortable for
you.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.659
Try to come up with 10-12 reps.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.631
Another one if you're looking into toning
and really focusing on the shape of that bicep

00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:55.680
are gorilla curls where you're gonna bring
it out front like this.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.820
Again this is a great exercise to do to really
isolate that bicep muscle.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.590
