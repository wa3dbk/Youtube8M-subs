00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
Hi YouTube, Darth Here:
After a suggestion on twitter from a viewer,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.370
I wanted to make a quick video about the recoil
changes from Battlefield 4 to Battlefield:

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.950
Hardline, and what you can expect.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.849
If you don't know already, the amount of recoil
in Battlefield: Hardline has substantially

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.990
increased from its relatively tame values
Battlefield 4.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.880
First, I'm going to show you what an automatic
assault rifle looks like in Battlefield 4.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.330
This is the M416, a relatively stable platform
at midrange that has a predictable upwards

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.529
recoil pattern.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.710
Even completely holding on the hose, the pattern
is tight and short.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.099
Let's look at an assault rifle from Battlefield:
Hardline.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.460
This is the M16A3 - yes, the M16A3 is back.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.150
But it's definitely not your same old M16,
as you'll see that the hipfire spread is pretty

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.150
steep already.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.550
Now when I aim down sights at close range,
the spray takes the weapon upwards pretty

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.550
quickly.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.430
So far the difference isn't quite as noticible
as it is at longer ranges.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.960
So let's look at the M416 at a slightly longer
range.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.540
Uncontrolled, the weapon slides upwards at
range pretty quickly.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.581
But with a little control, the M416 assault
rifle is still pretty manageable, even at

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:56.581
a distance.

00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:01.620
If I control my fire and my recoil, by countering
the weapon's recoil, and managing my bursts,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.720
the spread at a distance is still very tight.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.510
With single shot, the M416 is a laser.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.420
Compare this to Battlefield: Hardline, where
at a distance the vertical recoil of the M16A3

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.630
carries it beyond even my target building.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.200
If you attempt to control the weapon, this
results in a comparatively much wider spread

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.079
and some difficult-to-counter recoil.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.020
Now these weapons are not exact copies of
each other, but do fill similar roles in both

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.020
games.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.119
Keep in mind that all these weapon stats are
vastly different than one another, but I do

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.290
want to highlight the difference between both
games with these tests.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.420
So let's look at one other weapon from Battlefield:
Hardline, the Colt Commando RO933.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.740
In contrast to the M16A3, this is a carbine,
built for short range encounters.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.140
As you can see from this medium range test,
the gun goes completely berserk and into the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.950
sky when it's not controlled.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.159
Even if I switch to single-shot mode, the
minimum spread on the weapons in Battlefield:

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.210
Hardline is noticeably larger than in Battlefield
4.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.609
So the increase in the weapon's recoil stats
is not the only thing you'll have to compensate

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:54.999
for in Battlefield: Hardline.

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:58.240
If you play for any length of time in the
beta, you'll notice that Visual Recoil is

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
back.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.240
What is visual recoil?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.689
It's the animation of your sight in tandem
with the shaking of the gun.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.110
In Battlefield 4, this was removed from most
weapon sights in the Fall Patch.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.170
Well, like it or not, it's back in Battlefield:
Hardline.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.890
It's not quite as egregious as it was in Battlefield
4, but you'll definitely notice it when you're

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.050
trying to take a shot in Battlefield: Hardline.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.660
With the laser being nearly invisible in most
scopes, there's no workaround this time to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.310
get away from visual recoil.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.670
There's one last new thing for recoil in Battlefield:
Hardline: that is when you get hit, your soldier

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.700
visibly reacts to the shot.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.570
This, more than anything, is going to play
havoc on your aim.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.440
My recommendation to counter this particular
bit of visual recoil would be to shoot first

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.190
and ask questions later when you're in a head-to-head
fight.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.640
So the difficulty in successfully landing
shots in Battlefield: Hardline has definitely

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.390
gone significantly upwards.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.740
But there are some familiar techniques that
you can use to get better shots.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.930
First, stop moving when you're aiming down
sights.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.750
It'll keep your spread to a minimum.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.770
Second, only use hip-fire in extreme close-quarters
situations.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.370
Third, fire in short, controlled bursts.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.250
This is really going to be critical when firing
weapons with high vertical recoil and first

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.960
shot recoil multipliers.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.020
And finally, choose attachments that are appropriate
to your play style.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.960
If you find that you move and shoot a lot
and are in close quarters, you're going to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.830
want attachments that benefit hipfire.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.360
If you're the kind of combatant that will
stop, and take the time to burst accurately,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.530
consider heavy barrels and angled grips.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.170
If you want to get in early practice without
playing Battlefield: Hardline, I'd recommend

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.930
trying out the FAMAS or AEK971 in Battlefield
4.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.520
Both of these weapons are challenging for
recoil practice.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.370
That's it for this primer video on recoil
in Battlefield: Hardline.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.360
