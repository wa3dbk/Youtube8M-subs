00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
She is really very sweet and always tells us nice stories from the Bible

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That is great holy tell us please I will force but you children have to pay attention

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
if you do and answer my question correctly I will sing with you that sounds perfect

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we promise to listen and we love your stories

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
all right in those times in the Jewish community when a man would die all his

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
money would be divided between his children

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
if there was any problem then the matter would be taken to the court

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to be settled it so happened that after a man's death

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
his sons were fighting over how much money each one should get

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
one of the sons went to Jesus to solve the problem

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
on reaching the place where Jesus was preaching the man said

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Lord my brother is not giving me my fair share of money my father has left behind for us

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
please ask him to give me my share Jesus said I could do that

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but at the same time I cannot judge how your father's money all be divided

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Jesus then turned to the crowd and said

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
there is a lesson for all of you here are endless riches that are outside of you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it is what is inside your in your heart which really matters

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the world might judge you on the amount of money but the most important thing

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is that you must try to make yourself richer in the eyes of the Lord

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
beware of greed of any kind as it only brings warm

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Wow Holy we learn so much from you everyday

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I am glad to hear that now I will ask a question kids let's see which if you can answer this one

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
what did Jesus tell his people to be aware off

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I think I can answer this is it greed Holy

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
