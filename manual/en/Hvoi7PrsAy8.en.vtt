00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.659
Welcome to Watson King Planetarium at Towson University. I'm Alex stores

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.990
I'm one of the luckiest people in the world because I get paid to do my hobby

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.250
My Hobby is astronomy and I teach teachers about astronomy here at Towson

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.269
our

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.589
Planetarium is a big dome. It's a big dome shape

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.459
movie screen much like [this] the inside of a cereal Bowl

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.079
and we have a projector in the middle that can show us anything we like from the

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:45.299
View from the Earth and also a view from space out the stars and planets and galaxies anything in the outer universe

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.669
We have a variety of courses in astronomy in the core Curriculum here at Towson we can offer courses to any major

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.500
in basic astronomy

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.840
and then the second semester in basic astronomy coverage covers Galaxies and cosmology an

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.219
Advanced core Curriculum course is called the cosmic origins or we talk about critically analyzing scientific ideas

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.659
and

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.409
Now if the weather is nice, we can open up our telescope and look at some of these celestial objects up close and personal

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.279
This is our new 16 inch telescope from optical guidance systems

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.030
the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.909
Diameter of the mirror is 16 inches across we could put in a variety of different objects to get different

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.289
Magnifications when we have public nights we use an eyepiece

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.810
like this one

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.630
In different powers and different combinations to give you a wide Angle view or a close-up view

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:11.238
What we have on the telescope now is a technical camera for our advanced students our majors can actually use this telescope to take

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.630
scientific Data and we hope published scientific papers

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.989
This concludes our tour the astronomical facilities in Towson University. I'm Alex stores

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.599
I'd like to thank you for watching this video

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.269
I need to join us our public planetarium shows [and] [postal] you on the third Friday of every month

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.820
And if you decide to come here, and take some of our astronomy courses will have a chance to actually use some of this equipment
