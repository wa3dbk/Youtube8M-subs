00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:06.509
Video Transcript for “2014 Evergreen Bay
Hill Fifth Wheel Features (Part 2 of 2)”

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.509
Chad: Randy, we've seen the inside.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:08.509
Take us around the outside of this here now.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:09.860
I just want to point out a few things.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.440
One piece fiberglass cap on the front.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.600
We seen the extra room it gave us on the inside.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.859
Tell us the features on the outside here.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.910
Randy: First of all, no seams in the fiberglass
cap [crosstalk 00:21] less maintenance down

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.720
the road, [lap 00:24] joint, we've talked
about this before.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.340
There's good ways to do it and bad ways to
do it and this is the best way to do it.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.880
I love to see it on the Bay Hill.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.650
The other thing that they've done, in the
industry we've seen these caps fade that are

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.530
just gel coat and they've got less expensive
gel coat on it.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.620
This is painted, it's automotive paint.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.690
It's not going to fade.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.149
So it's going to keep those super model looks
that you talked about earlier in the video,

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.309
at all times.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.469
It's just ... I just love the way this thing
looks.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.720
It is probably the prettiest looking coach
that we have here at the dealership and that's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.510
the first thing that you notice about the
Bay Hill when you walk up to it.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.980
Then [inaudible 00:51] start getting a little
bit closer, we just can see the quality.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010
We see the quality of the gel coat on the
sidewalls.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.480
They do this a little bit differently than
the other guys out there doing it.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.140
They actually, it is baked right into the
sidewall.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.629
It floats to the top.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.690
It gives us a much better lamination system.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.270
It's going to last a long time.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.210
Super easy to keep clean and just a great
way to do it as everything on the Bay Hill,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.340
quality really comes to mind when I talk about
this product.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.451
Chad: Yeah, and we were talking earlier, just
chit-chatting about how, you know when we

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:20.270
look at other brands, they apply the gel coat
after, after the fiberglass [crosstalk 01:20]

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.270
is
Randy: Just spray it on.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.270
Chad: That's exactly right, yep.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.240
This is built right in from the initial liquid
process.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.240
Randy: It is.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.240
Chad: Some things on the front here.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.870
They use Trailair on the front.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.420
You can option this in with Trailair, gives
us a better ride.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.600
Randy: Big name in the industry, back to using
those quality parts on this piece here.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600
Chad: Yep.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.910
Randy: You know, some of the other guys will
deviate, use a little bit less expensive stuff.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.130
I want to see the good stuff.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.890
When you're buying a coach of this quality,
you want to see the best stuff on it and that's

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.890
what they bring to the table.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.480
Chad: It's got a strut and an airbag on it,
so when we're towing this fifth wheel, we've

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.890
got a bedroom slide on this obviously, and
that just keeps that suspension ...

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.890
Randy: Exactly right.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.120
What, you know, most of our larger trucks
are sprung pretty tight to handle this kind

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.160
of pin load.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.540
This just eases that as we're going down the
road, especially with the state our roads

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.520
are in in the Northern Vermont here this time
of year, they're not [02:00] so great.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.340
Chad: Yep
Randy: So that just makes us go down, along

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.020
with the suspension dampening system we've
got on the axles too.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.180
We also have a Trailair buffer there as well.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.071
So that just makes this thing go down the
road very smoothly for us where some of the

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:11.129
other stuff will not out there.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.220
Chad: Tell us, aluminum studding to the side
walls here?

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.310
Randy: All welded.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.159
All welded around the compartment doors as
well.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.519
Some of the other guys will just put studs
haphazardly and cut holes in.

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.879
These are all framed so we get much better
seals.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.579
We're not going to have any movement there.

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.129
We've pinched this right against that aluminum
studding so again, it's going hold up as we

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.959
go down the road with this guy for a long,
long time.

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.500
Chad: Little bit about the door latches here.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.629
I don't know if you can catch this Josh.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.950
These are metal on the backside here so it's
not a plastic latch.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.799
Metal on the front, like a nice high-end motor
home.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.799
Metal on the back.

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:40.799
Randy: Metal strikers.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.799
Chad: Slam shut, use your latches, it opens
up.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.799
Randy: Back to that quality, tons of storage
in here.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:46.799
Chad: Yep. [crosstalk 02:46] Trying to catch
it, but ...

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.010
Randy: We see some floor plans a little bit
for Josh to see it, some floor plans have

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.560
pushed the deck so far forward, it really
compresses our storage area.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.129
Bay Hill took this in consideration and they
were able to work with their floor plans to

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.629
give us the maximum amount of storage down
here because when we're using these for long

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.180
term, we know how important the storage is
and they really come to the plate, give us

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.180
a good job with that.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.180
Chad: We've got a dropped floor on that.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.319
You can catch this from the video Josh.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.300
We got the dropped floor, they wrapped that
J-channel all the way back to the main frame,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.099
keeps all the salt, all the debris, all the
dirt.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.099
Randy: It does.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.709
It's not flapping around in the breeze.

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.650
Just a nice clean look and a better way to
do it.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.650
Yep.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.370
Chad: There's an LED light strip on there
below that we don't have on right now, but

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.409
it's got a beautiful LED light strip like
the purple one that we have on there, the

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.769
blue one that is on the front, this current
model here has a central vac in place.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.080
You might be able to catch that.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.059
We got the central vac here.

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.300
We've also got, this is for tv hookup here
is it?

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.300
Randy: It is.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.840
We can put a tv down here if you're into watching
the sporting events or you go to races or

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840
whatever.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.420
You want to sit under your nice awning here
and use tv down here, we've got that capability.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.959
Also, outside speakers.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.800
You don't see outside speakers a whole lot
on these higher-end fifth wheels due to the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.099
stereo systems they're using.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.719
They're usually using a home theater system
which doesn't allow us to have the outside

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:56.719
speaker option.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:57.719
We have it on the Bay Hill.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.819
I like to listen to music outside or just
have it on in the background, maybe listen

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.939
to the [04:00] ballgame while you're cooking
or doing whatever out at your camping weekend.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.939
Chad: I like how they tone the everybody has
these and they're white, they toned it down.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:08.939
It matches the outside.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.879
[crosstalk 04:09]
Randy: They've textured it a little bit.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.469
Nice job, they've got indoor/outdoor here
on the floor.

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.419
Some guys do not finish off this downstairs
compartment.

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.320
This just is all finished off, nice clean
look.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.220
We're not going to catch anything that we
store in there on the plumbing or wiring stuff.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.170
Chad: Tell us about these levelers, this is
is a true leveling hydraulic leveling system.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.170
Randy: It is.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.280
It can't get any easier than this and I'll
be honest with you.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.610
It's like having a basement underneath this
coach when you've got the levelers down on

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.610
the ground.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.610
Chad: Yeah.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.220
Randy: This particular floorplan is one of
the shorter ones that Bay Hill makes so it's

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.820
running the four-point leveling system.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.500
This is built by LCI, it comes standard on
the Bay Hill.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.360
These are just incredible.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.070
We see them on a lot of other product lines
out there.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.910
You can actually lift this camper off the
ground with that and they say we can change

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.910
our tires with it.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.270
It's just a nice, nice system.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.110
I haven't seen any failures, all machined
in-house by LCI, all made in America, good

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.110
system.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.510
Chad: So when I get to my site, I just push
a button.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.070
I no longer have to back it up on my boards.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.920
I no longer have to put my [chalks 05:01]
under the wheels and [crosstalk 05:02] those

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.680
sort of ...
Randy: Get the truck out of the way, hit a

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.640
button and that's going to drop that rear
landing gear.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.790
You'll see the nose of this come down, come
up to level and just everything just kind

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.550
of pans out and makes it a nice little, it
couldn't get any easier.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.040
Chad: Another thing I want to point out, Sorry
here, we're in our showroom, things are a

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.040
little tight.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.730
We've got this on display in our showroom
just because this unit has been so popular,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.080
we put it inside so we don't have to constantly
taking the customer outside.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.080
[crosstalk 05:22]
Randy: Frameless windows.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.910
Super clean look, we're seeing it more and
more often in the industry now.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.960
I think it's probably going to become the
norm in a few years.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.390
I love the way they look.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.550
It's an automotive seal on it, so a little
bit less maintenance for us down the road

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.490
and just it brings a lot of nice things to
the table and it's also available in the dual

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.950
pane which was the way the typically order
this stuff.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.360
So, nice, nice, feature.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.610
We can open them as well.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.870
Chad: Yeah, opens from the inside, [inaudible
05:46] opens up so we can keep them open during

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.870
the rains.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.870
Randy: Exactly right.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.870
Chad: Really nice.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.731
Also, one thing, there's no seals that when
you look at that window up there, there's

00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:54.800
no seals on the outside of this window.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.040
It's all sealed from the in ... or all covered.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.610
There's no UV rays beating down on those seals.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.220
Randy: Exactly right, and it's a pinch [06:00]
fit and again, automotive technology there

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.221
and a great way to do it.

00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.221
I love to see it in the industry.

00:06:05.221 --> 00:06:06.221
Chad: Yeah.

00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:07.440
Well Randy, thank you for your time today.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.510
We're going to kind of wrap this up a little
bit.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.570
One thing, oh shoot, let's talk about the
stairs on this.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.930
Let's not go too far.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.570
Four steps on these stairs ...
Randy: When you're ...

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.570
Chad: ... instead of three.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.201
Randy: ... old and fat like me, you don't
have to jump up [laughter] Nice and easy to

00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:21.201
get into.

00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.201
Grab handle.

00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:25.360
I just, everything that you could possibly
want on this is they've got it and they've

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.840
it incorporated it and they've done it very
well.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.840
Chad: Yep.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.520
Four stairs, and the reason that they have
four stairs is because we use the bigger I-beam

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.530
framing on this.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.640
Randy: We're sitting a little bit higher with
the main body of this coach due to our heavier

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.030
duty running gear.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.300
We've got the slides above the floor or on
the floor level on this so we got to be able

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.000
to slide those out so the four steps become
very important on this guy.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Chad: Yep.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Really nice feature on it so.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.240
Well to wrap it up again, don't forget guys,
Pete's RV Center.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.200
We lead the industry, not only with product
knowledge, but we sell a lot of trailers.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.310
We stock a lot of trailers.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.760
Oftentimes over a thousand units in stock
so if you're looking for the best price, contact

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.860

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.440
It's Randy, it's Chad here.

We can get you the best price.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.830
If you don't shop our price, you're going
to pay too much for your RV.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.210
We can deliver it to your doorstep.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.920

on some financing packages.

Randy: He's got some great stuff available

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.220

bank.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.930
They know how much product we sell.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.930
They want to make money.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.930
We want to make money.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.400
We try to save everybody money through volume.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400
Chad: Yep.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400
We take trades.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.400
