00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:05.567
The President:
I want to take a few moments at the top to talk about something

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:09.900
that, with all the big issues
going on,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.834
hasn't received much attention,
but I think is worth talking

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:15.500
about briefly.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.834
As some of you know, we have a
humanitarian crisis that's

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:25.900
taking place in Sri Lanka, and
I've been increasingly saddened

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.433
by the desperate news in recent
days.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:33.066
Tens of thousands of innocent
civilians are trapped between

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:37.100
the warring government forces
and the Tamil Tigers in Sri

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.367
Lanka with no means of escape,
little access to food, water,

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.000
shelter, and medicine.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.533
This has led to widespread
suffering and the loss of

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.100
hundreds if not thousands of
lives.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.400
Without urgent action, this
humanitarian crisis could turn

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.500
into a catastrophe.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.533
Now is the time, I believe, to
put aside some of the political

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:04.633
issues that are involved and to
put the lives of the men and

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:08.667
women and children who are
innocently caught in the

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.367
crossfire, to put them first.

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:14.133
So I urge the Tamil Tigers to
lay down their arms and let

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.800
civilians go.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.633
Their forced recruitment of
civilians and their use of

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:22.266
civilians as human shields is
deplorable.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.533
These tactics will only serve to
alienate all those who

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.166
carry them out.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.467
I'm also calling on the Sri
Lankan government to take

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:33.500
several steps to alleviate this
humanitarian crisis.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.367
First, the government should
stop the indiscriminate shelling

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.600
that has taken hundreds of
innocent lives,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.500
including several hospitals, and
the government should live up to

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.300
its commitment to not use heavy
weapons in the conflict zone.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.900
Second, the government should
give United Nations humanitarian

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.767
teams access to the civilians
who are trapped between the

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:57.367
warring parties so that they can
receive the immediate assistance

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.066
necessary to save lives.

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.667
Third, the government should
also allow the United Nations

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:06.200
and the International Committee
of the Red Cross access to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.133
nearly 190,000 displaced people
within Sri Lanka so that they

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:14.500
can receive additional support
that they need.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.200
The United States stands ready
to work with the international

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200
community to support the people
of Sri Lanka in this time

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.133
of suffering.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.533
I don't believe that we can
delay.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:28.900
Now is the time for all of us to
work together to avert further

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.667
humanitarian suffering.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:35.333
Going forward, Sri Lanka must
seek a peace that is secure and

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:39.533
lasting, and grounded in respect
for all of its citizens.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:42.633
More civilian casualties and
inadequate care for those caught

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.867
in resettlement camps will only
make it more difficult to

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:50.200
achieve the peace that the
people of Sri Lanka deserve.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.867
Now, let me also say a few words
about an issue that I know you

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:57.767
asked Robert Gibbs about quite a
bit today,

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:00.967
and that's my decision to argue
against the release of

00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:03.667
additional detainee photos.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:06.800
Understand, these photos are
associated with closed

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.734
investigations of the alleged
abuse of detainees in our

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:12.900
ongoing war effort.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.333
And I want to emphasize that
these photos that were requested

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:19.834
in this case are not
particularly sensational,

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:23.300
especially when compared to the
painful images that we remember

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.333
from Abu Ghraib, but they do
represent conduct that did not

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:30.100
conform with the Army Manual.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.000
That's precisely why they were
investigated --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.200
and, I might add, investigated long before I took office --

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.800
and, where appropriate, sanctions have been applied.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.266
In other words, this is not a
situation in which the Pentagon

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:48.667
has concealed or sought to
justify inappropriate action.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:51.834
Rather, it has gone through the
appropriate and

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:53.533
regular processes.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:59.600
And the individuals who were
involved have been identified,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.233
and appropriate actions have
been taken.

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:05.834
It's therefore my belief that
the publication of these photos

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:09.800
would not add any additional
benefit to our understanding of

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.567
what was carried out in the past
by a small number

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.200
of individuals.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.000
In fact, the most direct
consequence of releasing them,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.300
I believe, would be to further
inflame anti-American opinion

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.200
and to put our troops in greater
danger.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.934
Moreover, I fear the publication
of these photos may only have a

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:31.533
chilling effect on future
investigations of

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:32.900
detainee abuse.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.033
And obviously the thing that is
most important in my mind is

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:40.867
making sure that we are abiding
by the Army Manual and that we

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:47.200
are swiftly investigating any
instances in which individuals

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.934
have not acted appropriately,
and that they are

00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:51.300
appropriately sanctioned.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.500
That's my aim and I do not
believe that the release of

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.934
these photos at this time would
further that goal.

00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:01.166
Now, let me be clear: I am
concerned about how the release

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.934
of these photos would be --
would impact on the safety

00:05:04.934 --> 00:05:06.667
of our troops.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:10.066
I have made it very clear to all
who are within the chain of

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:13.533
command, however, of the United
States Armed Forces that the

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:17.133
abuse of detainees in our
custody is prohibited and will

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:19.166
not be tolerated.

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:22.467
I have repeated that since I've
been in office,

00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:24.400
Secretary Gates understands
that,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.967
Admiral Mullen understands that,
and that has been communicated

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:30.300
across the chain of command.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.967
Any abuse of detainees is
unacceptable.

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.633
It is against our values.

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:37.567
It endangers our security.

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:39.600
It will not be tolerated.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.367
All right.

00:05:40.367 --> 00:05:41.700
Thank you very much, everybody.
