00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.009
buy were saying that this would be more
concerned about is that as they should

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.270

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.840
beginning of our videos and i want to
show you the ad that we're talking about

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.430

flood he's mohit lastly preclude him
from for or ticket but accurately no

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.190
so prowess some right wing and obviously
uh... and i don't get it

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.159
first of all was such a critical

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.200
i don't know if that is and obviously
they're trying to make it seem like this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.549
incompetent loser who doesn't know how
to say anything or are you know he he's

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.889
a rambling on and on skills catskill
beetle

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:50.390
and he's a rapper of course cousins but
ref course that larry

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.530
and uh... in ways that we show obama and
then they have been you know michelle

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.390
obama was also making no sense at all
and you know dancing around in a chicken

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.079
chicken over whether it is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.899
there were any sale a few speaking look
bad around shining me or something like

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.170
that feeling my thunder and why why is
that i don't think any of it i think

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.959
that they really need that he said that
the jokingly our lifestyle you know as

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.689
my beautiful anxious to make under that
kind of thing light all coming out of

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:20.159
the f_b_i_ bible descriptor some
supports here

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.209
uh... window molecule officers a
one-point two trillion dollar deficit

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.749
that the republicans have had so tutsis
with the deficits in the money waiting

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.739
down

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.069
where was the rap video on bush and how
incompetent

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.720
he was now we turn a five hundred
billion dollar surplus into a one point

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.250
two trillion dollar deficit so sperry
and gas prices skyrocketed under bush

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.690
and in two thousand they before obama
took office they went through the roof

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.849
or was a rap video on that chicka chicka
boom boom that

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.259
mckay

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.699
of course the question is was this ridge

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.589
you know that's killed me

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.939
an hour add that would preempt racial
for me

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.080
you actually were memory c_n_n_ would
arrive

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.079
advocate at jr terrorist list or not

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.509
police don't know

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:13.910
stupid stupid but

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.299
uh...

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.419
it's like

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:17.939
that i think we would like to do

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.199
and subdued ebusiness maybe do those
sometimes they don't like

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.519
bombing indonesian jet was political
they get when you put your name is going

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.890
on around the world possessed land at
once and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.030
like that there's a right wing video

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.479
you know that specifically made too

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.329
from radical on the bed

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.249
having to do that you can see the
direction like it has an agenda

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:39.409
silverlight

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.189
this kind of a particular delivery
ticketless reineck programs with a good

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.459
or if there is less than a

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.199
out what i think yes but

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.259
no because the it's more stimulate your
senses more jokingly

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.269
not not bad

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.729
funny billion yeah yeah i i think the
main thing that i had a problem was

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:01.529
michelle obama's listening is actually
thought album of course is pretty close

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.439
to his voice but he doesn't say that
nonsense stuff

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.909
but that inflation was pretty right

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.010
can we get michelle obama's would be a
character there

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.279
cassie's she sings said

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.290
not speak a language overall

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.889
coming home

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.090
d_e_s_

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.089
have

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:28.089
design analysis and it's the homeless
finally gets serious right

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.460
at the end of the year which is a week

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.470
but that differences and

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.400
perspective

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.030
anyway so what they really really is
reasonable question but i i i over all i

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.910
think i would if you like the supreme
court

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.210
they're really matter if it's racial
serta

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.890
and i love using that word naa uh... at
the bottom line is that it's absurd it's

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.770
probably were misleading and his roofie
and if they had a nice trust me
