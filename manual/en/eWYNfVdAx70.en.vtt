00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.500
In this clip we are going to talk about the
proper service procedure for removing and

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:14.459
replacing a rear axle U joint on a Ford Explorer.
In this step we are going to talk about the

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:22.050
proper service procedure for indexing of the
drive shaft and actual removal. The drive

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.600
shaft is not balanced when it is made and
they take it and put it in a machine and spin

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.270
it to a high speed and apply weights to it.
We are going to want to match that drive shaft

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.380
up exactly where it came from on the vehicle.
To do that we are going to use a piece of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:49.940
silt stone.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.640
What I'm going to do with my silt stone is
take and draw a large line down the drive

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.760
shaft onto the other side of the U joint and
down the axle flange and onto to the differential

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.470
case. The reason why I put such a large mark
on there is during the service procedure you

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.860
may rub off a small mark. If you were to take
and just put a dinky mark on there you may

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.420
actually rub it off and then you run the possibility
of lining it up out of balance. On this style

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.410
U joint or drive shaft, you're going to have
to use a hammer to break the corrosion between

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.100
the pinion flange and the end of the drive
shaft. I'm going to hold onto it with my hand

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:40.960
and pop it with the hammer.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.520
You can see it's beginning to break free.
What you're going to do is just slide it out

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:57.840
from there. Alright and there we go. Once
you have it free from the pinion flange you

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.020
can slide it out of the front of the transmission
or out of the rear of the transmission. It

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:11.439
just slides together. Go ahead grab a hold
of the drive shaft and slide it out.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:22.430
Just like so.
That is the proper way to index your drive

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.730
shaft and remove it from the vehicle for U
joint service.
