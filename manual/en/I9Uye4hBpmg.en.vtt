00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.350
The accessories that come with this machine,
there’s quite a few in your packet.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.639
We're going to start off with the warranty
that is in with your instructions manual.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.560
This warranty is for five years on the machine,
with a one-year parts and labor warranty offered

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.269
by your local Husqvarna Viking Dealer.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.770
You'll want to send that in and get that all
registered.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.670
You can also do that online.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.239
Your book, we will work through the user’s
guide, so if you find a section about something

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.910
on your serge you want to know, you can just
find the video and it will show you what this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.300
is actually meaning.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.469
There is a great fabric and thread guide in
here that we will reference later for doing

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.480
a lot of your other stitches.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.970
These are great, and it’s nice to work through
those, and practice as you go.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:56.670
We also have … Okay in with your accessories,
let’s start here, there are four spool caps.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.579
These bigger cones are meant to go underneath
your larger serge cones.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.320
What they'll do is just go up through the
middle and they'll stabilize these from wiggling

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.920
around or leaning to the side, which makes
the thread hard to pull off if that’s the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.920
case.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.130
Then if you can't find them, well they're
probably stuck up in one of your little cones

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.130
there.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.200
You have four of those, and you also have
four spool caps.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.130
These are already on your serge when you purchase
it with the sample thread that comes with

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.130
it.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.439
This will be what you use when you use smaller
spools, which you can do.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.950
These will help them stay in place and not
kind of slide up as the serge is in use.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.920
You have four of each size.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.549
That goes out ... We also have some disks.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.930
These will be placed underneath your spool,
so if they need some extra stability there

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.090
too, those are in there.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.299
You have extra needles.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.920
Needles are specific for this serge.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.850
You will want to find the system number of
ELX705.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.460
That is not a standard household needle, so
don't reach for your sewing machine needles

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.890
to put in your serger, you need to have these.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.890
Usually stores like ours keep them separated
from the regular needles so they don't accidentally

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.899
get picked up.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.050
Just ask for where the serge needles are,
and you'll be good to go.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.050
Thread nets.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.440
I don't need these a lot of times when I'm
using good quality threads, but if you ever

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.720
got cones that are kind of, the thread is
kind of falling down or puddling at the bottom,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.030
what you can do is slide these, oh here, get
another one.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.200
I usually have a couple of these in here.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.001
If you need them shorter you can always cut
them.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:40.120
Yes you have four, all you have to do is open
these up, get them started, and then slide

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.050
them over the cone and very gentle, so they'll
keep the thread still going up off the cone,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.390
but without them falling down.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.019
We also have, ah my favorite, a pair of tweezers.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.440
These, I'm going to open up right now, because
I know I will be using these throughout our

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.440
videos.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.010
They are going to be the extension of my fingers
and helps get into those small areas.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.000
Oil, we're going to show you how to clean
and oil your machine.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.770
Yes you do need to do that.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.010
There is a small wrench in here, along with
an extra blade.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.980
This is a lower blade here.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.900
It’s sharp but you could touch it and it’s
not going to cut yourself, but that will help

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.220
you change it out after it gets dull and they
will.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.049
Knives get dull after you use a lot of man-made
fibers.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.599
Like if you’re going to use this all with
fleece, that polyester is going to dull that

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.599
knife a lot quicker.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.640
You’ve got a backup, so when it’s the
weekend and you’re still sewing and you’re

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.150
having trouble, you can change it out.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.610
You have a large screwdriver and a small screwdriver.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.239
Let me show you where the other accessories
are hidden.

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.080
Take the door, slide it out to the side, and
pull straight down.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.670
There is the small screw driver, and this
is the one that’s going to loosen your screws

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:53.670
for your needles.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.079
That’s nice that it has its own little home
right there for you to keep it close.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.390
You also have a brush for cleaning, and you
have two other things kind of in this little

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.650
area where the little foam is.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.829
You have a tooth-rig converter, and also a
smaller stitch finger, which we will get into

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.591
when we worked with different fabrics and
weights, and we want the seam to be just a

00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.030
little different size, but still supported.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.820
We will go through all of those, and all these
accessories will be included in our videos.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.410
Then when you’re done, usually you get everything
threaded up and ready to go.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.130
Your lint catcher has a little nub right here,
that you can slide, I always slide it into

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.010
the edge here first and then catch it on the
little holder here and that will sit.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.900
I always have to take it off though, to get
inside.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.160
A lot of times I'm going to leave that off
so I can open and close this really quickly.
