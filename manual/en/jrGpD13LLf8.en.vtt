00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.017
- [Voiceover] Let's take a closer look

00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:06.849
at different ways in which crossing over

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:09.914
or genetic recombination can happen.

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:12.051
So, here we have our homologous pair

00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.650
of chromosomes again
that are crossing over.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.197
And we get something that looks like that.

00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:22.140
And this is called a single crossover.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.293
For the simple reason that
they're crossing over once.

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:32.962
But sometimes these chromosomes can get,

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.166
again kinda close together,

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.187
and they might crossover in that

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:40.647
same exact spot a second time.

00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:42.644
And then we're actually
back to square one,

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:45.198
because now the chromosomes revert

00:00:45.198 --> 00:00:46.475
to what they originally were.

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:49.006
So they might not look like
crossing over ever happened,

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.723
but it actually happened twice.

00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:55.421
So, this is called a two strand

00:00:56.886 --> 00:00:58.737
double crossover.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.193
And it's called a two
strand double crossover

00:01:06.193 --> 00:01:08.815
because it involves two strands,

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:11.719
let's actually highlight the
two strands that were involved.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.739
So it was this strand and that strand.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:17.980
And it's called double because
crossing over happened twice.

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:21.047
Let's look at another scenario.

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:23.849
So again, we're gonna
cross over our chromosomes.

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:25.709
So we're gonna say that

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.536
that's the first incident
of crossing over.

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:30.510
Actually gonna label it one.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.881
I'll label the fist one also.

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.831
That was the first
incident of crossing over,

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.454
and then we had a second
incident of crossing over.

00:01:37.454 --> 00:01:40.793
So anyway, back to our second scenario,

00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:45.752
let's say that these two
chromatids now cross over.

00:01:46.644 --> 00:01:49.166
So, that can happen in
a few different ways.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.372
Let's go through two ways
in which that can happen.

00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:55.640
Maybe they cross over exactly
at this spot over here.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.871
And in that case, we're gonna get

00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:59.680
a set of chromosomes that looks like that.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.236
Or, maybe not.

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:04.811
Maybe they're gonna cross over at a spot,

00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:06.646
like somewhere over there.

00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:09.357
And in that case, we're gonna get

00:02:09.357 --> 00:02:11.982
a set of chromosomes that looks like that.

00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:14.327
Again, that was our second crossing over.

00:02:14.327 --> 00:02:18.737
So we just described something
called a three strand

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:22.011
double crossover.

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.050
And it's called a three strand
double crossover because,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.463
well in this case, three
chromatids were involved,

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:32.299
three strands.

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.413
So let's just highlight them.

00:02:33.413 --> 00:02:35.084
I'm gonna highlight them
in the beginning pair.

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.686
Just cause it's easier.

00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:38.491
So it involved

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:42.546
this strand and that
strand and that strand.

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:43.964
And again a double crossover because

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.914
crossing over happened twice.

00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:48.004
So hopefully you're
starting to get the idea

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:50.651
that crossing over can
happen in many different ways

00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:52.670
and a number of times.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.169
Let's look at a third scenario.

00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:57.891
So again, we're gonna have crossing over

00:02:57.891 --> 00:02:59.562
happening one time.

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:02.372
And then we're gonna
have it happening again,

00:03:02.372 --> 00:03:05.437
but we're gonna say,
well maybe crossing over

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:08.036
now happens between these two chromatids.

00:03:08.036 --> 00:03:12.158
And also happens between
these two chromatids.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.461
You're gonna see, we're gonna involve

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:15.968
all four strands this time.

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:18.360
The first scenario we'll look at is well,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.450
maybe crossing over in
both and that happens

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.993
right at that spot.

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:25.989
So in that case we're gonna get

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.591
a set of chromosomes that looks like that.

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:30.722
But maybe not.

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:34.368
Maybe crossing over, let's
say in the purple chromosome,

00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:36.595
happened over there.

00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:40.428
Then we'd get a chromosome
that looked like that.

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:41.914
And then maybe the blue chromosome

00:03:41.914 --> 00:03:45.072
also maybe crossing over
happened over there.

00:03:45.764 --> 00:03:47.431
Then we'd get a set of chromosomes

00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:50.215
that looks like that.

00:03:51.122 --> 00:03:52.516
And what we just described,

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:55.138
well this is called a four strand

00:03:56.881 --> 00:03:58.801
double crossover.

00:04:00.452 --> 00:04:03.328
So in this case we
involved all four strands.

00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:05.001
This strand.

00:04:05.992 --> 00:04:07.362
Sorry about that.

00:04:07.362 --> 00:04:09.986
This strand and this strand

00:04:09.986 --> 00:04:12.888
and this one and this one.

00:04:12.888 --> 00:04:14.258
And again, it was a double crossover

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:16.974
because crossing over happened twice.

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:18.901
So the point of showing you all this

00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:21.595
is to help us understand that

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.381
crossing over can happen in
many, many different ways,

00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:27.097
in many different places,
and a number of times.

00:04:27.097 --> 00:04:28.909
And remember, it's not just happening

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.743
to one pair of homologous chromosomes,

00:04:30.743 --> 00:04:32.996
it's happening to all of the pairs

00:04:32.996 --> 00:04:34.551
of homologous chromosomes.

00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:38.149
So crossing over is a great
way to shuffle around alleles

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.210
and come up with a whole new combination

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.905
that didn't actually exist before.

00:04:42.905 --> 00:04:45.921
So it's a great way to
increase genetic variability.

00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:49.591
A question you may have
been thinking about

00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.679
in our discussion of recombination is

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:55.971
does recombination happen
between the sex chromosomes?

00:04:56.785 --> 00:04:58.921
And your intuition might tell you that

00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:00.500
that might not be the greatest thing.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.916
Let's see why.

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:03.610
So here we have our X chromosome and

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.211
our smaller Y chromosome in blue.

00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.974
And I'm just gonna stick on a gene

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:10.554
onto the Y chromosome.

00:05:10.554 --> 00:05:13.502
And remember, this is Y
chromosome that's duplicated,

00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:15.382
because we're looking at the chromosomes

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:17.909
as they appear in the beginning of myosis.

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.407
Anyway, this is the SRY gene.

00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:25.890
And the SRY gene is basically responsible

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.678
for the initiation of male
sex determination in humans.

00:05:30.678 --> 00:05:32.658
And let's say that

00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.677
above this point, these two chromatids

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:42.294
swap material and recombine.

00:05:42.294 --> 00:05:44.477
So that would mean that

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.798
we suddenly have, on the X chromosome,

00:05:47.798 --> 00:05:49.376
some of the Y chromosome,

00:05:49.376 --> 00:05:52.017
including that SRY gene.

00:05:53.527 --> 00:05:55.037
And then we're going to have some

00:05:55.037 --> 00:05:56.754
of the X chromosome over here.

00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:58.729
Let's say this happens.

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.305
So this is gonna be pretty problematic,

00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:05.486
because the gamete that
gets this Y chromosome

00:06:05.486 --> 00:06:07.111
is gonna be in trouble.

00:06:07.111 --> 00:06:09.288
Because when that's fertilized,

00:06:09.288 --> 00:06:10.909
it's, well, supposed to become a male

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.348
because it has a Y chromosome,

00:06:12.348 --> 00:06:15.088
but it's actually missing
a very important gene,

00:06:15.088 --> 00:06:17.828
the SRY gene, that's
gonna turn it into a male.

00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:19.105
So you can see that this can lead

00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:21.509
to a whole host of problems.

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.692
So let's see what actually happens

00:06:23.692 --> 00:06:26.077
between the X and Y chromosome.

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.562
We have at the tips of
the X and Y chromosome,

00:06:29.562 --> 00:06:32.922
I'm gonna shade it in this magenta.

00:06:34.317 --> 00:06:36.444
We have these regions

00:06:38.257 --> 00:06:41.970
called the pseudoautosomal regions.

00:06:46.383 --> 00:06:49.355
And crossing over does happen between

00:06:49.355 --> 00:06:51.422
the pseudoautosomal regions so it could

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:53.140
happen between these spots,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.459
provided that it's within
the magenta shaded area.

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.245
However, crossing over
generally does not happen

00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:02.985
between the rest of
the X and Y chromosome.

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:06.559
So this part of the Y chromosome

00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:09.183
that is the

00:07:10.415 --> 00:07:12.293
male specific region

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.169
so crossing over generally does not happen

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:20.747
between the male specific region

00:07:20.747 --> 00:07:22.768
and the rest of the X chromosome.

00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:27.502
It usually only happens in
the pseudoautosomal regions.
