hillary clinton have a secret or at
least the semi secret or I tried to be

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:04.946
secret

00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:08.616
lunch at the White House with President
Obama yesterday that is until

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:12.287
People magazine accidentally tweeted
about it we've got their first we

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:15.356
right here a

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:20.188
to people I FS West ball caps with
hillary clinton before

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:24.537
her meeting at the White House hope we
didn't make her late for Barack Obama

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:25.339
there's picture

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.958
now that we was up for three minutes and
then they deleted it and then me later

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:34.020
tweeted this with just a minor change
people that has wet ball

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.400
westfall chat with who included before
her act white house for lunch so it went

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.621
from a meeting at first

00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:43.211
to a large hope she wasn't late for
Barack Obama I

00:00:43.212 --> 00:00:46.981
one thing your sports and John Crabtree
and susan Rice

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:50.652
on the same show up both 49ers receivers
name to the I

00:00:50.653 --> 00:00:54.293
a just pointing that out I don't have to
have got it

00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:58.412
that does and a little side because
what's going on here you go out and I

00:00:58.413 --> 00:00:59.044
speech

00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:03.463
II whatever it's not really good was in
Monroe Marilyn

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.633
I

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:09.555
so I think there is something kinda
interesting here because people magazine

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:12.825
put out between obviously they didn't
ask for permission to say that she was

00:01:12.826 --> 00:01:13.696
having a meeting

00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:17.186
with the president then I'm guessing
hillary's people or the white house

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:17.766
people

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.766
thought and then they were like I guys
you gotta take that down

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:22.967
but then when they took it now they
really do with only gonna be a bigger

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:25.746
story to the change meeting for lunch
hoping nobody was going to

00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:29.447
I'm at exactly can have a meeting with
our DJ call right angle a bit here and

00:01:29.448 --> 00:01:32.938
now he's going to take Rt didn't say
anything you want in on the president's

00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:33.538
agenda

00:01:33.538 --> 00:01:37.427
so today reporters asked him and his
last day why was that didn't get married

00:01:37.428 --> 00:01:40.669
it was just lunch between two friends I
didn't think it merited

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:44.318
old hardly ever being a little
suspicious what do you think Jay Carney

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.209
might be lying nah

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.660
so what we doing lunch between friends
twenty makers there's no such thing as

00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:52.750
lunch between prime the leachate to go
from wanting to lunch when you obviously

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.420
we're calling is there i mean could get
like wanna

00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:59.062
what's what yep ROC about another girl
gotten our friends and having lunch

00:01:59.062 --> 00:02:02.681
can they ever have lunch again without
there being something to not allow

00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:05.922
that while one of them is in office ok
at that Aston answer

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:09.672
I'll even guy I would even greater yes
they can but then to have

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:13.684
a tweet change from meeting to lunch at
the end and the deletion

00:02:13.684 --> 00:02:17.934
just seems to add up to something that
doesn't seem right and I'm pretty sure

00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:19.195
he's running for president

00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:23.955
I'm not a think this shows you but don't
but the power or the misuse

00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:27.745
easily misused Twitter right I have a
friend who was a

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:32.066

time right and so he tweeted out and

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:32.807

%uh paper that's the problem with those

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:23.013
things people can tag you're so you
