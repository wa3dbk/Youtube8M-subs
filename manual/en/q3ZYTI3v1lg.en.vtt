00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:01.702
T'S SO GREAT TO HAVE

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.470
YOU HERE AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE
THE REST OF THE CAST COULDN'T BE

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.939
HERE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY
MEMBERS OF THE STATE AND IT

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:07.441
WAS SUCH A GREAT ENSEMBLE CAST.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.609
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, CHRIS.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:12.112
PEOPLE ASK US ALL THE TIME,
IS THE STATE GOING TO GET BACK

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.280
TOGETHER?

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.883
IT'S HARD TO GET US TOGETHER
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.552
THAT FRANKLY WE DON'T SEE EACH
OTHER AS OFTEN AS WE'D LIKE TO.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.288
&gt;&gt; BUT LET'S FACE IT, AT LEAST
JOE LO TRUGLIO ISN'T HERE.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.689
NOBODY'S MISSING HIM!

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.225
(LAUGHS)
&gt;&gt; GUYS!

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.894
GUYS, I'M HERE!

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.161
IT'S ME!

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.664
&gt;&gt; Chris: HEY, IT'S JOE LO
TRUGLIO!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:35.869
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU ALL LOOK TERRIFIC.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:36.937
YOU LOOK GREAT.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.139
I DRESS LIKE THIS NOW
SINCE THE GLOBES.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:41.341
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Chris: FOR THOSE OF YOU

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.977
WHO DON'T KNOW, JOE IS ON A SHOW
THAT NOBODY WATCHES CALLED

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.812
"BROOKLYN NINE-NINE."

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:49.082
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT'S SO FUNNY,
IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU GUYS.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:52.686
I RARELY SEE ANY OF THE OTHER
GUYS, LIKE THAT GUY GLEN GARANT.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.688
&gt;&gt; BEN GARANT?

00:00:54.721 --> 00:01:00.460
&gt;&gt; I STOOD RIGHT IN LINE
IN FRONT OF HIM FOR 45 MINUTES.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:05.866
"HEY, JOE!"
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.270
DID THE GLOBES CHANGE YOU?

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:13.073
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:17.845
(LAUGHTER)
YEAH, I WORK HERE NOW.

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.112
I'M HERE EVERY DAY.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.614
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU DO CRAFT SERVICE?

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:23.483
&gt;&gt; I BROUGHT YOU YOUR COFFEE,
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:25.352
&gt;&gt; IT NEEDED MORE CREAM.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:30.190
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; TOM IS HERE, TOO, BUT I

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:32.960
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN YEARS.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.828
&gt;&gt; OH, I HEARD HE PASSED.

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:36.597
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT MIGHT BE TRUE.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.998
&gt;&gt; HE DID PASS.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.267
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.435
TOM LENNON?

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.104
TOM LENNON WAS SUCH A GOOD
BEATLE.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.607
&gt;&gt; HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST
BEATLES.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.008
&gt;&gt; HE WROTE SO MANY GOOD SONGS.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.144
&gt;&gt; GUYS, I PRETEND TO LOSE
THIS SHOW TWO NIGHTS A WEEK.

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.281
&gt;&gt; PRETEND, REALLY PRETEND
OR LOSING FOR REALS?

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.783
&gt;&gt; YOU'LL NEVER KNOW!

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.720
&gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:02.155
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS, I WOULD LOVE
TO GET THE STATE TOGETHER.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.791
I'M A HUGE FAN OF A COUPLE OF
YOU GUYS.

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.661
(LAUGHTER)
AND I WOULD LOVE...

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.097
I MEAN, WE'LL NEVER GET
SOME PEOPLE, LIKE WE'D NEVER

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.265
GET DAVID WAIN, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:12.432
&gt;&gt; HE'S BUSY.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:16.069
HE'S GOT ALL THE INDEPENDENT
SPIRIT AWARDS, DIRECTING STUFF

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.204
AND...

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.939
&gt;&gt; I'M RIGHT HERE, YOU GUYS.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.941
RIGHT HERE.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:28.415
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M SUBBING FOR MY FRIEND BRUCE

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:29.917
ON CAMERA TWO TODAY, SO...

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.153
(LAUGHTER)
I'M ALSO DIRECTING THE SHOW.

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:35.923
OKAY, LET'S GET ANOTHER SHOT
OF THE THREE PANELISTS,

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:37.658
READY CAMERA ONE AND GO.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:41.862
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHO I REMEMBER FROM

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:42.930
THE STATE?

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.097
&gt;&gt; WHO WAS THAT?

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.667
&gt;&gt; HE USED TO DIRECT A LOT OF
THE STUFF, HE LOOKED LIKE A

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.768
PEDOPHILE...

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.870
(LAUGHING)
&gt;&gt; SHORT GUY?

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.804
&gt;&gt; NO, TALLER GUY.

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:51.738
&gt;&gt; GAY GUY?

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:52.472
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:53.607
&gt;&gt; BLACK GUY?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.309
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NEVER A BLACK GUY.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.410
MICHAEL JANN.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.444
&gt;&gt; OH, GOD.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.613
&gt;&gt; WE'LL NEVER SEE THAT GUY
AGAIN.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.316
&gt;&gt; (CLEARING THROAT)
HEY!

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.551
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU GUYS IN LIKE
THREE TO FIVE YEARS.

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:07.254
(LAUGHTER)
AND I'M NOT INTO GAY

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.089
OR PEDOPHILIA ANYMORE.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.757
&gt;&gt; CONGRATULATIONS.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.359
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.062
&gt;&gt; THE GUY WHO'D BE REALLY HARD
TO GET IS KEN MARINO.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.698
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE
I STOPPED GOING TO MEETINGS.

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:19.600
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO DIP MY BALLS IN IT!

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.134
&gt;&gt; Chris: KEN MARINO!

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.770
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANKS FOR BRINGING YOUR BALLS,

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:25.072
KEN MARINO!

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:27.508
THANKS FOR LETTING ME TAKE YOUR
BALLS.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:27.608
ANOTHER HUGE HAND FOR THE
STATE!
