00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
(enchanting music)

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:08.035
- [James] All right, for our
yakitori skewers I'm gonna want

00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:10.148
some of the bottom part
of the green onion.

00:00:10.148 --> 00:00:13.157
I do not want to use the tops,
just the bottom portions.

00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:18.480
But for garnishing our plate,
I will use some of the tops,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.703
so we're just going to finely chop this.

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:24.099
And to keep my grill from
flaring up too bad, I'm gonna

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.537
trim off a little bit of the excess fat.

00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:28.855
I don't want to trim it all
off, but just a little bit,

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:31.334
and then we're going to take
and cut this into strips.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.614
All right, we're going to
start putting our strips

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:36.564
of chicken thigh on or skewers.

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:38.723
Now remember, the skewers
have been soaked in water.

00:00:38.723 --> 00:00:41.135
Anyway, what we're doing, we're
just putting this on here,

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.333
and we're kinda folding it
over, and then we're going to

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.975
put a little piece of green
onion after each strip.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.331
All right, our grill's ready,
so we're going to start

00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:52.764
putting our chicken strips on here.

00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:56.520
(enchanting music)

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.146
And now we're going to start
brushing on some of our

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:03.654
homemade teriyaki sauce.

00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:06.185
The first coat will go kind
of thin, and then we'll just

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:09.110
keep flipping them over,
and we'll get thicker.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.500
All in all we're going
to put about three coats

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.122
on each side, and the last
coat's gonna be pretty thick.

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:16.513
But really, what we're doing
is caramelising the sauce

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:19.366
on there, and it really
brings the flavor to it.

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:23.610
(enchanting music)

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:27.500
All right, so it's time for our last coat,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.363
and we're going to put
this on nice and thick.

00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:30.725
And then after we get
it on we'll flip it over

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.351
for a couple seconds,

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:34.087
and then this is gonna be ready.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.827
And when I was in Japan, anytime
I smelled yakitori cooking

00:01:39.827 --> 00:01:41.987
I had to go find the
location of where it was at

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:43.446
and get some.

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:46.182
(enchanting music)

00:01:46.182 --> 00:01:48.272
All right, now we'll flip
these over to get that last

00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:50.909
little bit of crunchiness on there.

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:53.581
All right, so we're going to
garnish these with a little

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:56.567
bit of green onion; remember
we chopped that up earlier?

00:01:57.594 --> 00:01:59.962
And we're gonna sprinkle
on some sesame seeds.

00:01:59.962 --> 00:02:01.398
They don't really add any flavor but man,

00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:03.180
they sure look pretty.

00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:06.617
And so, how does our yakitori taste?

00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:12.391
Mmm.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.789
It's as good as the yakitori
I ate when I was in Japan.
