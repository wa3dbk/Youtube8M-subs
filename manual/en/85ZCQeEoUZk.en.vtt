00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.039
New York is situated in the Northeast region
of the United States of America.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.669
Over eight million people call the Big Apple
home,

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:25.599
and the city attracts up to fifty million
visitors a year.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.669
Ever since the Colonists arrived in 1624,

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.820
New York has been continuously shaped by the
waves of immigrants drawn here

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.930
by the promise of hope, and liberty.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.030
Every newcomer arrived with a cultural suitcase
that contributed to the sounds,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.149
tastes and textures of New York.

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:50.149
But it is their dreams which built the city.
A city like no other!

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.569
New York touches not only the heavens with
its mythic skyline,

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.370
its influence radiates to every corner of
the globe.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.350
Every street corner it seems, is familiar
through documentary, movie and song.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.390
New York's straightforward grid system makes
it an easy city to explore

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.890
by foot, taxi, or on its subway, which, just
like the city - never sleeps!

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.890
In Manhattan's Midtown, you'll find many of
The Big Apple's most iconic symbols.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.820
The Art Deco-designed Empire State Building
is one of the most impressive

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.920
and endearing skyscrapers ever created.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.780
The skyline may have grown up around it, but
the view from the 102nd floor

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.469
is as breathtaking today as it was when it
first opened in 1931.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.000
New York has always been a place where "when
the going got tough, the tough got going".

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.799
The Rockefeller Center, a visionary city within
a city,

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.840
rose during the darkest days of the Great
Depression.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.249
Today, it's still a place of creativity, inspiration

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:05.070
and even more incredible views of the city.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.940
Closer to earth is Grand Central Terminal.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.230
Step into the Main Concourse, and feel the
echo of every tearful farewell

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.230
and joyous greeting throughout the station's
history.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.490
New York has always been the gateway to the
Land of the Free,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.350
but it is also the city of the spree - the
shopping spree!

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.670
This city is shopaholic heaven,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.800
and Fifth Avenue with its eye-popping window
displays

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.060
is the high temple of the retail world.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.870
Times Square - one of the most visited tourist
attractions on the planet.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.740
Stand here, on the corner of Broadway and
Seventh Avenue,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.700
and you stand at the crossroads of the world.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.700
It's also the place to snap up a half-price
ticket to a Broadway show.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.320
New York has been blessed with generous civic
spaces.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.120
But there is no greater chill-out space in
the Big Apple than Central Park,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.650
a beautiful 850-acre network of meadows and
lakes.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.650
This is the place where New Yorkers come to
rest, romance, and express themselves.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.430
Over the decades many New Yorkers made it
big,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.950
and much of that fabulous wealth was reinvested
into collecting

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.890
some of the greatest artworks on the planet.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.980
Nowadays, much of this art is available for
everyone to enjoy.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.610
A walk through the The Metropolitan Museum
of Art

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.010
is a walk through 5000 years of humankind's
greatest creative moments.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.310
The Frank Lloyd Wright designed-Guggenheim
is a different kind of walk,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.710
one which spirals ever-upward through a dizzying
collection

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.390
of 20th and 21st Century masterpieces.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.210
Newcomers to New York spend much of their
time looking skyward,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.120
but since the 2001 attacks on the World Trade
Center,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.120
a new attraction gives locals and visitors
a chance to pause and bow their heads.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.400
The Reflecting Absence memorial and museum
honors the 3000 people

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.110
who lost their lives on that darkest of September
days.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.110
New York resonates with the sounds of over
800 language groups,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.940
and nothing epitomizes this diversity like
the city's neighborhoods.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.570
Little Italy packs all the tastes and flavors
of Italy into just a couple of streets,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.770
while Soho attracts cool cats and well-heeled
bohemians from all over the world.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.740
A few streets away, Greenwich Village proudly
retains the cafés and bars

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.660
where creative residents like Bob Dylan first
performed before becoming American icons.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.400
And then there are the boroughs.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.040
Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to the melting
pot of Brooklyn.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.090
With its own distinctive neighborhoods, museums,
open spaces -

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.620
and who could forget Coney Island!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.070
So welcome to New York City, The Big Apple.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.570
We've only just given you a bite-sized taste
of what this incredible city has to offer.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.540
But if you've got an appetite for the very
best things that life has to offer,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.900
this is the destination for you -

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.380
there's enough to feast on here for a lifetime!�
