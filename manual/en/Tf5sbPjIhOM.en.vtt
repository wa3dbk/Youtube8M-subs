Hi everyone, this is Jay Park. And I'm
a singer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.900
Oh, someone else? I think GD may be better
for the job. Should I go try and cast him?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.800
We couldn't cast GD.
No, we couldn't.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.900
Oh yeah? If he's busy, then I'll do
it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500
That's why you're here.
Yeah. Honestly, it's good for me to shoot this music video.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
What should the concept be?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.500
We should go with gentlemen.
Gentlemen's Attitude.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.900
Gentlemen's Attitude? I like that. I'm
losing my popularity these days. Make me look awesome.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.500
OK!

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.000
We're going to turn you into the Southern Italy's Sicilian-style.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.900
That's right.
Jay, try it like this.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.900
Do I need to introduce myself? Hold on, I forgot to zip my pants, wait.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.900
We have all these little details.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.900
Oh, a mustache?
You really like it, yes?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.800
Sure! If I don't like it, I won't wear
it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
I don't think Jay would remember, but come
to think of it, we've already worked together.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.900
We met for the first time to work on this
project.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.000
There is a kissing scene.
Really? No way!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.900
You're not going to do it?

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
Hi Jay, nice to meet you. I'm Thais. Yes.
Hi! You're tall!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.500
Use the tongue, use the tongue. Yeah, that'sit. I helped make Jay's dream come true.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900
You want me to do this right here? Woohoo!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.900
I can't really concentrate in front of other guys.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.900
I don't get why Jay's always working with foreign girls.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.500
A global player?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.900
Because this is Gentleman's Attitude, I'm
going to add my own color to that of TASTEmakers to express a more modern type of gentleman, and spread it.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.300
TASTEmakers, Gentlemen's Attitude, I'll do my best! Peace!

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.740
