Matt Guf, The House Snowboard Shop. Technine,
Team Dennison - this was designed by team

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.770
rider Derek Dennison all by himself! He engineered
this board and designed this board to hit

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.740
the streets of Salt Lake City and hit the
cliffs of Brighton. He rides in Utah, lives

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.510
in Utah and kills it in Utah.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.670
This board, yes, was designed by him. Everything:
the cores, the glass, and even this cool little

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.319
graphic that says, 'Tech Nine - Turn on, Tune
in, and Drop in.' Kind of peaceful looking

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:51.170
for the Technine family, but that's OK; everyone
needs a little bit of balance in their lives.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.659
This is a true twin, freestyle, all mountain
snowboard with a radial side-cut, a centered

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:09.119
flex that is about medium. About a, it's a
3; yeah, it's about a 3. Yeah, that's a 3.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.810
It of course has an amazing core that is tip
to tail poplar wood called Power Tech. It

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.689
has finger joints that is sandwiched by a
bi-axial fiberglass laminate over the top

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.380
and over the bottom of the core. The fiberglass
runs in two different directions, at 90 degrees

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.840
and at zero degrees.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.229
By looking at the base you will see that of
course it's die-cut, and that it is an extruded

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:48.159
4400 IS base. It will be low maintenance and
easy to maintain all season long.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.189
The Dennison Pro Model board is unique in
a couple of ways. Two ways are my favorite:

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.679
the triple-layer rubber dampering system that
is has. In between each layer of glass, above

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:13.280
and below the core, are three layers of rubber
dampering systems. So when you are riding

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.941
on some choppy terrain, this is going to absorb
some of the negative vibrations the board

00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:26.140
has. The carbon streamers that run from tip
to tail are going to keep this board ultimately

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.830
poppy and absolutely amazing.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.380
Of course it has high gloss and the rough
touch effects. Feels like grip tape, you won't

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.600
need a stomp pad. This is the Team Dennison
board for Derek Dennison, designed by himself,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.510
because he's so gangsta. Technine.
