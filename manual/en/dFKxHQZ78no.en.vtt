Hey YouTube!

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.029
I don't know about you, but I think Doctor
Who is one of the best programmes on TV - but

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.590
that's not to say it can't be improved upon.
So here are five things that annoyed me about

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.670
Doctor Who.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.670
&gt;&gt; LONDON: This thing can fly?

00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.940
&gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Yep! Anywhere in time and space
you wanna go, I'll take you there.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.000
&gt;&gt; LONDON: Let's go to Cardiff!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
&gt;&gt; ROSE: Doctor, what's that?

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.000
&gt;&gt; DOCTOR: That would be a plot hole. Don't
worry, I've got this.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.000
[the sonic screwdriver buzzes]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.999
That's got it! Come on!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.009
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: Doctor, thank you for saving the
planet from the Daleks… again…

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.450
If there's anything I can do to repay you?
0:01:53.451,0:01:53.450
&gt;&gt; DOCTOR: Oh it's all in a day's work, all
right!

00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:58.189
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: Are you sure, because I could do
something for you…

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.189
&gt;&gt; DOCTOR: No, it's all in a day's work!

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.040
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: But I… Doctor! Doctor, I…

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.180
Did I mention I'm gay?
