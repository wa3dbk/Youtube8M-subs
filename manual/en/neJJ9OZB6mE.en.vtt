00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.500
Welcome back again with me Alvin Maulana

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.680
On Masak.TV!

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.120
The ingredients needed to make Sambal Korek are...

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.640
Garlic

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.100
Shallot

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.360
Bird's eye chillies

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.340
Salt

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.620
Pepper

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840
Cooking oil

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
Break the chillies, and place it into the mortar

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.000
And then, add some garlic

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.580
Followed by the shallot

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.020
Add salt to ease the crushing process

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.780
And to season as well

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.380
Add pepper, as much as desired

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And then, crush to fine

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.240
You can as well use food processor

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.440
To ease your crushing process

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.660
After food processor,
dump it back to the mortar

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880
So you will get a better result

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.480
Heat oil, a pretty much oil than normally

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.680
It will be tastier

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.480
If you use used cooking oil from
frying chicken, duck, or fish before

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.400
Or used to fry petai before

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.540
To give it a little bit of an aroma

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.400
And then, pour the hot oil into the sambal

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.100
Our Sambal Korek is now done

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.780
If you couldn't figure where
you normally had Sambal Korek

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.560
Is when you eat duck, in a place like...

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.320
"Bebek Slamet" (Duck restaurant) or something

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.480
They use Sambal Korek, as we have made here

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.240
And they're normally using used cooking oil

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.960
That they had previously used to fry the duck

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.640
So the taste would be fantastic
But today, I used new oil

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.060
