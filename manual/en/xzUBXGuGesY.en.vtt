00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.710
I had a friend who asked if I'd show some of the different dresses that I have here, 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.179
and I said "Sure!" ... I've got about 
two hundred and thirty some,

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.420
that are from newborn size up to maybe size  twenty eight. I don't know,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.499
they don't have sizes written in them. 
Most of them, they're homemade.

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.410
But anyway, today I thought I'd start 
with the newborn ones

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.819
and show you a few of them, 
and how I made them.  

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.279
'cause newborns kind of are made a
 little bit different than some of the rest.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.370
Before we get started there's a little
button right up here

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.830
you can click on. It says "subscribe", 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.110
and if you do that, when I post a new video, it will pop right up and you won't miss anything.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.280
I don't have a newborn baby, but this is me holding a doll 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.480
wearing a dress my daughter wore when 
she was three weeks old.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.120
This is the first dress I'm going to 
show you today.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.500
When you have a newborn

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.640
they spend most the time laying down or 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.240
having you holding them 
something like this.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.739
But, I got to figuring, since she lays 
down most of the time,

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.429
it wouldn't really matter too much

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.950
how the back looked, because 
no one would see it.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.540
Plus babies do some horrible, 
explosive things in their costumes,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.640
and you wouldn't want to have this getting ruined

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.750
the first time she wears it, 
by something bad happening.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.480
I'm going to flip it over and show you 
how I made the back of the dress

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.720
I made it so it's a wrap-around...   like this

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.610
so that when I layed her in the stroller 
I could actually open the dress like this 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.710
in case we had some kind of a diaper issues, that the dress wouldn't get ruined.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.600
and another reason if i needed to change
her...    to change her all I had to do was just pull 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.460
the dress off

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.610
over the top. It was that easy.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.310
And it could come off really easily. 
It was one big 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.799
wrap-around dress

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.750
I had a store-bought, little white blouse 
with a collar, but you could also go to one 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.140
of the baby stores...  This is a Carter's newborn little white one-piece

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.220
 "onesie" with a little bit of fancy trim.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.840
But you could pick up something 
for a couple of dollars that way, ...  

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.850
to make your life a little easier.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.329
I have several examples here of little
newborn baby dresses. This one has a

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.270
satin ribbon cross the bodice,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.120
button holes on the apron waistband, that corresponds to a button sewn down 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.530
below on the dirndl front. And this 
keeps the apron from sliding around on

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.769
the dress and this one also 
has a wrap-around back.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.349
This next one has stitching that looks like lacing, but it just stitches across the zig-zag. 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.589
And then you've got some ribbon 
and little daisy eyelet  

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:20.919
and this one, the ribbon makes up the tie.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.529
It's a cute woven, pink and white
 ribbon that you could just buy

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.889
off the roll, by the yard, at the stores.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.369
A pink and white apron

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:32.339
Now the last one shows that you don't have to have a cute little pastel to make a baby, 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:33.689
newborn baby dress.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.049
This one was worn by my granddaughter when she was three weeks old

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.290
It's a black skirt

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.879
purple and black bodice

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.450
and gold shiny ribbon here

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.820
and flowered trim around the waist that
matches the mother's dress  that she

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.129
also wore for Oktoberfest. And that was really fun.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.629
If you're the mother of a newborn baby, you know you don't get anything extra done

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.799
during the day...It's all about the baby.

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.039
Even if you're an excellent seamstress,
if you don't have time to get to it

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:06.150
then you're kind of sunk!  So anyway, I started sewing at night, when my baby was sleeping.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.400
I pulled out the fabric left over from
two dresses I'd made 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.299
for the older sisters.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.020
And what I had used, was something like this. This is a  fabric that you can buy that has

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.319
all sorts of designs that are kind of coordinating colors

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.259
together. And I cut out some strips, that I had liked of this.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:25.329
And when you use this, you have to really make sure that you've pre-shrunk this trim 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.329
and you've pre-shrunk your normal fabric. And if you don't,

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.249
you put two different kinds together

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.119
and then this shrinks different than the fabric

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:34.209
then you'll have kind of a puckery mess.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.569
You don't want to have a puckery mess!

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.160
While the baby was sleeping,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.099
I took a dress that fit her,

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.230
and I laid it out, and I kind of traced it onto paper, 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.319
and made a little pattern for the bodice.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.579
Then I cut the bodice out of this regular
cranberry fabric, 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.019
then I layed my fabric trim on it,

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.029
that i wanted, until I had it about how I
wanted it to be. And I topstitched that on.

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:57.219
After I got that done

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.080
the bodice was kind of done.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.980
Then I prepared my apron, 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.230
My apron I made blue, with another strip of fabric, kind of how this would be. 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.369
sewed that on... got it all ready...matched the sisters' ... everything's good!

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:11.859
then I sewed th skirt onto the dress

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.170
and got that all done

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.319
...sewed the apron on, then the trim

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.280
When the baby 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.840
woke up in the morning

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.959
I tried the dress on and i was really
disappointed to find that the dress was

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.639
about two inches too short

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.680
so I added two inched of fabric here,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.060
but I didn't really feel like...I knew I should but 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.180
I really didn't feel like taking this apart and 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.919
making another apron, 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:32.880
and making it longer

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.710
I was rather exhausted, and so I just let it go as-is. 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.330
And I think it probably was the first day of Oktoberfest. too, so there's no time to mess around

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.610
Okay, to the apron ties. They're each about fourteen inches long,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.870
on each side,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.529
The dress itself, the entire dress is about
twelve inches long

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.039
and i think the skirt's nine inches. So, really if you're going to make 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:52.730
a nine inch skirt, 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.060
then I think your apron should be probably eight inches finished, or maybe even a little.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.449
closer to the length here(skirt length)

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.569
And this whole thing was so easy, because it's all one piece

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.180
when you throw it in the wash "boom,"  it's all ready!  You do have to iron it,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.999
even if you pull it out of the dryer right away, it just doesn't have that crisp look

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.189
and I think when you starch it, it "resists" spills a little bit better, too

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:15.919
When it comes to babies, there's lots of drooling and

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.729
things happening,  that you might want to
"resist" your spills. 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.710
So I would suggest that you starch it. That's a good idea.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.900
Well I would recommend if you're making a dress for a lady who might have a little baby in the next few years

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.270
that you buy some extra fabric, (maybe you need eight inches extra), and you could just put it away

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.750
and you can just put it away

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.699
And then if you do need to make a little baby girl dress you've got it and it could match the mother,

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.000
or it could match the two other sisters.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.650
and if you just buy the fabric ahead of time,  then you'll have it right there ready to go

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.529
go

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.729
and making the dress, you don't have to wait until the baby is born. 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.290
Because you can make a wrap-around style
like this that would fit most any baby

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.410
that would be, I don't know,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.269
six to twelve pounds. This really would fit quite a few

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:57.969
different sizes the way I did it.

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.560
And you'll have alot more fun at Oktoberfest,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.869
if the whole family's dressed up- even the baby!

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:06.020
If you or your daughter are expecting a baby a month or two before Oktoberfest, don't wait until

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.130
the last minute to make your dress.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.380
Most people who sew have little strips of 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.669
fabric, lace, eyelet, ribbon 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.469
that they have in a little box somewhere. You pull that out

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:16.939
and to make a baby dress

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:22.009
it probably wouldn't cost you anything because you've already got all this in your sewing boxes somewhere.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.710
And I think this was a really satisfying thing
for me to do

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.349
frustrating, at the same time it was satisfying.

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.199
And I've also learned a lot. I think
everything I make,

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.020
there's a lesson to be learned

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.639
like:  Don't make your apron too short. And check 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.400
before you

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.610
finish your hem off

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.610
to make sure that you don't

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.919
have a dress that's too short.

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.080
And don't sew at the last minute when you need it

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.219
tomorrow morning

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:43.990
so if you have time, do it ahead.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.749
And this time of year, here we are, it's October, 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:48.760
almost November 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.829
you have plenty of time before Oktoberfest 

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.800
to make a lot of fun things, including Oktoberfest dresses for your babies.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.270
Now if you're expecting a baby and you don't know how big it's going to be, 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.009
because mostly we don't know

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.960
I would suggest a wrap-around dress like
this for the newborn

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.639
and that takes away all the guesswork, it'll fit no matter what.

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.319
And if you're not really sure what size a newborn is, you can go to the store and buy one of 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.379
these little dolls

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:11.680
and you can dress her up

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.830
and then all year round the doll can wear the dress at your house, too.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.860
Then when your grandchildren 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.589
come to play

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:20.469
they can play with the doll wearing a cute little dirndl

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:21.189
because we know, wearing dirndls is lots of fun!
