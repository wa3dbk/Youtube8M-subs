00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.946
(orchestral music)

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.809
- I'm Superman.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.132
- [Jeremy] What are your superpowers?

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:11.184
- Laser eyes

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:12.821
and I can fly

00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:14.821
and I can punch through.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.334
How do I do my laser eyes?

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:22.207
- [Jeremy] I don't know, try it.

00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:24.874
Try to make the laser eyes work.

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.472
How do they work?

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:28.305

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.516

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:32.862
(releasing gas)

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:34.445

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:41.030

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.699
(suspenseful music)

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:44.865
- [Jeremy] And who are you?

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:46.134
- Batman.

00:00:46.134 --> 00:00:47.785
- [Jeremy] What's so awesome about Batman?

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:49.452
- He has a bat suit.

00:00:56.614 --> 00:00:59.531
(electronic music)

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:01.726
- [Jeremy] And who are you?

00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:02.700

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.421
- [Jeremy] And what's your superpower?

00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:06.504
- I love freezing people.

00:01:11.693 --> 00:01:12.789
(hissing)

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.842
- [Jeremy] Did you guys know
that there's a new movie out,

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:19.034
called Batman verse Superman?

00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:19.867
- No.

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:21.450
- [Jeremy] Do you think
Batman or Superman's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.494
gonna win?
- Batman!

00:01:22.494 --> 00:01:24.580
- [Jeremy] Do you think
Superman's gonna win, bud?

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.747
Why is Superman gonna win?

00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:36.629
- [Jeremy] Why do you think
Batman's gonna win, bud?

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.044
- He's gonna outsmart Superman.

00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:40.543
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:42.847
Well, maybe Anna's gonna win.

00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:44.581
Do you think Anna could beat all of them?

00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.085
- Yeah because I have freezing powers.

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:48.509
- [Jeremy] Oh, okay, well let's see.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.110
I thought we could just
have a fight to the death,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.494
and see who wins right here.

00:01:52.494 --> 00:01:53.408
Ready?

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:54.506
Set.

00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:55.339
Go!

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:58.422
(upbeat funky music)

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:08.928
(hissing)

00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:13.448
- [Jeremy] Are you frozen?

00:02:13.448 --> 00:02:14.829
You froze them!

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:15.835
Nailed it!

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.776
I think Anna won!

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:18.609
Woo!

00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:24.754
- It's not fair.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:33.300
