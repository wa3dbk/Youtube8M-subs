It´s been said that cIothes speak the internationaI Ianguage

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.500
And I have to admit,I´m a bit of a fashion whore

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.540
Unfortunately, today I´ve got work,|and I have to tone it down a IittIe bit

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.100
but that´s aII right. Gucci.End-of-summer saIe

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.560
Very understated.And I can easily spice it up with...

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.640
What?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.880
No, no. I know what you are thinking

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.320
If you ooze mascuIinity, Iike some of us do

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.360
you have no reason to fear pink.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Smashing

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.360
Now, in the coIogne department, most men overdo it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.360
Americans practicaIIy spray it on|with a crop-duster.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.200
My ruIe: Nothing above the neck

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.540
though I do Iike a IittIe spIash on Big Ben

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.180
You never know where the day may take you

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.240
AImost forgot

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.000
New word for the day

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.600
´´Ostentatious: The attempt
to attract attention to oneself. ´´

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.000
Who?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.620
Me?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.100
Oh, blimey. I´m so rude.
I haven´t introduced myself.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.780
I´m... ?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.120
AIfie

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.980
There you go. AIfie

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.560
Are you the little elf that left these
mocha bonbons on my doorstep?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.140
No, no, no. You must have
a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.420
You are such a doll, Alfie.
But I´m supposed to be on a diet.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.100
Oh, on a diet?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.680
A diet.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.520
You?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.080
Yeah

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.200
Now, I don´t mean to be forward, Lu

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.040
but you should know by now
that a full-figured girl like yourself

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100
- is every guy´s secret fantasy.
- Stop it.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.100
So she´s a tub of lard.
The ship´s already sailed,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.600
so why not make her
feel good about herself, right?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.100
Oh, Lu?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.480
Yes, angel?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.640
I´m working the night spot,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.600
and my apartment is a horror show,
so I´m sorry if I keep you up

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.560
with the dust-busting at 2 a. m.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560
Oh, don´t you worry.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.940
I´II give it a quick straighten.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.000
Oh, no, no, you don´t need to that

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.940
Nonsense.
I like doing things for you, Alfie.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.200
I´m a blessed man
having you in my life.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.060
Thank you.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.980
Keys are in the usual spot
