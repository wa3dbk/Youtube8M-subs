00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.001
THE AIR COMPRESSOR SHOW HERE

00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:04.603
IS USED IN THE SYSTEM

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:07.240
THE PURPOSE OF IT IS TO SUPPLY
AIR

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:08.701
TO THE AIR BRAKES

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:12.261
AND FOR THE AUXILIARY AIR
OPERATED SYSTEMS

00:00:12.343 --> 00:00:14.261
IN THE VEHICLE

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:17.683
THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS GEAR
DRIVEN

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:19.851
OF THE ENGINE

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.288
SO IT TURNS AT ENGINE SPEED

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.571
INSIDE HERE

00:00:24.653 --> 00:00:26.571
WHEN WE TAKE OFF THE CYLINDER
HEAD

00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:28.571
WE CAN SEE HOW IT OPERATES

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:33.500
RIGHT HERE WE HAVE INTAKE VALVES

00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:36.870
THE INTAKE VALVES ARE ONE WAY
CHECK VALVES

00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:38.870
THAT ALLOW AIR IN BUT NOT OUT

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:40.870
AS THE PISTON

00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:42.870
INSIDE HERE

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:46.913
STARTS TO GO FROM TOP DEAD
CENTRE

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:50.086
FROM TOP DEAD CENTRE

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:53.870
DOWN TO BOTTOM DEAD CENTRE

00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:56.008
A LOW PRESSURE AREA IS CREATED

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.625
AND CAUSES AIR TO COME PAST

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:02.628
THE INTAKE VALVES ON THE
CYLINDER HEAD

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:08.233
AS THE AIR COMES IN

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:10.233
THE PISTON WILL GO TO BOTTOM
DEAD CENTRE

00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:11.938
AS IT STARTS TO COME BACK UP

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.241
IN ITS TRAVEL

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:14.783
IT CLOSES THE INTAKE VALVE

00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:16.783
AND NOW IT STARTS TO OPEN

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:18.783
THE DISCHARGE VALVE

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.546
THE PISTON COMES UP

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:25.451
COMPRESSES, AND NOW THE CYCLE
REPEATS ITSELF

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.445
WHAT ONE CYLINDER IS DOING

00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:31.925
THE OTHER CYLINDER IS DOING THE
OPPOSITE

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:33.696
SO IF THIS IS ON INTAKE

00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:35.530
THIS ONE WILL BE ON COMPRESSION

00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.063
AND VICE VERSA

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:39.798
AIR SUPPLIED TO THE INLET

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.553
CAN BE SUPPLIED FROM THE TURBO
CHARGER

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.903
ON THE BOOST SIDE OF THE TURBO

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:48.508
OR IT CAN BE SUPPLIED ON ITS OWN
AIR FILTER

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.680
OR IT CAN BE SUPPLIED INTO THE
AIR FILTER OF THE VEHICLE

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:58.283
THAT IS THE PRINCIPAL OF
OPERATION

00:01:58.365 --> 00:02:01.688
AS THE AIR LEAVES THE COMPRESSOR

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.090
IT GOES ON TO THE AIR DRYER

00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:07.293
AND THEN ON TO THE WET TANK

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.671
AND TO YOUR DRY TANKS

00:02:09.753 --> 00:02:11.671
AND ALSO BACK TO THE GOVERNOR
