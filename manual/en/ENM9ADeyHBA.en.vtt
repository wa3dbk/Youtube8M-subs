00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.700
The next exercise I'm going to demonstrate
for you is called the step up. Which is a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.240
fantastic exercise for the lower body. However,
it does require a lot of stability, balance

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.039
and control. So I only recommend this exercise,
one; if your intermediate or an advanced exerciser.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:28.410
If your knees are healthy. And I also recommend
doing on a lower platform to start. This is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.190
a little bit high. It?s a bout a two foot
platform. But I recommend starting on a lower

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.670
platform, and then progressing to a higher
platform. What we are going to start with

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.550
is what we're going to step up with one leg.
Ok. So I'm going to start slowly. And then

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.889
demonstrate the step up at a faster tempo.
What I need you do is you're going to step

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:59.219
up with one foot, making sure the entire foot
is on the platform. Not just your toe. Ok,

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.030
from here you're going to use the power of
your legs, your gluts and your quadriceps

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:13.070
to bring your body up onto the platform. Keeping
both knees bent. Ok. Abs are tight. And you're

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.590
going to step down with that foot that you
stepped up with. However, on the way down,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:30.280
be gentle. Ok. Because if you come down harshly,
it will be very hard on your lower back, ok.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.420
So what I want you to do- I'm going to demonstrate
about five repetitions done at a faster tempo,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.469
the way I'd like to see you do it. Step up,
keep the knees bent. Down, use the power of

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:52.689
your gluts. Step back up, use your arms. Step
up, Abs are tight. Bent knees over your foot.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:03.939
Step down gently. Once again, only perform
this exercise if you're ready. If you're intermediate.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.830
or advanced exerciser. And once again, maintaining
the integrity of your form; knee stays over

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.170
the top of your foot and come down gently.
