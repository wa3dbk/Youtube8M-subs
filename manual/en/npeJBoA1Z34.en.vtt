00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.700
So we talked about the importance of paddling
with other boaters so that you have support

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.700
on the river. It’s also important to have
a standard set of signals that you can use

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.260
to communicate with other boaters on the river,
whether they’re in your group or not. So

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.620
the American Whitewater Association has developed
a series of signals that allow you to communicate

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.170
with other boaters on the river and pretty
much everybody paddling on U.S. rivers is

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.440
familiar with these signals and uses the same
ones. If you do get one of these signals give

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.410
the signal back to the signaler so that they
know that you got it and that you’re going

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.511
to act on it. The basic signals are these;
the first one is the paddle straight up into

00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:44.080
the air and what that means is go ahead, its
okay, go straight down the middle, if the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.840
paddle goes off to one side that means go
that way, that means head over toward that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.329
side of the river. I wouldn’t point toward
an obstruction, so for instance if there were

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.149
an obstruction over on this side I would point
my paddle to the opposite direction to encourage

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.149
people to go away from the obstruction. So
we’re never going to point toward a problem

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:12.030
or obstruction. So go that way, or go that
way. A horizontal paddle means stop, and that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.820
usually means stop right where you are, if
you can catch an eddy stop there, if you’re

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.040
already in an eddy, stay in the eddy you’re
in. Maybe something is going on downstream,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.120
maybe there is an obstruction downstream that
you shouldn’t be paddling through and so

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.150
that stop signal is an important one to know.
The final signal is this one and this signal

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.200
means emergency help, and this means come
toward me, you know, come, I need help here,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.220
and that’s a paddle waving back and forth
vertically overhead. There’s also another

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.780
signal, which is not a paddle signal but which
is also pretty universally known and used

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.110
and that is this, slap, slap, slap, if I signal
to another boater by patting my head, slap,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.399
slap, its asking a question, are you okay?
If a boater signals back to me this way, that’s

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.090
meaning, that means they, they are okay. That
doesn’t mean go ahead, it doesn’t mean

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.599
run the same rapid that I just ran, it could
just mean that, that boat is okay, but they

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.040
may immediately put up a stop sign telling
you not to go ahead, because that thing that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.569
they just ran, was not, not a good rapid to
run. But either way this, slap, slap, slap,

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.750
is a good way to acknowledge, that yes, I
am okay. Again, use those basic symbols, pass

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.599
them back when ones passed to you and stay
together as a group, so you can all support

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.879
each other.
