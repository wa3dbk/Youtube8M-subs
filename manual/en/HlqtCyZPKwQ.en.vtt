Hi, everyone! My name is Alexey,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
today I'll tell you about
the banjo by Aria model SB-10.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is a classical bluegrass banjo,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the body, the resonator and the neck
are made of mahogany,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the fretboard is made of rosewood,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the bridge is also made of rosewood.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It has an 11" drumhead by Remo.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now let's play!
