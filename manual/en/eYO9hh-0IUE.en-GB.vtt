00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.369
Oh Wow!....Woooh-oooow!

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.179
Look at this, ladies and gentlemen! This is a common Gecko!

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.890
The most common Gecko in the Italian peninsula! It lives in every coastal area.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.420
Look at his eyes with vertical pupils

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.980
like a cat. They are suitable for night vision.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.180
Its coloration can change depending on the color of the surface on which it lays:

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.980
If the surface is bright, its body becomes brighter;

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.100
if the surface is dark, the body becomes darker.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.460
This happens in order to be able to observe but not to be observed!

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.180
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.090
In this... in this way, it can observe the prey, remaining unnoticed itself

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.630
but simultaneously it remains invisible to predators!

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.000
It does nothing but standing near a light source

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.040
where insects fly. It's very quiet! Such a darling! Wooh-ooow!

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.070
It remains motionless, completely camouflaged

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130
attached to the walls,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.860
especially near to the light sources...

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.640
in the cities.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.030
It associates light to insects, which are its preys.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.060
In fact it remains completely camouflaged, waiting for its prey to come close...

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.760
and when the prey is close enough... Wack!

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.630
It bites, chews and swallows the insect...

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390
It uses its lamellar tooth,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.690
that has spread all around its mouth.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.660
Geckos eat mostly insects like locusts and everything they can chew with their mouth

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.350
like lizard's babies or eggs.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.770
In their fingertips they have suckers and thanks to these they are able to adhere on each type of wall

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.229
even glass! They are able to adhere even on the slipperiest wall! Woooh-oooow! Spectacular!

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.980
Look! They look like small crocodiles!

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.880
Look at its tail! It's amputated!

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.329
Every italian lizard amputate its tail if it's in danger!

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.079
This is a defense mechanism: when the tail is detached from their body, it continues on moving distracting the predator

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.630
and than they have time to escape. Woooh-oooow!

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.000
Look at all these tubercles along the body of the animal!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.489
They give a thorny aspect to the animal!! Wooow! Great!!!

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.059
In the sides of its head you can see the ears! One thing of Geckos that surprises me is

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:25.109
their eyes with vertical pupil... Spectacular!
Now let's set it free

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.799
in the place we found it! Look at it!

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.219
Good luck, my friend!

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.839
They are extremely important to the ecosystem! Don't torture them and don't kill them!

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.129
Let them free and observe them!

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.040
Wooooh-oooow!!! Great!
