Hi! I am Shelly Cordsen at Expert Village.com.
We are putting the final touches on our first

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.000
baby quilt and our binding is sewed on and
as you can feel as you go along every place

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.180
that we attach the binding together to make
our strip and even in the end, is a nice smooth

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.349
not bulky finish. Now everything is on. We
are going to go to each corner and trim off

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.370
the excess; just kind of cut that corner off
then we are going to now iron. And what I

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.220
like to do is take it from the front side,
take my iron and just kind of iron it out

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:54.460
and really on that mitered corner just poke
your iron in there and just get it done and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.850
then I will turn it over and I will pin all
my corners down. So you will start from one

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.760
edge and come up place the pin and you will
come up to a point here to stick your finger

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.800
in there bring that down, let the corners
meet. If you want to when you are on your

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.200
ironing board, just stick a pin in that so
you get this tacked down, put a pin, come

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.580
back to your mitered and you can see where
you have a beautiful mitered corner right

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.780
there. Then you will just take your needle
and thread sometimes all poke out there, there

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.030
you go a nice smooth mitered corner to a point
there and it will come to a point on the other

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.840
side. Now to finish this up, there are several
methods; one is to do take a needle and thread

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.590
and do a blind stitch. Some people will do
a whip stitch. If you can hide it, some will

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.230
just pin this down take it to their sewing
machine, they will stitch right here in this

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.970
stitch and make sure that they can catch this
side and they can sew it down by machine which

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.409
is your quickest way. So you have now completed
your first quilting project. You have a wonderful

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.310
gift to give to someone and you are now officially
a quilter.
