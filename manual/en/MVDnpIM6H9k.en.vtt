Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking
BBQ Desserts

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.060
Hi Bold Bakers! I'm delighted to have you
out here in my garden because we're going

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.880
to be barbecuing. I have some fun and easy
recipes that you might not have known you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.830
could make on a BBQ. So let's get started.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.120
Summer is the perfect time of year to start
eating and cooking outside. However, if you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.240
don't have a grill don't worry all of these
recipes can be done in an oven.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.930
I get a lot of inspiration from Pinterest
so when I stumbled upon this first recipe

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.750
I knew it was perfect because it's definitely
BIG &amp; BOLD. It is a Barbecued Brownie in an Orange.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.620
So the first thing we're going to do is cut
off a little bit of your orange and hollow

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.260
it out. Use a serrated knife to take out the
middle of your orange. Take care when doing

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.480
this because you don't want it to slip. With
the middle of your orange, just place it in

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.280
a bowl. Then go back in with your knife and
loosen up more orange. I like to save this

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.640
orange later for smoothies.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.509
And there you go, it's that quick and easy.
As you can see, you do not have to take out

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:07.930
every bit of orange.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.330
The reason I love this recipe is because it's
so creative. Baking a brownie in the orange,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.860
means you get all of the infused flavor from
the orange while it's baking and those two

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.370
flavors go so well together.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.300
If your orange is a little bit wobbly on the
bottom, you can take a knife and cut a little

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.250
bit off so it sits nice and flat on your grill.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.200
The next very important part of this dessert
is a great brownie recipe. Now I used my best-ever

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.270
brownie recipe but feel free to use any recipe
that you like. However if you have not tried

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.780
this yet then I strongly suggest you do so.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.300
I love my brownie recipe because as you can
see it's really fudgie. You want to fill up

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.409
your orange around 3/4 of the way.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.920
Once your orange is full of brownie, we're
going to take his little hat, put it on, and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.620
we're going to wrap him up in tin foil. What
the tin foil does is give it a little oven

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.700
to keep in all of that steam so the brownie
can bake.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.330
You want to bake this guy off on medium heat
so for your grill and your oven, around 350F/180C.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.210
As they grill your orange will get really
nice and soft and give a lot of moisture and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.590
flavor to your brownie.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.780
So our timer's gone off and there's a lovely
chocolatey, orange smell in the air so I'm

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.519
pretty sure they're done.

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.239
I'm positive these are done so let's check
them out. Oh wow, look at that beautiful soft

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.920
orange and as you can see our lovely brownie
is flowing out and it's done. Let's have a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.670
little look at the brownie on the inside.
Wow! Look at that. That's why you cook it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.189
in an orange because you get all the lovely
moisture like I was saying and a really soft,

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.159
fudgie brownie.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.829
This looks absolutely divine. Oh, man. If
you love chocolate and orange you are going

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.999
to love this.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.880
This brownie is insane but I cannot fill up
on this because we have to move on to our next dessert.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.160
This next dessert is made with really simple
ingredients but once they're grilled packs

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.659
a big flavor punch and they are Fruit Kebobs.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.819
The first thing you want to start out with
is preparing your skewers. Now I'm using wooden

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.290
skewers so if you're going to use wood, make
sure that you soak them for around 2 hours

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.819
and this will stop them burning on the grill.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.629
The fruit that I'm using for my kebobs are
strawberries but you can use any fruit that

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.169
you want. Pineapple grills really well. You
can even use bananas, peaches, whatever you like.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.400
To prepare your strawberry, just take out
the hull with a little knife. And there you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.680
go, he's ready for your kebobs.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.590
The next component in our kebobs is pound
cake. Now I'm using pound cake because it's

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.520
nice and sturdy but you can use angel food
cake maybe victoria sponge, brioche, whatever you like.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.749
When preparing your cake, no matter which
one you use you want to slice it nice and

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.559
thick so you end up with big chunks for your
kebobs because you want to make sure they

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:28.430
stay on there when you're grilling them.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.999
I think pound cake goes really well with strawberries
and it even goes really well on its own. Delicious!

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:38.760
Once you have everything ready that you want
to go on your skewer, just start to pile them

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.919
on. Make sure your strawberries are also similar
size because it makes them easier to grill.

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.189
And if you haven't had roasted strawberries
yet or grilled strawberries, you're in for

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.889
a treat because they're gorgeous.

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.549
Look at that. It looks lovely. So feel free
to mix up your fruit. Do whatever you want.

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.889
I think I'm going to stick to these two.

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.469
Once you have your kebob assembled, that's
pretty much it. You can put them straight

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.469
onto the BBQ. Or if you want to make them
ahead of time, keep them like this and put

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.120
them in the fridge until you're ready to eat
them.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.719
So the beauty of these kebobs is they're not
only fast to make they're fast to cook. You

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.109
put them on as the BBQ is cooling down and
get them nice and toasty and they're ready

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:12.699
to eat.

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.260
I've been keeping a close eye on these kebobs
just to make sure I don't overcook them and

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.199
I think they're done. Beautiful! Look at that.

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.120
I know you guys can't smell this but the strawberries
are lovely and roasted and they smell nice

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.340
and sweet. The poundcake is golden brown and
toasty.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.669
Our fruit kebobs are best eaten straight away
while they're warm and fresh so I'm going

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.889
to serve them with a little bit of whipped
cream and orange zest.

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:42.270
I'm excited to try these guys. These are really
good. If you like my recipes and would like

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.240
I believe I've saved the best for last since
this is my absolute favorite thing to make

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.680
on a BBQ and that is Grilled Banana Split.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.550
So for this recipe, all you need to do on
the grill is take your whole banana in all

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.009
of its glory and put it straight on the BBQ.

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:07.569
Ok perfect. So we're going to leave those
guys on there and let them get nice and black.

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.020
When we were young having BBQs, we would always
throw on bananas just as the BBQ was about

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.550
to die out. And they would get lovely and
sweet and we would have them with vanilla

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.139
ice cream. And I just thought they were the
best thing ever.

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:24.069
I hear the bananas sizzling so I think they're
done. These look perfect. I know they're black

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.620
all over but that means they're beautiful
and roasted and caramelized in the middle.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.650
They're going to taste great.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.400
So now that our bananas are beautifully grilled,
all we're going to do to turn this into a

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.280
banana split is cut it open down the middle.
And serve it with some ice cream, my signature

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.020
caramel sauce and some toasted nuts. And it
will be beautiful!

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.560
Hands down this is my favorite grilled dessert.
This banana split could not be easier and

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.599
it's the perfect summer treat.

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.389
All of these recipes take no time to prepare
and are perfect for the summer season.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.340
I really hope you enjoyed this episode being
out in my garden. Thank you so much for watching

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.580
