00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.530
Today, we'll be reviewing the Thule Tram Ski
and Snowboard Carrier Adapter for hitch mounted

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.590
bike racks, part number TH9033.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.510
This adapter allows you to carry skis and
snowboards on a variety of dual arm hitch

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.970
mounted bike racks.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.680
It has large locking pushpins which make loading
easy.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.820
It has soft padding which protect your skis
and snowboards from getting scratched up.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.140
The adapter has two points of easy installation,
the first being the cradles of your dual arm

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.920
bike rack and the other being the mast of
the bike rack, which the adapter clamps to.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.920
Now, let's go ahead and show you how it's
installed.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.219
We'll be using the Thule Apex Bike Carrier
for this review.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.620
We'll first make sure the straps in the cradles
closest to the vehicle are undone.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:52.420
Now, we'll take the tram and set it on top
of the bike rack.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.479
You'll also want to make sure the clamp point
is pressed up against the mast.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:02:12.280
To ensure this, you may have to make adjustments
to the cradles as necessary.
