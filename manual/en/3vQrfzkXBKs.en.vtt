[Opening music]

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:08.967
NARRATOR:
If you're like me,

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.100
you're trying
to get smarter about

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.033
the foods you
and your family eat.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.700
You read
food labels and pay attention

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.900
to ingredients
and nutritional information.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:21.400
So you'll be glad
to know that there are

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.500
new food labeling
regulations. And I think

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.967
you'll
find them very -- well, cool.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.867
Here's one place
you'll find the new labeling -

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.867
in your supermarket's or
grocery store's produce section.

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:36.633
See?

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:40.400
This sticker tells me that this
orange is from South Africa -

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.367
And, these
bananas are from Honduras -

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.367
And these carrots
are from the United States.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:53.100
These are
all examples of COOL --

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.333
the Country of
Origin Labeling Program.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.900
COOL is a U.S. Department
of Agriculture program

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.967
that requires
most full-line grocery stores,

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:02.800
club and warehouse
stores to provide consumers

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.367
information about
where certain foods come from.

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:08.300
Included are both
fresh and frozen vegetables,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.266
and fruits, and peanuts, pecans,
Macadamia nuts and ginseng.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.433
And that's not all.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.567
Chicken and meats including
muscle cuts like steak,

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:23.066
chops, and roasts, and
ground meats must be labeled.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.367
So must
fish and shellfish.

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:29.033
All of these labels, stickers,
placards, bands, tags, and signs

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.300
indicating countries
of origin can be helpful

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.500
-- if
you know what they mean.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.200
This cod, for example,
is labeled "Product of USA."

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.266
This means that this fish was
hatched, raised and harvested

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.767
on a farm in the
United States -- or harvested

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:45.400
in U.S. waters
by a U.S. flagged vessel

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.166
-- and prepared
for market in a U.S. facility.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.700
In addition
to the origin declaration,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.033
retailers must provide a
method of production information

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.066
for fish
and shellfish products -

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.900
Either
farm- raised or wild-caught.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.633
To be declared Product
of USA, chicken and meats

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:06.633
must come from animals
that have been born, raised,

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:08.767
and slaughtered
in the United States.

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:12.633
Vegetables, fruits, nuts, and
ginseng must be harvested here.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.433
For some
products, the name of the State,

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:18.300
or its abbreviation
can be used to indicate

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900
where they come
from. And regardless of where

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.333
they come from, all
foods sold in the United States

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:28.567
MUST meet the strict
food safety standards of USDA

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.767
and the Food
and Drug Administration.

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:33.667
Pretty straightforward, right?

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.934
Well, what about
a product like this?

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:39.400
It lists
three countries of origin.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.700
This means that
either the meats used originated

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.367
in different countries or
the animals were born and raised

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:47.633
in one country
-- say, Canada or Mexico --

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.767
and then slaughtered
in the United States.

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:52.033
Meat products are
not the only ones that can list

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.233
multiple countries
of origin. Fresh fruits

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:57.500
and vegetables,
and frozen foods can too.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.767
COOL is an
easy way to learn more about

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:01.767
the foods you
buy. But keep in mind

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:03.967
it does
not cover everything.

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.633
For example,
COOL regulations do not cover

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:10.166
processed food items,
items that have been cooked,

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:12.433
cured, smoked,
restructured or combined with

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:16.100
other food components.
So raw shrimp falls under

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.667
COOL regulations,
but cooked shrimp does not.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.066
Fruits are regulated
under COOL, but once they

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:27.066
are processed into,
say a fruit cup or fruit salad

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:29.166
containing
other ingredients, they are not.

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:31.433
Raw meats - yes.

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:34.333
-Raw meats that
have been marinated - no.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:38.033
Also, COOL
regulations are not food safety

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.400
or health regulations.
They are intended only

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.934
to help inform consumers
about where food comes from.

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:46.300
COOL is separate
from government nutritional

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.567
and food safety labeling
programs, food inspection

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:52.934
and grading programs,
and imported food inspections.

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:56.567
Finally, you will not
find COOL labeling everywhere.

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:59.000
Only high-volume
retailers, such as full-line

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.734
grocery stores
and club and warehouse stores,

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:04.033
must comply
with COOL regulations.

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:07.066
Convenience stores,
fish markets, butcher shops,

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:09.700
farmers' markets,
and food stands are exempt.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.667
So are
restaurants, delicatessens,

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.500
and other
food service establishments.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.767
COOL helps us all
become more informed consumers.

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.834
And if you have
a preference for a particular

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:22.000
food from a
certain part of the world,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.600
COOL can help you
find what you are looking for.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.500
So, look for
the country of origin labeling

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.667
on the foods you buy.
And if you have a question about

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:33.800
where a particular food
comes from ask your retailer.

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:39.834
COOL -- it's a smart
way to shop, and it just might

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:42.900
open you up to a whole
new world of food experiences.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:54.633
