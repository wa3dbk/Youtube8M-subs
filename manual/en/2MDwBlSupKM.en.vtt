00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:10.050
Since 2013 Construction Products Regulations
or CPR is the mandatory procedure of regulating

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.340
the construction products market throughout
Europe. It requires every manufacturer of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.529
construction products covered by harmonised
standard or a European Technical Assessment,

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.829
to draw up a DoP or Declaration of Performance
in order to CE mark and place their products

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.810
for sale in the European market. But you knew
that didn’t you? If you’re selling goods

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.050
in Europe, the CE marking is a bit like your
driving license. You have to have that handy

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.769
on every journey, yes? So how do you get your
CE mark affixed to your construction products?

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.449
The CPR requires all manufacturers to draw
up a Declaration of Performance. It outlines

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.050
details such as the intended use of the product,
its essential characteristics, performance,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.579
levels or classes and other important information.
So it’s vital that you get it drawn up properly,

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.130
and provide all the right technical information,
in the right format. Sounds daunting, but
