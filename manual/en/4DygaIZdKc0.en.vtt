Besides necklaces, some other great accessories
that you can look for are some brooches and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.410
some pins. Again, you can find these pretty
gosh darned affordable in the thrift stores

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.230
online. This one's really nice. It just speaks
for itself. You can look for some like this

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.189
with some rhinestones and what not, really
great pieces. These ones are in fairly good

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.050
condition. You're going to find some with
the rhinestones and pearls such as these and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.980
maybe it's missing a rhinestone or two. I
don't know myself, I'm like I don't care.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.810
I'm still going to wear it. I don't care if
it's gone. It's vintage. What are you going

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.750
to do? You're not going to find always a perfect
piece. But it's not a bad idea if you're going

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.260
to get serious about this to keep a little
caddy of bits and pieces to make some repairs

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.550
on your vintage jewelry. I like to keep some
rhinestones and some super glue on hand just

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.190
to pop back in a pearl or a little rhinestone.
Even if it's not a perfect match or a perfect

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.079
fit or it matches the others, it will kind
of give them a more kind of newer look. So

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.280
pins and brooches, they're great to just throw
on your cardigan or on your dress. If you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.710
have a fabric purse, throw it on your purse.
So brooches and pins look for those. They're

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.249
a great piece to have. Of course, earrings
are great pieces to have too. Today I brought

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:24.369
two of my favorite classic ones to find. These
are some cute little crystal ones. What's

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.329
interesting about the vintage earrings is
I tend to find more clasp on earrings. Here's

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.409
some pearls again. Great little 50's staple
and for some people, they prefer that if they

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.510
don't have their ears pierced, but some people
don't. I know for me I can only wear the clasp

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.049
on one's like this for a couple of hours before
it give me kind of a little bit of a headache.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.039
So again, if you're handy, break out that
little repair kit and you can turn these into

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.530
post type earrings if you're willing to kind
of break off the backs of these. But I know,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.990
I do for a lot of my headgear, crisp little
pearl vintage earrings. They're just too heavy

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.459
on my earlobes, so I snap these off and in
this case, it's not such a bad idea. It's

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.310
not going to bust the earring because it's
got a sturdy back on it and just super glue

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.810
on a post if you don't want to wear the clasp.
So look for some vintage earrings. Oh, and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.490
another great tip; say that you found only
one earring like this and you're like great,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:28.530
what am I going to do with only one earring
if I don't have the second one?

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.041
Super glue on a pin, like a little pin, like
this on the back and you can just wear it

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:39.940
on your clothing. You can snap it on like
this. It makes a great little pin. If I leave

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.100
it on here with just a little clasp, I might
be afraid of it falling off. So in this case,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.620
what I've done with some of these is I broke
off the back and safety glued on a little

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.730
pin so I can wear it as a pin. So don't just
toss this out and think it's hopeless just

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.210
to have one earring because there's actually
fun stuff you can do with that. You know,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.231
bracelets of course. This one I actually made
when I was in high school. My grandma just

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:08.640
had handfuls of beads from her jewelry box,
busted necklaces and bracelets and I just

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.260
strung this one together. So look for some
bracelets. Either you can break them apart

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.390
and make your own or look for them as is.
And of course, you can't go wrong with the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.100
old rhinestone sunglasses. Now, I'm kind of
cheating again. These ones are not actually

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.040
vintage. At Halloween time, you are going
to find some really fun vintage replica sunglasses

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.400
for five bucks. You can find them in all kinds
of colors. So keep that in mind too. So there

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.600
we go. We've got necklaces, pins, and brooches,
earrings, bracelets, and sunglasses. So just

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.320
keep your eyes open for some really fun vintage
jewelry pieces to incorporate and round out

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.290
that vintage look in your wardrobe.
