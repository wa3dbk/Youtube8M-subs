you guys how's it goin? I got a quick
little video here show you

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.249
just on some stuff that i got lately

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.009
uh... so i can organize things for Ebay

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.709
this is i think the best possible way to
store things

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.749
if you've got a limited space and if you
wanna know where everything is so you've

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.410
got listed on ebay

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.880
or amazon or you know stuff on
craigslist this is just good for

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.990
kinda like this smaller things

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.090
uh... like baseball gloves

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.839
uh... you know just small things like
that

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.330
so i got these over at the wal-mart

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.460
uh... they are sixty six quart

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.390
i paid i think it was ten dollars each
for them

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.240
they're pretty good size

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.310
uh... you know a guy like this latch on
the top

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.880
and um... you know you could almost fair

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.320
like uh... almost hit a baseball bat

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.230
or tennis racket in here but

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.670
you know i can fit let's see two for six eight

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.580
i can fit twelve of those

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.400
in a footprint that's about

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.250
three feet by one feet

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.080
so uh...

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.960
They can go pretty tall that is about

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.890
um... about six feet tall

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.320
so if you have about eight feet total

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.350
that's a pretty easy way to store all
that stuff very efficiently

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.430
all you gotta go is just put a but a
little label on hears and ay okay this is a

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.670
number one

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.520
and maybe under ebay listing or whatever just
say

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.210
okay this is our number one on the very
bottom

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.230
so that you know

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.330
uh...

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.990
i can store a lot of stuff here

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.380
very easily

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.700
i'd just...I have these here

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090
but are just about these two

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.500
so that i could organize some of that hoard that  see you see you know in my videos

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.100
i got a lot more stuff upstairs and
we'll get to that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.210
just want to make this video show you
guys uh...

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.720
the shelves here

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.650
they are really sturdy, I paid a lot for them

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.330
they are, you know, solid metal they're not
gonna break, these will last a lifetime

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.090
yeah i think it's a good investment
because

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.439
you know they're gonna hold their value
over time

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.790
anytime you can put something into a
business and get it back later

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.719
that's always better than

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.159
putting money into it and not getting it
back later so those are my thoughts

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.019
behind that
