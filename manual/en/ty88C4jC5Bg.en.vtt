00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:24.270
To borrow a 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.800
line from Mrs. Potts, it's a tale as old as
time.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.000
Or at least, as old as Mario Kart.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You take your

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.180
characters, whatever franchise you may have,
and you put 'em in go-karts.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.379
Ever since Nintendo did it, everyone else

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.379
has done it.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.820
It's a fast way to make a game that instantly
appeals to two different audiences.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.730
Fans of your franchise,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.339
and fans of Mario Kart.

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.769
So if you like Digimon and Mario Kart...holy
crap, this is where it's at.

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.920
If not, you're like, "Meh.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.440
I'll just play Mario Kart, thanks."

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:06.860
At least, that's how I felt.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.940
Digimon Racing isn't a bad game, and it actually
does a lot of things pretty well.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.940
But

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.590
the one place where it falls short happens
to be the most important place, when it comes

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.900
to a kart racer.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.900
The

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
handlingâ€”the actual driving mechanics.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.260
If you're used to how the Mario Kart games
play?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.130
With the tight steering and,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.690
you know, tires that have traction?

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.540
Yeah, you can just...forget all about those.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.400
This one's more like the original Mario Kart,
with those drifty...feelings.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.890
Those slidey, physics.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.210
Only more slidey.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.420
Jesus, listen to me.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.420
Slidey.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.420
That's how this thing plays.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.650
I have to make up adjectives, just to describe
it.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.220
So, uh...not a big fan of how the karts handle.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.970
But fortunately, the game gets a lot of other
things right.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.970
For

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.970
starters, the environments are cool.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.050
Cliched, but cool.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.680
You can from jungles to mountains to snow
levels to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.420
volcanoes...all the terrain you'd expect,
but all well done.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.490
And the track design is actually pretty good,
too.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.490
In fact,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.039
if the karts were tighter, I'd be all over
this game.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.709
The tracks remind me of those classics from
the original Mario

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.709
Kart.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:29.769
The ghost house, Bowser's Castle...pretty
good stuff.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:40.549
And one of the interesting things about Digimon
Racing is way it organizes its cups.

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.239
So you know how, in Mario Kart,

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.049
each cup has its own courses?

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.739
Well, Digimon Racing has a lot fewer tracks,
but what it does is...it sometimes puts

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.810
certain tracks in multiple cups.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.000
So, like...this snowy mountain?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.379
It's in the frozen cup...but it's also in
the mountain

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.379
cup.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.279
It's kind of a cheap way to add more cups,
but...it also adds more cups.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.279
And it's cool.

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.060
It's like grouping courses based

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.890
on similar characteristics, so even though
tracks repeat, the cups do have their own

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.890
feel.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.819
But you know, one area where Mario Kart clones
always seem to fall short...is the weapons.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.939
Digimon Racing is no

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:15.939
different.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.200
There are items you can use, but...the kart
combat is never as well done as Mario Kart.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.269
Some of the weapons

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.299
are really unbalanced.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.290
And sometimes, you're actually thrown off
the course by them.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.940
And you end up facing backwards.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.940
That's not fair.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.760
Even for a kart racer.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.840
Speaking of which, the rubber banding in this
game is f*cking ridiculous.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.359
If you're in last place on the final lap,

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.680
everyone seems to pop a tire so you can place.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.779
If you're in first place?

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.090
Holy sh*t balls, it's like the cops are

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.819
coming and someone strapped a kilo of Columbian
bam-bam under your kart.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.900
They're all over you.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.900
So that gets annoying

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.900
real quick.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.019
Especially when the karts handle like, freaking...Jell-O
with wheels.

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.819
And this is easy, by the way.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.430
I can't even imagine what happens on the next
difficulty.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:11.120
Your Game Boy digi-volves arms, and punches
you in the dick.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.150
If they gave out awards for originality, Digimon
Racing wouldn't get one.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.500
From the basic design to the freaking Mode

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.039
7, this is like a clone of clones of Mario
Kart.

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.950
But that's not to say it doesn't have its
moments.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.950
Because it does.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.530
Especially if you're a Digimon fan, and you
don't mind the drifty mechanics.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.120
In that case, there's a lot to like about

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.120
this game.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.970
Cool levels, fun track designs...there are
even boss battles.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.970
That's awesome.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.880
But if you're looking for a good kart racer,
as opposed to a passable Digimon kart racer...this

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.880
one's not gonna do it

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880
for you.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.100
Unless "it" means leaving you frustrated and
wanting to just play Mario Kart.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.690
In that case, Digimon Racing

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:56.030
does precisely that.
