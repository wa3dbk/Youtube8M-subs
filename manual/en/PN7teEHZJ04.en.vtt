Hi this is Chris from Music Radar and we're
here with Slash to talk about riffs, so Slash,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.790
what makes a killer riff?
&gt;&gt;A killer riff is something tha'ts memorable,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:24.000
something that digs in, something that obviously
has the right note selection to sound attractive

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.150
I guess. But it's got to have a great sound,
it's got to have a great attack, there are

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.460
a lot of diferent elements, but I think the
most important thing is just something that's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.820
really catchy and sticks with you.
&gt;&gt;Right so if you had to name your favourite

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.280
riff of all time, which is obviously a nightmare
question but what would you choose?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.360
&gt;&gt;You know what...nightmare...yeah! You know
I was thinking Whole Lotta Love because it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.149
just I remember when that record came out
I was a little kid but you know, Black Dog

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.000
is another one, Zeppelin had probably the
biggest cache of killer riffs more than any

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
other band, but anyway, I could go on, there
are so many great riffs it's hard to go with

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.070
just one you know?!
&gt;&gt;So which of the ones that you've written

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.470
are you most proud of, you 
think are the most enduring?

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:27.310
&gt;&gt;You know, I think, I've always dug Paradise
City, I always thought was great, Rocket Queen,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.830
was something that I was pretty fond of, you
know and Jungle's great and everybody seems

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.350
to like Sweet Child of Mine, that's a pretty
cool riff but I'd probably opt for Welcome

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.299
to the Jungle over Sweet Child of Mine.
&gt;&gt;So when you were writing those was there

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.130
a point where you played it and thought, this
is a great riff or was it something that just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.210
evolved with the song?
&gt;&gt;I'm actually a riff guy, most of the stuff
0::01:52.210,0:01:58.149
I write, most of the time I actually have
to force myself sometimes to write more chord,

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.390
just to get away from the single note thing.
But usually what happens is I just run across

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.420
something or I hear something in my head or
get an idea and then just execute it with

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.209
the drums and then if it's got that impact.
There are some stuff on my new record that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.480
I'm really fond of because it came together that
way. And then I don't sit there and judge

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.860
it as far as what kind of riff it is, whether
it's up there in the upper echelon of great

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.099
riffs, but if it moves me, thats the main
thing, if it grooves and all that.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.319
&gt;&gt;Do you have any advice for aspiring riff
writers?

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.150
&gt;&gt;I mean I started out from the very beginning
as a riff guy, so I guess if that's what you're

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.010
into then go for it. I think it's a frame
of mind I don't think you sit there and go

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.660
I want to be a riff guy how do I do that.
It's something that comes naturally.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.569
&gt;&gt;Thanks very much slash and 
it's riff week on Music Radar
