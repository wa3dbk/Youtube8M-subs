00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.100
So, figuring out how you're going to get fresh,
drinkable water when you're camping is a pretty

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.660
big concern.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.679
If you're primitive camping, meaning that
you're hiking in a couple of miles from where

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.660
you parked your car, then you're probably
not going to be able to carry all the water

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.840
that you need in with you.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.950
I did used to do that when I first started
camping, just because it seemed like the most

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.770
comfortable and safest way to go.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.430
I had a couple of five-gallon jugs and I would
fill them before I left.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.311
It meant taking a lot of breaks when we were
hiking in, but at the same time, I knew the

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:45.610
water was safe to drink and I just knew that
I could bring in everything that I possibly

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.520
wanted and it just made me feel really comfortable.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.130
The other cool thing about bringing in big
jugs of water is you can tie rope around them

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.360
and hang them from trees and then you've got
running water.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.620
So, that's kind of neat.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.239
Any water that you find when you're camping,
in a river, or a lake, or a stream, you're

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.790
not going to be able to drink, because it's
filled with bacteria and viruses.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.440
You can boil all that water.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.410
So, if you boil water for five minutes, then
it's safe to drink.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.460
The thing is, then you've got hot water.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.260
You also are going to use up a lot of your
firewood if you have to boil all the water

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.670
you want to drink.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.860
So it's not very practical to do, but it can
be done.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.670
If you boil your water, you should just plan
on bringing something to store the water in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.890
once it's boiled, and let it cool.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.290
The other thing you can invest in is a purifier
or a filter.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.500
You're looking at spending between 50 and
200 bucks on something like that, but that's

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.869
probably the safest, most reliable and most
practical way to make sure that the water

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.990
that you find is drinkable and safe for you
to drink.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.990
There's lots of different options on the market.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.049
The one that I is a pump.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.200
So it's a filter.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.659
The water runs through a tube, through the
filter, and into the container you're going

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.420
to use for drinking, but you have to pump
all the water.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.230
That's the part, that's the downside to the
filter that I have.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.919
On the other hand, there's something called
a steripen, which is awesome.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:23.340
It's basically sterilizing all the water that
it's placed into.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.560
That's on the expensive end of the spectrum.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.900
Lastly, you should probably plan for a worst-case
scenario situation and bring some iodine tablets.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.749
They'll purify any water.

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.290
They're going to make the water taste like
iodine, and it's also not safe for you to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.909
consume large amounts of iodine, so the tablets
like that are just used in emergency situations.

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.870
When it comes to purifying water, water is
a necessity, you're going to need it, so it's

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.169
just a matter of figuring out what solution
you're comfortable with, in terms of ease

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.329
when you're camping and how much money you
want to spend.
