00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:10.594
Hello, viewer!

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:15.332
We're here with NS, the first day of The International is over.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:20.203
Welcome in our brief review. Yaroslav, what have we seen today?

00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:24.007
The International has started!

00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:28.378
Thanks to our huge viewers... huge amount of viewers!

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:34.384
Starting from the very first minute we had over 160.000 viewers.

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.454
We didn't even expect such an audience.

00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:40.690
Probably, it's because of Vega.

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:44.861
Last year we had 100.000 at the start. We grow up every day.

00:00:46.163 --> 00:00:49.266
I think, people mostly came to look at Vega.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.701
I mean, our CIS viewers.

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:55.739
Well, Vega showed their game.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.910
Unfortunately, the result is disappointing.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.746
Well, we started not with Vega, but with two matches

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.283
between... yes, we started with Vega versus CDEC.

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:10.087
And Archon vs MVP.Phoenix.

00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:13.557
Well, Archon had no chances, quick 2-0.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.993
But CDEC and Vega really fought.

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:22.432
2-1, but it was close! Really close!

00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:26.369
I feel sorry for Vega in that game.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.775
As we know, CDEC destroyed MVP.Ph 2-0 in winners.

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:36.246
MVP fell to Vega, who had already knocked Archon out.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:38.715
They had no problems against Americans.

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:43.687
But Vega lost to MVP in the hardcore match.

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:46.556
We had the first Rapier at this TI.

00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:50.060
Game lasted for 60 minutes.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.095
Really tough.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.602
You know, I wouldn't be that sad if I were Vega fan.

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:01.037
Yes, loosing hurts.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:04.040
But think: they suffered in wild card.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.444
Imagine what could happen to them at the main event.

00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:10.347
Probably, their loss is for the best.

00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:16.052
Guys will work on their mistakes and prepare better for the Majors.

00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:19.256
This team definitely has to stick together.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.629
I hope, fans won't be flaming them too hard in our internets.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.499
I hope they will support them, Vega need support.

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:33.703
They are young guys with a bright future,

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:36.273
they will achieve results later.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.508
We'll cheer for them!

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.779
We have a few news apart from matches and broadcast.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.314
Like what?

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.119
Players zone has opened in Western Seattle hotel.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.453
And it's empty.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.157
Players prefer their own rooms or practice rooms.

00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.660
Or in the canteen.

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:58.428
With some rice.

00:02:58.562 --> 00:03:04.834
Seriously, there's nothing to do there. You, me, Dread are not allowed in players zone.

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:11.575
Russian and English casters are also not allowed there. As well as Ash, who finally made it to The International.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:13.710
Let the alco-heaven roll.

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:19.716
By the way, Valve have brought some VR.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.854
Everyone can sign in and try this device themselves.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:29.359
I haven't been there yet, but I will, like, the day after tomorrow.

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:34.231
As soon as possible, you mean.

00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:37.934
We spend the whole day here, so we had no time for fun.

00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:40.670
Smile wrote his list.

00:03:40.837 --> 00:03:45.875
You probably know Game of Thrones. Arya Stark had her kill list.

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.944
Smile has one too.

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:49.479
Let's see.

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.716
Fatso, GodHunt, Faker, 4ce,

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:54.985
all casters, rice.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.021
Rice is understandable.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.657
And six lamps.

00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:04.628
I think, these six lamps that blind us, have really got into Smile's head.

00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:07.631
I would add a wind, but it's not my list.

00:04:07.864 --> 00:04:09.966
Yesterday Smile tried to kill the rice.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:13.003
He tried, but there's too much rice here.

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:14.604
Rice is invincible.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.375
Well, that's all for now.

00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:22.112
Exciting group stage and main even are coming,

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:24.347
we'll show you everything!
