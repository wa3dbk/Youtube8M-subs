(Mark Bazer) Let's talk real quickly before 
we turn it over to the audience about

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:07.013
your time here in Chicago. 
Talk about the Defiant Theatre

00:00:07.013 --> 00:00:10.552
- Nick Offerman: Oh. Return of erection (laughter)
- Mark Bazer: In about 30 seconds

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:16.912
Nick Offerman: Well, we started at the U of I
in Champaign Urbana - a group of us formed

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:22.562
this theatre company, we moved up here,
and it was a wonderfully irreverent and

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:29.623
vibrant and daring company for about 11 years.
I was here for about the first 3 seasons

00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:37.031
and we just had a wonderful time working
our asses off for free, doing some of the best

00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:44.771
work of our lives. And the Chicago theatre
scene allows that in a way that I've found

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:51.391
in no other city. The theatre community
here is so supportive and generous

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:56.781
and it was so depressing when I moved to 
LA, the largest collection of actors and

00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.857
writers in the country, was nothing like
the theatre scene here. And I was like

00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:03.497
"what's the matter with you people?"
And they were like, "we're trying to get

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:08.277
on Baywatch, man!" (laughter)
Mark Bazer: And you met Amy Poehler

00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:14.536
while you were in Chicago, but you were
telling me offstage that you operated

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:17.336
in different worlds.
Nick Offerman: We did, yeah. We met because

00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:25.906
our friends lived together, so we would
kind of party together. And I was suffering

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:33.206
from an idiocy that straight theatre,
at least in me, I was like this farm kid

00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:37.576
that discovered I could study theatre 
in college and I was like

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:42.466
"I have become a thespian" (laughter) 
Dead fucking serious about theatre.

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:47.526
And I still like making people laugh,
but I also love Pinter and Chekhov and

00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:51.796
all the snotty stuff (laughter), which is
great, but I was a snob about it

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:56.526
so when I met Amy, and I had heard of,
vaguely of, Second City and I knew

00:01:56.526 --> 00:02:04.376
kind of what comedy was, in their world,
but I had absolute disregard for it

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:12.906
because I was a serious theatre artist 
(laughter) so when Amy and I would talk,

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:17.896
I might as well have been a Zoologist 
and she was an astronaut (laughter)

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:21.896
and it's like, alright, good luck with 
your launch (laughter).

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:34.676
The solipsistic tunnel vision of the
theatre artist when she told me what she did

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:40.166
and I was like, you make stuff up 
in a bar? Great. (laughter)

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:50.016
Good luck with that career path. (laughter)
I was like 36 when I started doing stuff

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:55.806
with her in New York at her UCB theatre
and only then I was there and all these

00:02:55.806 --> 00:03:02.106
great SNL people, we were doing shows,
and I was like, "Oh! Now I get it from

00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:11.746
15 years ago that you knew that was the
way to SNL. God dammit. (laughter)

00:03:11.746 --> 00:03:20.196
(applause)
