00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.200
yeah

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.839
human beings are

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.800
extraordinary creatures we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.949
can understand things in multiple ways

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.070
we understand

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.360
that our lives are short

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.300
sometime they are too short

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.300
many masters that have

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.119
influenced me some

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.930
of whom are quite hold in

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.489
human time and the ones who are

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.060
still here today at this moment to kind of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.900
journey through

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.460
life with the knowledge

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.800
that of course you will not

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.800
be living forever

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.110
the whole point human existence is to leave

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.800
something behind, something special

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.900
wouldn't have to be really special, wouldn't  have to be intellectual,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.100
doesn't have to be spiritual, just
something

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.220
the creativity exists in all human
beings

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.500
creativity exists in animals

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500
and even insects

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.900
they are all constantly

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.050
innovating things, this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.330
power and force to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.680
create something new from something old

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.600
 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.410
my field of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.500
art is

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.940
the universal language in mankind
