00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.200
I have lost the will to live

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.160
Simply nothing more to give

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.000
There is nothing more for me

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.900
Need the end to set me free

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.200
I have lost the will to liih oh ho-oh

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.900
Simply nothing more to give

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.400
There is nothing more for me

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.100
I need the end to set me free yeah

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.200
Things aren't what they used to be

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.720
Missing one inside of me

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.260
Deathly lost this can't be real

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.800
Cannot stand this hell I feel

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.600
Emptiness is filling me

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.800
To the point of agony

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.680
Growing darkness taking dawn yeah

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.700
Yee I was me but now he's gone

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.400
Yeah yeah

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.800
No one but me

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.000
Can save myself but it's too late
