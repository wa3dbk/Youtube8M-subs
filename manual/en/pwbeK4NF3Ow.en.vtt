00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.130
The .DWG file format is native to AutoCAD and its derivatives, 
but it can also be exported from many (mostly CAD) applications.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.140
You can link DWG files created in AutoCAD to 3ds Max so that any 
changes to the DWG can be updated in your 3ds Max scene.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.560
There are typically two ways to work with a DWG file in 3ds Max:

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:23.610
One method is to use a 2D DWG file as a reference, so you can build 
3D geometry such as walls, doors, and windows, in 3ds Max.

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:31.772
The other is to use a 3D DWG file that already has 3D geometry, 
which you can embellish and render using the superior 3ds Max tools.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.730
Either way, the process of linking a DWG file remains the same.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.365
It helps to know in advance if the DWG file you wish to link has 
its units set to Decimal (metric) or Architectural (imperial).

00:00:57.102 --> 00:01:03.560
This determines how you should set your System Units in 3ds Max; 
to inches if the DWG file is set to Architectural, 

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:06.258
or millimeters if it is set to Decimal.

00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:14.683
When scaling between the two applications, the Display Unit settings 
are less important.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.060
In this case, the Display Unit scale is set to meters whereas 
the default unit in the DWG drawing is in millimeters.

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:27.988
The next step is to open the File Link Manager dialog. You can then 
browse for a DWG file to attach.

00:01:34.243 --> 00:01:39.548
The Rescale option displays the incoming file units. This DWG file 
was set to the metric system.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.780
There are other options you can set to help make the transition between 
the two programs.

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:50.188
3ds Max already ships with a Revit preset that uses predefined options, 
but you can also create your own AutoCAD preset.

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:54.523
This can be done through the Presets tab, by creating and naming 
a new preset.

00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:00.561
After the preset is created, you can modify its options.

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:06.131
Most presets work well for AutoCAD files, but there are a couple 
of options worth noting.

00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:11.656
In the Advanced tab, enable the options that favor the use of 3ds Max 
materials over those coming from AutoCAD.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.690
This is especially useful if you update your CAD drawing after you have 
defined and applied materials in 3ds Max.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.490
This way, any work on materials you do in 3ds Max does not get lost 
after you reload the updated DWG file.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.040
Save the preset to update the changes.

00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:32.095
Going back to the Attach tab, you can now select the AutoCAD preset 
you just created.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.463
Once a preset is created, it will not be removed unless you delete it.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.910
Before moving on, filter out the layers you do not need when you work in 3D.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.520
These are usually layers in 2D, which include annotations and dimensions,
and various construction lines.

00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:51.090
If you have formulated your layers properly in your CAD drawing, it should
be easy to select only those layers that have 3D entities on them.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.283
When you attach the file, the models appear in the viewports.

00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:08.993
Materials may have been applied in AutoCAD, but you usually want 
to adjust them in 3ds Max.

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:16.076
Once in 3ds Max, materials defined in AutoCAD translate as either 
Architectural Materials or Standard Materials.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.540
In Design renderings, you usually use the mental ray rendering engine 
with physically accurate materials.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.850
This means you can edit any of the materials coming from the DWG file.

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:30.263
You can turn them into Arch &amp; Design materials, 

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:33.633
and choose a base template for them.

00:03:38.063 --> 00:03:42.043
You can also apply texture maps to the various channels in the material.

00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:49.028
Some templates may already contain texture information, but you still 
might need to fine-tune their values.

00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:58.480
To keep the integrity of mapping coordinates in 3ds Max, you may elect 
to add a UVW Map modifier to the linked geometry.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.831
In DesignViz mode, use the Real-World Map options to define map sizes 
as they appear in the real world.

00:04:54.987 --> 00:05:02.990
Significantly, if you make a change to the DWG file, it can be updated 
in 3ds Max while preserving some of the changes made.

00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:11.272
An example is changing the size of the balcony in AutoCAD 
to make it deeper.

00:05:22.573 --> 00:05:28.970
Once the file is resaved in AutoCAD, notice the red flag next to the 
file name in the Files tab of the File Link Manager.

00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:42.043
Using the Reload tool, the file is reloaded, updating the balcony size 
in 3ds Max, yet preserving the material changes you introduced.

00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:51.526
If no additional changes are expected to the DWG file, you can bind it 
to the 3ds Max scene to remove any dependencies.

00:05:52.683 --> 00:05:58.598
The link is now broken and any subsequent changes to the DWG file 
are not updated in 3ds Max.
