00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.410
The Study Group University Fair is an
opportunity for our students to meet

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.619
with the representatives

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.939
of more than 75 Universities from the UK

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.289
Europe and the US. This is the largest
University fair

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.980
held in the UK and it is held at a
central London location

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.939
twice a year: October and February, and
these are the key times when

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.850
different cohorts of students are
thinking about their university

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.230
applications.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.920
Students really benefit from coming to
the fair, because they get to meet

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.200
staff from the university directly, they get to hear about the academic entry

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.090
requirements

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.620
but also we can highlight things such as
open days and other information sessions

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.950
that they might not be aware of if
they just go to visit a university

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.450
website,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.680
and also it allows us to represent the
student once they have

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.420
made an application to the university so we can make recommendations

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.619
particularly once we know that they've come
to visit us and made the effort.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.880
This university fair gives students an
opportunity to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.410
interact with the universities themselves,
because what we get

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.500
is all on the website. So it's a very static medium of one-way information

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.960
so speaking to the representives helps me
make my decision because

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.940
then I know does it go hand-in-hand with what
I want and what they want.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.560
It is a great experience that you can ask

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.060
face to face. You have a wide variety of universities.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.260
You can ask very specific questions

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.270
that are very useful for you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.630
I just really love how switched on the students are here

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.820
it's just an extremely pleasant
experience and I feel confident

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.550
that many students we've spoken to today see will be applying to Goldsmiths

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.480
and I really sincerely hope and
think that we'll be to offer them places as well

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.430
What we find is that this fair gives
our students the opportunity

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.180
to really refine their university choices, they

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.620
can meet a whole range of representatives

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.490
from a breadth of universities as they
make their final decisions

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.000
as to which universities they are going to
apply to.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.810
They have everything for anybody

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.000
and this is just a good
opportunity for me to look around

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.240
and gain from the experiences of the people
that are talking to me

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.460
so if you're not sure where you want to go,
come here. You will find a place!
