Now let's begin this week's Vest Media!

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.046
Good evening! Welcome to this week's Vest Media.

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:26.751
I'm Ari Keita, the MC and

00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:27.825
I'm Boo!

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:31.211
Hope you enjoy!

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.970
We would like to rate the video by using Vest Board...

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.630
We'll review picked up from all over the world.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.893
By classifying in any buzzed 4 sections-

00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:46.628
-we can visualize the global rate of videos.

00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:48.547
Vest Board!

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:50.692
Vest Board!

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:55.109
So we've reviewed the videos introduced on August last week,

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:58.676
Remember the video titles we've wrote down on pink papers?

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:05.249
We've archived it in our PC, so please be assured.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.018
It's not a contest you know.

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:14.486
Yep, we're pacifist.

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:17.413
We're just judging in our own terms.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.161
"This video seems to locate right here!"

00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:27.837
We won't say "This is the lowest rank!"

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.911
I won't do such a cruel thing.

00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:31.462
No we won't.

00:01:31.705 --> 00:01:35.440
World Peace is our 2nd subject in this program.

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:49.521
We hope that we can commend the creators who've uploaded the Vest of the Vest.

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:51.899
Stay tune!

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:56.981
OK, let's start!

00:01:57.456 --> 00:02:04.034
The first one is about the American comic hero which was found in Japan.

00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:06.334
Are you ready to watch?

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:06.636
Of course.

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:11.278
Some of you might seen this already, but let's take a look.
