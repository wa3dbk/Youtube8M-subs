On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Reno McCormick
and I'm here to tell you about playing the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.339
Dobro today. Well, this is the guitar we put
the perfect nut on. We turned it into a Dobro.

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.840
It works exactly like you would play Dobro,
only it doesn't have quite the sound. This

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:43.141
is more of a blues sound. So, it's fine and
when we want to turn it back, loosen our strings,

00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.440
take out that perfect nut, we have our original
nut there, and it sounds just like it did

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.870
before. No changes to the guitar. For blues,
it's really the way to go. But if you do like

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.590
the Dobro sound and want to play blues, all
you have to do is buy a round neck resophonic

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:18.090
guitar. You can play it like a regular guitar

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.900
or you could lay it down, put the perfect
nut on it, or you could play it without it.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:32.610
If you hear, when I slide I'm going to hit
those frets once in a while because it takes

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.450
a lot lighter touch because our strings are
way close to the neck. So it's nice to just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:53.689
lift those up.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.479
So it sounds just like a squareneck guitar.
If you noticed, it's round, no problems there,

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.130
you can play it any way you like. And we come
back to the squareneck Dobro. You're never

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.090
going to play regular guitar on this. I'd
say that's three-eighths of an inch off the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:22.640
neck and you're going to hurt yourself. So
you lay it on your lap. If I tuned this to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.770
a lower tuning, we could make it sound more
bluesy. Right now it's tuned to a regular

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:36.500
G and there's a lot of tension on this bridge
so it's got that bluegrass sound, and nice

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.430
and tight. In blues you want a loose, flowing
kind of sound. Bluegrass we want it nice and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.150
tight. And that's exactly what we want.
