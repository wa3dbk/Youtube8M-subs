00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.230
-Today on "Drinks
with Diablo," we're

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.315
bringing you the tropical
sunrise margarita.

00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:07.815
Ow!

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.250
All right.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.230
Welcome back to "Drinks with
Diablo," with your host,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.890
Johnny Diablo.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.650
And today, we're making the
tropical sunrise margarita.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.280
Now what you're going to need
for this-- some fresh limes,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.900
orange juice,
Cointreau, tequila,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.580
club soda, and a little bit of
powdered sugar and grenadine.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.206
Today, we're just going to build
it in a regular martini glass.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:38.455
You can use a margarita glass.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:39.196
It don't matter.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:40.820
So we're going to
shake it down though.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.040
We need to squeeze out two
ounces of fresh lime juice.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.830
Want to know the secret
of getting more juice out

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.570
of your limes?

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.160
Roll them.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.874
Just press down and
roll them like that.

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:56.290
You'll get more
juice out of them.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.040
That's the secret.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.740
Whoa, that was juicy.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.850
On top of that lime
juice, we're going

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.142
to throw down an ounce
and half of Cointreau.

00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:23.320
You gotta have it.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.145
Add to this one and
a half ounces of OJ.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.778
Now it's time for
an ounce of tequila.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.890
And add one or two
ounces of powdered sugar.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.610
So this is like a
Ramos fizz in a way.

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:01.120
Woo!

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.274
I swear, Officer,
it's powdered sugar.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.628
Got the Mount Everest
of powdered sugar.

00:02:20.484 --> 00:02:23.907
Nobody'll get that but me.

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:25.190
All right.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.140
Shake it up.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.966
Strain it into your glass.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.885
Top it off with just a touch
of club soda if you want.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.640
And finally, drizzle a
little bit of grenadine,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.330
and that'll give
you the sunrise.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.900
Just enough to get it.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.370
Just enough.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.770
And there we go, sunrise.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.270
Boom.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.350
The tropical sunrise margarita.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.220
How's this bad boy taste?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.940
Let's find out Mmm, mmm.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.020
That is delicious as can be.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.340
The orange juice
adds-- I don't know.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.810
It's like an orange
juice margarita.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.060
Really simple-- Cointreau,
a quality tequila,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.990
fresh-squeezed lime juice.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.150
Quality ingredients make all
the difference in the world

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.410
when you're making a cocktail.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.170
I am really spoiled for
going out to bars now.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.570
There you go, tropical
sunrise margarita.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.470
