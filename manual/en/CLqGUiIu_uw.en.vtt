Hi. I'm Noopur on behalf of Expert Village.
In this clip, I'm going to tell you how to

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.209
make paneer tikka sandwich. Now we can either
get this marinated cottage cheese in the market

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:19.950
or we can do it on our own by using marinating
sauce which has to be done for at least 24

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:37.800
hours so that the sauce gets completely inside
the cottage cheese.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:01:10.820
Now, we take a slice of bread and apply some
cheese on it and some ketchup. Now place these

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:34.560
slices of paneer tikka all over the bread,
add capsicum,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:56.929
sprinkle some fine chopped onion. You can
even add some green chili and, of course,

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:13.820
tomato. Then sprinkle some pepper and salt
and cover this with another slice of bread.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:23.410
And then place it on the toaster and leave
it for three to four minutes. So now, after

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:37.310
four minutes, your toast is ready. So let's
see. Now we take this toast, since it's properly

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:47.620
toasted, place it on a plate and then we can
have it with either tomato ketchup or maybe

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.230
mustard sauce, as per your wish. So here you
go, your toast is ready.
