&gt;&gt; Geoffrey Kendall: It's an incredibly bizarre
feeling knowing that there's a, I believe

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.079
they call it the computer in the sky, that's
deciding the next 4 years of my life.

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:10.510
&gt;&gt; One more

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.289
&gt;&gt; Kristi Larned: The fate of the next 3 years
is resting on the announcement that I'll hear

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.189
in about 10 minutes.

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.640
&gt;&gt; Good luck!

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.110
&gt;&gt; Jason Hine: I worked really hard. There
was a lot of payoff a lot of sacrifice and

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.170
it all kind of culminates today in a very
exciting moment, all of us opening our letters

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.560
together.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.949
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.860
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey: My first choice, I'd love to
stay in Boston, is right here at Beth Israel.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.700
&gt;&gt; Jason: My number one is Temple down in
Philadelphia.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.610
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey: But I've applied all over the
east coast.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.550
&gt;&gt; Janessa Nason: I would love to be at Maine
Med.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.270
Thank you.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.800
I think the people there are great.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.140
That is the cutest dress.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.410
&gt;&gt; (screams)

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.160
&gt;&gt; I have the envelope in my hand.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.410
&gt;&gt; (screams)

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.120
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh!

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.430
I feel like I have the golden ticket, you
know.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.690
&gt;&gt; Okay, you ready? This is like the most
nerve wracking thing I've ever done.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.880
(laughs) Maine Med!

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.920
&gt;&gt; What is it, what is it?

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.999
&gt;&gt; Yeah! Maine Med!

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:09.039
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey: Going to Dartmouth! Unbelievable!

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:15.109
&gt;&gt; Mayra Spurling: Congratulations! You've
matched! Family medicine, Alaska!

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.219
&gt;&gt; High five! Woo!

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.010
&gt;&gt; Kristi: I got my top choice at Beth Israel.
I'm very excited.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, we're going to be neighbors!

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.440
&gt;&gt; Nicole Barbee: I got my first choice, I'm
matched in the family medicine program in

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.170
Waukesha, Wisconsin.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.570
I plan on coming back to rural Maine to practice
family medicine and they have a really great

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.659
rural training program out there.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.909
&gt;&gt; Jason: I got my number one choice actually.
That's the important part right there, the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.189
Temple. Unbelievable. I can't stop smiling.
So, yeah, I'm very excited and just opening

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:44.890
another chapter.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.299
&gt;&gt; Geoffrey: This has been a marathon to say
the least. It's been a long four years, but

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.689
it's also been the fastest four years of my
life. It's been incredible.
