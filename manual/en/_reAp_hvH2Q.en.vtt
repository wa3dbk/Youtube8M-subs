00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:08.310
To replace the door of your SureFlap cat flap
you first need to remove it from its installed

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.330
location.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:20.670
Remove the battery cover and then remove the
four screws using a cross-head screwdriver.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.550
Once the four screws have been removed you
can open up the cat flap as we are showing.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.470
Note that the two halves are wired together,
please take care not to damage these wires

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.060
during the door replacement process.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.890
To remove the door place your fingers on the
end of the spindles and lift the door up as

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.890
shown.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.570
To insert the new door, lower the magnet end
in first and then drop the door into position.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.140
Apply pressure to the PCB and battery compartment
in case it has lifted up.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.940
Ensure that the two plastic lens covers are
also in position.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.659
We can now put the two parts of SureFlap back
together, but make sure these antenna wires

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.119
are not trapped as you place the unit back
together.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:19.740
The two halves should be lined up, one above
the other and gently lowered down to ensure

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.799
the spring on the catch slots into the correct
place.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:41.729
The unit can now be screwed back together
using the four screws.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.929
Now we want to check that the door swings
freely and that the catch and spring are working

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:49.929
correctly.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.859
Push the door back and push the catch down
with your finger.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:08.569
The catch should pop back up under the pressure
of the spring.
