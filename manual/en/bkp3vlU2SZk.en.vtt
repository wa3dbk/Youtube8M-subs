00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:07.789
Weighing just 6.3 ounces and employing waterproof,
breathable, stretch fabric, the award winning

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.110
Marmot Essence jacket is an excellent ultra
light weight option for hikers, back packers

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:23.110
or climbers seeking light weight compressible
protection in wet and windy weather. Let’s

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.980
take a closer look at its fit and features.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.750
Marmot manages to balance that ultra light
weight construction with reliable protection

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.750
by utilizing its stretch nanopro membrane
fabric. So, again, you have got a waterproof,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.740
breathable fabric. You have got taped seems.
So you have got every confidence there that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.790
you are protected despite weighing in at that
low weight. In addition to the breathability

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.420
provided by the fabric itself, there are integrated
vents in this jacket. They are always open

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.320
vents. And so you can see here on the side
there is a pass through for warm air to escape.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.200
Because of the design the overlay there, you
don’t have to be concerned about water finding

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.800
its way into the interior of the jacket.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.560
Marmot doesn’t skimp on the fit here either.
It utilizes its angel wing construction as

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.580
it does with many of its jackets. So while
you are on the go, on the move, pack on, the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.640
jack-et stays where you want it to instead
of riding up or gathering at the waist line.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.119
There is a fairly streamlined athletic cut
to the Essence jacket. Certainly there is

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.070
room for low profile base layers, a t-shirt
underneath it, but not an extremely roomy

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.070
cut. There is elasticity built into the asymmetrical
cuffs. So you get some nice coverage there.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.070
You get a nice fit. But there isn’t any
real adjustability there. There is a single

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.470
point of adjustability on the right side
of the jacket at the hem. So you can pull

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.540
that or cinch that in. It certainly is a
hooded jacket. You have got a little bit of

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.359
stretch there. You also have dual points of
adjustability at either side of the chin and

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:20.310
a Velcro tab in the back to align that as
well. So you have got plenty of room, plenty

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.019
of adjustability. So you are getting a great
fit at the head.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.680
In keeping with that stream lined design and,
again, helping to maintain that weight, there

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.609
is just the single chest pocket here. So not
a jacket that comes with any hand pockets

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.829
down below or internal. But great, great protection.
It doesn’t stow inside itself, but packs

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.230
down really small. Again, you have got that
20D fabrication. Makes this a great option

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.019
for throwing in your back pack just in case,
for hiking, for back packing or for climbing.
