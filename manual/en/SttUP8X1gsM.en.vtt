00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.540
Hey there I'm Bobbie and we are here at the
Del Mar Fans &amp; Lighting headquarters.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.050
Today I'm going to show you how to give your
ceiling fan a makeover that will match any

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.390
room in your house.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.699
While we uninstall our fan here's the supplies
you're going to need.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.520
We recommend choosing a base color that will
match your room's hinges, doorknobs or appliances.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.119
Your bases will go well with the colors of
your furniture, door or cabinet colors.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.470
Neutrals work well if you change your furniture
often.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.870
For this project you're going to want to use
a flat or satin enamel based spray paint.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.739
Preferably one with primer already in it.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.320
Especially if you're going to go from a light
color to a dark color.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.390
Try to avoid gloss paints because they will
leave a glare on your ceiling fan.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.699
Now we're going to start working on the blades.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.890
Now we're going to sand the blades.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.399
Make sure when sanding the blades use a downward
motion with solid sweeps.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:09.079
Pay extra attention to the edges of your blades.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.030
Next you're going to want to clean your entire
ceiling fan.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.790
You can use warm water with a mild soap or
you can use baby wipes because they're really

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.190
easy.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.690
Make sure to give your spray paint a good
shake before using and always test your nozzle

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.950
so you know what kind of pressure you're working
with.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.009
When you spray you want to spray six to eight
inches away from the surface and work in a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:50.939
side to side motion across the fan so you
get an even coat.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.210
Now we're going to paint all the fans hardware.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.369
Once you've completely finished painting your
fan, take a moment, let it dry and then look

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.369
and make sure you don't need a second coat.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.399
If you need a second coat no problem just
go ahead and run through all of it one more

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.000
time before you start piecing it back together.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.110
Make sure to wait until your fan is completely
dry before re-installing it.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.860
We chose the chrome for the hardware and the
red for the blades because you guys voted

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.910
