Tweet of the week goes to Chloe Elizabeth
who says, 'Oh my god you're so close to 100,000

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:14.599
I remember when you had only 10,000. So exciting,
congrats Cristen Conger.' Thank you Chloe

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.810
Elizabeth for watching even when I only had
10,000 subscribers when I was just a little

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.470
YouTube baby and now I'm like a YouTube toddler
still pooping my pants but almost walking.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.020
This week on Stuff Mom Never Told You I kicked
off with nails. A lot of you have asked why

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.720
women paint their fingernails and now there's
an entire video explaining the whole thing.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.290
So be sure to watch it and like it if you
haven't already. Then the week got menstrual.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.310
On Wednesday I talked about is PMS a myth?
Then on Friday I cleared up 9 menstruation

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.190
myths which I ran across while researching
for PMS because it turns out that there is

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.000
so much misunderstanding out there about how
our periods work so be sure to watch it even

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.050
if you are a fella who doesn't get periods
it can be educational for you as well. Now

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.470
it's time for Ask Cristen in which I ask Cristen
that is myself some questions actually you

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.000
ask them to me. Thanks to everybody who watched
and commented on last week's Ask Cristen video,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.360
'Why are women expected to sit "like a lady"?'
I had no idea how much testicle talk that

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.740
video would generate. neeneko said, 'Speaking
as a male who does sit with ankles crossed

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.450
together I can comment that yeah, we do get
flack for it. I would also like to comment

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.060
on the "squished male bits", learning to cross
your legs without hurting anything is pretty

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.650
trivial in the same way that sitting on a
horse (or motorcycle or whatever) without

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.540
squishing anything is easy.' This is definitely
stuff mom never told me about testicles. Jonathan

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.770
Warren also said, 'I think I am the only guy
I know who sits with crossed legs. As far

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.810
as I'm aware I do it because it's one of the
easiest and more comfortable seating positions

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.979
for me. Many of my guy friends have asked
me "doesn't that feel painful?" because I

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.909
assume the legs would squish the private parts.
To which I simply reply'--ohhh! That's not

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:20.129
what he replies, Jonathan Warren simply replies
'no'. I just nearly leapt out of my chair

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:28.719
because a curtain moved. Oh my god. Now onto
this week's Ask Cristen question from person

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:33.840
Phillip. 'Why do people signify the color
pink with girls?' As a least one commenter

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.900
pointed out there was a study that came out
in 2007 that got a ton of attention. It proposed

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.999
a scientific basis for women innately liking
pink and men innately liking blue. What these

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:52.859
researchers proposed is that way, way back
in our hunter-gatherer days women were tasked

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.590
with the gathering which would included seeking
out ripened fruits and berries and what color

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.760
do we often associate with ripened fruit and
berries? Red and other reddish hues. They

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.299
might also pay attention to redness in their
children's cheeks which could be a sign of

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.829
illness and fever. What about the blue? The
neuroscientists who conducted this study proposed

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.329
that men as the hunters would have payed more
attention to say blue skies which would have

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.849
been indicative of good hunting weather. They
also would have kept their eyes peeled for

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.889
the blue of water where the could have gone
to get yeah water and also catch fish to then

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.389
feed their families. While that theory is
certainly compelling and perhaps the reason

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.749
I'm wearing a red shirt today, it doesn't
help explain why pink for girls, blue for

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:47.309
boys didn't become a thing at least in the
United States until the 1940s. Up until the

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:53.419
1910s it was customary for both baby girls
and baby boys to wear exactly the same thing.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.029
Take this adorable baby photo from 1884 when
you have this 2 and a half year old who is

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:04.900
wearing the customary white gown that both
boys and girls would wear and also long hair

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.370
because at that time, a boy's hair would not
have been cut until age 6. That my friends

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.310
is none other than a baby President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt. It wasn't until into the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.410
1910s that some clothing catalogues and other
publications started suggesting that, 'well

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.040
if you want to dress your child in something
other than white, which is very practical

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.600
because you can simply bleach it to keep it
clean, put a boy in pink and put a girl in

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.600
blue. Say what? Take for instance this quote
from a trade publication from June 1918 which

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.350
said, 'The generally accepted rule is pink
for the boys and blue for the girls. Pink

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.600
being a more decided and stronger color is
more suitable for the boy while blue which

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.070
is more delicate and dainty is prettier for
the girl. Why then in the 1940s did it switcheroo?

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.410
Essentially retailers told parents that hey,
if you're having a girl, buy pink. If you're

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.280
having a boy buy blue. What does that mean
for the retailer? They can sell more stuff.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.390
So while that 2007 study on hunter-gatherers
is certainly thought-provoking to me what's

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.000
even more thought-provoking is how in our
modern day culture at least this whole pink

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.610
for girls, blue for boys thing was really
just the product of the rise of mass media

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.390
and also clothing retailers telling us ultimately
what to wear. Now I want to know what you

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.040
think about this whole pink-blue divide. Are
you guy who likes pink and a girl who likes

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.900
blue? Let me know in the comments below and
as always, ask me your questions so I can

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.740
give you some answers.
