Hey it's Andy from MyTechMethods.com.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:10.690
In this video I'll show you how to put movies
on your iPhone.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.259
So instead of spending a bunch of money on
the iTunes store and buying movies through

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.930
iTunes you can actually copy any movie from
any DVD onto iTunes and then sync it to your

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.320
iPhone, and that's what I'm going to show
you how to do today.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.270
And let me tell you if you don't have movies
on your iPhone right now you're definitely

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.270
missing out.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.180
To do this you'll be using DVD copy software
from a company called Digiarty.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.290
They make the absolute best DVD copy software
out there.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.440
It's by far my favorite.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.430
It's very easy to use, it's fast, and it's
high quality.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.180
And the software is available for Windows
and Mac users.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.350
So the first thing you want to do is click
the link in the video description below.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.190
If you're a Windows user click the Windows
download link.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.530
If you're a Mac user click the Mac download
link.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.660
And that link will start an instant download
of this program.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.260
So download and install the DVD ripper from
the link below, and you'll be able to try

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.300
it out for absolutely free.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.860
And if you like it you can register for the
full version right from the program itself

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.220
and for a special discount.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.140
Now once you have this application installed,
it'll be called Mac X DVD Ripper Pro for Mac

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.140
users.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.500
It'll be called Win X DVD Ripper Platinum
for Windows users, but they both work exactly

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.660
the same so you can follow along here.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.810
The next thing you want to do is insert the
DVD movie into your computer's DVD drive right

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.300
now, the one that you want to copy to your
iPhone.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.060
Then click this DVD button here at the top
left of the application.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.170
Okay now the source DVD disc window will pop
up, and you should see your movie's title

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.710
here in this box.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.619
And that means it's selected then just hit
OK.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.100
Once it loads your DVD movie you'll see this
output profile window pop up.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.810
Now since we're putting it on an iPhone you'll
choose Apple device to iPhone video, and then

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.240
choose whatever iPhone model you have that
you're going to put the movie on.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.670
So I have an iPhone 4S.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.549
I'll choose iPhone 4S recommended option.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.170
The recommended option just means the program
has automatically selected the best quality

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.549
options for my specific device.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.060
Once you've selected the recommended option
for your iPhone model you'll click "Done".

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.420
Now the program has automatically selected
the main movie file itself.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.280
Here you can see that title 1 is selected.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.619
Now down towards the bottom you have a destination
folder.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.650
This is where you're going to copy the movie
to.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.049
So if you browse you can choose any folder
that you want to copy the movie to.

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.419
So I'll just select Desktop.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.700
You can choose whatever folder that you want
and hit open.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.190
Now all you have to do is click the Run button
in the bottom right, and it will start copying

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.489
the movie to your computer.

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.760
Alright and once the copy is complete the
movie is now on your computer.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.790
It shows up in the folder that you copied
it to.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.790
Here it's in my desktop.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.340
I saved it to my desktop folder.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.809
Now in order to put the movie on our iPhone
we have to put it into iTunes first.

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.609
So the next thing you want to do is open up
iTunes.

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.099
Then go back to the folder that has the movie
in it.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.790
Here's my desktop folder and then drag and
drop it into iTunes just like that.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.469
The movie will be copied into iTunes, and
you can verify it by going into iTunes into

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.469
the Movies section.

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.010
And there you see the movie right there.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.650
And the last thing we need to do is sync our
iPhone with iTunes so plug your iPhone into

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.669
your computer using the USB cable.

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.439
Now once your iPhone shows up in iTunes just
click on it.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.170
Then go to the top and click on Movies, and
check the checkbox to sync movies.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.480
And then click apply.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.659
And the movie will be copied to your iPhone
and you'll be able to watch it on your iPhone

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.329
from the videos app.

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.049
And that, my friends, is how to copy movies
on your iPhone, the absolute best way to do

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.049
it.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.049
So go ahead and give that a try.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.010
