Technology applied to surfing is definitely a great tool to follow the swells and storms that generate these waves.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.200
Owl Chapman is one of the best Hawaiian shapers, and I couldn't be happier to know that this monster of the North Shore has made one of my boards.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.000
Hawaii is one of the most important places to train because of its strategic location. The ocean can transform itself in minutes, in hours.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:34.500
The waves may be small in the morning and out of nowhere, in two hours, the swell can come and give you waves of 10, 15, 20 feet.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.000
I believe that physical preparation is key to any sport, especially in surfing of big waves. Lately I've been swimming in the ocean,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:53.000
I've been jogging on the sand, I've been stretching, doing push ups, working with bars and all those things that help you, you know?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.000
When you're alone you definitely have to do it and Hawaii is a place that has always motivated me to do so.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.000
When I train, the thing that I dedicate the most time to is a circuit I do with my physical trainer in which I combine balance and endurance,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.000
especially in the legs and waist. This is the closest thing to what I do in the water. I also think it's important to spend time doing breathing exercises,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:30.000
either out of the sea or in the sea. You get to connect with yourself, it gives you more confidence, helps you mentally... and that's pretty much the bottom line right?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.500
In these giant waves you have to be able to stay calm and confident that you will be able to pass any situation and experience.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Everything counts, the more prepared and more trained you are, I think you'll have a better performance in the activity that you develop.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.500
In this case, in surfing, the breathing capability and your psyche are the two things you need to hold on when you are under one or two waves.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.500
Don't hesitate. Be sure of yourself, I think that is one of the most important things.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Sometimes I'm afraid to go in the water, you never know what might happen in the ocean: sharks, no sharks, the reef is close,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.000
the waves can be small or large. But I like to feel the adrenaline that surfing big waves gives,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:26.000
and being able to do something that not many people can do, is something that in some way or another becomes addictive and something that I enjoy more every time.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.000
The most important thing is to be ok with your self, stay positive and be prepared to pass any situation.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:49.000
For me, Hawaii is always going to be one of the most important places of my life. If you get in a good tube... it's the closest to happiness you can get regarding this sport.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000
After a couple of years of experience surfing big waves and several months of training, I feel prepared to achieve this new goal I have.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:16.500
I think the best thing will be to take every opportunity as if it was the last and give everything for this passion so that I can keep up this track.
