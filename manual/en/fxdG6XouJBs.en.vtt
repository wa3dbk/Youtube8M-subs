00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.080
Here at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California,
NASA is preparing to launch a spacecraft to

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.490
study the Earth's atmosphere and better understand
how climate change affects everyone on the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.589
planet.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.990
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory, or OCO-2,
will be NASA's first dedicated Earth remote-sensing

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.439
satellite to collect space-based global measurements
of atmospheric carbon dioxide. It will have

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.669
the precision, resolution and coverage needed
to better understand the environment on a

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.610
global basis.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.239
The mission to study the atmosphere began
to take shape in an Orbital Sciences Corporation

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.020
facility in Gilbert, Arizona. The company
built, integrated and tested the OCO-2 spacecraft

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.469
under a contract from NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.559
After a 560-mile trip from Orbital's facility
in Arizona, the satellite arrived at Vandenberg

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.489
on April 30. It then was transported to the
Astrotech payload processing facility. Inside

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.500
the clean room, technicians and engineers
began uncrating the OCO-2 spacecraft.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.430
The 985-pound satellite then was placed on
a test fixture to begin weeks of intense prelaunch

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.500
checkouts to ensure all its complex systems
are working properly.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.290
During December of last year, a convoy of
trucks began delivering the solid rocket motors

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.310
to Vandenberg for the United Launch Alliance
Delta II rocket that will boost the satellite

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.530
to orbit.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.799
In late March, the Delta's first-stage booster
arrived at NASA hangar 836.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.540
On March 28, the Delta II first stage booster
was transported to SLC-2 and raised to the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.350
vertical position and hoisted into the mobile
service tower.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.049
Two weeks later, the three solid rocket motors
were attached to the first stage of the booster.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.619
The Delta II second stage then was towed to
the base of the mobile service tower at Space

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.520
Launch Complex-2 on April 15.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.579
The instruments and systems on OCO-2 were
thoroughly tested at Astrotech's Vandenberg

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.440
facility, including the all-important solar
arrays. While orbiting the Earth, the arrays

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.440
will capture the sun's energy and generate
813 watts of power for the spacecraft's systems.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.200
With a primary structure consisting of a seven-foot-long
hexagonal column that is three feet wide,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.170
OCO-2 is about the size of an office desk.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.130
Once final checks were complete at the Vandenberg
Astrotech facility, the satellite was enclosed

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.850
in its transportation canister and prepared
for the trip to the launch pad to meet up

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.460
with the Delta II vehicle.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.520
By mid-June, OCO-2 was ready to be placed
atop the Delta rocket to begin final preparations

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.740
for liftoff and its 24-month mission.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.350
Once in orbit, OCO-2 will study carbon dioxide
levels of the Earth's atmosphere from an orbit

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.350
438 miles in space, providing scientists with
a better idea of carbon dioxide's impact on

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.760
global climate change.
