00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:03.749
(gentle chiming music)

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:05.770
Hi, I'm Dr. Terry Labberton

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.915
from The Victorian Cosmetic Institute,

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:09.428
and today I'm going to talk to you

00:00:09.428 --> 00:00:12.221
about non-surgical facial rejuvenation.

00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:14.873
Very often, we get people coming into us

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:17.990
saying that they just want to
freshen up with their look,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.586
they're not exactly sure what it is

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.345
that they're not happy
about with their face,

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:23.580
but maybe they feel that they look tired,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.047
or they look cranky, or their skin

00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:28.311
is not behaving how they'd like.

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:32.235
So, we tend to just take a
holistic approach to the face,

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.447
and look at all the different components

00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:36.510
that we can do a little bit of work

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.976
that will help to freshen up
the whole overall appearance.

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:41.560
Today we have Yvonne with us

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.145
and we're going to take a look

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:46.485
at the whole of her face,
and look at different aspects

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.415
that we may be able to work on,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.979
either with anti-wrinkle
injections, dermal fillers,

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.293
laser treatment, or perhaps even

00:00:55.293 --> 00:00:59.456
radio frequency removal
of lumps and moles.

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:02.550
So when I'm looking at somebody's face,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.141
I like to break it down
into different components.

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:09.867
First of all I have a look
at lines of expression,

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:14.207
so that we can perhaps work
with anti-wrinkle injections.

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:18.374
And first of all, just having
a look at Yvonne's face,

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:21.428
there's not a whole lot there in terms

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:25.481
of strong wrinkles, but I am
drawn to these little wrinkles

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:29.211
across the top forehead,
and I would like to consider

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.670
using some anti-wrinkle
injections in there,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.345
just raising your eyebrows up for me,

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:34.799
as you can see they're quite strong,

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.361
that muscle pull up there, and I'd like

00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:38.343
to just soften that a little bit.

00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:39.776
I don't really want to completely

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.979
knock out the movement in the forehead,

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.840
we like to see some
expression and a little bit

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.709
of elevation of the eyebrows,

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.841
but just to soften so that
those lines are much softer.

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:51.258
And frown for me.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.881
Yvonne's had some anti-wrinkle injections

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.690
before in her frown, but you can see

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.498
there's a little bit
of movement coming back

00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:03.066
so I'd perhaps like to
soften that as well.

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.869
And a nice cheesy smile for me.

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.585
And we've certainly got
some lines coming in

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.913
around the crow's feet area,

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:12.594
again I don't like to
wipe these out completely,

00:02:12.594 --> 00:02:14.260
but I think we can soften those

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.016
so that she's still got a lovely smile

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:17.958
and her eyes still
sparkle when she smiles,

00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:22.354
but the lines are just
a little bit softer.

00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:24.053
And in the lower half of the face,

00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:27.191
we can use anti-wrinkle
injections just to soften the pull

00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:29.397
of these muscles here,
which can tend to cause

00:02:29.397 --> 00:02:30.950
that little fold that we get

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.842
in the corner of the mouth,
and also in the chin.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:37.390
Just you can see that
Yvonne's just starting

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.956
to get a little bit of a
fold in, just above the chin,

00:02:40.956 --> 00:02:43.120
so we can actually use a little bit

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.278
of anti-wrinkle injection there

00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:47.175
which relaxes the muscle,
and that actually softens

00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:48.646
and opens out the face,

00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:51.450
and it has a younger,
fresher look as well.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.448
And then next of all, I like
to look at facial volume.

00:02:54.448 --> 00:02:58.094
As we age, we all lose
weight from the face,

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:01.925
it often happens probably
from about mid-30s onwards,

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:03.693
and it doesn't matter what's happening

00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:04.971
with the weight in the rest of your body,

00:03:04.971 --> 00:03:07.722
I've got a theory sometimes
it goes south and multiplies.

00:03:07.722 --> 00:03:09.573
When we start to lose the fat in the face,

00:03:09.573 --> 00:03:12.780
what happens is we start
to get the appearance

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.928
of these lines that are coming down,

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:18.574
like diagonal stripes
coming down the face.

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:22.487
What that tends to do is it
draws your eye to those lines.

00:03:22.487 --> 00:03:23.726
It's like your mum used to say,

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:26.225
you don't wear diagonal striped skirts,

00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:27.707
that accentuates the hips.

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.708
So same sort of thing, you
don't want to draw the eye

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:31.577
down the face, you want
to actually bring the eye

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:33.681
back up when you're looking at a face,

00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:36.443
you want to bring the
attention up to the eyes,

00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:37.833
to the personality,

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:42.102
rather than seeing these
lines that are drawing down.

00:03:42.102 --> 00:03:45.831
So what we need to do, or
what we can look at doing,

00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:48.249
is replacing volume so that we're

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.582
just disguising these lines very subtly,

00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:55.432
and bringing a bit more
volume back to the cheek,

00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:59.101
so that the light hits
the face and bounces up,

00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:03.009
so that we're drawn to
that part of the face.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.347
Taking a look at Yvonne's skin,

00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:08.502
there's a few things that
I would like to work on,

00:04:08.502 --> 00:04:12.633
in terms of improving
first the tonal variation.

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:16.469
She's got a little bit of
redness and splotchiness,

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.923
they're fine little
capillaries that are dilated,

00:04:19.923 --> 00:04:22.626
and she's also got a few little freckles

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:24.444
and a little bit of sun damage,

00:04:24.444 --> 00:04:27.796
which we can also work on with the laser.

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:30.376
Are you feeling alright
after that little rundown?

00:04:30.376 --> 00:04:31.342
- Thanks.

00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:34.187
- Now, it sounds a lot when we mention

00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:36.280
all of these things
together, and now you can

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.643
actually do all of them in
a very short space of time,

00:04:39.643 --> 00:04:42.204
and get a total sort of rejuvenation

00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:44.244
in a short period of time,

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:46.985
or you can actually pick which little bits

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:49.729
that you want to focus
on, and just do them

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.443
a few weeks at a time and actually improve

00:04:52.443 --> 00:04:56.272
the appearance over a
period of several months.

00:04:56.272 --> 00:04:58.295
It's the slow and steady approach,

00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:00.966
so it's really very much based on

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:04.045
what you want to achieve,
what sort of time frame,

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:05.792
how much downtime you want,

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:07.337
all of those factors are part

00:05:07.337 --> 00:05:10.181
of what we take into consideration.

00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:13.431
(gentle chiming music)
