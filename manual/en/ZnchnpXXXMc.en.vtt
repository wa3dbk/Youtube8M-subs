Hi! I'm Marlene Spiegel, founding team leader
with Wildtree. I'm here on behalf of Expert

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:16.680
Village and today I'm going to show you how
to make a Moroccan Chicken dish over couscous.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.230
Now I've already cooked the couscous but the
first thing I do is in my hot Euro dipping

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:40.050
oil in the pan I'm going to add some diced
tomatoes. Just swirl that around and let that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.630
cook and simmer off some of the steam and
the juices. Then I add some sliced zucchini

00:00:49.630 --> 00:01:20.100
and the chicken breast which, oops, we forgot
to have over here. But that's alright, the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.979
meal will come out delicious anyhow. Then,
the key ingredient is Wildtree's Moroccan

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.670
Salmon sauce. Now I know this is a chicken
dish, but you could use it on salmon or chicken.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.280
And I'm going to add a tablespoon of that
because it's real rich. And I'm going to make

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:52.599
sure that we get every drop of it by scooping
the vegetables and getting those off. And

00:01:52.599 --> 00:02:01.790
I just keep stirring everything in. Our chicken
is starting to cook and I reduce it down to

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:11.560
simmer, cover it and in twenty minutes, we
are good to go! Take a look at this dish!

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:21.590
It's absolutely excellent! A Moroccan Salmon
Chicken! And as you can see, it's in high

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.200
demand!
