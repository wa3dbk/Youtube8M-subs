00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.230
The QL Series includes Dugan automatic mixing built in to the mixing board.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.500
I've been making automatic mixers for 40 years,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.180
and I'm proud that we have a very high-quality realization of the Dan Dugan automatic mixing in this product.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.310
There are three advantages to Dan Dugan automatic mixing;

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.020
First, it reduces the studio noise to the noise of one microphone.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.090
Second, it reduces feedback to the feedback of one microphone.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.060
You could have twenty microphones but it sounds like one microphone.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.480
Third, a dramatic reduction in comb filtering from my voice going into an adjacent microphone.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
All this is done without any gating or threshold at all.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.700
Everything is just done by smooth automatic cross-fades.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.340
Dugan automatic mixing is extremely helpful wherever you have multiple microphones.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.480
For example in corporate events, you might have a panel discussion;

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.150
in television you have news panels/ sports panels;  

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.960
in houses of worship you have many microphones; 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.320
in theatre you have many wireless microphones.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.500
In all of these situations the Dugan automatic mixer will take care of bringing the faders up and down while people are talking. 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.200
The operator is not chained to the faders anymore.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.570
He can just make small adjustments and be artistic.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.780
My products have always been used in speech applications such as corporate meetings.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.800
Yamaha has also been very involved in speech applications.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.390
When they learned about my process they thought that it would be very good for us to get together.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.430
We collaborated on making a plug-in card which would go into Yamaha mixing boards.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.000
That has been very successfulâ€”people are really loving it.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.600
Now we've decided to go one step farther,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.450
and build Dugan automatic mixing into a Yamaha mixing board itself. 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.450
I worked directly with a team of very talented engineers at Yamaha.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.020
They were dedicated to performing my algorithm with no compromise whatsoever.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.250
We went back and forth.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.620
I went to Japan, tested various versions, and made suggestions.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.390
They had suggestions too.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.450
In the end, the result is something that we're both very pleased with.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.300
The real advantage of having the Dugan automatic mixer built in to the console is that there's nothing to hook up.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.870
It's all there and you just patch it on the console's patching screen.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.000
All you have to do is put the automatic mixer into the channels that you're going to use.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.390
If you do live mixing with multiple open microphones,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.700
I strongly recommend that you try out Dugan automatic mixing;

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.480
you'll find that it will make your job much easier,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.190
it'll make your production more consistent,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.830
and you and your audience will both be very happy with it.
