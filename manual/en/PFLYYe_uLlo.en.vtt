00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.970
One of the truly unique things about Xyron
Creatopia is the ability to apply edge to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.070
edge adhesive on any item up to half an inch
thick and 12 inches wide.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.099
So, I'm going to show you how to adhere a
foam letter to our project.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.090
When you are storing your machine, you remember
that you want to store it with the tray facing

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.090
up.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.329
So I am going to pull it out and press it
in and my permanent adhesive cartridge is

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.300
already in the machine.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.170
You want to press the positioning button which
is in the centre of your handle and on the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.540
side of the machine, you'll notice a one,
two, three sticker that shows you the positioning

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.680
of your handle and we want ours to be in position
number two because that will give the rollers

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.660
the ability to float up and down so that you
can put in your item.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.710
So, you put your giant blue S into the machine,
got my handle pulled out, and you simply crank

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.180
the handle as you would with any other item
and once its cleared past the clear bar, you

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.180
want to press down on the orange cut button.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.610
Slide it across and your item is going to
come right out.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.740
Now, when you are using thicker items you
really do want to make sure that you burnish

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.740
all around the edge.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.740
You can use your fingers, you can use a pen,
you can use a popsicle stick, just make sure

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.020
that you've got your adhesive truly edge to
edge.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:49.189
Then you're going to peel off the clear plastic
top and peel off your letter and we are going

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.940
to stick it here on the board.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.600
This really is an incredibly machine you can
run cork through it, small tiles, wood, acrylic,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.130
chipboard, cardboard, memorabilia, a wide
variety of other craft items.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.030
The possibilities are truly endless.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.619
