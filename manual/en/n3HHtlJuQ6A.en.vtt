00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.010
THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW TO TRANSFER

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.020
ISILO FILES FROM YOUR COMPUTER

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.040
TO YOUR IPHONE, USING A MAC COMPUTER

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.060
THE FIRST THING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT YOU

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.090
YOU HAVE A WI-FI NETWORK OR WIRELESS NETWORK SYSTEM FOR YOUR

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.100
COMPUTER, AND THAT YOUR IPHONE IS CONNECTED TO THE WI-FI NETWORK

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.120
TO CHECK YOUR CONNECTION YOU WOULD GO TO "SETTINGS"

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.150
IN "SETTINGS" YOU WILL SEE HERE WI-FI

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.160
AND AS YOU CAN SEE, MINE IS CONNECTED TO MY NETWORK. IF IT WASN'T CONNECTED

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.170
YOU WOULD SEE "NOT CONNECTED", AND THEN YOU JUST TAP HERE

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.170
AND CHOOSE  YOUR NETWORK CONNECTION. NOW LET'S GO BACK TO

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.180
THE SCREEN ON THE

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.200
IPHONE, AND NOW WE WANT TO OPEN THE ISILO

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.210
PROGRAM

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.220
TO CHECK THE SERVER ADDRESS FOR YOUR PHONE. TO DO THAT,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.230
YOU WANT TO CLICK ON THE 3 DOTS HERE

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.250
AT THE TOP, AND THEN COME DOWN AND CLICK ON SERVER

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.260
ONCE YOU CLICK ON SERVER, THIS

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.290
SCREEN WILL COME UP- "FILE SERVER VIEW", AND YOU WILL NOTICE HERE

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.310
I HAVE 3 DIFFERENT IP 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.330
SERVER ADDRESS ON MY PHONE. THE IMPORTANT ONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.340
ON THE SECOND LINE. THAT'S THE ONE THAT I FIND TO WORK

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.360
MOST OF THE TIME, ALL OF THE TIME.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.390
THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT TO WRITE DOWN. AND ALSO NOTICE HERE WHERE IT SAYS

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.410
"ENABLE SERVER- WHEN ONLY  IN FILE SERVER VIEW"

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.420
IF YOU BACK OUT OF THIS VIEW, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONNECT YOUR

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.430
IPHONE. WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IS TO LEAVE IPHONE

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.450
IN THIS VIEW UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED TRANSFERING THE FILES FROM

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.460
YOUR COMPUTER TO YOUR IPHONE.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.470
THE NEXT STEP IN TRANSFERING OUR FILES FROM OUR COMPUTER OR

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.490
MAC ONTO OUR IPHONE IN ISILO, IS TO COME TO YOUR DESKTOP

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.510
AND GO TO YOUR "FINDER" BAR AT THE TOP, COME OVER TO

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.520
WHERE IT SAYS "GO"

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.540
AND THEN SCROLL DOWN TO "CONNECT TO SERVER".

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.550
YOU WANT TO THEN ENTER THAT ADDRESS THAT

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.580
IP ADDRESS YOU GOT FROM YOUR ISILO SERVER.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.600
AND YOU WANT TO TYPE IN THE ENTIRE

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.620
ADDRESS. IT STARTS WITH "HTTP"

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.630
I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TYPING AND THEN WHEN I AM FINISHED,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.140
I AM GOING TO HIT "CONNECT", AFTER YOU HIT "CONNECT"

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.650
I AM GOING TO HIT "CONNECT", AFTER YOU HIT "CONNECT

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.660
IT IS GOING TO CONNECT TO YOUR ISILO

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.670
PROGRAM ON YOUR IPHONE.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.690
ONCE IT DOES, YOU WILL SEE THE ISILO FOLDER

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.700
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AT THIS POINT NOW IS TO OPEN

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720
A NEW WINDOW,  A FINDER WINDOW

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.750
AND POSITION IT JUST BELOW AND THEN GO

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.760
FIND YOUR FILES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRANSFER, THE FOLDER

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.790
WITH THE FILES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRANSFER OVER

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.800
OPEN THAT FOLDER, CHOOSE THE FILES OR FILE

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.820
AND FROM HERE ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO IS 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.840
CLICK, DRAG AND RELEASE ON YOUR ISILO

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.850
FOLDER. NOTICE IT SAYS IT'S COPYING THE FILE OVER

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.860
AND THAT'S AS SIMPLE  AS IT IS. IF I OPEN

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.880
MY ISILO FOLDER ON MY PHONE

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.900
YOU WILL NOW SEE THAT FILE

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.920
THAT I JUST TRANSFERED OVER FROM MY COMPUTER

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.980
SO IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
