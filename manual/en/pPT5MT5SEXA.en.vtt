00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.980
You'll find they're more than just simple mats, bars, and beams.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.120
In fact, they're building blocks for life skills.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.160
The balance beam teaches grace and poise, and yes even balance.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.640
Parallel bars are unparalleled in their ability to sharpen focus and build self-esteem.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.300
Vaulting gives young gymnasts a running start towards skills like speed, agility, and power.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.280
Still rings help kids soar by teaching strength and control.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.000
Acrobatic gymnastics partners skill development with teamwork and confidence.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.640
The horizontal bar is a high-flying exercise in manual dexterity and precision.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.000
The uneven bars teach courage

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.440
while developing valuable traits like precision and strength.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.380
Floor exercise is a launch pad for somersaults

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.080
and a life filled with poise and self-confidence.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.500
Trampoline gives young gymnasts a jump on valuable skills

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680
like spatial awareness and control.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.680
And finally the pommel horse helps in developing

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.300
core mobility, rhythm, and timing.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.120
It's fun.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.160
Where else can kids run, jump, swing, tumble,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.260
and use all their energy in one single class period.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.500
Gymnastics develops strength.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.260
See!

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.660
I was practicing my strength training even when I was younger.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.520
It also increases flexibility.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.440
Participating in gymnastics helps develop listening skills.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.060
Gymnastics helps children build self-esteem and confidence.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.880
I remember in grade school I felt so cool

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.860
when I could do more pull-ups than all the boys.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.420
Being in gymnastics teaches you how to set and achieve goals.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.100
I remember when I was little I always wanted to be the best in the sport

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.060
and for me, making the Olympic team was just that.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.680
In 2008 when I got to travel to Beijing,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.420
I know that I had fulfilled my dream and I couldn't be happier

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.140
to be part of Team USA.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.020
Also as a graduating senior I have aspirations to attend college.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.100
Luckily I got the opportunity to get a full ride gymnastics scholarship to UCLA.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.020
And one of the best parts about gymnastics

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.440
is that it can develop skills that enhance other sports.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.480
Your child can begin building a foundation in gymnastics

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.600
and then it will allow them to go anywhere.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.820
I love all the experiences and opportunities being a gymnast has given me.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.620
Not everyone aspires to go to the Olympics,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.540
but all children love to have fun,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.540
move their bodies, and learn new skills.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.940
