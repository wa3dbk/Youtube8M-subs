All right, today on this 2008 Toyota Tundra
were going to install part number BAK126410.

All right, to start off our install well go
ahead and take the rails and well go ahead

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.680
and install them to the side of the truck.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.070
These will install on the inside edge of the
bed.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.390
Well go ahead and put it in place and we need
to push this forward as possible.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:01:02.819
Now to help hold it for us well go ahead and
use a couple of extra clamps just to hold

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:41.320
it up, then 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:57.840

00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:17.540
clamps 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:05:04.130
