00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.049
Rob's default is based on the design of the
Famicom, which was the Japanese version of

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:32.179
the NES.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:38.719
Reportedly this is what actual ROB accessories
looked like.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:47.449
Rob's secondary is a reference to the design
of the NES and Super Famicom consoles.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:56.320
Rob's third bears a close similarity to Diskun,
the mascot of the Famicom disk drive.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.620
Rob's fourth is based of the American Super
Nintendo console and the controller and other

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.210
accessories.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.810
Rob's fifth resembles his appearance in star
tropics as well as a fusion of the traditional

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.310
and black Gamecube's colors.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.040
Rob's final color is based on the minor enemy
Robs in Subspace Emissary, but also slightly

00:01:19.040 --> 00:02:01.019
resembles the design of the Nintendo 64.
