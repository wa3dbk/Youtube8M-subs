00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.830
In this clip we are going to be finishing
off our knight's outer body and we're going

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.370
to be doing that by drawing his legs. So I'm
just going to, like I said, the plan that

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.589
I kind of had originally is sort of to have
this knight in a kneeling type pose. So I'm

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.051
just going to come in and draw the outer dimensions
for what will be his legs. I'm going to come

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:22.820
down here and kind of draw one knee sort of
planted on the ground like that and the other

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.480
one coming out like this and will be resting
just along the outer side of his sword there.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.320
See how he is kind of kneeling like that.
Now what we are going to do is come in here

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.550
first off and we're going to sort of draw
the top portion of his armor, well I guess

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.280
it would be the lower portion of his armor
but the stuff that covers the upper portion

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:01.410
of his leg, lower portion of his upper armor.
We are just going to kind of make these little

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.360
protective things hanging down. A lot of guys
wore these. They look sort of like a weird

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.990
sort of skirt I know but it is really supposed
to be just another form of defense I guess.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.980
A lot of times they were made out of leather
straps and things like that and each little

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:34.650
piece had its purpose. So we will clearly
define the edges here and there we have got

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.930
that part. Now what we will do here is first
off what we'll do is define his boot and give

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:50.000
him sort of a knee guard here. We've got the
edges of his boot here and if you found that

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.460
you have run into trouble with your lines
you can always I don't know, fudge them by

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.850
making it look like you did it on purpose.
Like, and come in here and just sort of draw

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:10.069
a piece that kind of goes like that, like
that and like that and maybe like along the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.739
top, some sort of pattern. I mean you can
get as creative as you want to really but

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.840
as long as you are consistent that really
won't matter with the armor very much. Come

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:38.870
in here and draw protector bits along the
front for his feet. Armor again was very sort

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.189
of unique and strange during its days. It
had its own, each piece had its own point

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:51.629
and purpose and it was very hard to sort of
maneuver, it was absolutely necessary if you

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.859
wanted to stay alive though. And what we'll
do here is we have roughly got the shape he

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.599
wants and now we are going to come in and
do the, draw this little kneecap over here.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:17.260
We're going to come in and we're going to
draw his little foot back there. We have got

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.319
roughly the pose that we want and we'll do
the same thing we did before with the chain

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.530
mail. We are going to come through here and
we are just going to go like this all the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.689
way through and try and stay as straight as
you can. Keep like a straight line going and

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:43.639
then come right back over it the opposite
way just like that. I mean it is not the prettiest

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.439
chain mail that you have ever saw and it is
not the cleanest but it definitely gives it

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.760
that sort of square, chain mail type look
and first the earlier sketches is mostly what

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.700
these will be, like a preliminary type sketch,
that's exactly perfect. Do the same thing

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:19.650
on the other leg like so
and there you go. So at this point our knight

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.680
is very nearly fully formed and so the next
obvious step would be to come in and sort

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.610
of just touch everything up a bit. So in the
next clip we'll come in and I'll show you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.509
how to do a bit of detailing on a drawing
like this. So go ahead and move on to the

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:35.009
next clip.
