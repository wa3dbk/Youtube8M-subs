00:00:00.912 --> 00:00:02.370
JOHNATHAN MCDONALD:
What is a tuner

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.930
and why do I need
one for my Mustang?

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.775
That's a question we
hear every day here

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:09.200
at latemodelrestoration.com,
and there

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.160
are several different answers.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.360
We'll start out with
what a tuner is.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.050
Right now, the standard
in aftermarket tuning

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.100
is this right here
and it comes from SCT.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.760
Regardless of how technology
changes it in the future,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.660
the function is still
going to be the same.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.210
It connects to your
Mustang's diagnostic port,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.720
and it comes pre-loaded
with proven tunes

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.300
for several different vehicles.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.320
Most importantly, your Mustang.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.330
It also allows for
PCM diagnostics

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.990
if you have a
Check Engine light,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.670
and it'll hold
several custom tunes

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.520
like those available from
our custom tuning program.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.270
When programming
your Mustang with one

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.840
of the pre-loaded
tunes, it alters

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.950
parameters such as your air
fuel ratio and ignition timing.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.630
So why do you need
one for your Mustang?

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.510
Well, because changing
those parameters

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.870
improves efficiency and,
most importantly, horsepower.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.511
Let's say you've swapped out to
an aftermarket cold air intake

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:02.010
kit.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.910
A programmer will help
you correct for that.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.300
Changed out your rear gears,
running a different size tire?

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.640
Push a few buttons and
it's all corrected.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.620
We're going to plug this hand
held into our 2011 Mustang here

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.661
and I'm going to show you
a lot of the parameters

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:16.530
that you can change
right out of the box.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.650
Plug the tuner into your
Mustang's diagnostic port.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.390
Select Program Vehicle.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.280
You can select either
Strategy or Custom Tune.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.780
In this case, we're going to
go with the Strategy tune.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.030
Accept the terms of this being
a performance modification,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.240
turn the key on, press Select,
turn the key off, press Select,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.460
select your engine.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.670
Then you can choose to
adjust options or go straight

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.010
to downloading the tune.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.590
We're going to show you what
all options you can adjust.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.650
You can pick different
fuel octanes,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.170
you can turn off
your rear O2 sensors,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.510
you can compensate
for an aftermarket air

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.470
intake such as a Steeda,
JLT, Airaid or WMS.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.510
You can adjust your global spark
timing and different RPM bands.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.170
You can correct your
axle ratio for anywhere

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.800
from 273s all the
way up to 513s.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.400
You can adjust your tire
revolutions per mile

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.639
if you've changed out to
a different tire size.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.430
You can adjust or turn
off your speed limit.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.410
You can raise or
lower your rev limit

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.380
in both Drive and Neutral.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.510
You can raise or
lower your idle speed

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.150
in both Drive and Neutral.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.610
Once you've made all the
adjustments you care to make,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.250
hit Cancel, the
programming will begin.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.150
Turn your key on and kick
back for a few minutes

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.480
because it'll take a little
bit to download the stock tune

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.610
and upload your new
performance tune.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.660
Another little use
people really don't

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.230
think about for the speed
limit and rev limit,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.415
is if you have somebody
else driving the car,

00:02:41.415 --> 00:02:43.110
like maybe your
teenager, you can

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.050
lower the rev limiter
and the speed limiter

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.710
to keep them from getting
too far out of control.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.254
Once the tuner beeps
you can turn the key off

00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:50.920
and you're done.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.740
There you have it.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.320
It's just that simple.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.470
A few button pushes
and a few key turns,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.295
and you've got more power,
more torque, better economy,

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:01.150
and most importantly,
all of your modifications

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.030
have been adjusted for
it in your computer tune.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.160
