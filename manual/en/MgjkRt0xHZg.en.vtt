00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.899
Hi it's James here, Founder of CDNify. In this video I'm going to show you how you can implement

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.259
a CDN onto your website in under five minutes.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.160
Now we have a basic site here: Birdsong.fm,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.680
and if we look in the source code you'll
see there are numerous Javascript

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.249
CSS and images, we'll call these 'assets'.

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.779
So our assests are currently loaded from our website host which means that they

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.810
are gonna load slower

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.919
then if we hosted them on a CDN.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.210
We'll cover how to easily implement a CDN to speed everything up. Firstly we'll

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.519
need to log in to CDNify, creating an account if we haven't got one
creating accounts we haven't got one

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:37.780
already.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.940
Then we'll click on 'add a new resource', the dashboard shows because our account

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.010
is currently new

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.220
and it hasn't got any existing resources
resources

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.770
the CDN host name will be the name of
our resource this is a user friendly

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.500
URL

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.240
where the assets will be loaded from, in
this case I'm gonna use

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.450
CDN.birdsong.fm.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.580
The origin URL is normally all existing
site, the server that the files have

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.450
been uploaded to which in this case is
birdsong.fm.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.340
The CDN will then mirror the content from this existing site
from this existing sites

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.340
finally we can choose whether or not we
want SSL support, in this case we don't

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.500
require SSL so we'll leave that option
disabled. We then can click and create

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.110
the new CDN resource on our account that will create it in a few seconds.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.369
It's important to note that it can take up to
fifteen minutes for this new resource to

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.630
start functioning correctly, whilst it's provisioned across all of our network

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.060
we'll now click on 'manage', you'll notice this currently is empty

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.800
but it will begin populating with statistics
once we start using the CDN on our

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.050
website.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.710
I'd like to draw your attention to the
resource detail, here we can see the host

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.940
name we just choose

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.510
and also the cName,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.649
this is the actual resource host name on
our platform.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.860
You can use the raw host name if you
like

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.270
but we're going to create a pointer for our CDN.birdsong.fm domain in this

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.820
tutorial.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.670
Finally what we're going to do is we're going to copy the cName

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
record to our clip board because we'll need that in a minute.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.460
Now we'll head onto our web hosting account
so we can edit the DNS for our domain,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.819
this is a similar procedure across most web hosts and registrars.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.550
We have a selection of specific DNS editing tutorials available

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.789
covering most common providers.

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:21.909
So let's go ahead and editor our DNS zone,
n_s_a_

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.349
then we'll scroll down and we'll click 'add a record'.
record

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.879
The type of record should be set to CNAME.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.989
The record name in this case is CDN.birdsong.fm and so we'll set this here.

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.129
And finally the value of our record is
the CNAME in which we just copied to our

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.900
clipboard

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.549
so we'll paste this in here

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.409
and we can go ahead and click on save.

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.260
Now the DNS has been updated for our domain so now CDN.birdsong.fm

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.419
will point to a unique CDN host name.

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.569
It's important to note that sometimes
CNS changes may take awhile to start

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.099
working on all computers,

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.139
so please be patient if it doesn't work instantly!
instantly

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.219
The last step of the processes is to edit our website code.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.529
I've got the home page here in my HTML editor and we're going to update all of the assets to

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:11.669
point to the CDN

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.449
with a single click.

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.329
The file names and structure of our
files will remain exactly the same all the

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.410
CDN will do is mirror what is on our web
server

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.439
and cash it in multiple locations around
the world.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.499
The content is then served to users

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.739
from the nearest geographic location

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.299
thus making your website load lightning
fast.

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.079
To do this we're going to use find and replace,

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.079
we'll then find assets and simply pre pend our CDN host name that we just

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.189
created

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.339
so we'll replace it with HTTP://

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.090
CDN.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.310
birdsong.fm/assets and then click
replace and hey presto all of the links

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.089
have been updated.

00:03:55.089 --> 00:04:02.089
Finally we can upload our updated HTML back on to the web server.

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.580
Now if we go back into our source in
chrome and refresh this

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.379
we can see the URLs for our assets now
point to the CDN,

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.379
and if we click on a file such as jQuery
we can see that it loads the JavaScript.

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.699
All this is doing is mirroring, or pulling,

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.109
the jQuery file

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.620
it is already on our server

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.520
storing it on the CDN,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.660
this will reduce the number hits to your web server significantly

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.009
and speed up load times

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.120
for your website visitors!
