00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.720
Having a state-of-the-art data center
here at the University at Albany I think

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.720
represents a huge

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.320
opportunity, a great benefit to everybody
on campus

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.040
We have 60 to 70 scientists all conducting
atmospheric science research

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.550
and they will require considerable  amount of computer power

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.640
an important new area of research for
the Center for Technology in

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.599
government is very computer intensive
how do we think about data

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.529
as a tool for making better decisions in
government. With the help of high

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.679
performance computing in

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.640
the type of research that we do, we can simulate nucleic acids like DNA, RNA

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.370
and they make the cell function. To do this

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.530
effectively we need large amount of computer

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.010
resources. The original data center was

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.600
opened in 1968 forty-five years is a
long time to ask a data center to be viable

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.550
I think we owe a nod to the original
engineers because that design was

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.890
prescient in many ways.  Nevertheless we
found ourselves in a position where the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.210
data center and its inability to keep up

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.290
could potentially inhibit our research
initiatives.  The energy efficiency and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.130
reliability of this facility

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.010
qualify us for grants that we would not
have qualified for previously.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.530
The facility has earned some prestigious

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.159
certifications such as lead and Uptime
Institute

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.060
Tier three certification.  The facility was
designed with an eye towards reducing

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.040
duplication of efforts and creating
opportunities for organizational efficiencies.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.689
We're hoping to provide data center
facilities for Empire State College

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.110
Hudson Valley is planning to locate
their

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.470
disk to disk backup here.  We think that
the data center's designed in such a way

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.410
to optimally operate these sophisticated
atmospheric science models

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.580
When we think about our technology at CTG

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.880
it's very often a way for us to engage
with our partners

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.070
and to develop data supported solutions
or strategies

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.450
With the kind of computing resources the
data center provides us with to be able to

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.660
scale-up these calculations do it in a much more efficient way

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.090
-   A project of this magnitude takes the
collaboration of many

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.630
but we're confident that we provided a
facility of lasting value
