00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.042
I've been experimenting with
using a half-round router bit

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:17.084
to make dowels, just
by passing a board

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.375
on both sides, and I
thought I had a method

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.875
that was really foolproof
and accurate, but it's got

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.833
a slight flaw. I bought
a fancy half inch

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.375
half-round router bit
from Lee Valley,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.917
and I figure if I just put
that at the correct distance

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:32.167
to the fence, then I could
just set that up by

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:34.416
putting a half inch shaft in
here, and setting the fence

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:38.250
to that, and I just
have to pass my wood

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:41.167
through here to cut
half of it off

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.208
and then flip that over
and pass it through again

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:47.208
and I'd be guaranteed to get
a half inch wide dowel,

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.958
except that logic turns out
to be slightly faulty.

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.833
Imagine if I start with a piece
of wood that is too thick

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.958
for what I need, so once
I pass it through here,

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958
I get exactly half an inch left
here, so what I now have to do

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.167
is cut the other bit off of
there, and if I could cut it

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.667
exactly like so, that would work

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:08.833
but, the wood being too
thick, it'll actually be

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:11.750
offset a little bit, and
what I end up getting

00:01:11.792 --> 00:01:15.417
is much less than a dowel.

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:18.083
So, then I'm thinking, "Well,
maybe if I just start with

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:20.333
something that's a
tiny bit too thin,

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.125
like this piece of wood here,
but then if I cut through

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.792
here, like so, I have a
flat spot left on here,

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:29.292
and now when I pass it through
the other way around,

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:33.333
that flat spot causes the thing
to be a little bit too far away

00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:36.750
and, not only do I get a flat
spot on the other side as well,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
I get the middle part
that's, kind of, too thick

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.167
because my two router
cuts are too far apart.

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:45.041
So, the solution to make this
accurate, is to start with

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.042
a piece of stock that is
just over half and inch

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:50.084
by half an inch, and
pass it through here,

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:53.250
and you get roughly this tier

00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:55.459
And, then when you
pass it through again,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.875
this time around, without this
other piece of wood on there,

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:01.125
it bumps up against this
fence here, which makes sure

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:04.167
you're actually cutting a
half inch circle out here.

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:08.208
So, I think the solution is to
just cut sticks, and use those.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.042
So, I just made a whole bunch
of dowels with this method.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:36.916
It goes really quick.
Every once in a while

00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:40.417
there is a slight ridge that
gets left between them,

00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:43.417
and I can just remove that
with a utility knife.

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:46.167
They are fairly accurate.
They usually range from

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:50.208
about 500 thou, to up
to ten thou under.

00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:53.042
Should be good
enough for gluing.

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.250
You do need to make sure
you have decent quality

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.417
router bits for this,
though, so if we look

00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.958
at this perpendicular to the
cutting direction, so from

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958
right here, that needs to look
exactly like a semicircle.

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:09.333
With this cheap
MasterCraft bit, here,

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:12.042
if we look at it like that,
it just doesn't quite look

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:15.542
like a semicircle, this doesn't
come out all the way around.

00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:19.542
So, with this one, you just
can't make round dowels period.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:24.208
Think I have enough dowels now
to last me a good long time.
