00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.279
you know contemplating uh... what would
happen if these uh... these patent roles

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.969
are able to shut down or shows like this
one

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.959
contemplate what you would be left
listening to i really chris matthews on

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.090
them

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.710
on hard by it and see it but

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.630
uh... was quoted as saying well leon
panetta where these get you what he's

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.979
got integrity goes to church every every
day right

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.619
he's conscientious

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.839
speaking of the uh... current c_i_a_
chief

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.220
um...

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.980
if that is the what is it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.790
always defense secretary former c_i_a_
was former c_i_a_ chief a brief emily

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.860
went to church during that time as well

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.150
not at all nell and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.179
i mean i i just

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.330
uh... contemplate the the implications
of that statement

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.920
uh... regardless of whether or not you
have

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.010
issues with religion the idea that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.740
somehow we should just say i had no
worry about this duty goes to church

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.440
every day

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.210
is

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.000
but sorrow world

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.870
it's just bizarre o

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.100
that this is what uh... the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.869
liberal voices apparently is promoting
to us

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.260
don't worry about it these guys go to
church

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.479
what happens if we get someone who who
doesn't go to church and we uh... it

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.210
hobbies like a lot of still applicable

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.439
uh...

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.170
stop local start dropping meaning nukes
on pakistan iraq because the lack of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.690
churches that's the real problem

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.250
and i'll just leave them around because
they're not conscientious but haven't

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.040
your child what other well that's what
they keep control of the snack

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.150
at weeded out

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.240
are joke on twitter yesterday

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.190

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.550

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.710
way second i don't go to church and i
don't

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.730
kill people with drones

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.900
nothing makes sense anymore

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.259
and then all the sun like the albino
pots come out of nowhere

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.929
and accuse me on saying that oh obama is

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:14.869
like bush now

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.680
the interesting thing about that was it
that's obviously the process that was

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.449
going on in their those persons mocked

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.559
and they somehow

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.900

would do this

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.629
but is so she needed

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.939
the assassination of american citizens
with drones

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.909
never mind the

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.359

whatnot in general

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.379
