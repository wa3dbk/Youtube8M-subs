00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:11.700
Designing a Fighter Jet

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.950
As a young boy,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.950
my friends and I

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.700
walked back home

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.283
from school at Rameswaram.

00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:22.200
On the way,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.533
we often rested on the banks

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.617
of our village pond.

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:28.783
While my friends

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:31.117
practised skimming pebbles

00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:33.783
over the rippling water,

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:35.117
I would sit and watch

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:37.950
the cranes and seagulls

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.950
soar in the sky.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.533
The sight of those birds

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.117
inspired me

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:49.617
and I dreamt of my future.

00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:52.283
As I grew older,

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:53.867
my goal became clearer.

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:56.367
my goal became clearer.

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:58.533
I knew

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.533
I had to go into engineering

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.367
I had to go into engineering

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:04.700
to realise my dreams.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.283
The Madras Institute of Technology,

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:09.367
popularly known as MIT,

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:10.783
was the best institution for technical studies

00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:14.950
in South India.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.783
I studied hard to win a scholarship

00:01:17.783 --> 00:01:20.283
that allowed me to study

00:01:20.283 --> 00:01:24.867
in such a well-known college.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:27.200
But it wasn’t until the day

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.950
I entered MIT that I saw

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.700
my goal standing before me.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.367
The MIT campus boasted of

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:39.033
two large aircrafts

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.700
that were on display.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.533
I remember

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.117
sitting near them,

00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:47.117
long after other students

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:49.367
had gone back to the hostel.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.783
had gone back to the hostel.

00:01:52.783 --> 00:01:55.283
I was fascinated

00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:57.617
by the details of the design

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.617
and wanted someday

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:02.033
to create such an aircraft.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:03.950
to create such an aircraft.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.533
For my final project at MIT,

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.533
For my final project at MIT,

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.700
I was asked

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.700
to design a fighter jet

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.867
with a team

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:14.867
of four other classmates.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.283
of four other classmates.

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:20.367
We had distributed the work among us.

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:21.950
One day

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.533
my teacher reviewed my progress

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.200
and exclaimed,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.117
“Abdul,

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:30.367
I’m really disappointed

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:32.533
with your plan,

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.200
I had expected

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.117
much more from you.”

00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:38.450
I offered several excuses

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.450
but my teacher refused to listen.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.367
but my teacher refused to listen.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:44.033
“Sir,

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:46.450
please give me one more month,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.950
I’m sure I’ll come up with a better design,”

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.783
I pleaded with him.

00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:53.200
He looked at me

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200
and said,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.367
“Look, young man,

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:58.450
I’ll give you three days.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.450
If on Monday morning

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.950
you fail to show me a better design,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.950
you fail to show me a better design,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.867
I’m afraid your scholarship

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:09.117
will be cancelled.”

00:03:09.117 --> 00:03:11.617
I was speechless.

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:14.617
The scholarship was my lifeline.

00:03:14.617 --> 00:03:16.700
The scholarship was my lifeline.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.033
Without it,

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:20.950
I would be helpless.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.117
I had no choice

00:03:22.117 --> 00:03:24.700
but to keep on working.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.117
but to keep on working.

00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:28.283
That night I remained awake all night

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:32.533
toiling on the project.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:33.950
The next morning

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.783
I just took an hour’s break,

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.867
ate very little

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:42.033
and went back to work.

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:43.700
On Sunday morning,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.283
I had almost completed the task

00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:48.867
when I suddenly felt

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:52.533
a presence behind me.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:54.450
I turned around to discover

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.533
my teacher peering at my drawing.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:00.283
my teacher peering at my drawing.

00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:01.617
After examining my work,

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:04.200
After examining my work,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.533
he patted me on my back and said,

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:08.700
“I knew

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.033
I was putting you under stress

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:13.033
by asking you to meet

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:15.367
an impossible deadline.

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:16.200
I never expected you

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.450
to perform so well!”

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.700
to perform so well!”

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.700
I had hardly slept or eaten

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.533
in the past three days,

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:27.700
but I now felt

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.617
a huge sense of joy

00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:31.617
and relief.

00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:34.867
and relief.

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:37.117
and relief.

00:04:37.117 --> 00:04:38.950
Not only did I keep

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.033
my scholarship,

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:40.533
I also graduated from MIT

00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:42.867
I also graduated from MIT

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:44.283
with outstanding marks.

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:47.783
with outstanding marks.

00:04:47.783 --> 00:04:50.867
I had already accomplished my goal

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:52.450
of successfully designing an aircraft

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.283
and now

00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:56.867
I was drawing close

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:58.450
to my dream

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.783
of flying one too.

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:02.367
It was amazing to think

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:04.617
It was amazing to think

00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:05.867
that just like the seagulls

00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:07.867
I had observed as a child,

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:09.617
I would soon

00:05:09.617 --> 00:05:13.200
soar in the sky.
