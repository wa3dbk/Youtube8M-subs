00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.765
Who wants to have a jet pack to fly around with?

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:05.334
Me!

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:11.385
Who wants to have special robot legs that make you go faster?

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:14.519
No? You don't want that?

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.206
Only Zachary wants that?

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:18.893
I want that.

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:22.467
Who would want another eye?

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:27.584
Oh yeah, I want three eyes in the back of my head, but they're covered in hair.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.049
What do you think humans need to improve them?

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:37.845
Claudia Mitchell has become the world's first true bionic woman--

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:39.701
--we're already part artificial, aren't we?

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:42.863
--implants to release drugs when and where you need them in your body--

00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:46.079
Is the quest for a perfect baby morally wrong?

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.299
The man known as the Blade Runner: a sprinter, who with the help of artificial legs had hopes

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.384
of competing in this summer's Olympic Games.

00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:56.423
--it will redefine the field--

00:00:56.423 --> 00:01:00.033
We're used to a certain amount of artificiality but this is taking it to a whole new level

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.265
--it's happening now.

00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:06.957
What does it mean when you can augment the mind, if you can improve memory?

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:09.068
What does it mean if you could augment the body?

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:13.269
There have been so many advances even in the past few years, that

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:19.491
people are aware, more aware at least, how quickly the technologies are moving.

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:24.066
Us humans, especially us baby boomers, are really gonna want augmentation pretty soon

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.574
as we start to decay, we're gonna be demanding more and more augmentation.

00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:31.997
I'd like to have a better memory.

00:01:31.997 --> 00:01:34.308
Maybe with-- memory chips, or something.

00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:37.139
I'd probably want to be taller so I could play for the NBA.

00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:40.284
Well I just turned fifty so memory is sort of an issue.

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:43.669
I'm happy who I am.

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.580
I actually don't need anything.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.629
I mean, if i could fly maybe it would be okay.

00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:01.406
Am I disabled?

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:03.866
That depends which definition we use.

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.398
Of course I'm a disabled person.

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:10.259
Do I see myself as an impaired person? No.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:13.264
I'm just who I am.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.765
There's all kinds of dynamics which go around this obsession with ability and competitiveness,

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:24.650
and that the only way to get respect is if you show you are superior to someone else.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.377
Ableism is our obsession with certain abilities and 

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:35.543
the accompanying negative treatment of people who don't have these kinds of abilities.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.112
Human enhancement is no different than human.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.501
Everything from brain implants to spinal cord injury rehab to cell phones to gaming: 

00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:56.081
there is no difference between them.

00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:59.762
What if this kind of collaboration with a machine

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:03.512
was flexible enough to allow the user to do whatever they want with it?

00:03:03.512 --> 00:03:07.524
You want to make a device that has

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:12.232
a sophisticated enough collaboration that that human will make it an arm,

00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:14.448
in their own way, in their own image.

00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:20.145
I really don't understand the desire for enhancement technologies-- we don't have basic healthcare,

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:22.274
not only in this country but globally.

00:03:28.182 --> 00:03:31.835
Preventable diseases are number one killers globally.

00:03:31.835 --> 00:03:34.928
Talk about misplaced priorities.

00:03:34.928 --> 00:03:38.360
It is this huge irony that's more than a little frustrating the way that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.887
all the research money goes into emerging technologies as opposed to wheelchairs that are waterproof?

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:47.531
That demonstrates the financial priorities of the healthcare system.

00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:53.983
Wheelchairs are amazing, and that's really precious and at the same time it's a machine.

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:59.979
You know, I'm subject to its frailties.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.121
You know, like any machine. 

00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:04.762
So it makes me feel pretty vulnerable. 

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.013
(Where are the hand controls?)

00:04:09.013 --> 00:04:11.101
(Daddy, here are the hand controls.)

00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:15.384
People should think of disability as another human experience

00:04:15.384 --> 00:04:16.908
(Alright, ready?)

00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:23.322
that embodies qualities of human adaptability

00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:28.276
that are common to all people, whether they have a specific disability or not,

00:04:28.276 --> 00:04:33.915
and the experiences of people with disabilities have lessons for the population at large.

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:36.381
Technologies that help bring people up to normal

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:38.639
are used to help people go beyond normal.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.044
Often when I talk about implants to people,

00:04:41.044 --> 00:04:42.949
they say "Oh that's too icky.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.158
No one would do that willingly, no one would have a cochlear implant

00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:48.298
if they weren't deaf, if they didn't need it.

00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:51.908
No one would have a visual implant if they didn't need it."

00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:59.737
And I say to them: Botox. People will do anything to their bodies for enhancement, social enhancement.

00:05:00.262 --> 00:05:03.568
If you force me to see myself as deficient, 

00:05:03.568 --> 00:05:06.865
and you want me to enhance myself to your level,

00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:12.542
then I of course will say no, I go further, and then you are deficient because I outdo you.

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:17.094
I mean, why would I want to have legs which only get me to your level?

00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:22.191
Every line we draw will be transgressed in the next

00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:24.598
ten, twenty, thirty, fifty years,

00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:31.743
and we are gonna see more and more augmentations, alterations of our bodies as the technologies develop.

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:39.011
These technologies assume that human variation along a spectrum of ability 

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:41.527
should be eliminated.

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:45.556
We have these technological developments, they're not inevitable,

00:05:45.556 --> 00:05:51.372
but they do have a lot of momentum behind them, and so we at this point in human history

00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:57.236
we're at this moment where it's our responsibility to really look at them carefully,

00:05:57.236 --> 00:05:59.634
and really make decisions.
