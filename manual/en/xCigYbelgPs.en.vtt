00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.930
This is a triple chain bracelet tutorial by Rachel Murgatroyd

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.019
And this is part three, It's what I like to call the 'Shrek' chain

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:10.870
you'll see why

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.729
If you were to do part one two and three this is what you would 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:18.239
end up with, which would be a duel chain bracelet

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.210
right

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.580
now the materials, obviously dependent on how long you are making the bracelet.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.610
I used

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.740
Seven

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.759
uh... eight

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.069
by five-millimeter amethyst briolettes.  And I used eight

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.970
4mm swarovski bi-cones

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.520
and about thirty inches of twenty six gauge round wire which is 75cm of 0.4mill wire

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.680
Tools....Just like the other one I used round nose pliers some snipe or chain nose pliers, snips

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.830
and a marker pen

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.750
okay so we have marked our pliers, like we did in part two

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.820
and i have gripped my

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.010
wire

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.690
without about three quarters of an inch to one side

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.920
on where I have marked the pliers, wrap around

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.670
over the mark

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.040
giving us a nice loop that is going to be a uniform size throughout the bracelet

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.520
I've wrapped around three times

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.840
and once I have got that then what I'll do is trim that off and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.780
use my snipe or chain nose pliers to flatten down any ends

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.240
When we thread the bead on this time, instead of pushing it right upto the end.  

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.840
I am leaving a bit of wire, I have it nestled in my fingers so it stays put

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.510
and then I bring the wire that we pushed through across the front

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.050
of the briolette and slightly downwards

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.560
so that when I wrap around, can you see how I've gone underneath the wire that is sticking out

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.640
the bit that has got the loop on

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.770
That shows it from the top

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.960
but what I'm going to do now is wrap
around and around

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.440
the top of  the briolette, I've gone around four times

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.870
so my wire is coming to the side and I'm going to make, erm....another loop

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.540
there you can see how

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.490
that wire, is coming around the right hand side downwards

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.659
grip it in my round nose pliers

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.009
on your mark

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.179
but can you see I have a little gap? I have a piece of wire that sticks out

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.939
as I make the circle 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.189
I want the two sides to be even

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.230
so it needs

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.329
about the same distance away from the stone, as the other side

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.799
I've done about three shots of that all from
different angles to try and show you

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.329
exactly what i'm doing

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.919
and then I am going to wrap around three times

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:41.089
now I am going to show you this from another angle

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:45.960
top of the bay let and now want deflect
comeback crammed anthony

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.469
