00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.030
Hi there, guys! This is Joel Kennedy with
Kennedy Violins, and today I wanted to do

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.100
a video about how to replace a fine tuner.
Now, it's a pretty simple operation. Here

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.260
at Kennedy Violins we perform this operation
thousands of time a year because when you

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.000
order a violin from us, we customize the violin
to your liking whether you want built-in fine

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.599
tuners or independent fine tuners.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.170
But if you're not used to replacing fine tuners,
it can be a little daunting, a little but

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.079
scary because you're afraid you're going to
break your violin or whatnot. So I'll just

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.690
show you guys really quick how to do it and
you'll see how easy it is.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.600
Now there are a lot of reasons why a person
might want to replace a fine tuner. One is

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.609
because it may be malfunctioning, or maybe
let's say they have four fine tuners and they

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:59.239
want to just have one fine tuner on the E,
so they might want to take off these.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.840
But I think the easiest thing, if you're not
familiar with taking a violin apart, probably

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.980
the best thing for you, the best rule of thumb,
is just do one string at a time. Now, if it

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.080
was me, I would disassemble the whole violin
and then reassemble it with the amount of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.000
fine tuners that I want, if I want to remove
three of them or whatever. But that requires

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.840
a little more experience and you can run into
some issues if you do that. I am going to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.960
do a video on that, but for the purpose of
this video I'm just going to show you the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.970
quick and easy way to do it just one string
at a time so it's as easy as possible.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.030
So here I have a violin. Let's pretend this
fine tuner is stripped out. It doesn't work.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.970
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
just going to loosen the E string so the ball

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.470
is nice and loose, and I'm going to pull it
out and let it go. And then there are two

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.390
parts that you have to be concerned about.
One is you have the screw portion here, then

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.000
you have a nut. Those are both threaded items
that you'll be dealing with. So this screw

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.770
portion, I'm just going to turn it counter-clockwise,
which is left. "Lefty loosey, righty tighty,"

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.720
I think that's what they say. And that comes
out pretty easy. And then I'm going to loosen

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.560
this nut right here, again, counter-clockwise.
Turn it left to loosen it. And I usually use

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.760
this kind of plier. You don't need this kind
of plier, obviously. You can use any kind

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.660
of plier. These are easy to use because they
have a little bit of angle to them. Now your

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.450
fine tuner might be loose so you don't need
a pair of pliers. But I do use a pair of pliers

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.530
to tighten the nut at the very least to make
sure they're nice and tight.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.420
So I'm just going to get this and turn it.
There you go. Now I can get the rest with

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:53.020
my fingers. Now I'm just going to loosen that
little guy. Turn that counterclockwise, and

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.860
there it is. Now we've got to pull this out.
So you want to gently lift your tailpiece

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.280
to kind of give you some clearance so you
don't scratch the top of your violin, and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.780
I'm going to lower it out of the hole and
pull it out.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.890
So here it is again. You're just putting it
in and you're just taking it out. It's about

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.390
that simple. So that's removing the fine tuner.
Now I'm going to show you how to put it back

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.040
in. So we've removed the offending fine tuner
and now we're going to put the good one in.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.730
So again, we lift the tailpiece just a tiny
little bit and we insert it in the hole. And

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.319
now we're going to get our nut, that little
nut, and we're going to turn it clockwise.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:39.860
We're going to turn it to the right and tighten
it. And this is going to make this fine tuner

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.459
tight with your tailpiece so it doesn't buzz
and move around. So I'm going to get it finger

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.400
tight, then I'm going to use my pliers. Now
the pliers are a little dangerous if you really

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.160
reef on it you're going to break your tailpiece.
So you have to be careful if you do decide

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.580
to use pliers.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.140
So the general rule is about a quarter turn
after finger tight, about a quarter turn and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.590
that's all you have to do. Maybe a third turn
at the most depending on how tight you got

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.680
it when you did it finger tight. But if you
do it any more you risk cracking your tailpiece

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.349
and then you get to buy a new tailpiece. So
no more than a quarter turn. And you want

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.970
it nice and snug because if it's not, it will
get loose in the near future and it will buzz

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.459
and rattle while you're playing, and you don't
want that. So that's why we always make sure

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.440
it's plenty tight so your violin will sound
the best it possibly can.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.380
Good. So we have our little arm in, so now
we're going to stick the string back on and

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.900
get the ball. Stick the ball in there and
now we're going to tighten the string. And

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.060
if you've watched any of my videos on how
to replace strings, you'll know that the best

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.100
way to put a string on the peg so the peg
doesn't slip is by directing the string over

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.820
towards the peg that you're turning so it
winds against the side of the scrollbox. So

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.970
I'm going to push the peg in gently while
I turn it and direct that string over so it's

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.030
tight against the scrollbox, and this is going
to prevent that peg from slipping from rewinding

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.750
after I get it tight. So I make sure the string
is in the nut and make sure it's int he notch

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.530
of the bridge and now it's kind of medium
tight.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.550
So I'm going to take that little piece of
plastic there. Not all violins have this on

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.340
the E string but many do. So you're going
to lift the E string a little bit and get

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:38.590
it on that bridge and then I'm going to tighten
it basically to pitch and I'm going to stick

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.889
that screw back in. So I'm going to put that
in the violin and you tighten it. Now if you

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.720
just stick it in there, it's not going to
fall out, but the problem is [rattling sound]

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.889
here that noise? It's loose so it buzzes around.
It's pretty annoying while you're playing

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.810
and you hear that buzz. So you want to tighten
the fine tuner down at least so it's a little

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.979
bit tight. You'll feel the resistance once
you get there. So now it doesn't buzz. So

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:13.580
now you're free to use your fine tuner and
you're good!

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.840
So I hope that helps out some of you guys
who want to replace your fine tuners. And
