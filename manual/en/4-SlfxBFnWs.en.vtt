KIP BRADFORD: Hi, my name's Kip and I'm here
on behalf of Expert Village. Today, we're

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.810
taking a close look at used acoustic guitars,
primarily to determine whether or not it's

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.650
worth purchasing and with the idea of something
that is playable and we can learn on. We've

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.320
taken a look at the bridge and determine that
the bridge on the instrument we're looking

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.640
at actually does not have enough glue or the
bridge's beginning to lift from the sound

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.760
board. The next thing that I'll do is take
a look at the fret board itself and see what

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.609
kind of condition that's in. Now, the fret
board is glued to the neck. This is the neck

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:44.609
and this is the fret board. The fret board
is often times Rosewood or Ebony or some kind

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:51.329
of hardwood whereas the neck itself could
be Mahogany or whatever wood they chose to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.770
use. It can, being says as glued, there again,
if it gets hot and it's not properly cooled

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.790
and all of that kind of stuff, then the fret
board may begin to lift. So you want to take

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.979
and look very carefully all the way up and
down both sides where the binding and the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.909
neck portion come together and see if there's
any cracking, anything that's lifting there.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.659
You also want to look at the condition of
the fret board. This one again is very dry

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.439
just like the bridge was, so lemon oil would
be in order to condition the neck or the fret

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.979
board and keep it from cracking, but being
said it's so dry, you want to look and look

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.500
to see if there's any s--places where the--there
is cracking in the grain. Also, look very

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.409
carefully especially up in the playing position,
the first playing position which is up near

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.399
the headstock, near the nut and look at each
fret and run your fingers along, then see

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.299
if you feel any burst, any pitting, excessive
wear. A fret job on a guitar can be a couple

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.219
of $100, so if they wore out and the instrument
is $20 at a garage sale, it's not worth buying

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.480
if you want something that's very playable.
Now, that's a full fret job milling in the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.140
whole bit. If you have one or two frets that
just needs a little attention, you can have

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.970
those taken care of individually, but if this
lots of wear, then you might want to avoid

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.000
the instrument.
