Hi Today id like to answer the question we
get asked many many time’s what is the difference

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.029
between eighty series 80 and seventy one series
71 series staples?

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:18.330
Well quite frankly there’s not a great deal
of difference there both fine wire and there

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.359
both mainly used in the upholstery trade ur…
there are other uses of course but mainly

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.890
used in the upholstery trade, the ones at
the top here that’s an eighty series strip

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.780
of staples and there’s a sample staple there
and seventy one series with a seventy one

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.200
series staple their.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.930
Now both staples on this display are twelve
mm in leg length, there’s the eighty series

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.020
as you can see twelve mm, now as you can see
it’s a galvanised finish, it’s a strip

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.800
staple, if I turn it side on hopefully you
will be able to get some view of the crown

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.940
there and conversely if I show the seventy
one series again this is a twelve mm leg length

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.150
and if I just turn it side on you can see
the crown and what I’m going to do there

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.320
is actually put them side by side eighty series
to the right seventy one series to the left,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.830
now as you can see that’s were the major
difference is there, the eighty series on

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.200
the right has a crown with of twelve point
eight mm and the seventy one series on the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.040
left has a crown width of nine mm and that’s
the main difference between the two staples.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.030
Now there’s the staples there as you can
see they come in variable leg lengths, they

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.790
start at a leg length of four mm and go right
the way through to sixteen mm, a common size

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.720
mainly used in the upholstery trade is either
ten or twelve mm, also when attaching breathable

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.860
membrane in buildings again ten, twelve mm
tends to be the standard size but of course

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.250

supply you four mm right the way through to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.990
