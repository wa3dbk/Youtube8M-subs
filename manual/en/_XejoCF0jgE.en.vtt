Hello League of Legends Players 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.840
Today I'm going to show
you how to change your locale

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.740
On your LoL patcher client

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.940
Since the new patch the old way isn't working any longer

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.520
and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.395
Here's how I did it

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.420
Now, right now i reset it back to what it
used to be

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.880
and under here you can't hit English

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.320
Um, uhh all the east coast players that want to play this game in english, I understand completely

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.140
So, let's get this started

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.880
First what you want to do is you want to close out of League entirely

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.200
and um, I had a sticky note here's a path to the file

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.560
But, I'll do it through the C:\ drive as well just in case you don't want to type that in

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.540
You want to go to C:\

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.760
Riot Games

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.140
League of Legends of course

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.340
RADS

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:07.594
Projects

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.440
LoL Patcher

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.460
And under managed files, The first file is 0.0.0

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.960
.0 (Late haha)

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.800
On this screen, you know it gets a little messy just hit R. It should bring you right to regions

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.760
Alright, from here

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.700
Well, really any, um, any loacle you want

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.940
But, right now I'm just going to do english

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.160
And copy this little character (took me forever to think of that word)

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.400
Take it over to, if you're on LAN, it's La1

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.360
and if you're on LAS it's La2

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.340
bring

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.860
English down here

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.800
it's very important that you put the
comma afterwards

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.240
Then you just hit save

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.800
Close ouf of all this and start League of Legends back up

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.340
Since LAN's default language is spanish, just bring this up. English should be right here.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.020
Thanks guys.
