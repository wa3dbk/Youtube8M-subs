Greetings, today I'm going to be showing you
guys how I style my hair on pretty much an

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.329
everyday bae, basis. Oh my god, if you
don't know already I have a sweatshirt that

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:20.120
says Everyday Bae on it. If you follow me
on Snapchat and/or have seen my vlogs you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.770
know about that sweatshirt and I'm kind of
obsessed with it. Anyway, this is how I style

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.350
my hair on a daily basis, and I have pretty
fine, flat hair and I also have my hair cut

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.260
into a long bob which has actually become very
trendy in the last year. It's an awesome cut.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.569
You can do so much with it and this is how
I style mine everyday. And I got flat hair,

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:47.300
girl. So, I'm going to show you how you can
get texture and volume in your hair, and also

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.269
how you can be an everyday bae. That's not how
people do it. You know what I'm trying to

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.799
do. Okay, let's get this started already.
So, I'm starting off with wet hair and I'm

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.889
going to be using the Dove Oxygen Moisture
Root Lift Spray. You can actually use this

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:07.300
in damp or dry hair and it provides all day
lift at the roots where your hair can tend

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.250
to fall flat. I know that's where my problems start. And then I'm going to blow dry it and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.910
when I want a ton of volume what I'll do is
I'll actually brush my hair in the opposite

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.300
direction of my part, so then I can blow dry
it and that's going to create a ton of volume

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.400
so when I flip my hair over, I'm going to have
way more volume than I normally would.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.520
When my hair is dry, I part my hair. I use a bobby
pin for this because I just like using bobby

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.670
pins to part my hair. It's just what I do.
Now, to curl my hair I like using a 19 mm

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.270
clipless wand. I think this is a great size
for creating texture without being too loose

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.300
or too tight, and I don't leave it on the
wand for very long. I let it go pretty quickly

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.800
and I like to leave the ends out too so you
have more of that deconstructed look. I love

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.090
hairstyles that are a little bit more undone
and as the day goes on you'll still have

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.870
that volume, but you're not going to have
a tight ringlet curls.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.200
Now, to get a lot of volume I discovered that
if I alternate the direction of my curls it

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.870
really helps. It not only provides more volume,
but it just adds more dimension to the look

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:35.160
as well and doesn't look so perfect or
put together. And to finish everything up,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.980
I am using the TRESemmÃ© Keratin Smooth Illuminating
Shine Spray. This is a lightweight spray that

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.300
helps condition your hair and adds shine
while leaving it really smooth.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.330
And that's it, as you can see, super easy to do and this
is how it looks almost every single day, every

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.940
day bae's. Yeah. Btdubs, in case
you guys are wondering my first rap single

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.060
is going to be dropping very soon and it is
called Bae Is A Lifestyle. I also hope you guys

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.900
know that I use this jokingly, but also seriously.
It's like a serious joke. Alright, that is

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.510
how I style my hair pretty much every day.
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.480
you try out this style yourself, or something
similar, or if you even just cut your hair

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.420
into a long bob, I want to see your photos
on Twitter and Instagram and make sure you

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.140
are subscribed to the All Things Hair US Youtube
Channel for even more hair tips and tutorials

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.580
from me and my friends. I'm going to peace
out now. Goodbye, double peace out.
