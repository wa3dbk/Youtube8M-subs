00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:07.150
The next technique we're going to do is a
goddess braid; a goddess braid is a large

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:22.310
inverted corn-row with hair added, you can
also do it without hair added. Goddess braids

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.609
are parted just like corn-rows but usually
they're much larger giving it more of a crown

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:43.149
effect and wraps around the head, and gives
it a thick crown effect usually; thus calling

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:50.170
it the goddess braid. The technique for this
is the same as a corn-row but we're going

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:58.809
to do an inverted corn-row instead of braiding
out we're going to braid in; it's an inverted

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:14.790
corn-row. Using a very large section of hair
because you want the hair basically; the size

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.189
of the braid to be as large as the part so
you want to add a lot of hair for the goddess

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:34.159
braid, to make a very thick braid. So on this
technique, to add the hair first you want

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:45.310
to section it into a small part in the very
front like that then you want to lay the hair

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.409
that you're using in between that hair like
that and you basically want to; there's twp

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:02.549
techniques to this, one you can take this
hair; add a little of her hair from behind

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:11.960
and make a small braid to hold the hair on.
This is a real easy technique to holding it

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.440
on; you could do that, just braid it a little
bit so it can hold it then separating it off

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.080
into your three strands using some of the
hair from all three pieces and the synthetic

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.110
hair that you add or human hair; dividing
it into three sections just like the regular

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:44.160
basic braid, 1 2 3 and start crossing over
bringing it to the middle and bringing the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:56.670
middle to the right; crossing the left side
over to the middle grabbing the hair behind

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.750
it so you can make it a chain-link just like
other corn-rows and bringing it to the middle,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:15.090
bring this over to the middle; over to the
middle and then middle to the side. It's the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.950
same as doing a regular corn-row but you're
going over hand like the overhand braid and

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:31.730
you're using a lot more hair to make a thick
corn-row. So basically these are thick inverted

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.080
corn-rows; adding the different color hair
makes it look real interesting like you just

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.970
had highlights, it looks really cool; you
have to make sure when you're doing goddess

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.690
braids because the parts are so thick that
you keep the hair detangled that you're working

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.070
with, sometimes you might have to stop and
comb it out a little bit depending on if it's

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:01.180
wet or dry. I like braiding hair wet because
it tends to tighten up and look smoother but

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.350
I can braid dry or wet; doesn't matter and,
and depending on the style would determine

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.380
whether you want the hair to be wet or dry.
