00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.574
- Hey guys, Scott here for
another Headcanon video.

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.250
We are cranking these things out

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.880
and today I want to talk to
you about color in comic books.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.830
The different ways that people use color

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.960
to represent different things
in characters and costumes

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.890
and also the debate about

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.750
black and white versus color comic books.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.960
I want to start out with something

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.830
that Scott McCloud says in
his book Understanding Comics.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.250
He has a very short chapter
about color inside of here

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.390
and one of the things he says is that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.619
for superhero comic books specifically,

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:40.050
color has been a way that helps
make characters more iconic.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.050
So that you know, you
can see this color pallet

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.470
and instantly know, oh, that's Superman.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.072
Oh, that's Captain America.

00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:51.460
That's Batman, obviously.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.577
You see this a lot,

00:00:52.577 --> 00:00:54.390
there have been tests
all around the internet

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.800
where people just put
like stripes of color

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.531
and you can just identify
what cartoon character

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:02.622
or comic book character
it is just based off

00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:05.920
the color without any shape
or form or anything like that.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.880
That's something that's
really interesting to me

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.010
and also just learning about
the psychology of color

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.970
and how it affects us and our minds

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.680
and how it maybe plays
tricks on us as well

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.576
and influences us in different ways.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.250
And also kind of represents
a little bit of a shorthand

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.870
in terms of visual storytelling.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.081
So there was an infographic
that my friend Ricky

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:28.050
pointed me to about colors in comics

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.420
where, that I'll link to
in the description below

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.970
if you want to check it out.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.390
And something they do is they break down

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.180
specific colors inside of comics

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.430
mostly referencing superhero comics

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.630
specifically Marvel and DC.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.300
And so they do talk about specific colors

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.210
upfront with things like
how blues and bright reds

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.510
represent things like ultimate heroes.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.210
Greens and browns represent a hero

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.560
that is connected with nature.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.710
With brown also doubling as
a way to show a retired hero.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.170
Again these are costume colors.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.810
So obviously pink for women
was a very easy shorthand

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.791
to do in create female
comic book characters.

00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:14.220
Gray was for old wise
mentors and the list goes on.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.200
Blacks and blood reds
represent villains heavily.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.960
Purple is kind of like
a poisonous character.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.890
Dark blue is for like
a cold blooded bad guy.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.340
Something that is kind of interesting

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.560
that this infographic pointed out to me

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.324
is the use of primary
versus secondary colors

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:35.159
in comic book character costumes.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.390
So for example, heroes are largely

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.390
portrayed in primary color costumes.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.130
You look at someone like Superman

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.430
and he is decked out in
red and blue and yellow.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.250
The three primary colors
and he's got them all.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.260
And he is like the biggest superhero

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.590
that there is on the planet.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.865
And you look at other characters as well.

00:02:56.865 --> 00:02:59.340
Spider-Man, he's got the red and blue.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.584
Iron Man, he's got the red and yellow.

00:03:01.584 --> 00:03:06.584
Captain America, the list
literally can go on forever.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.880
And you can turn it around as well

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.404
and show off some secondary
colors for villains.

00:03:12.404 --> 00:03:14.710
So for example Lex
Luthor is kind of famous

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.170
for his green and purple suits.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.910
Someone like Green Goblin as well.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.329
Green and purple, orange pumpkin bombs.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.120
Hobgoblin for the orange
thrown in there as well.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.680
Again, this is like a list
that can go on forever

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.350
of villains dressed in
greens, purples, and oranges

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.237
and you might think to yourself

00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:36.590
well there are obviously
some exceptions here.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.350
Hulk for example, famous for being

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.240
green with the purple pants.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.630
He's not a villain.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.890
Well you could also argue
that he is a monster

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.510
and he is dangerous
kind of like a villain.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.250
Someone like Hawkeye who
dresses in a purple uniform.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.300
He had a past as a villain
but now he's reformed

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.250
but he still holds onto
that purple uniform as well

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.470
to kind of signify his past
a little bit as a villain.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.670
Again, this isn't things
that are exclusively stated

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.850
in the comics, at least
I don't think they are.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.840
But it's just kind of a
way to psychologically

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.390
get you in the zone, and be like

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.470
"Hey, by the way, here are
familiar color pallets."

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.100
Obviously you know that this guy

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.920
is a villain or had a troubled past.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.619
Obviously you know this guy
is a brave and bold hero.

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:27.450
Just based off of the
colors and stuff like that.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.050
So I'd love to discuss
with you in the comments

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.380
some other interesting things that

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.890
you see comics doing with colors.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.140
X-Men for example.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.800
Blue and yellow, there's
another one for you.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.840
Primary colors representing the good guys.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.880
Magneto has like a little bit of the red

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.460
plus the purple which is
primary plus secondary

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.930
so maybe it's signifying
that he is a villain

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.810
but he has good intentions.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.100
I don't know, these are just things

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.130
that I'm thinking of
off the top of my head.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.220
But I do want to talk to
you a little bit about

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.786
color in comics versus
black and white comics.

00:04:59.786 --> 00:05:03.340
Because there's this idea
that black and white comics

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.210
take a little bit longer to read

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.100
and because of that are a
little bit more reflective.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.100
You get to slow down and
enjoy the story for what it is

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.078
instead of just the
bright visuals of color

00:05:15.078 --> 00:05:17.284
and I think there are merits to both.

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:19.750
But something like Walking Dead

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.060
is famous for having
black and white comics.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.490
Scott Pilgrim was released
in black and white

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.000
and then later released in color.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.720
I've only read them in color

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.090
so I'm actually really curious to know

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.825
if anyone out there has read them

00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:33.510
in both black and white and color

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.890
and if that has changed
your experience at all.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.510
Whether the black and white
really did make you slow down

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.000
and appreciate the art and
whether or not the color

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.040
was a distraction or if it
enhanced the story at all.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.560
I know Scott McCloud talks about how

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.039
color can be really distracting

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.300
and it can objectify pictures instead of,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.579
you know, the art speaking for itself.

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:02.760
It kind of gets in the way.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.890
That's kind of what I took
away from his chapter anyway.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.784
Well that's just if it's used incorrectly

00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:10.540
and just kind of thrown
in there willy nilly

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.710
with no real purpose, so
maybe that's another question.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.920
Do you think there needs
to be a purpose for color

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.640
or if color should just be in there

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.800
because it helps us see
comics as more realistic

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.800
because our real world is in color anyway

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.950
so why shouldn't comics?

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.697
So there you go.

00:06:26.697 --> 00:06:28.577
A lot of thoughts about comics and color.

00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:30.630
Let me know about your
thoughts in the comments below.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.050
I'm super excited about
talking with you guys

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.970
about this topic because it
is one of my favorite things

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.996
to discuss on just the concept of colors

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:41.080
and how it can impact our minds

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.920
and how we see things.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.840
So I will look forward to
reading your comments down there.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.460
And if this is your first
time hanging out with us

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.380
here at Nerd Sync, we do
weekly comic book videos

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.050
that are usually a little
bit different than this one.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.930
We are on a bit of a hiatus right now

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.380
so we're experimenting
with some other video types

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.100
that are a little bit easier
and quicker to throw together

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.026
as I get moved into my new apartment.

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:04.970
As well as just revamp
the show for the future.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.510
So make sure you subscribe
so you don't miss out

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.260
on any exciting new videos that
will be coming out very soon

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.000
and once again I'm Scott.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.050
I will see you guys right here next week.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.560
See you!
