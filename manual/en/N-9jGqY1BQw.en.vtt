00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.680
Powder skiing, it's really the Holy Grail 
for a lot of recreational skiers.  

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.369
The idea of coming down a perfectly 
virgin field with snow flying everywhere 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.000
it's a lot of peoples dreams. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.460
But the reality is if you've got a 
problem coming down a blue run

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.689
it's going to be amplified 
when you're off piste. 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.019
Linking those turns together is really key

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.989
and not getting too built up physiologically
that it's a massively different thing

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.189
between that and skiing down a piste.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.490
Good smooth linking of the turns 
and a positive flow.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.000
It's a lot to do with rhythm.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.900
Link the turns together with no hesitation.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.870
A good pole plant will help you 
keep the rhythm going. 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.090
Remember what we learnt on the piste; 
no dead spot, no tea break between the turns.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.220
There is always something happening. 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.220
Relax and enjoy it

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.109
The best way to build confidence skiing powder 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.870
is on the piste after a fresh snowfall.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.710
Start linking the turns down the run 
with no hesitation. 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.000
The first few runs will give you a gentle 
introduction to the feeling of powder.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
Above all be confident.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.119
If you're in a resort when it snows over night

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.399
make sure you're on the first lift,

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.550
as it will soon get tracked out.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.660
Something to watch out for is trying to 
throw the skis around far too quickly.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.919
You're coming into the turn and you're 
going to do it all in one big movement.

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:33.590
If you put too much weight onto that new ski, 
the downhill ski, in one go

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.540
it's going to dig in and you're going to feel 
like you're thrown over the handlebars.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.120
It's got to start nice and smooth, 
let the skis point downhill

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.990
and gradually build up that pressure change, 
nothing is too fast. 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.880
Let the skis work through this deeper snow. 
Get that control.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.190
Keep the distractions to a minimum

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.690
No rocks, no trees, a nice simple slope

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.820
so you can just focus on what you're doing. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880
Skiing powder feels great 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.560
but if you can get some of these exercises 
on the piste, a nice smooth fluid turn,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.550
good strong pole plant, that's 
going to go a long way to help you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.729
get some of those turns mastered 
when the snow's a bit deeper. 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.700
You'll be amazed once you link some turns together 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.900
how much more self-confidence you have

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.109
and that's going to go a long way 
to help you ski off piste.
