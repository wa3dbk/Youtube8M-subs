00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.140
Hey guys.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.960
So, apparently you want me to talk

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.540
in my nail art videos.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.040
Which,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.300
I don't really know why?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.780
'Cause, personally when I watch nail art tutorials,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.020
and people are talking,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.200
it's really annoying.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.320
And I just kinda really want to tell them to shut up

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.060
and just show me the nail art already!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.960
So in my ugly pink,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.560
I mean,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.780
pretty pink leopard nails

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.180
I did not to long ago.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.080
I included a little bit on

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.340
choosing the right white nail polish.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.540
So I'll just show you guys again.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.580
So you know how a lot of white nail polish

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.600
is really milky?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.620
Yeah.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.020
This is what you don't want.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.780
You want creamy nice white nail polish,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.240
like this one on the right.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360
The easiest way to find this nail polish

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.000
without searching through hundreds of different companies

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.300
for the perfect white nail polish,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.180
is to just buy a french tip nail polish.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.240
And what that means,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.700
is that there're certain companies

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.040
who make nail polish meant for the french tip manicures,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.380
and they're really thick.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.140
I don't know why

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900
nail polish companies didn't think of this before.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.800
Just

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.480
take your french tip nail polish,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.520
and call it white nail polish

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.940
to cover your entire nail.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.160
Not just the tip.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.380
The problem with french tip nail polish,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.900
is that the brush is often really thin.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.480
Which is the case with Color Club,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.400
Orly,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.640
and a couple others.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.580
So all I did was

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.680
just switch the brush!

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.360
And there you go.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.000
You have a white,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.840
opache, french tip nail polish

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.900
But with a thicker, regular brush.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.220
So we're gonna start with a bleached neon striped base.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.620
I'm using a yogurt lid container

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.460
as my nail polish palette.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.720
So I can get it really messy,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.460
and I don't really care what happens.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.020
See?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.420
Yogurt was good for something.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.900
So I just apply a little bit of each color.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.700
One at a time,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.180
so it doesn't dry out to fast,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.740
on my yogurt lid.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.980
And take a thin stripping brush,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.740
I got this one from Winstonia Store,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.580
link below,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.500
and start with one color at a time,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.820
from the outside of the nail,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.080
working your way across

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.380
to the other side of the nail.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.760
In between colors,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.320
I clean my nail art brush

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.560
by dipping it in a little bit of acetone.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.740
Swirl it around,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.320
and then I wipe off the access with a paper towel.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.800
This isn't really the proper way

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.600
to clean your brush.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.320
'Cause you're supposed to, like,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.760
use water and soap or...

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.640
Care about them? Or something?

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.260
But,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.940
I don't really care,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.240
'cause I don't have time.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.840
So, I'm just gonna wipe it in acetone and go.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.800
*nail art montage*

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.220
When you're done,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.400
put a niiiiice,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.480
juicy top coat

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.580
on top of it all,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.920
and then let it dry.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.020
And... Go pet your cat.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.180
With your other hand.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.520
That you're not painting.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.960
Or...

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.100
Maybe, don't pet your cat.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.300
'Cause you don't want

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.500
her hair in your nails.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.000
Never mind.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.940
When it's all dry,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.500
and for me it takes fifteen minutes,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.260
but it depends on the top coat that you use,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.420
take your nail vinyls,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.640
and stick them on.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.980
And what I usually do

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.080
when I want a pattern where they're equally spaced,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.500
is I pick up a whole bunch of them.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.760
I apply them all on the nail.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.740
And then I take every other one

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.200
off the nail,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.920
and keep adding to the end.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.740
I don't know how to really explain this with words.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.540
Again,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.200
talking in a nail art video kinda useless.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.920
Right here is an example.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.780
But,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.440
whatever.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.400
Just watch what I'm doing.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.320
Then I took some straight nail vinyls

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.980
to give me that

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.260
clean edge on the side

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.400
of these arrow chevron thingies?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.900
and...

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.280
Paint it with black,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.180
and quickly peel off

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.740
the nail vinyls while the polish is still wet.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.400
If you wait till it dries,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.100
then your nails will look hideous.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.100
Trust me.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.200
Before jumping to your top coat,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.060
you should probably wait fifteen minutes.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.020
Because the second you apply top coat over

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.240
freshly painted black,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.200
it's gonna smear

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.300
everywhere,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.120
and then you'll have to do it all over again,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.080
and you gonna hate me for not warning you.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.100
But I just warned you!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.400
So you won't have to hate me!

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.500
And there you go!

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.900
You've got some really cool summer

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.940
crazy nails on your fingers.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.760
Well,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.540
I hope you guys really enjoyed this video.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.460
But more importantly

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.880
appreciated me talking in this video.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.580
As per your request.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.860
I mean really, though.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.480
We could've gotten through this tutorial

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.240
in, like, a quarter of the time

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.180
if I wasn't talking and being annoying.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.680
Uhm...

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.360
But for some reason you guys like me being annoying?

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.080
So,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.900
I mean,

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.780
comment below

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.620
if you want me to continue being annoying

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.680
while talking.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.400
And I just might listen to ya.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.100
Thanks for watching!

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.860
Annnnnd... Listening!
