Hi, I am Natalja from the Red Brick Cafe.
On behalf of Expert Village, we are going

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.740
to learn how to properly make poplar gourmet
coffee house drinks. So now we are going to

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.840
learn how to make an Iced Americano. Iced
Americano is very similar to iced latte except

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.680
it doesn't have the milk or cream in it. The
trick here to make a really good Iced Americano

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.340
is to have lot of ice and not too much water.
The first thing we want to do is actually

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.940
pour our shot. We are going to do it in this
small pourer here. If you are going to use

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.450
any flavoring or sugar, you should put it
into the pourer and have go with the shot

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.960
so it blends better. I am actually going to
use sugar because it draws out the flavor.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:01:13.280
Because it is a double shot, I am going to
use 2 tablespoons of sugar. It is really important

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
to make a really perfect espresso when you
have drinks that don't have creamed milk or

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.009
any syrups in it because you are really going
to taste the espresso. You want to have it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.369
very good tasting. So I am going to put the
pourer over here and pull a double shot. The

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:44.229
next thing I am going to do is I am going
to fill up my mug with ice. There you go.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:02:06.639
Put in a lot of ice. Going to wait for our
shot.

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:17.280
The next step is stir it if you have any flavoring
or sugar, which I do. Stir that well in. Then

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.660
I am going to slowly pour it over the ice
to melt it. As you can see, it really melts

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:35.610
the ice right away. Now I am going to add
some water. I like to pour the water into

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.660
the pourer. I am only going to put 3/4 of
a pourer because if you put too much water,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.030
it is going to taste diluted. Get all the
left over sugar and the good stuff, blend

00:02:48.030 --> 00:03:00.480
it in the water, pour it in. Now, what I like
to do at this point is add a little more ice.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.460
This should be probably good. Now, that is
the bare minimum iced American. If you customer

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.700
wants to add cream or milk, they will have
room to put it in. So that's good not to actually

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.799
not fill it up. There you go. That's an Iced
Americano.
