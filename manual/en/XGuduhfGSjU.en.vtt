00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.790
Today we're going to talk about a really inconvenient
truth. You cannot be an environmentalist and

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.450
a non-vegan. Now in my very first nugget ever,
I touched on the environmental impact of the

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.299
animal products industry. Today we're going
to compare the benefits the environment that

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.290
the typical going green methods have, to the
impact that you have by making shifts in your

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.600
diet. Often times the most passionate, vigilant,
and militant environmentalists still eat animal

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.180
products. Let's take a look at why that is
[BEEP] stupid. We're going to focus on the

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.380
elements of environmentalism that you most
often hear about. Water, paper - meaning trees

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.810
- and CO2 emissions. Let's start with water.
Now one of the common water saving tips that

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.579
you hear is to get a water efficient shower
head. The typical shower head emits 5 gallons

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.920
per minute. Most water efficient shower heads
emit 2.5 gallons per minute. Say that you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.329
take 10 minute showers every day, you're going
to save 9,125 gallons every year. If you take

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.489
a 15 minute shower every day, you're going
to save 13,687.5 gallons every year. The average

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.030
US citizen eats 185 pounds of meat every year,
and 62.4 pounds of beef. So every year the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.509
average American is using 156,000 gallons
of water for their beef consumption alone.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.880
If you didn't eat any meat for an entire year,
conservatively, you'd be saving 339,900 gallons.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.679
The average American also eats 632 pounds
of dairy. Every pound of dairy takes approximately

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.200
600 gallons of water. So if you stopped eating
dairy for entire year, you would save 379,200

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.850
gallons. Now here's the real testament. If
you went an entire year without eating any

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.950
meat or dairy, you would be saving 719,100
gallons of water for that year. That's the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.149
same amount of water as if you didn't shower
at all for 53 years if you took a 15 minute

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.149
shower, or 79 years if you took 10 minute
showers. So what's really making the best

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.389
environmental impact as far as water is concerned?
So maybe a full year with no meat or dairy

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:03.420
is a little too much for you to handle right
now. What about not eating 1 pound of beef?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.590
You would be saving the same amount of water
as if you didn't shower for 100 showers. That's

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.640
3 1/2 months of not showering, just for 1
pound of beef. I hope you're starting to see

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.780
how huge the impact of diet is on the environment.
Now it's time for paper. What you most often

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.170
hear for helping the environment, is to start
going paperless. And also to recycle whatever

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.980
paper you do use. On average, a person uses
between 5 and 8.51, 40 foot trees every year.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.730
And if you recycled 1 ton of paper, that's
2,000 pounds, you'll be saving about 17 trees.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.760
And now for dietary impact. I'm only going
to use the data for beef right now, because

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.879
it is the meat that's had the most environmental
impact studies done. To produce 1 pound of

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.459
beef, it takes approximately 55ft.Â² of rain
forest, which depending on the area, is anywhere

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.040
between 45 and 55 trees. So if you didn't
use any paper at all for an entire year, you'd

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.689
be saving at most 8.51 trees. Whereas if you
avoid just 1 pound of beef, you're saving

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:04.340
45 to 55 trees. Now if you went an entire
year without eating any beef, you'd be saving

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.730
3,432 trees. By not eating beef for an entire
year, and we're not even talking about any

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.020
other animal products at this point, you would
still be saving 3,406.49 more trees than if

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.630
you didn't use any paper for the entire year
and recycled an entire ton. And how about

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.240
toilet paper? The average US person uses 50
pounds of toilet paper every year. Let's say,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.640
dear Americans, that you went an entire year
without using any toilet paper. You would

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.719
be saving a measly 0.425 trees. Now for CO2.
The animal products industry is the largest

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:45.469
sole contributor to climate change, and is
responsible for emitting 2,964 million tons

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:50.540
of CO2 every year. Now let's compare the CO2
emissions of the average car to that of the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.890
meat dairy and egg industries. When people
talk about saving CO2, you always hear about

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.640
hybrid cars. The average passenger car is
going to emit 5.1 tons of CO2 per year. Now

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.160
different hybrid cars have different CO2 emissions.
If you decided to drive a Prius instead of

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.719
your average car, you'd be saving 1.7 tons
of CO2 every year. Whereas going a year without

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:16.200
just beef, saves 5.5 tons of CO2. And now
for a simplified version - you could drive

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.380
about 600 miles from the CO2 that's produced
by 1 pound of beef. Now believe it or not,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.060
this is the tip of the iceberg. We're not
even going to go into nitrogen from fertilizer

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.300
and feed production, the issue of methane,
or the over 500 million tons of fecal matter

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.920
produced by livestock every year. In summary
- never showering, never using paper, never

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.360
using toilet paper, recycling an entire ton
of paper, and never driving, don't even come

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.340
close to making the environmental impact of
switching to a vegan diet. Now it doesn't

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.840
have to be all at once, every little bit counts.
