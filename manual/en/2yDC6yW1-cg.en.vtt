00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:01.231
- Hey guys!

00:00:01.231 --> 00:00:03.704
Today we're making this, Bahama Mama.

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.432
And we found this recipe on the new app

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:07.963
called Drink Advisor.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.331
- [Skyy] Exactly, this
app gives you recipes

00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:13.593
for drinks, the histories of
drinks, and also tells you

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:16.496
which bars in your neighborhood
are open and rates them.

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:17.719
- Nice!

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:18.874
I'm ready.

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:20.146
- Coconut rum!

00:00:20.146 --> 00:00:21.422
Pour!

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:24.104
White rum!

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.144
Dark rum!

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:31.266
You can just put a little
of that, OK, that's good.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.684
- Pineapple juice

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:33.742
- Give this a nice shake, shake that

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.261
Shake it and keep it sexy!

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:37.310
- Give me some Bahama song

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.086
♫ Who let the dogs out Who ♫

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:40.724
♫ Who, Who, Who

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:42.222
♫ Who, who let the dogs out

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:43.992
♫ Who, who, who, who ♫

00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:46.857
(laughs) What?

00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:47.878
- Nothin', nothin'

00:00:47.878 --> 00:00:49.079
- I think that was pretty good

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.800
- Yeah, it was brilliant.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.003
It was very natural. Pour!

00:00:52.737 --> 00:00:54.001
Top that off. OK.

00:00:54.803 --> 00:00:57.822
Stay focused girl, OK,
this is serious business.

00:00:57.822 --> 00:00:59.409
Alright, next--
- Don't point at me!

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:00.779
- Next, we get that splash,

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:01.846
that's bad, like in Russian.

00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:03.762
(laughing)

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.032
- On one side, just a nice splash,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.338
'cause I want it to sink to the bottom,

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:08.963
to give us a nice red bottom, OK?

00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:10.319
- OK, got it.

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:11.459
- [Woman] Just a nice splash
- [Bartender] Stop.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.825
Alright.

00:01:17.384 --> 00:01:19.311
- Cherry, tada!

00:01:19.823 --> 00:01:20.843
- Perfect.

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:22.469
And there you have it!

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.502
The Bahama Mama from Drink Advisor.

00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:27.443
Go ahead girl, get your lips on that.

00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:29.351
- Cool, OK.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.190
- It should be super tropical.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.158
- Very tropical

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:41.128
- You like it?
- Love it.

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:42.685
Very tropical, but yet too dry.

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:46.784
I can tell it, just from
how it goes down my throat,

00:01:46.784 --> 00:01:50.766
and like, "I'm gettin' buzzed,
right here, right now."

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.624
- You need to man up,
you only had two sips.

00:01:52.624 --> 00:01:55.177
- I'm lightweight, OK?
- How much you weigh?

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:56.604
- 106

00:01:56.605 --> 00:01:58.126
- I put in LA, just the LA area.

00:01:58.126 --> 00:01:59.705
And these bars are all rated.

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:00.454
The Dresden

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.890
The Dresden that's were they
were talking about in Swingers.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.615
You remember the movie with Vince Vaughn?

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:06.533
- Ahh, yes.

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:07.298
- This was one of the bars.

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:08.819
It's an old bar.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.478
It's a really, really,
really, really super cool app.

00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:13.069
- Comes in handy.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.390
Yeah, ’cause this rates them well.

00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:16.319
This chick I used to date, I
remember, she took me there.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.595
That's how I know where it is.

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:20.334
- Was it nice?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.707
- Was she nice?

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:22.821
She was out of her mind.

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:24.643
But she was cool.
- What happened?

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:27.208
What did she do?

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.228
(both laughing)

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:30.738
- Brings up good memories, huh? (laughs)

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.502
Poor boy, what'd she do to you?

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:36.824
- Let me tell you what I remembered well.

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:39.185
OK, we standing in the middle,

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:44.185
Firstly, she dressed practically
like a hooker doll, OK?

00:02:44.418 --> 00:02:46.283
Like, you see these pants?

00:02:46.485 --> 00:02:47.879
Those are too long for her.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.492
She can't wear those, OK?

00:02:49.772 --> 00:02:52.802
Her stuff got to be like half
a butt-cheek hanging out,

00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:55.055
half the bottom of her
breast hanging, you know?

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:56.434
She used to go out half-naked!

00:02:56.715 --> 00:03:01.138
And then you'd have other
girls who'd stare at you

00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:02.695
and give you that eye, right?

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:04.564
And that's when she'll jump up,

00:03:04.564 --> 00:03:06.121
"What you lookin' at?"

00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:09.203
- (laughs) Sassy!

00:03:09.203 --> 00:03:11.340
- "You can't appreciate beauty.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.932
"Why you hating?"

00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:16.438
- (laughs) I love that girl already.

00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:18.260
- She used to do that to dudes too!

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.886
OK, so we walking down
the street, you know?

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:25.764
Pass a group of guys, OK, like 15 dudes.

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:28.322
But two or three of them didn't look,

00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:30.017
but they didn't say nothin',

00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:32.970
but they look back and
half a cheek's hangin' out,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.955
and then she gonna have
the nerve, "Excuse me!

00:03:37.177 --> 00:03:39.079
"Could you be more respectful please?"

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.159
Well when half your ass
hangin' out, what you mean

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.994
could you be more respectful?

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:44.549
You got the damned thing hanging out, OK?

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.640
These boys just lookin'.

00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:48.602
- They've never seen anything like that.

00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:50.587
- Yeah, she tried that,
you know what I mean.

00:03:50.587 --> 00:03:53.397
I'm standing there, and like I don't know

00:03:53.397 --> 00:03:56.146
This is the girl I'm with, I
gotta back her up you know?

00:03:56.218 --> 00:03:58.021
"That's right! You all stop that, OK!"

00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:59.801
"That's nasty, don't look at that!"

00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.481
"Yeah, it's hangin' out, but
it's none of your business!"

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:04.259
Please god, don't let these dudes kill me.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.110
Sweet Jesus, I'm going to put
more offerin' in this week.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.238
- (laughing) That is so funny!
- You know?

00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:11.095
Well listen, go on Drink Advisor

00:04:11.095 --> 00:04:13.405
and just check out the bars, at least.

00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:14.822
It's good man.

00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:16.180
It got a lot of recipe for drinks

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.898
but what really impresses me is the bars

00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:19.744
in your neighborhood.

00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:21.660
Go ahead, take a sip,
tell me what you think.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.600
- Can I pick it up and take a sip?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.481
- Sure, you can pick it up.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.193
- (laughs) Woo! It's good. It's so strong.

00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:33.514
You tryin' to kill me?

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:34.898
Where you takin' me after this?

00:04:34.898 --> 00:04:36.440
What's the plan?

00:04:37.161 --> 00:04:42.161
- Where you wanna go?
