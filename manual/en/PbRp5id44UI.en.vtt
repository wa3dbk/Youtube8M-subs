00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.029
waves wrangler is certain other shooter
another day another shooting of course

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.369
whose the guy who shot at firefighters
in new york

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.049
uh... and

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.519
whether this character that in nineteen
eighty was for waco for seventeen years

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.730
for killing his grandmother

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.519
now he killed or the hammer so there you
go business so we have to be a gun right

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.429
and in fact it appears that before he
let his house on fire and eventually the

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.430
whole block was on fire base we seven
different houses on fire

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.290
he also kill the system now it's unclear
at this point

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.200
uh... whether a sister of had died
before the fire or as a result of the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.690
fire the spangler poet in his own house

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.510
uh... but by the reason that he let the
fire was so the firemen we show up

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.280
and he would kill them

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.830
which is what he did

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.500
he sat up uh... in a high position

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840
ecn

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.600
use the same gun that was used in the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.170
connecticut shootings at two twenty
three caliber semiautomatic bush master

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.390
rifle

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.390
and uh... he took out of four fireman to
omit died locally to or wounded but not

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.350
dead obviously so i mean this is the
blessings that we count in today's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.760
america

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.040
that n_r_a_'s america

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.200
when only too well the four people shot
are killed

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.270
now we don't know how we kill the sister
either them in the fire could even as i

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.410
said anything else could've been a
weapon but let's say that it was let's

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.810
say it was a fire

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.410
suit than gun advocates was that you see
that could've been by fire could have

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.000
been by hammer stroup this guy's a
raving alluded take maniac

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.950
but you know what

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.650
the weapon mix of old easier

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.040
at most of our killed one person

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.410
the hammer killed one person

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.630
the rifle

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.380
shot four till two

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.470
you know why

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.940
it is a more efficient weapon

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.540
he used to kill people

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.389
and in fact

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:59.340
william spengler says that's exactly
what he intended to do

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.070
z family in some sort of notes he left
behind ice love to get ready to see how

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.760
much of the neighborhood i could burn
down

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.139
and do what i like doing best

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.219
killing p

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.739
to five thirty in the morning than those
for a fireman showed up

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.029
try to help

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.279
not just the neighborhood

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:23.559
to help spangler cousins his house
burning down there responded

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.799
kissed together we work better together
and n

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:27.919
they can there

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.519
to do their job which is to save the
community

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.479
and there is a maniac with a rifle
waiting forum and as soon as i got close

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.569
the fire he shot out of until two a

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.120
what is it gonna be enough

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.459
when is it gonna be in now

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.969
apparently of the answer to this of
course an i_r_a_ would say uh... as they

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.719
did with the school shootings

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.969
is more weapons

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.329
so there are a said after the
connecticut shootings that we should put

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.369
more guns in the schools

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:01.149
should we give the fire department more
guns today show up at every fire

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.430
with their own bush mass arrivals and
set up

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.150
should everybody show up everywhere at
church at school

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.889
at hospitals and flyers

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.359
with weapons

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.069
well then i of course would love that

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.249
because they don't represent you they
were present they've gone manufacturers

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.799
know the answer is not more guns it is
less than this

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.160
sad day for you if you still don't
believe that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.209
cas your hobby is so important you are
disputing orchids

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.919
my hobbies fantasy football it hasn't
filled anybody as far as i know

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:36.680
we can get a life
