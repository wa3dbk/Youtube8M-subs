00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.600
Hi, Tim here with my Day 49 juice diet update, 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.110
yes my juice fast update.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.400
Only 7 days to go! 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.600
This time next week

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 will be my last juicing day.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.600
Since yesterday I have lost another 0.2 kilogram,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.380
which is just under half a pound. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.500
Total weight loss now is a total of 20 kilograms exactly. 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.700
And that is a fraction over 44 pounds. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.900
Current weight is 91.4 kilos,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.500
and that is around 201 1/2 pounds.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.600
So everything on track with my fat burning diet, and doing well.

00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:38.707
I mentioned in quite a few previous videos

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.600
that I am looking at transitioning off, 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.300
and what I need to do. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.800
And 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200
it seems pretty well the worst thing you could do, 

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:49.946
if you have been on a long juice fast,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.400
is to just start eating normally. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
And because you have been on a juice fast,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.560
it hasn’t had a lot to do in the last, 

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:07.105
in my case, the last 49 days, 

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:07.799
because, of course, 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.680
the juice is ready to go and ready 
 to be absorbed by the body. 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.400
So, the body apparently backs off in the production of these digestive enzymes.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
So if you just go back to eating your normal diet, 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.700
full on,  

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.570
especially if it is junk food,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.060
but even if it is healthy stuff

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.700
in large quantities, 

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.500
your body is not actually prepared for that. 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.700
So, from what I can read,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.700
it is a small amount of fruits,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.460
vegetable smoothies, that are really good for the first couple of days, 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.500
and just to gradually get back into normal eating.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.900
Now, of course, 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.900
the difference between vegetable smoothies and juicing is 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.300
the juicing pretty well removes a lot of the bulk, the fibre. 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
Whereas the smoothie you put that in a blender and 
 you are just blending up the entire fruit

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
Whereas the smoothie you put that in a blender 

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:25.370
and you are just blending up the entire fruit and adding some water

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.450
and perhaps some ice cubes or whatever it is. 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.850
So you are actually getting the bulk of it, 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.100
so it is a lot thicker. 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.000
And as it turns out I’m going off to Phuket 
 in Thailand on 11 September (yes, with Louise!), 

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:53.230
and I am finishing the juice fast over here, 

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:57.270
my first day of non juicing is the 6th. 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.300
So I am going to start off and do that, 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.700
and then I am going to move to, 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800
I have pretty well decided now, 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.200
I am going to have meat no more 
 than once or twice a week. 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.450
Now, obviously, dairy and caffeine I have eliminated anyway. 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.750
And meat I have obviously eliminated in the 
 last 49 days in the juice fast.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.300
I see no reason to go back to it.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.600
So, anyway, I am going to ignore dairy, 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000
and I would not have been able to do that 
 if I hadn’t started the juice fast. 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.200
Because, quite frankly, I was really into cheese, 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.600
and had a lot of milk and so forth. 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.900
And that’s going to give me vitamin B12, 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.400
which is something fruits and vegetables can’t give you, 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500
which I have talked about in an earlier video.

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.830
So I will give you more information as it comes to hand. 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.300
I will be reporting to you tomorrow, 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.460
in Day 50′s video as to how that went, 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.600
what findings the doctor found in my blood, the blood test results. 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.600
Because I mentioned this in an earlier video,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.300
that some of those areas were a cause for concern 
 when I first did this blood test, 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.750
which was before I started the juice fast.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.300
And just in case you haven’t seen Day 46 video

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.200
So, that is a result of being on this juice fast, 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.800
which I was pretty pumped up about.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.600
But more on that tomorrow anyway.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.900
OK, I have got to leave it there for now. 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.300
Everything is still on track with my juice fasting plan and still feeling good.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.300
And, yes, I will be continuing these videos. 

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:09.470
At least next week I will go right 
 up until I go away on holidays

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.800
I’ll do a daily video. 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.900
And then gradually, I probably won’t be able to continue indefinitely doing daily videos

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.500
but look, I am going to be talking about transitioning.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.700
And currently, as I said earlier in the 
 video, I am on 91.4 kilos. 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.200
So I have only got 11.4 kilos to go (26 pounds).

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.300
I have already lost 20 in this juice fast. 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.100
Alright, I will see you tomorrow for Day 50!

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.200
Bye for now.
