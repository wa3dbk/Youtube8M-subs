00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.130
In 2012, The Heart Truth marked a decade of commitment to women's heart health. 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.970
During February's American Heart Month, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.280
(NHLBI) reaffirmed its commitment to increasing awareness about heart disease 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.620
among women and helping women take steps to reduce their own personal risk 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.230
of developing heart disease. 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.650
One of the campaign's signature American Heart Month activities, 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.660
the Red Dress Collection Fashion Show, serves as a red alert to women that heart 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.560
disease doesn't care what you wear---it's the #1 killer of women. 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.670
With the generous support of celebrities and the fashion community, the Red Dress took 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.340
center stage on the runway again this February as the national symbol of women 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.920
and heart disease awareness. 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.310
 The Red Dress event is a signature event for us because we have such a large focus on 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.350
cardiovascular disease and the science behind cardiovascular disease in order to

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.500
 improve patient care and outcomes. 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 So this is a real opportunity for us to connect to women all over the country to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.210
demonstrate that heart disease really is something that they should be aware of. 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.770
 It's the number one killer of women. 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.780
 And that we have a role to play in order to prevent that. 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:42.640
(MUSIC)

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:51.750
 My mom's heart is only beating at about 12 percent right now, which is amazing because 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.270
she has such a big heart and you just can't believe that she can exude all that love with a 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.690
heart that's barely beating. 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.790
 So I'm here for my mom and to get the message out that this is the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.070
number one killer of women. 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:47.380
(MUSIC)

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.340
 For me this event is very meaningful because my mother passed away from heart disease. 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.740
 So to me any reminder that I can give other women to be aware of their vulnerability and 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.180
to take care of their heart health is just an opportunity to be reminded of my 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.120
vulnerability, of my family with my mother. 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.770
 And together --- you know I love women and we have to come together and take care of 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.480
each other and remind each other that we need to be healthy and sustain. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:05:55.170

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.590
 You know I think it's important, especially for women to pay 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.220
attention to their heart health. 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.380
 Usually we're use to men of being aware of this, but as stress factors grow and women 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.120
work even more and still are mothers and everything that we do, we sometimes neglect 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.860
ourselves, and heart health is very important. 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.720
 My grandfather had a lot of heart problems and my mom had some tough times a few 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.010
years ago --- she got very ill. 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.530
 So I'm very, very versed on everything that can happen. 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.920
 And I stay very healthy. 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.860
 I work out a lot. 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.220
 Try to stay cardio conscious and heart healthy that way. 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.730
 I eat very healthy. 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.180
 I've always watched it. 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:40.590
