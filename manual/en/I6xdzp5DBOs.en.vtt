00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.420
Hey!! It's Pat Hawks again.  Here in the forest of.. 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.680
My backyard! And I'm here to tell you about the

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.360
number one cause of deforestation.  What's the number one cause of deforestation?

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.440
Hey, what's the number one cause of deforestation? ' I am NOT an expert on deforestation ' 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.700
I guess we don't know. That's besides the point.  The point is, junk mail.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.730
Every Monday Matters week number 6! Get rid of Junk Mail!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.930
So every month I get credit card offers,  information on how to subscribe to a magazine

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.570
that I don't want to subscribe to. A sports  magazine that whoever lived in my apartement

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.680
before subscribed to. And it's still coming to me! A couple air purifier catalogues.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.720
Some coupons for stores I never go to, and a fitness catalogue. 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.870
Do I look like the kind of guy that reads a lot  of fitness catalogues? 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.860
Junk mail is just a waste of your time.  And a waste of paper. 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.400
Now I'm not saying I'm a 'tree-hugger', but waste is never a good thing.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.940
The good news is there are some really easy  things that you can do, 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710
to cut down on the amount of junk mail  that you get. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.890
So whenever you need to give somebody your  address, check and see if there's a box that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.280
say "Don't sell my information to anybody." If you can't find a box, then below your address

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.590
just write:  "Don't sell my information to anybody."

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.700
Unsubscribe from those air purifier catalogues that you never read anyway. 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.710
Just call them up and tell then you don't want it anymore. 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.410
Sometimes these people can be tricky. You got to  make sure to get your point across. 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.120
Be the man! 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.320
Hey this is Pat Hawks.  Yes that Pat Hawks.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.820
Do you think you can take me off your mailing list?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.110
Oh, you could?  It's that easy? Sweet!

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.390
That was a lot easier than I expected.  I just called them up and POOF! 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.180
I'm not on the mailing list! If you get a lot of catalogues 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.650
that you just throw away, there are a couple websites that let you unsubscribe from big

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.200
lists of catalogues. You can find a link over at  EveryMondayMatters.com

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.470
Or you could just search for it yourself.  You're never going to totally eliminate junk mail.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.000
So just be responsible with what you still have.  Recycle! 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.480
And if can't recycle, at least find some other use for it.  

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.870
Or use it to start a fire.  

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.210
We'll see you next Monday. 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.400
 www.EveyMondayMatters.com

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.100
Stupid bird! 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.250
I said knock it off! 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.510
KNock it off! 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.360
That's right! 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.860
