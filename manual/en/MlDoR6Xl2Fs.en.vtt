00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.420
Feel free to leave if I'm getting boring.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.950
They can come back if they like, if they don't
like it, of course.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.200
You get a free return ticket.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.660
There's sometimes a debate about going to
Mars one-way and whether that makes things

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.020
easier, and I think for the initial flights
perhaps, but long term, to get the cost down,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.460
you need the spacecraft back.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.470
Whether the people come back is irrelevant,
but you must have the ship back because those

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.579
things are expensive.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.010
So anyone who wants to return can just jump
on.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.260
I wish I could just stab that bloody thing
through the heart.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.149
I really want SpaceX to help make life multi-planetary.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.680
I'd like to see a self-sustaining base on
Mars.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.250
Technically, if somebody were to stow aboard
the cargo version of Dragon, they'd actually

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.500
be fine.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.500
I mean, hopefully.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.989
The climate debate is an interesting one.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:15.190
If you ask any scientist, are you sure that
human activity is causing global warming,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.550
any scientist should say no.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.220
Because you can not be sure.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.200
On the other hand, if you said, do you think
we should put an arbitrary number of trillions

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.950
of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere and just
keep doing it until something bad happens,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.800
they'll probably say no too.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.290
The idea of lying on a beach as my main thing,
just sounds like the worst - it sounds horrible

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.100
to me.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.500
I would go bonkers.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.270
I would have to be on serious drugs.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.360
I went to Russia three times to negotiate
purchasing an ICBM.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.670
Twenty launches a year, is not a crazy number
at all.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.009
We expect that to occur without any miracles.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.040
I think it would be great to be born on Earth
and to die on Mars.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.360
Just hopefully not at the point of impact.
