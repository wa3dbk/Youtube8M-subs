00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:07.709
HTC TITAN.

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.639
Expected October 2011.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.370
A Windows Phone 7.5 handset featuring HTC's
largest ever smartphone display, the HTC TITAN

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.390
certainly deserves its name. And just in case
the name sounds familiar, HTC did have the

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.699
similarly named TyTN handset a few years ago.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.530
It's been almost a year since the launch of
HTC's last Windows Phone handsets, and since

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.160
then Microsoft's new operating system hasn't
made a huge impact. However, it has steadily

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.909
improved over the past year and the latest
version, 7.5 is showing some promise for customers,

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.900
against a backdrop of troubles with the rival
Android OS which is making manufacturers look

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.210
again at Microsoft's offering.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.350
The most obvious feature with the TITAN is
the display, a large 4.7" 480 x 800 pixel

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.330
panel which is one of the largest on the market.
Inside is a 1.5GHz single core CPU coupled

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:18.470
with 512MB of RAM. On the back is an 8 megapixel
camera with 720p HD video capture.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.700
This is a 3.5G phone with WiFi, GPS and Bluetooth
plus DLNA integration. Inside is 16GB of non-expandable

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.380
memory, some of which will be used up by the
operating system. There's a pretty decent

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.060
media player and all the usual smartphone
software features that you'd expect, although

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.970
everything is very Microsoft-oriented.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.950
The user interface is very different from
other smartphones, and it takes a bit of getting

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.200
used to. On the other hand, Microsoft have
thought long and hard about how people want

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.010
to use their phones and there are plenty of
people who rate Windows Phone very highly

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.170
when it comes to usability.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:08.479
The HTC TITAN is quite a big device at 132
x 71 x 10mm and 160 grams. The 1600 mAh battery

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.019
gives up to 6.8 hours talktime and 19 days
standby time.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.879
There's a chance that Windows Phone might
just be about to take off, and high-end handsets

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.629
like the TITAN are certainly going to help.
HTC say that the TITAN should be available

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.010
from October onwards, starting in Europe and
Asia although there is no guidance on price.
