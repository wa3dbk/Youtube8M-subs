00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:20.600
the it charlie Worthington here

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.850
most people wouldn't think a putting a
PC me this big on the grill with

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.650
indirect grilling

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.650
you can do anytime you want

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.220
the method indirect grilling is right
there in the name

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.890
indirect grilling your grilling with
indirect heat see you don't want the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.110
heat right under the me

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.559
or whatever it is that you're cooking so
you make a ring up for cats

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.500
and every drip pan in and then you put
some water in at the moisture is going

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.730
to keep the heat consisting

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.269
keep moisture inside the growth keep
your me and what are you cooking moist

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.610
another way of doing it for small pieces
meat like chicken breasts I get some

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.790
stuffed peppers America

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.579
is to take all your calls and bring them
to the center of the grill

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.550
and Cisco love balls I you last
stragglers

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.550
that's good you put a grill on

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.960
we'll take our not are burke et

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.880
tongs grab food tongs and place these
papers around the edge

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.680
so they're gonna cook and I get that
smoky flavor but they're not going to

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.790
get burned on the bottom before they're
cooked through

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.530
it's almost like cooking in oven
beginning in that group labeled

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.500
came the other thing about indirect
grilling

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.470
on a burke et fire is that its gonna
cook for a longer period time especially

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.960
with a large pizza me like a brisket or
pork roast

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.100
so you may have to add some for cats
when you at the park at

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.280
make sure that you open up the vents on
the top with grilled

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.510
because they need to get started and
without oxygen and not gonna get started

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.780
in

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.460
catch up with the others can also do
growing indirect grilling

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.250
on a gas grill machine that over here on
a gas grill

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.370
you governors that have

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.470
controls on basic do you do to turn off
to

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.500
above the burners temperature me where
the fire is not hot

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.870
take up more

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.690
and related front still a bit hot but
the girls hot

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.360
but the heat is really coming from the
back burner and then again you're gonna

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.960
close it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.790
and disconnection doesn't get too hot by
watching the temperature on the outside

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.270
the girl

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.910
come back and get a rose form
