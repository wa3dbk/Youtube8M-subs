That's totally different, I want blue hair,
not pink hair!

00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:12.630
Microsoft is doing something new with Skype.
Who should you follow on Twitter? And would

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.940
you buy an iPhone case with a bottle opener?
I'm Cali Lewis, welcome to GeekBeat.TV #222.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:29.990
This episode of GeekBeat.TV is brought to
you by Carbonite. Earlier this week the Skype

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.160
iPad app was released. Our AV Engineer and
blogger Ken Tran had his first impressions

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.899
out on GeekBeat.TV as they took they app down,
then they later rereleased it. Yesterday they

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.950
updated the Android Skype app. 2.1 will allow
video calling on seventeen new devices, including

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.540
the HTC Flyer, Evo 4G, Desire HD, Sensation,
Galaxy Tab and Xperia Play.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.899
Seems to be working pretty well.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.489
For those of you worried that Microsoft is
going to kill Skype, Hopefully you're less

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.489
worried now.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.030
For those of you using Google +, we've had
a steady stream of tips and tricks to get

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.670
the most out of the new service. Gordon McCloud
has a great tip for how to use Google Reader

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.640
and Google + together. Pretty cool stuff.
Check it out at geekbeat.tv/googleplustips.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.409

So, Kick Starter has really become quite the
marketplace. I love that Spec iPhone case

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.440
that has room for three cards in the back:
credit cards, driver's license, well...Would

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.119
you want your iPhone case to double as a bottle
opener instead? Well, the Opena is a hard

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.310
case for your iPhone 4 with a bottle opener
that slides out.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.600
It fits both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon iPhone 4.
It's 40 bucks and will ship this month. if

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.939
you have a physical backup, you should also
have an online backup. When you have Carbonite

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.419
online backup, you don't have to worry, because

you just wish you had a photo or video of?

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.579
Glmps, no vowels, gives you the possibility
of capturing unintended unintentional moment.

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.280
It will take video of the moments before a
photo is taken, when you tell it to start,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.840
it will start recording video. Then, when
you snap the photo, the photo will be the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.379
last frame of the video itself. You can either
decide to discard it, keep it privately, or

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.379
