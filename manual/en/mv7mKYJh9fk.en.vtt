00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.899
How to Give Up Soda.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:10.400
There are many reasons to quit drinking soda,
but a soda addiction can be hard to break.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.240
Try these methods to kick the can for good.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:24.380
You will need Diet soda Citrus slices or fresh
mint Fruit juice Tea Lemonade Coffee Milk

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.619
Small amounts of regular soda (optional) and
club soda (optional).

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.630
Step 1.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.250
Don't try to give up soda cold turkey.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.690
Instead, cut back a little bit every day until
you're down to almost no soda.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.800
If calories are your main concern, try switching
to diet sodas.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.340
If you can't stand the taste of diet soda,
add lemon or lime to it, or try adding small

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.180
amounts to regular soda to get used to the
taste.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.180
Step 2.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.680
Spruce up plain water with citrus slices or
fresh mint.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.680
Be creative and try adding different things
to your water until you find something you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.160
can drink all the time.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.820
Step 3.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.100
Drink 100 percent fruit juice.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.340
While fruit juices tend to contain a lot of
sugar, they also contain nutrients that are

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.500
good for you, unlike the empty calories of
soda.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.570
Add club soda to fruit juice to replace the
carbonation you're missing.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.920
Step 4.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.530
Drink unsweetened tea.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.740
Try herbal or green teas, or drink tea with
milk or lemon and sweeten it with honey or

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.229
artificial sweetener.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.549
Step 5.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.830
Make your own lemonade with fresh lemons,
water, and a small amount of sugar or artificial

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.090
sweetener.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.500
Step 6.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.420
Get into the habit of drinking nonfat milk
instead of soda.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.110
Milk contains calcium, potassium, vitamin
D, and protein, all of which are essential

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.619
for the health and maintenance of your body.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.710
When you find a replacement for soda, you
won't remember why you ever drank it in the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.710
first place.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.680
Did you know During its first year of business,
Coca-Cola sold an average of only 9 drinks

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.689
per day.
