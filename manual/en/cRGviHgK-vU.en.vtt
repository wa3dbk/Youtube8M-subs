00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.130
we've had plus on with ballots for yes to
be he can't be the a la carte game

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.839
in fact so anyway the

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.580
the team is very hard to open the plastic

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.349
and I did that the %uh that to that

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.210
%um

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.480
here

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.740
I really do not think that on together at
the end

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.090
folks let's look at this map

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.510
and other by the camera

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.200
whoops on that it's over

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.509
sorus years what the bag looked like I am

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:54.039
and as you can see it

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.330
stand on its own you stand up for that

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.150
so in sandifer

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.400
%um

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.360
meet characters on

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.019
kind of a

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.110
well I'm going kind of thing going on here

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.010
%uh week that plots

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.230
if you are and how I got this bank acceded
by getting is to make a comment and a point

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.069
is that what

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:18.829
and this is misty and is just an idea I came
up with on that I don't get any money by doing

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.170
it and it's like giving us some hints

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.670
but on in on an additional of on of a await
I have an idea way to get as many Clinton

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.470
appointees

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.820
and on nearly that using with a close and
stuff

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.909
the fact

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.210
but I have

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.340
on this is a Clinton to attack that

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.219
so it's nice to know if she

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.740
I think it's kind of she I mean the material
year

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.289
but some are

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.090
Mike or a pat or two Iowa is but on the just
hope she Pakistan care of paper

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.900
but either way it's free sell on can't go
on with this at the at least the fuss without

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.829
for go and register

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.820
and anyways

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090
that's pretty much it

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.459
there's much and all on hand yet but that
fact we subtracted and thanks for watching
