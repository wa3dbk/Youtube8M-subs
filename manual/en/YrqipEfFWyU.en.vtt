Hey, I am Kate, welcome back to my series
Kate's Kitchen, where I will be cooking up

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.050
some simple and tasty dishes to share with
your friends and family.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:15.069
Today I am going to be making one of my all-time
favorite foods, fish tacos.

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.840
[music]
I am going to start by making my fish into

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.840
goujon.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.550
So I have got Monk fish here.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.550
You can use any other white, firm fish like
Cord or Pollock, they work just as well.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.490
And what you want to do is cut them up into
thin slices and then you want to pop them,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.680
first of all, into the flour and coat them,
all the way around.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.570
And then quickly, give a quick flash in an
egg and milk mixture and then back in to the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.120
flour, like that.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.314
And then just repeat this process until they
are all done.

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:52.929
So now this is done I am just going to set
them to the side and get on with making a

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:53.929
quick guacamole.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.760
So I have got two avocados, I am going to
start by chopping them up.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.930
I am just going to grab a bowl and scoop out
the avocado into it.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.670
Then to that I am going to add the juice of
half a lime, a good pinch of salt, and some

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.690
chopped coriander, and then just mash it all
up.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.720
So my avocado is all nicely mashed together
so I am going to pop this to one side.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.520
You may have noticed that I have not put any
onion or spice in yet but that is going to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.060
all come later.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.760
So now we are going to crack on with the oil
and getting the fish done so I am going to

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.610
put some oil on really hot heat.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.140
Add enough so it comes up about two centimeters
from the base of the pan and you just want

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.480
to get it really nice and hot.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.060
I have got my fish and I am going to carefully
put it into the hot oil using these tongs.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.650
So you know the oil is hot enough when they
start sizzling as soon as they go in, you

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.880
can always do a little test beforehand.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.900
You just cook the fish on one side until it
is golden brown and then flip it over so it

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.750
is golden brown and even on the other side,
too.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.720
Once your fish is evenly cooked just pop them
onto [??] kitchen roll just to take off any

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720
excess oil.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.480
And then I am going to get my corn tortillas,
brush them with a little bit of oil, and put

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.920
them in the pan and turn them over halfway
through again just to make sure they are nice

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.170
and soft.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.659
So I have got my tortillas here and now it
is the fun part, just to stack them all up

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:09.789
and make them into some gorgeous tacos.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.329
So I am going to start off just by taking
a little bit of lettuce, popping it onto each

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.329
one.

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.129
Then I am going to get my avocado mixture
and just put a spoon full of each one as well.

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.709
I like a lot of avocado.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:29.799
Then I am going to get my fish, pop a bit
on each one too.

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:38.430
So now I have just got a mixture here of sour
cream and a bit of mayonnaise and also some

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.650
hot habanero sauce, you can use any hot sauce
you like really, but I just like this one.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.690
I am just going to drizzle this over the top.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.829
And then I have got some homemade red pickled
onions here which are really good for flavor

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.599
and this gorgeous, gorgeous right pink color
as well.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.280
I am just going to put a few of these on each.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.019
Then to that I am going to add some finely
chopped radish, again just as a nice bit of

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.810
crunch but also some lovely pink color as
well.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.750
So these are topping that I really like but
let me know if you have any other different

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.659
taco combinations that you like to have as
well.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.400
I am just going to finish off by sprinkling
a little bit of coriander on top off each

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.999
one as well.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:24.999
And then a lime wedge, too.

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.209
So I am off to enjoy my fish tacos.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.400
