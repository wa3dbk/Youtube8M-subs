00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Invis rune.

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:21.001
Opponent team has Storm and Puck. These heroes are great initiators.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:26.002
There is also an AOE ultimate from Tidehunter. Hence, I'm considering BKB.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:28.003
Eh? Puck.

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:54.004
Maybe Storm would continue trying to push. So I TPed bottom to try and catch him.

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.005
Storm has gone elsewhere though.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.006
Oh Storm has initiated on Lion.

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:12.007
[Storm] Balled in and pulled Lion. Lion countered with a stun, an ulti and a hex.

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:15.008
Lion should have hexed the Windrunner instead...

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.009
Starfall.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.010
Let's go for the Puck.

00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:37.011
Necrolyte was definitely going to die. Thus, you could completely focus on the Puck instead.

00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:51.012
About Puck's Orb just now, if he had shot it in the opposite direction instead, he might have been able to make it.

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:09.013
Wow, 4 people from Scourge has left the game.

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:15.014
There's not much point in playing on, let's not waste time. So let's leave the game.

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:35.015
Okay. Welcome back! This is the second round of POTM first-perspective.

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:43.016
Let me tip you on how to improve the chance of your arrow hitting your target.

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:50.017
Personally, personally... Firstly, you need to be confident in yourself.

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:52.018
You have to dare to shoot, don't be afraid of not hitting your arrow.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.019
And... You have to put in a lot of thoughts to it. Make predictions. Predict where the opponent is heading and what he is trying to do.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:09.020
If you've predicted correctly, err... and the opponent hasn't spotted you or doesn't know that you're going to Arrow him, plus your judgement of the distance and direction is alright,

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:13.021
Err... then your chance of arrow hitting would be higher.

00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:20.022
Umm... For example, you're playing POTM as a roamer early game.

00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:25.023
If you're playing as a roamer early game, you should observe the way your opponents move when they are last-hitting.

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:30.024
Predict when is the next time your opponent is going up to last-hit.

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:38.025
At the moment right before your opponent is moving up to last-hit, shoot an arrow into the spot he's going to move to.

00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:42.026
If you do this, it's definitely easier for your arrow to hit.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:54.027
Also, early game if you're trying to arrow someone, you can try and search for a good angle and a low-profile spot.

00:03:55.028 --> 00:04:00.028
A spot where an opponent is least likely to check. For me, I prefer shooting from behind the opponent.

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:11.029
I randomed an Invoker. However, I'm not using it.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.030
Afterall, I've already done a video on Invoker.

00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:21.031
But... the sound was pretty bad.

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:26.032
If there's a chance, I will make another video on Invoker again in the future.

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:37.033
Last episode... No. I mean last round, I introduced "Jing Ling Dan Dan".

00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:40.034
This round, he randomed an Axe.

00:04:40.035 --> 00:04:45.035
I'm sure we're interested to see his unorthodoxed playstyle of Axe.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:53.336
I think he wanted to solo top, the hard lane solo. However, I didn't let him. I want to get exp.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:05:01.337
Since personally, I'm not good at playing support. If I don't solo top, I can only go bottom to babysit the carry.

00:05:03.338 --> 00:05:06.338
I also did not pump my skill until now, which is after I had analysed the situation.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:08.339
A leap.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.340
For a POTM, during early game, you shouldn't pump your skill right away. Find out what the situation is first.

00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:26.341
Generally, sometimes it is more efficient to leap and attack a few more times than using an arrow.

00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:35.342
This would deal more damage. However, if you're saying that you have a lot of teammates around, then it's better to arrow.

00:05:36.343 --> 00:05:40.343
Since there're a lot of teammates, naturally the overall DPS is higher.

00:05:41.344 --> 00:05:47.344
Another good thing about leap is that you can escape. Anyway, you should just judge based on the situation.

00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:49.345
There's no definite.

00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:55.346
"Jing Ling Dan Dan" wants to roam to mid.

00:05:57.347 --> 00:05:59.347
...Using his unorthodoxed Battle Hunger built.
49
00:06:21,348 --&gt; 00:06:00,348
Shot an arrow and hit. Is there a chance?

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.349
"Jing Ling Dan Dan" is trying to backstab with a DD rune.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.350
Let's see if we can kill the SP.

00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.351
SP might have used a salve before this.

00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:40.352
A leap.

00:06:42.353 --> 00:06:45.353
Attack once more. Eh? Axe's final attack did not connect!

00:06:52.354 --> 00:06:54.354
[Axe] used a salve and continues chasing.

00:06:54.355 --> 00:06:58.355
Salve got cancelled.
