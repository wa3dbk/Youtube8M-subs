00:00:06.088 --> 00:00:11.878
I've had the fuel filter light come on. So
basically I know what it is. The fuel filter's

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:20.498
blocked. I don't have a spare. The other night
I ran the tanks down pretty low. And basically

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:25.237
I think I've picked up a bit of stuff in the…
in the bottom of the tank, and now it's in

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:31.768
my filter. Now, it was only changed recently.
But these things happen. Now the problem I've

00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:38.638
got is, I'm really in the middle of nowhere.
Absolute nowhere, so what I'm gonna do is

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:43.708
I'm gonna get on the sat phone. I've got a
couple of contacts in Kunnunara, and I'm gonna

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:49.778
see if I can get a filter sent out. We'll
see how we go. Let's get the sat phone out.

00:00:49.778 --> 00:01:00.808
I was told by someone that there's a… D
C were runnin' a helicopter out to the plateau.

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:02.898
They wouldn't have a problem taking the filter
out.

00:01:02.898 --> 00:01:07.148
Mate, no worries, thanks for that. Um too
easy. Cheers.

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:16.098
Now, if 
you think about it. The situation that I'm

00:01:16.098 --> 00:01:22.398
in, if I didn't have a satellite phone…
so now I've got… I've got a helicopter,

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:28.538
the DEC, they're on their way out here anyway,
so they travel to the Mitchell Plateau regularly,

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:32.738
so it's nothing for them to chuck the filter
in for me, and I can go and pick it up from,

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:38.878
uh, the plateau there, Mitchell Plateau, at
the airport. But basically you imagine if

00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:45.988
you didn't have a sat phone like that. Now
it's a pretty important tool when you're out

00:01:45.988 --> 00:01:52.798
in the bush, and if you're going remote places
like places that Simon and I go, the a sat

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:57.518
phone is a pretty good tool to have. And of
course, the missus likes me to give her a

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:03.458
ring every couple of days. Make sure I'm still
alive. Remember that one. If you're going

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:09.438
out in the bush, the radios are good, the
HF radios. Yeah. But look, at the end of the

00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:15.398
day, I can take this anywhere. On the quad-bike.
I can take it in the boat. I can have it in

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:19.208
the 4-wheel drive. So it's a pretty important
tool. Remember that one.
