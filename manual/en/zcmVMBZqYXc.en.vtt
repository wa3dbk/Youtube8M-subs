00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.430
The Subaru Outback has always had a certain
chunky appeal, although the styling of the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.230
previous model wasn’t – shall we say – to
everyone’s taste.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.550
For 2015, though, Subaru have made substantial
changes – not just to the way it looks,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.609
but also to the interior, and the way it drives.

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.589
Most obvious is the new look at the front,
with the Outback now sharing the hexagonal

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:30.460
grille with the rest of the Subaru range,
along with more aggressively-styled LED headlights.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.840
The new Outback is a little wider and longer
than before, and its lines are a little more

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.070
chiselled, particularly the shoulder line
that runs the length of the car, while sporting

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.270
elements have been emphasised, such as the
more pronounced roof spoiler and new rear

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.580
lights with part LED illumination.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.760
The rufty-tufty sill extensions are now black
instead of body-coloured, a look we prefer,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.830
and there’s now a choice of either 17 or
18-inch alloy wheels.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.800
The interior of the Outback sees perhaps the
most substantial changes, however.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.400
Most noticeable is the feeling of space in
here.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.729
Front seat passengers are now 10mm further
apart, shoulder room has increased by 42mm,

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.390
elbow room by 43mm and hip room by 35mm.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.359
There’s a huge range of adjustment for both
seats and steering wheel, too, so drivers

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.869
of all sizes shouldn’t have any trouble
getting comfortable.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.039
Subaru has made much of the use of new higher
quality materials, and certainly compared

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.479
to the old model, this feels like a proper
premium interior now.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.990
The instruments are now deeply hooded and
feature coloured illumination around their

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.240
outer rim that changes to red when the car
detects an obstacle, orange when the auto

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.649
transmission is in manual mode, or you can
choose one of 10 colours yourself.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.030
The new ventilation controls are much more
intuitive, and we like the Max A/C button

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.389
that comes in handy on hot days.

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:57.049
The big news, though, is the arrival of a
new infotainment system.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.429
We’ve been critical of some of the systems
used by Subaru in the past, but this new one

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.420
is pretty neat.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.990
Its design reminds of the single-sheet-of-glass
look used on high-end plasma TVs, and we particularly

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.239
like the touch-sensitive buttons down each
side.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.010
The menus are all easy to get your head around,
and if you’re a tinkerer there are all kinds

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.690
of info screens to play with.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.930
There’s even a maintenance reminder system
that tells you when to have the tyres rotated,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.930
for example.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.790
Of course, the usual stuff is here, too, such
as Bluetooth connectivity, but there’s also

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.870
the ability to hook up with Starlink to your
smartphone, although curiously there’s no

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.870
DAB digital radio.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.939
As standard, the Outback is equipped with
a pretty decent navigation system with full

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.349
UK post codes, traffic information and the
ability to calculate the most efficient route

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.490
as well as the usual quickest, fastest, etc,
plus a reversing camera that gives a good

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.040
view of the rear bumper making it easy to
hitch up a trailer.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.590
Rear seat passengers will be better off than
in the old model, as there’s now substantially

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.310
more shoulder, elbow and hip room, plus more
legroom and foot space, too.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.189
And, of course, there’s still the facility
to recline the seat backs for longer journeys.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.400
As if that wasn’t enough, there’s now
33 litres more boot space at 559 litres, a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.010
new 47-litre underfloor compartment where,
incidentally, there’s still space to store

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.030
the load cover when not in use, and the seats
fold easily thanks to a pair of levers in

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.579
the boot walls to convert the boot into an
area with a flatter floor than before, now

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.989
measuring a massive 1,848 litres.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.219
Oh, there’s also a new power tailgate, too,
and it includes a handy memory feature that

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.099
stops you clouting a low ceiling.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.510
Under the bonnet, there’s a choice of two
engines, starting with the familiar 2.0-litre

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.879
boxer diesel with 150PS and 350Nm of torque,
plus a 2.5-litre petrol unit with 175PS and

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.090
235Nm.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.629
Subaru says they’ve been substantially reworked,
with both delivering more torque lower in

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.769
the range as well as greater efficiency.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.780
The petrol engine is only available with Subaru’s
Lineartronic CVT transmission, while the diesel

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:10.209
is also available with a six-speed manual.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.120
On the road, the diesel is much quieter than
before, thanks to more sound-deadening in

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.480
the engine bay, and once you’re on the move,
it settles down to a distant rumble that – at

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.370
times – is barely audible.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.830
While we’re not fans of CVT transmissions
in general, when hooked up to the diesel engine,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.310
Subaru’s Lineartronic does at least resist
the urge to peg itself at the redline when

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.800
you put your down, and unlike other CVT units
its overtaking ability is actually pretty

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.770
credible.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.020
There is a manual mode that allows you to
use the steering wheel-mounted paddles to

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.960
switch between seven ‘fake’ pre-set ratios,
but to be honest, the Outback prefers to just

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.830
take things easy, and that means it’s best
to leave it in auto mode.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.500
That’s not to say the Outback can’t be
hustled along, because it can.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.680
You wouldn’t think a car with 200mm of ground
clearance could handle so well, but Subaru

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.160
have made substantial changes to the suspension
aimed at improving turn-in and reducing body

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.031
roll, and I have to say, we’re impressed
with the results.

00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:14.050
It helps that they’ve also implemented an
active torque vectoring function that applies

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.820
the brakes to the inside wheels during cornering
to help reduce understeer, plus of course

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.970
there’s Subaru’s trademark all-wheel-drive
system that maintains a 60/40 front/rear split

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.140
on auto models, 50/50 on manual cars.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.530
The new suspension also features a number
of changes to improve the ride, and this,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.250
too, impresses.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.290
The Outback makes the most of its long-travel
suspension to absorb the worst of the bumps

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.520
with ease, and it’s surprising just what
you can drive over without having any impact

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.870
on those in the cabin.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.740
Also new for this year is Subaru’s EyeSight
system, although it’s only available on

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.870
cars with Lineartronic transmission.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.470
It uses a pair of cameras mounted by the rear-view
mirror to detect other vehicles and obstacles

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.340
up to 110 metres ahead, and can take control
of the throttle and brakes to help avoid a

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.430
collision, but the system also adds functions
such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.550
warning and a few others.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.759
The cruise control is pretty effective, with
the system applying the brakes or accelerating

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.850
to match the speed of the car in front.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.840
We did find the lane departure system to be
a little paranoid, though, often sounding

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.210
a warning about crossing a white line even
when we were indicating, and although you

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.870
can turn it off, it switches back on again
when you restart the car.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:33.270
Prices for the new Outback start at £27,995,
with all models getting LED headlights, heated

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.710
seats, and satnav as standard.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.950
Premium models gain a sunroof, keyless entry,
18-inch wheels, power tailgate and leather

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.580
seats for three grand more.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.759
Pick of the bunch for us would be the entry-level
diesel model – it’s a great engine, we

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.410
prefer the manual transmission to the Lineartronic,
and the Outback is so well equipped the top-spec

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.370
Premium model doesn’t seem necessary.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.830
Plus, of course, if you want practical, go-anywhere
capability but don’t want a full-sized SUV,

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:14.120
let’s not forget the Subaru Outback is the
original crossover.
