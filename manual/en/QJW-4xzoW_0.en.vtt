Hey there and welcome to ChicPeek DIY! I'm
Jade Seah. If you have a pair of black boots

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.000
that you love - you know, they're super comfy
- but you want to add a bit of preppy spice

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to your look, well here is the DIY for you!

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.630
So what you want to do is look at the boot. Measure it, and figure out how much of it
you want covered.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.100
So in this case, I'll probably go with this
much, and this much across.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.620
So you're going to want to draw out a kind
of trapezoid; where it kind of fans out at

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.079
the bottom, with a slimmer part on top.
Cut out this template.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.190
This is important -- you've got to measure
your template against your boot. So this part

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.749
is slimmer; it goes into the boot. So I think
that's about perfect for me.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:54.109
Now go ahead and cut out two pieces following
this template onto a fabric of your choice

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.999
-- mine is a bit more 'suede-ish', so I've
picked suede.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.300
Just kind of measure it up and see how it
looks on your boot -- it looks quite cute!

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.790
So I'm going to probably cut about an inch
and a half -- just keep going along the length

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.430
of the whole piece of material.
Okay, so now you've kind of got a little fringe;

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.290
you're going to want to cut a sort of V shape
to add a bit more interest. Let me show you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.460
-- kind of like that, so it's a point. So
keep going on down the length of the fabric.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.940
So it kind of looks a lot cuter like that!
So now, kind of figure out again how much

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.700
of the shoe you want to cover -- I think I'm
going to go somewhere like that.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.770
So you're going to want to pierce two holes;
somewhere here, and somewhere here; and kind

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.700
of expand them a little bit -- enough that
you can feed thread or cord of your choice

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.970
through. And so now's the fun part where you
can kinda personalise it; you can pick any

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.670
sort of string, cord, ribbon; you can use
like leather thread or suede thread -- whatever

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.030
your choice -- just thin enough that you can
tie it into a bow; that's quite important.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.030
So thread it through the hole. This is kind
of like what you're going to do -- be sure

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:18.329
to leave enough space for you ankle and for
it to fit around the boot. I would actually

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.989
fit it around the boot rather than the ankle;
that looks nicer. Then you can tie a pretty

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.879
bow!
Ok now once you're done with the bow, you

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.870
can just kind of snip of the ends, depending
on how much you want it to dangle -- and you're

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.569
done!
Or you can add one extra trimming -- which

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.199
I kind of want to do!
So I've picked these beads off this old bracelet

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.200
-- so this is a good way to repurpose your
old jewellery.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.999
Now let me just thread it through. Have them
hang about this length; so you're just going

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:50.689
to have to tie a little knot, to make sure
they don't fall out...there you go. And volia!

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.239
Your little Oxford bootie!
So you can personalise this -- for me, I like

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.999
red, so I've picked red.
You can choose basically any kind of cord,

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.659
any kind of material; you can match your shoe,
or you can do it in a contrasting shade -- like

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.060
this would be quite cute even if this weren't
in black so just play around, and let your

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.529
imagination run wild!
