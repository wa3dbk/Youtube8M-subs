00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.109
Question: How do you prevent lint from getting
into your dreadlocks?

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:07.109
Answer?

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.390
You can't.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.910
That's right.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.179
I'm Nappy Headed Black Girl and I'm here to
tell you that there's no way you can keep

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.430
your dreads absolutely, completely lint free.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.420
There are, however, things that you can do
to help minimize the amount of lint that your

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.420
hair attracts.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.050
Let's take a look.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.110
The easiest prevention method is to keep your
dreads covered when possible.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.050
Covering your hair helps prevent it from attracting
debris in the air and also fibers that it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.760
may come in contact with from your clothes.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.440
I use and recommend the Dreadsock.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.890
It’s lightweight, breathable, and it's made
from a smooth, non-woven material.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.480
Stay away from products like beeswax, grease,
and pomades as they are lint magnets.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.630
Also be careful with the amount of oil you
use.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.399
Excess simply sits on top of the hair and
practically begs for lint.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.569
Along the same lines, please keep your hair
clean to prevent build-up.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:11.719
When you have layers of product on your hair
you increase your odds of attracting lint.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:17.289
Giving your hair a thorough brushing can help
bring dirt and debris to the surface, increasing

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.820
your chances of eliminating it.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.340
Take your time when doing each section and
concentrate on possible problem areas like

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.899
the nape where lint often attaches.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.490
I use a soft boar bristle brush like the one
in the picture.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.869
You can also use a clothes lint brush daily
to catch surface lint.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.759
Sleeping on cotton is a no-no.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.259
It attracts lint and robs your hair of moisture.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.969
There are two measures you can take at bedtime
to help keep your hair lint-free.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:54.249
You can use satin or silk sheets and pillows
and you can simply cover your dreads at night.

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.200
I do both.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.899
If you choose to towel-dry your hair, buy
ones specifically for this purpose.

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.050
Microfiber towels are great because they’re
lint-free and have a smooth surface, unlike

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.329
traditional cotton towels which can leave
behind lint and can damage your hair.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.870
And never scrub your dreads when drying.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.870
Think “pat and squeeze.”

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.870
And there you have it.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.870
Did I miss anything?

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.480
Hit me up in the comments and let me know.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.120
And be sure tp look out for the follow-up
to this video, "How To Get Lint Out Of Your

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.650
Dreads."

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
I'm Nappy Headed Black Girl, and I'll talk
to you later.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.360
Bye.
