00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:19.057
Five years ago,
Ian was diagnosed with

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:22.580
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.727
That started us on our journey
of time here at Hopkins and

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:33.100
dealing with what ended up
being on a rather long journey.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.086
&gt;&gt; This is Ian.

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:39.120
&gt;&gt; I was here when he was here.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.665
&gt;&gt; We're here today to deliver
our first production run

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:46.998
of comfort line garments, which
were developed while our son Ian

00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:49.376
was here being treated for
cancer.

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:51.543
So here's the onesie.

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:55.848
The problem that we found
through the course of our son's

00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:59.797
treatment was that there
were no effective means for

00:00:59.797 --> 00:01:04.030
safely securing and
safeguarding a central line.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.252
So Emily took it upon herself

00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:13.760
to modify a child's garment.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.150
&gt;&gt; It has some snaps down
the front of the garment, and

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.340
has a pocket which opens and
the central line device is being

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.060
able, you can feed it through,
and it snaps in place, and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.730
it keeps the child from yanking
the device out of their chest.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.670
The parent doesn't have to
be as cautious of every

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.140
little move the child makes,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.260
because the garment will take
the tug instead of the tug

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.560
coming directly from the site
on the child's chest.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.669
&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; To see it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.150
functioning in the same way that
we saw it function for Ian.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.020
&gt;&gt; And he was about the same age
as our son was when we first

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.406
came, and to be able to see him
moving about and thinking oh,

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:56.960
this is pretty cool.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.796
&gt;&gt; Knowing that it can make
a difference for this child, and

00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:04.215
this child's parents, and

00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:07.560
the wonderful people
here at Hopkins.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.686
It's difficult to
put into words, but

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:14.293
I can tell you that it
means everything to us.
