Party Planner: How To:
Cooking With Guests: Dessert

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.160
Hello, I'm Joey Altman, author of 
the book, Without Reservations, 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.050
how to make restaurant style food easily at home. 
And today I'm gonna share with you

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.000
some great recipes for entertaining restaurant style
in your own home.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.220
Now it's time for my favorite part 
of our Italian themed dinner,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.030
the dessert. I'm gonna show you how to make
a dark chocolate

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.070
and mascarpone tiramisu, which, translated, 
means "pick me up,"

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.120
the reason they call it a pick me up
is because it has coffee in the syrup

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.110
that we imbibe the ladyfingers with. 
And that gives you a little "pick me up," but first

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.030
let me show you how I make the dark chocolate 
mousse. I have some melted chocolate here,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.250
with some butter, that's melted and then 
cooled to room temperature.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.040
I have egg yolks and sugar, 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.190
that are beaten to a pale yellow 
color,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.020
so the chocolate I melted over a double boiler,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.190
and I'm gonna let it cool, and I take that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.180
luscious melted chocolate, and I 
add that right to our egg yolk and sugar mixture.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.240
Then I have some whipped cream, with a little sugar,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.190
so now my whipped cream is in there 
and I'm gonna carefully fold

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.000
the whipped cream into the chocolate butter and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.130
egg mixture. By placing the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.170
spatula in the bottom and then 
just flipping it over, just like that,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.260
so now it's mixed plenty, 
and I'm gonna take my meringue 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.250
and this mixture is made with a little bit of sugar 
and whites that were left over from 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.060
when I separated my eggs, and I'm gonna add

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.170
about a third of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.020
the egg whites, and I'm gonna fold those in, 
and this I can be a little bit 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.120
um, less gentle with, then I take 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.230
the next third and I'm a little 
bit more delicate with it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.020
because I don't want to lose any of that aeration, 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.120
just gently fold that in, and maintain as 
much of the aeration as possible

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.040
to keep our mousse nice and light, 
this is looking really good,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.260
look how light and fluffy that looks, 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.070
that's beautiful!

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.250
So the first part of assembling the tiramisu is 
I'm gonna use

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.080
some ladyfingers that I bought at 
the store - in the book I show you how to make them

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.040
but buying them already made is totally 
fine,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.090
and I'm gonna soak them in this syrup I made 
with dark coffee and a little Kahlua, 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.100
rum, and brandy. And I just

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.110
dip them in there, and I just lay them 
in the bottom of the bowl.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.100
I really love using this glass-footed 
bowl from Pottery Barn because

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.260
you can see all the great layers inside 
as you're building it,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
it's really important to only dip 
them in a little bit, 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.180
don't put too many in at one time,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.010
because then they'll sog out 
and get really mushy,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.220
and you want them to get soft in here, 
not in here, 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.040
Okay, so now I have my bottom layer 
of the ladyfingers, 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.070
and now I'm gonna add my chocolate mousse 
right on top of that,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.130
yum, yum, yum, now I'm gonna repeat the process 
of adding

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.240
the ladyfingers right on top 
of the chocolate mousse. Okay, so the final

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.270
layer of our tiramisu is the mascarpone mousse 
and this is some heavy whipping cream,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.240
and sugar, vanilla bean, and 
mascarpone Italian cheese,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.030
just whipped together,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.220
so to get a nice smooth top, chefs 
use an offset spatula like this

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.080
and just gently pushing it, angling 
the blade of the spatula

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.200
and turning the bowl, so push it out,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.140
and then turn the bowl,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.210
and you want it to be a little 
bit higher in the middle,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.080
just like that, and then

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.080
using the sides of the spatula, start 
going to the outside, like that,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.050
from the middle, and this way you get a nice even

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.130
and smooth top.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.020
Voila! 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.170
Now this is best made a day ahead of time, 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.200
wrapped in plastic and stored in the 
refrigerator.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.190
Then right before serving, take 
it out of your refrigerator,

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.080
and you can garnish it with chocolate.
