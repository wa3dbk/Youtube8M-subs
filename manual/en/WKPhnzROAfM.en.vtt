00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.190
&gt;&gt; Clint Gage: [SOUND] Hey guys,
as you know, the Oscars were last night.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.590
And, as usual, they were filled with
all the standard Oscar greatness.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.310
All the movie stars were out.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.840
All of the sexy red carpet fashions and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.460
all the awards going to all
the people we knew would win them.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.680
But, most importantly,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.840
they had all the crazy little moments
that are worth talking about today.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.530
So, we here at Cinefix just wanna
say thank you to the Academy.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.280
&gt;&gt; Ti: First of all,
I would like to thank DVR's everywhere for

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.730
making sure that I was able to watch
the Oscars in under 40 minutes.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.290
&gt;&gt; Philliam: I would like to thank
number one, the west coast and

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.690
time zones in general for the Oscars
ending at 9 pm here in Los Angeles.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.959
So I was actually able to go to bed
at a decent hour which is the first

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:38.350
time in my life.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.320
&gt;&gt; Ethan: There’s so many people,
I'd love to thank Pharrell Williams, for

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.190
being just a classy gentleman and wearing
his black tie Arby’s had to the event.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.875
&gt;&gt; Ron Babcock: Also,
I'd like to thank Jared Leto for

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:48.790
looking like Jesus after a hot shower.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.220
&gt;&gt; Mackenzie: I wanna thank the Academy
for letting Spike Jonze win.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.080
Because it really just confirmed
that I’m brilliant and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.100
I didn’t waste all that time watching
her over and over and over again.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.700
Telling everyone else to watch
her over and over and over again.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.430
&gt;&gt; Philliam: I would like to thank
the people who work at Twitter,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.720
specifically the engineers for
being on call when Ellen broke Twitter.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.530
Cuz let's be honest,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.400
you spend more time actually looking
at Twitter than at the actual Oscars.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.020
&gt;&gt; Ti: I also wanna thank
Matthew McConaughey,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.470
because just like you, my hero is
Matthew McConaughey ten years from today.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.490
&gt;&gt; Ethan: I'd like thank
Benedict Cumberbatch for

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.140
bringing back the photobomb.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.010
Thank you for just being behind
everybody in all the photos this year.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.290
&gt;&gt; Tim: I wanna thank
Lupita Nyong'o's amazing dress.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.130
It was beautiful.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.880
It stole the show,
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.449
&gt;&gt; Clint Gage: Wow, this thing's
heavier than it looks [LAUGH].

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:35.220
&gt;&gt; Tim: I wanna thank Jennifer Lawrence

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.800
falling before she even
got inside the building.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.430
&gt;&gt; Clint Gage: I just want
to thank John Travolta.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.152
You know, I know he works really
hard on learning all those words and

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:45.190
Idina Menzel's name ahead of time.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.826
And it just really meant a lot to me,
particularly because my wife was

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:49.880
really looking forward to
seeing Idina Menzel sing.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.190
So to screw up her name right before
she goes on and throw her off her game,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.180
that was, that was really great of you,
John, thanks.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.780
Thank you so much.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.060
&gt;&gt; Tim: I wanna thank Bill Murray for
being Bill Murray, Bill freaking Murray.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Babcock: I'd like
to thank Cate Blanchett for

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.720
looking like a piece of bread
rolled in shards of glass.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.550
&gt;&gt; Tim: I don't know.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.100
Overly earnest Jared Leto.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.190
And Matthew McConaughey.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.130
I didn't understand what he was saying,
but it sounded beautiful.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.200
I don't know, there are just so many.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.820
There are just so many to thank.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.410
I don't know.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.690
That's all, that's all I have.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.550
Thank you everyone, thank you, good night.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.520
&gt;&gt; Clint Gage: So let us know what you
thought about the Oscars from last night.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.370
And make sure to come back for
more movie news on Cinefix Now.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.960
It is Idina.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Is this Idina?

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.680
Is that Idina?

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.400
&gt;&gt; Clint Gage: I think it's Idina Menzel,
I don't know.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.795
I got closer than John Travolta.

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.216
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: [LAUGH]
