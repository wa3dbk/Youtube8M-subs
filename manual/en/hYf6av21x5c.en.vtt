00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.759
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And what do you
say we get outta here...to space and into

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.739
an orbit. That way we could just float around
and be free from the influence of gravity.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.620
Except not really.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.120
Astronauts orbiting around the Earth experience
pretty much the same gravitational pull that

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.820
you and I are feeling right now. The major
difference is that those astronauts are falling,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.390
constantly, towards Earth, but their angular
velocity is so large that they're falling just

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.010
as fast as Earth curves away from them. Now,
of course, this is nothing New...ton's Cannon

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.590
hasn't already taught us.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.560
Gravity makes stuff fall and, in particular,
Newton realized that it makes objects accelerate

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.670
towards the Earth the same amount independently
of how fast they're moving horizontally. That's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.929
called relativity. And, of course, orbiting
is just falling, but falling where you move

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.190
horizontally fast enough that the earth falls
away faster. In order to successfully fall

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.929
and miss the Earth, unless you dug a tunnel,
you need to be travelling at over 17,000 mph

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.300
or 8 km every second. So, you'd probably
incinerate from friction with the air, well

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.040
before you had a chance to enjoy the trip.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.960
Of course, Newton's thought experiment involved
the Earth, but on something smaller, like

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.760
the Moon, the cannon wouldn't have to throw
its projectile nearly as fast for it to complete

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.380
an orbit. In fact, if you had a powerful enough
gun on the Moon and you fired that gun at

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.590
the horizon and then waited a little bit,
you could get hit in the back of the head

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.210
by the same bullet.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.450
Henry calculated that the bullet would have
to travel about 1,600 m/s, which is exactly

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.000
how fast the Paris gun fires.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.450
Now, that's a powerful gun, it's no squirt
gun. But if you had a squirt gun, out there

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.310
in space, and you fired a stream of water
at the Sun, how much water would it take to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.380
put out the Sun? I mean, in general, putting
water on something hot would cause that something

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.880
hot to lose some heat, especially since the
water will be frozen because it's out there

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.660
in space. But, here's the issue. The Sun is
not a big ball of hydrogen on fire. Instead,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.540
the Sun is powered by fusion.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.599
Fusion of Hydrogen nuclei, which is kind of
like the chemical bonds between the Hydrogen

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.459
and Oxygen that make up water, except on a
much smaller and much more powerful scale.

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.199
Now, before I get tackled by nuclear physicists
from one side, and chemists from the other,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.280
let me explain.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.380
A bond of any sort, whether between planets,
molecules, atoms, nuclei or quarks is just

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.240
a happenstance where two or more particles
together have a lower total energy than when

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.400
they were apart. Like if you get married
and your taxes go down. So, when you form

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.739
a bond, that extra energy that the two solitary
particles had is released, and because of

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.699
a little relation we called "E=mcÂ²," this
actually means that the mass of the pair goes

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.359
down a little bit too.

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.259
For example, every fusion reactions turns
a little bit of Hydrogenous mass into light.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.780
Sunlight, for example, amounts to a loss of
100 quadrillion kg each year. That's the equivalent

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.370
of a medium sized asteroid. But stars have
a lot of mass and the more massive a star

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.690
is, the hotter it burns. And adding a bunch
of water to the Sun would only cause it to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.750
be more massive, so it would burn brighter,
not go out. Of course, it would also burn

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.610
faster, which means that its life would be shorter.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.480
For instance, if you were to add 20 solar
masses of water to the Sun, you would decrease

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.849
its life expectancy from the current 5 billion
years to only a few hundred million more years.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.609
But there's a faster way to put out the Sun.
Take that water, or whatever material you

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.689
want, and shoot it into the Sun in a way that
causes everything to get spread out and scattered,

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:47.060
so that there's no longer the critical density
needed for fusion to occur. Now, no matter

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.780
which avenue of putting out the Sun you pick,
both would be a disaster. Literally, disaster.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.760
From "Dis," meaning "against," and "aster"
meaning star, you would have literally turned

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.000
our own star against us.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.240
If you were somehow able to avoid that disaster
by magically appearing in inter-galactic space,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.980
here's a fun experiment to try. Take out your
gun and fire a bullet. That bullet will be

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.329
forever alone.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.900
That's because the universe is expanding,
and if you were a few megaparsec's away from

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.400
the nearest galactic cluster, on average those
galaxies would be 200 km father away from

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.840
you every passing second. In space terms,
200 km per second is pretty slow. It's barely

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.760
as fast as the solar system orbits the center
of the Milky Way. And stars closer to the

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.620
center of the galaxy can orbit 10 times faster.
But a measly bullet travels only a few km

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.600
every second and would have no chance of reaching
the receding galaxies, ever.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.640
It makes you realize how tiny we are compared
to the scale of the universe. But it also

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.000
makes you realize how close together we all
are here on Earth. Of course, to get from

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.940
one side of the Earth to the other, you have
to fly over half the sphere.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.809
So, what if instead there was a tunnel through
the Earth? Let's jump over to my channel,

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:13.489
Minute Physics, to see what happens.
Click here and I'll see you on the other side.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.300
Oh, and as always,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.400
thanks for watching.
