Welcome to howtocookthat I am Ann Reardon
and this is an easy buttercream rainbow cake.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.260
Firstly you need to make up your buttercream,
the recipe for that is on the blog howtocookthat.net

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.950
there is a link in the description below this
video.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.890
All you do is add the butter and icing sugar,
stir well then and whisk for about 5 minutes

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.279
on high speed until it is pale and fluffy.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.029
Add a tiny bit of milk but not much because
you are going to be adding a fair bit of liquid

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.050
colour to get those bright rainbow colors.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
Split two thirds of your frosting into 5 bowls
and add your chosen colours to each bowl.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.300
Now to get the really bright colours here
you will have to add quite a bit of liquid

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.280
colour, so add it a tablespoon at a time until
you get a colour you are happy with.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.989
Then take each colour and place it into a
plastic bag push it down into the corner and

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.859
twist the top to stop the icing from oozing
out the top when you squeeze the bag.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.699
Take half of the remaining uncoloured frosting
and put that in a bag also.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.469
Put your bottom layer of cake onto a plate
and pipe a cirlce of uncoloured frosting around

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.469
the edge.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.220
Then you can either put buttercream in the
middle as well or you can use a filling.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.450
Here I am using home made lemon curd.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.070
Having the layer of buttercream around the
edge helps contain the filling and stops it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.240
from oozing out the side of the cake and effecting
the decorating.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.860
Repeat this with the next layer of cake as
well.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.590
Then take a palette knife and smooth the buttercream
that is in the joins adding more if necessary.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.760
So you have a nice flat finish.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.200
Place a thin layer of buttercream on the top
of your cake just to level it out.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.460
Cut the corner off each of your coloured bags
and then starting at the bottom pipe of blob

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.290
of each colour repeating them when you get
to the top going through a pattern.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.570
Take a spoon that's been dipped in hot water
and push it sort of half way along the blob

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.430
and drag it across the cake.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.400
So just push it in and drag it across.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.580
Keep doing that all the way up the cake.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.890
Then for your next row of blobs you need to
pipe the colour that was just above the one

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.410
that you are currently doing on the previous
row.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.870
And continue in this pattern the whole way
up.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.390
Use your spoon to spread them out and keep
piping and around the cake.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.980
On the top of the cake pipe blobs in a circle
shape smearing them one at a time.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.190
Until you have filled in all of the gaps.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.890
