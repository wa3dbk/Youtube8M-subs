TONY KAPECHUK: Hi, my name is Tony. And on
behalf of Expert Village, I'll be showing

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.390
you how to turn this check socket into a laminated
definitive prosthesis. Now, we're ready to

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.700
laminate. Some of the things we'll be using
now are PVA bags which will act as a barrier

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.190
against our cast. We'll need a wet towel and
some carbon fiber. This will be the strength

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.500
of our socket, and as well as some nylon with
fiberglass mixed in with it. It will also

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.390
help us pick up a little of the pigment. All
right, we're ready to soak our six-inch PVA

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.820
bag. We'll let it soak for about three to
six minutes, and we'll just wrap it up, like

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.731
so. This will help soften up the bag and it
will be easier to apply. While our bag is

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:52.060
soaking, we can apply some Vaseline to our
cast. This will help the bag slide on easier

00:00:52.060 --> 00:01:22.869
too. All right, our bag should be ready now.
We'll go ahead and dry up some of this excess

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:42.579
moisture on the bag. There is a seam on this
bag. You want to place this in the back of

00:01:42.579 --> 00:02:13.629
the prosthesis. I'm going to pull the bag
down all the way so it's a nice tight fit

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:35.319
at the top. Now, we're ready to tape it. You
can tape it off with some clear stretched

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:46.329
tape.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:03:00.780
You want to tape the lid with no wrinkles
and no more than two layers. Now, we can trim

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:28.650
the excess of the bag off. Now, we can just
use some black tape to tape off the bottom

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.939
of the bag. We're going to tape off above
this fit port so our first bag can get vacuumed.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:50.760
Go ahead and trim the excess of the bag off.
And we'll seal that off with some more tape.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:59.540
Please note that there's a--okay. Please note
there's a hole in this. You don't want to

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:10.480
tape off this 'cause this is where your second
bag will be taped off. Okay. Now, we'll install

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.720
our release dummy. This is where the bottom
will go to release the prosthesis. Again,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:34.650
we're going to Vaseline any threaded parts.
Then we'll use our razor blade to cut away

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:46.460
the tape from the hole. You can clean out
any putty that's in there from the filling

00:04:46.460 --> 00:05:02.040
part. Okay. We'll use plumber's putty to fill
this hole too so no resin leaks in.
