00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.400
So its tomato growing time of the year
And in today's video we will see how to grow

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.749
great tomatoes in containers

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.260
So if you've been growing tomatoes in containers,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.640
you know there can be a lot of issues to deal
with

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.340
In today's video we will see how to deal with
some of these issues

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.919
And we will see two varieties of tomatoes
today

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.439
The first one is the Heinz Super Roma Tomato

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.460
And the other variety we will be seeing is

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.310
The Ace 55 Hybrid Tomato

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.100
A nice determinate variety of tomato

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.400
And that brings us to our first tip

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.600
Grow determinate varieties in containers

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.819
When growing in containers you're restricted
with size 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.020
So make sure you choose determinate

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.579
varieties which don't grow like crazy
And still produce a lot of tomatoes

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.579
And do well with minimal staking

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.780
When choosing the soil to use for your tomato plants

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.300
Use a Potting Mix and not Potting Soil

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.619
Potting Mixes are usually more expensive but
they are well worth the money

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.439
Because they contain good ingredients that
your tomato plants will love

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.060
So do not use potting soil, using potting
mixes

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.580
Even determinate plants need staking

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.740
So make sure you stake your tomato plants very well

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.539
You can use tomato cages, re-bars, garden

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.509
stakes, twines
Just make sure they are staked

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.200
One of the most common complaints of growing tomatoes in containers

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.800
Is that they get  Blossom End Rot or BER

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.940
And I'm going to tell you how to fix this very easily

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.320
The reason why tomatoes get BER is because

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.300
of lack of Calcium and irregular watering

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.780
So make sure you enrich the soil with Gypsum

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.940
which is Garden Lime

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.980
And add a little bit of peat moss to neutralize the Lime

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.479
Gypsum or Garden Lime contains Calcium

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.360
And also make sure you keep your tomato plant
well watered using a drip irrigation system

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.220
When using fertilizers remember that when
your plants are young

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.520
You need more leaves and foliage

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.860
So make sure you use a high Nitrogen or a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.020
balanced fertilizer so that you get good growth
and a good start for your tomato plants

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.740
As the plant grows and starts producing flowers

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.420
You need to stop giving high Nitrogen fertilizers to your tomato plants

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.310
And start using a low
Nitrogen, High phosphorus, potassium fertilizer

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.900
And also make sure you keep adding Calcium using
Garden Lime or Tomato fertilizers that contain Calcium

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.860
You do not want to use a high Nitrogen fertilizer

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.510
when the plant is flowering
This is a common mistake

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.620
To make sure you get the maximum yield from
your tomato plants, you need to make sure

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.740
that each and every flower gets converted
into tomato

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.620
Well if not all at least most of them
And as you can see we have a lot of tomatoes

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.900
on this plant in this container
And that's because we have hand-pollinated

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.050
these tomato plants
I have explained how to hand pollinate tomato

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.190
plants in another video
So be sure to check out the link that you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.720
see on your screen
And that goes over the process in detail

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.060
One of the reasons you need to hand pollinate
tomatoes is because the bee population is

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.390
constantly decreasing
And even if you have a lot of bees in your

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.550
area, hand pollinating assures many more tomatoes!

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.700
While your tomato plant is growing well, make

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.430
sure you add some Epsom salt in water and
bathe your tomato plants

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.320
You can also add some Aspirin in water and
water your tomato plants

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.480
Aspirin is known to control a lot of diseases
- usually fungal diseases that a tomato plant

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.090
could have. So it does do a good job
The Epsom salt is going to add Magnesium and

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.730
Sulfate
And that's great food for your tomato plants

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.600
You do not need to use any insecticide on
your tomato plants till you see any problems

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.719
But when you do see insects we come to our
next Tip

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:31.939
Make sure you use either Neem Oil or Spinosad,
which are organic insecticides to control

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.699
insects on your tomato plants

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.100
When you see pests on your tomato plants you

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:42.340
need to spray them at least every 3 weeks
if not,  about a month

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.280
Or you can do it whenever you see insects
on your tomato plants

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.249
And as you can see by following some simple tips

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:54.949
You can grow a lot of tomatoes in small spaces and containers

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.840
So let's go ahead and harvest some tomatoes from this container

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.479
Now from this 5 or 6 gallon container that

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.419
the tomato plant is growing in, you can expect
to get a lot of tomatoes

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.319
And if you're not getting enough tomatoes,
make sure you follow all tips in this video

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.639
properly and then give it a shot!

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.620
When harvesting tomatoes, its best to let

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.149
them ripen on the vine

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.340
They just taste a lot better that way

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.800
If the tomato is partially ripe it will still
ripen at room temperatures

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.520
This one is the Heinz tomato

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.479
And let's harvest another one - this is the

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.019
Ace 55 tomato

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.840
So that's how your tomatoes should look like

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.409
- clear skin, nice tomatoes, no Blossom End
Rot

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.759
And if you follow the tips in this video correctly,I
am sure you'll be on your way to growing great

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.419
tomatoes in your containers

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.080
So I wanted to show you how one of these tomatoes

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.930
looks like
This is the Heinz tomato - yes the same company

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.150
that makes the ketchup
Not sure why its called Heinz, probably a

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.150
good tomato for making paste and ketchup
And let's cut it open

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.180
So that tomato looks pretty good
And you can use it for almost anything you

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:26.180
can think of - sandwiches, paste, ketchup,
almost anything

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.490
So I'll see you soon again in another episode
of California Gardening

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.559
Until then...Happy Gardening!
