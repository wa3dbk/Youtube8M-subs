00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.910
Edwin: Bachata pattern for beginners.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.440
This pattern is going to start with the basic
five, six, seven and one, two, three, four,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.559
five, six, seven and one, two, three, four,
in out in and one, two, three, four, in out

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:31.060
in and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.160
eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
and eight.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.350
Now let's break it down.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.510
We're going to start with a basic five, six,
seven and one, two, three, four, five, six

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.930
and stop right here.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.329
We're getting ready to do the push and pull.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.050
So first thing gentlemen, is to create the
space for the ladies to be able to come in.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.980
We're going to push off one, two, three and
tap for your break.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.249
Here, we're going to pull each other in, so
she's pulling me as well.

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:05.659
We pull, push back, pull and the tap comes
to the middle, and now we're ready to start

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.040
all over again for one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven and eight.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.700
Daniela: Ladies, remember the resistance that
we spoke about earlier, in our arms?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.950
Make sure you use your muscles, so the guy's
not pushing the air and he's actually pushing

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.950
you.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.390
Edwin: And gentlemen, be careful not to push
the ladies or pull the ladies too much.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.300
Remember that they are in heels and they need
to feel that support from you.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.760
Make sure that you just push, pull, push and
pull.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.760
Let's try it one more time.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.660
Five, six, seven and one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven and one, two, three, four,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.530
in out in and one, two, three, four, in out
in.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.580
Now the next part is for the ladies' turn,
so we're going to start with the basic one,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.090
two, three, four.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.320
Gentlemen, we prop the ladies up.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.310
This time she's not going to spin fast, so
give her time.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.370
Just hold her hand up,and let her show off
here, a little bit of her sexiness.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.690
Daniela: So we're going to go for a four corner
turn.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.690
What does that mean?

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.820
We're going to spot the first corner and turn.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.890
Spot the second corner, third corner, and
the fourth corner brings me back to my partner.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.180
Edwin: And gentlemen, as this is happening
you're making sure that you're letting the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.239
ladies take the corners, each and every corner.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.709
It's going to emphasize on her hips, so overdoing
is marking the time.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.709
Let's try that slowly.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.599
Five, six, basic and one, two, three, tap.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.900
Here she goes, tap.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.099
Daniela: One, two, three, tap.

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.860
Five, six, seven, tap.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.819
One, two, three, tap and five, six, seven,
tap.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.219
Edwin: Now let's demonstrate this with music.

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:57.079
Daniela: Remember ladies, feel sexy, move
your hips.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:10.319
Edwin: We're going to demonstrate it one more
time and different ways that you can add some

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:33.680
variation 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.510
and that is your basic bachata pattern for
couples.
