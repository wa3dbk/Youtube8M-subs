00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.640
You thought you were SO smart!

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.270
You thought you KNEW where lightning came
from, but you don't.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:15.850
Because it comes from the SUN.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.460
Howdy light bulbs, Trace here comin' atcha
from DNews with your weekly space update!

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.480
Lightning is a fairly common way for nature
to showcase its raw power.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.930
Molecules in the clouds bump and grind on
each other, creating a buildup of static electricity.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.370
As the cloud becomes positively charged, electrons
snake up from the negatively charged ground

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.540
called step leaders.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.950
When the electrons meet SHHHHKKKKK!!

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.170
Lightning!

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.170
Science is awesome.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.079
Anyway, that's what we USED to think, turns
out there's a bigger, badder baller on the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.079
block.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.449
The friggin' SUN.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.430
A new study in Environmental Research Letters
found the solar wind may be affecting the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.879
amount of lightning we're seeing on the ground.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.170
The sun is constantly producing a stream of
electrons and protons travelling a million

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.850
miles an hour flowing in all directions away
from it.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.530
This is commonly called the solar wind -- because
Earth is bathed in the high-speed little buggers

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.950
constantly, and during periods of high solar
activity, like now, the solar wind "blows"

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.110
even stronger.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.000
Though we think of the sun as a solid ball,
it's a giant nuclear furnace made of gas that

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.270
takes 27 days to fully rotate.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.990
The particles it emits are therefore fluctuating
in a predictable pattern as well.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.170
The scientists describe the solar wind as
waves, because it can vary in density, temperature

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.289
and charge, based on where the sun is in its
cycle.

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.680
When these high-energy particles hit Earth's
magnetic field, we get aurora, and they usually

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.630
just bounce off and keep going.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.500
However, when a relatively slow wave is overtaken
by a relatively fast wave it overwhelms Earth's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.259
magnetic shield and some of the particles
break into the upper atmosphere, charging

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.299
up the clouds and causing an increase in either
frequency or intensity of lightning.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:07.009
They weren't exactly clear on which of those
it was...

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.120
It's not just our sun causing this static
buildup, when OTHER stars explode millions

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.450
of light-years away, they ALSO send out these
high-energy particles and some of them do

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.989
eventually hit us too.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.690
Mathematically, this is mind boggling, right?

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.340
What are the chances of a star exploding millions
of years ago at JUST the right time to shoot

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.080
out a particle which after millions of years
will hit US and cause a lightning strike that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.390
will FINALLY give me super powers?

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.390
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?!

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.220
Knowing this, the scientists say, might help
improve long-term weather forecasting.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.650
Somehow.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.019
Are you blown away by this solar wind thing?

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.819
Tell us in the comments below and get funky
with it.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.860
Make sure you subscribe and also, space friends,
NEXT Wednesday we doing a Google Hangout with

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.849
NASA/JPL and it's going to rock.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.849
Literally.

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.430
Because we're talking about Meteors.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.660
Check the description for the link to RSVP
and get your questions ready!

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.400
I'm super excited about this, it's going to
be every month!

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.080
Subscribe for more videos every day of the
week and come say hey to us on twitter at-DNews,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.750
or me at-TraceDominguez, and thanks for watching,
y'all are the bestest.
