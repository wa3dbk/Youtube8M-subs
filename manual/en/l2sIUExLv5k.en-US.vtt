00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.220
In this video from ITFreeTraining, I will
look at the different components in Active

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.420
Directory Federation Services. In particular,
this video looks at what each component does

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.570
rather than the features each version of Active
Directory Federation Services has. That, I

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.740
will leave to a different video.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.699
As shown, the components change depending
on which version of Active Directory Federation

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.119
Services you are using. However, most of the
changes are to the name or the location of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.949
the component.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.430
The first component is Active Directory Federation
Services. Windows Server 2012 R2 comes with

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.070
version 3 of Federation Services. The most
noticeable difference is that Federation Service

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.890
is a role only with no separate components.
When you install the role, you are not given

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.649
the choice to install additional components
like in previous versions.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.719
Version 2.1 of Active Directory Federation
was included with Windows Server 2012. The

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.200
name of the role is "Active Directory Federation
Services" and the main component is "Federation

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.329
Services". So the main difference between
this and version 3 is that the Federation

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.959
Service component is now a role rather than
a component of a role.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:23.459
Version 2.0 was an optional download for Windows
Server 2008. Version 1.1 was included with

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:28.709
the operating system. Regardless of which
version you use, Federation Services is a

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:34.179
component of the Active Directory Federation
Services role. So essentially, if you want

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.899
to install the main part of Active Directory
Federation Services, you would install the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.899
Active Directory Federation Services Role
and then select the Federation Service component.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:50.729
The next component that I will look at is
the proxy component. I will have a closer

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.229
look at this in a moment, but essentially
it is installed on the DMZ and provides communication

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.539
between the internet and the Active Directory
Federation Server.

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.559
In Windows Server 2012 R2, the big change
is this component has been moved out of the

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:11.349
Active Directory Federation Services role
and into the remote access role. The component

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.000
is now called "Web Application Proxy".
It still provides the same basic functionality

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.780
as it did in the previous versions. In all
the previous versions of Active Directory

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.930
Federation Services, the component is called
"Federation Services Proxy" and is part

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.040
of the Active Directory Federation Services
role.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.599
The last component that I will look at is
the Web Agents. In version 3.0 of AD FS these

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.480
web agents have been removed and are no longer
available. In version 2.1 and previous versions,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.840
they are available as components of the Active
Directory Federation Services role.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.909
In a moment I will have a closer look at the
Web Agents, but essentially there is no real

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:58.439
difference between the different versions
of AD FS other than a small name change. In

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:05.269
the later version of AD FS the web agents
have the version number of 1.1 in the name. So

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.140
in effect regardless what the name of the
Web Agent is, they perform the same role and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.400
have the same features regardless which version
of AD FS you are using. I will now have a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.549
look at some of the functionality of these
components.

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.920
The first component I will have a closer look
at is the Web Application Proxy. This component

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.749
is new in Windows Server 2012 R2 and is a
component of Remote Access rather than of

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:37.639
the Active Directory Federation Services role.
It has the same functionality as Federation

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:44.120
Service Proxy and thus replaces it. The point
to remember is that it has the same functionality

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.420
but also has additional functionality. For
example, it also allows applications to be

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.170
published for remote access. This is not a
feature that is required with Active Directory

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.409
Federation Services but shows that this component
can be used for things other than just for

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.930
Active Directory Federation Services.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.739
Regardless of what the component is called
or where it is found in server manager, it

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.999
performs the same basic task. If you consider
that Active Directory Federation Services

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:17.930
needs to be on a server that is a member of
the domain, an administrator will generally

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.819
want to install an Active Directory Federation
Server on their internal network.

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:29.220
If you have a user on the internet that needs
to access this server in order to obtain claims.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.289
You generally do not want a user directly
accessing an internal network from the internet.

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.930
In the case of Active Directory Federation
Services, this user may not be an employee

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.900
from your company.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.080
For this reason, an AD FS Proxy server will
normally be deployed between the user (on

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.810
the DMZ or the perimeter network) and the
internal network. To keep the networks safe,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.699
firewalls are placed between them.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.460
What will happen now is, when the user attempts
to contact the Active Directory Federation

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.830
Server, they will instead contact the AD FS
Proxy Server. The Proxy server will pass the

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.710
request onto the Active Directory Federation
Server. The federation Server will respond

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.710
back to the proxy server. For example if the
user was requesting a claim, it would pass

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.680
this claim to the proxy server. The proxy
server will then send the result back to the

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.250
user.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.099
Now that the user has the claim, they can
use it to contact a claims aware application

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.740
which will most likely be on the DMZ. You
can see that the user at no time needs to

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.610
contact the Active Directory Federation Server
directly. Also, the Active Directory Federation

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.520
Server needs to be a member of the domain
whereas the AD FS proxy does not need to be

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.460
a domain member, which improves security.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.690
It should be pointed out that the user will
use the same address to access the AD FS proxy

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.720
server as they would have if they were to
contact the Active Directory Federation Server

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.680
directly. The AD FS proxy server essentially
is transparent in the process.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.159
The next component that I will look at is
the Active Directory Federation Services Web

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:18.069
agents. These are not available in AD FS 3.0
shipped with Windows Server 20012 R2. If you

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.330
are running an earlier version of AD FS you
have two web agents to choose from. These

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.229
are the Claims Aware Agent and the Windows
Token-Based Agent. The name of the component

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:34.090
may be slightly different depending on which
version of AD FS you are running. A 3rd party

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.729
may also provide their own agent. What they
do is as follows.

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:44.400
Let's say you have an application running
on a server and this server only accepts NT

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.069
security tokens. You also have Active Directory
Federation Services running. The problem is

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:56.599
that it creates a security token that has
a claim in it. However, it is not an NT

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:03.039
security token. To get around this, you have
an agent running in between. This agent will

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:08.270
take a security token issued by Active Directory
Federation Services with the claim inside

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.009
and change it to an NT security token. This
provides a way for claim aware applications

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:20.020
to work with Active Directory Federation Services
that only accept NT Tokens.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.949
Windows NT based authentication is quite old
now and this is probably why Microsoft removed

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:31.439
this feature. The claims aware agents were
usually used with Internet Information Services.

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.539
There are different ways to achieve this using
different software that was previously not

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:41.050
available, so may also be one of the reasons
why Microsoft removed it. The point to remember

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:48.050
is that if you are planning to use AD FS 3.0
these features are no longer available.

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:54.110
Thanks for watching this video from ITFreeTraining;
I hope that you found it informative. I hope

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.300
to see you in other free videos from us for
Active Directory Federation Services and others.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.169
Until then, thanks for watching and see you
next time.
