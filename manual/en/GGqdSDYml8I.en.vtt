Jason: OK in this clip we're going to do side
by side Charleston variation, the two step

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:12.690
drop in promenade position. So it looks like
this. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.840
eight, one, two, one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. So we're inserting those,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.160
that two drop back steps right after the Charleston
basic. The key to this leaders is to make

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.120
sure you've got really a nice contact and
connection in these hands and across the followers

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.220
back. If you don't you're going to start to
do this travel back and leave her there. We

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.309
need to make sure that we've engaged here.
Got a little opposition so that when I go

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.350
back, she goes back. Tara: Yeah, followers,
we're also responsible for providing that

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.870
oppositional connection. So the leader is
going to do something with the connection

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.870
but he can't do it unless we also give it.
So as he's pulling back a little bit, I'm

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.559
going to resist by pushing forward, and then
when he gives a bigger pull backwards, when

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.879
he moves his entire body, then that's going
to carry my body as well. So I want to make

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.800
sure that I don't just let my arms collapse.
If I did that when he tried to go back on

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.040
that initial step, it would look like that.
So I want to keep my own arms engaged as I'm

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.070
providing that opposition. Jason: OK, so let's
try it from another angle. I want to mention

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.060
that leaders, this connection is really what
it's all about. We're sending her back. This

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.710
hand's going along for the ride, but it's
primarily what's going on in this area. Starting

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.390
with the basic. One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, one, two, one two, three,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.160
four, five, six, seven, eight. At the end
of that move, we've just done this travel

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.520
back. We've done five, six, seven, eight,
one, two, rock step, we've got all this momentum

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.640
going this way, here's where you need to kind
of give a little resistance and help stop

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.551
her momentum with that forearm connection.
It was important to get her going this way

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:59.780
to have the hand connection. But we've just
sent her back in a very quick three step drop,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.140
here's where we need to help put on the brakes,
to get back into the regular side by side

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.159
basic.
