00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:03.110
It was funny.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.480
I was actually on YouTube,
and in the UK blogs,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.410
now, I can't tell you if this
is the truth all through all

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.020
of YouTube land, but in
the ones I was watching,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.814
instead of calling it a rant,
they would call it a waffle.

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:19.730
Now, we're going to have
a bloody good waffle.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.360
So get ready, get set.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.450
Strap yourselves in.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.160
We're going to have a waffling
good time and catify the world!

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.970
Come on, you.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.945
First of all, look at this here.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:37.220
Not bad, huh?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.830
Look at that right there.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.720
Kind of prototypical,
but it's coming.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.220
Keep your eyes, your
ears peeled for this one.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.200
Anyhow, today I want to
talk about this concept

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.520
of the raw cat.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.240
And how does that become a rant?

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.200
Very easily.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.010
I don't want to see
a cat in a sweater.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.990
I do not want to see
a cat doing something

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.350
that if a cat could
speak English,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.700
they'd be like, hell no.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.289
What is the raw cat?

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.080
It's the concept that
they use all the time

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.440
when trying to
explain to you guys

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.040
what it is to be pretty much
a wild animal in a home.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.330
Like I've always said, they
wake up in the morning,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.470
they go hunt, catch, kill, eat.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.540
Groom, sleep.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.140
Rinse, repeat.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.370
Let's do it again.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.080
And of course in the meantime,
there's snuggles, there's love,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.560
there's a little
bit of quiet time.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.690
But there's always that raw cat.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.480
There's always that cat who
goes, I need to get up high

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.890
and survey my territory.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.110
I have to get in the
bush and hunt my prey.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.680
It really galls me that we still
sell cat clothes in pet stores.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.580
That we still think it's
OK to sell little tutus.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.650
And I just think
that if we're going

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.770
to encourage them to be their
best cat self within our four

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.110
walls, we have to thank
them for doing stuff for us

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.300
in the first place.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.195
Case in point, this
litterbox, the ones

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:05.340
that are self cleaning so you
never have to look at litter.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.850
We clearly have a hangup
about what cats do.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.790
I don't think that you should
scrub out your litterboxes

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.320
and bleach them, and make
them smell crystal sanitized

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.130
clean to the human nose.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.980
You've heard me talk about what
I think about toilet training

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.480
cats.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.800
It's just-- the
cat would be going,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.830
you want me to go on the toilet?

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.950
Do you know the
massive favor that I'm

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.450
doing for you by going into
a box in the first place?

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.730
I mean out there I could
go in like every 10 feet,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.800
marking everything in sight, and
pooping and peeing everywhere.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.740
And I've been doing it in a box.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.150
I love clicker
training for cats.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.460
You know I love positive
reinforcement, offering,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.490
conditioning, you know
I love all that stuff.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.000
And it keeps cats'
mind and body occupied.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.770
But then we take it a
step farther, you know?

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.470
Once we get to the point where
cats are performing tricks

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.550
for humans, where we charge
admission for cats to,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.089
I don't know, juggle.

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.630
I don't know.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.310
It's just so demeaning
to the animal.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.046
And if you see something
going on where you go,

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:16.450
ugh, follow that
thought for a second.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.000
Animals deserve the same amount
of dignity that humans do.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.140
I mean, at the end of the day,
there are 90+ million cats

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.350
in homes in the United
States for a reason.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.460
We love them.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.070
And we don't love them
because they act like dogs,

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.940
and we don't love them because
they act like children.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.790
I hope that we have
them in our homes

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.410
because they act like
cats, and we respect that.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.920
My hope is this,
folks, is that when

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.320
a cat walks in a room
all regal and lovely,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.146
you just take that
second, and you go, man,

00:03:51.146 --> 00:03:54.390
that is one gorgeous animal.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.950
I don't need to put
a hat on that animal.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.200
I don't need to hide
this animal's litterbox

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.160
underneath a floorboard
in the garage.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.200
I don't need to declaw this cat.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.010
I don't need to make
this cat who he's not.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.990
He's gorgeous just
the way he is.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.390
And I'm telling you, in
terms of the work that I

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.399
do helping people understand
their cats to help

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.779
correct behavior problems,
this is ground zero.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.030
You are who you are,
and likewise, your cat

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.880
is who your cat is.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.150
Now, if you know
me, you know I'm all

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.200
about the challenge line.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.280
I'm all about making your cat
the best version of themselves

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.790
that you can make them.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.810
But that doesn't mean
making them more human.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.160
And that is the period
on that sentence.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.340
I know we've got plenty
more to say about this,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.760
and we can talk about it more
in our upcoming Google Hangouts.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.400
You can also leave me comments
in the comments section

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.900
below here, and let's just--
let's be nice about it,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.460
but let's remember--
what would the cat do?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.640
I'm off to go and enroll
my cat into law school,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.460
because that cat had
better start paying

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.950
the bills around here, man.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.890
You know how much
that cat costs?

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.550
Until next time.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.700
All light, all love,
and all mojo to you.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.761
