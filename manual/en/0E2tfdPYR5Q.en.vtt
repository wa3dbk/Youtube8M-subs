00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:20.587
Sometimes I simply don't like one of my pictures any more. 
Did this ever happen to you ?

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:28.000
I stick then a newspaper with wallpaper paste on the canvas. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The whole is coated with wallpaper paste once again. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You can push the paper with some folds and cracks in it 
and let it dry - this is a beautiful structure. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
After drying, I prime the newly created 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
painting surface with white paint. You don't need to work

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.694
too accurate here - so some curiosities remain. 

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:08.000
The dried wrinkles are now hard. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Of course one cannot paint a photorealistic image on it ;-) 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But the structure is ideal for an abstract image. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I paint with broad bristle brushes pretty colors on 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the surface and create an informal abstract work. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I show this picture just as an example, what you could 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
paint on such a highly textured surface. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Working with the spatula knife is also possible. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now my new little picture is finished. 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Thank you for your interest.
