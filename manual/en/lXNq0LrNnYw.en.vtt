00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.020
My name's Flight Attendant
Amanda Gardner.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.860
I'm a medical officer
in the Air Force.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.140
I'm a doctor who on a
day to day basis,

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.470
I do general medicine.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.510
People have appointments, book
appointments and come and see

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.290
me for their general health.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.420
I also do aviation medicine and
aero-medical evacuations,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.300
and also have had the
opportunity to deploy.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
I joined as a troop, as a
[? clerk ?] supply, and had a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.600
great opportunity to do Bachelor
of Nursing through

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.910
the Air Force, so I did that.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.570
And then I was fortunate
enough to have another

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.800
opportunity to do medicine,
so that's how I got here.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.050
It was a rather long road,
but I made it.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.040
Aviation medicine is a sub
specialisation of medicine, so

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.480
that we have to examine and
declare people fit to do

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.890
things such as fly a fast jet
aircraft, pilot another type

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.130
of aircraft, air traffic
control.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.670
And there are regulations and
standards that apply to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.530
civilian as well as military
operations that we

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.750
need to be aware of.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.270
So that aviation medicine is
done in civvy street, but they

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.830
wouldn't be certifying people to
fly a Hornet, for example.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.870
We certainly can do a minor
operations, minor procedures.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.940
We have x-ray facilities.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.920
We certainly have a lot of
consulting rooms where we have

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.870
some specialists come in
that people can make

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.140
appointments to see.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.720
We have outpatient departments,
so if you sprain

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.890
your ankle playing touch
football, you can come in and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.640
we can attend to that here,
outside of our normal

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.660
appointment hours.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.370
I guess like a small hospital.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.710
There's certainly an element of
team work and camaraderie,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.310
especially if you deploy.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.120
So the people I just deployed
with, you feel an obligation

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.450
to each other to support each
other, and to help each other

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.460
out, and also to enjoy the
good times together.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.760
The deployment to the Middle
East area of operations was

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.950
certainly one of
the highlights.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.780
It was like nothing
here at all.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.430
So it's quite an eye opener.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.995
The country that I was in
invited a whole stack of us

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:56.260
and some of our coalition
friends to this big dinner,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.030
and it was this massive tent.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.150
It was probably the size of
four basketball courts.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.670
So we were quite privileged
to have been invited, and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.820
certainly had it all laid on.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.550
I've got a huge sense of pride,
being in the Air Force.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.885
I feel like I'm doing my bit, if
you like, for the country.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.740
I do feel like I'm
a public servant.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.220
I'm part of an organisation
that there's a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.610
bigger picture to.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.450
Yeah, and there's a sense of
pride in yourself, because I

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.270
do things that I would
never have done if I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.540
wasn't in the Air Force.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.120
Well outside the comfort zone.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.880
Things that I've achieved,
that I just wouldn't even

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.480
consider attempting
as a civilian.
