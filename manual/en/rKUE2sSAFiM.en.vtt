00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.269
So right now Damien is going to demonstrate
how to do the World Dance.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.670
This is the World Dance right here.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.830
So we're going to break it down step by step.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.250
And first we're going to start with the legs.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.100
With the World Dance you move your legs right,
left double it.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.699
So it's right, left, double.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.930
Right, left, double.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.840
Right, left, double on the left.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.880
There you go.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880
Then you're going to add the arms.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.840
You're going to extend the arms out.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:49.890
And whichever way your body moves, your legs,
that's the way your body moves.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.470
World Dance.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.110
Because and all the right moves, they tell
you a journey.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.890
Well and you bring it back right there in
Jamaica.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:10.240
Well, the World Dance basically is a dance
from, the late great you know what I mean?

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.770
And it got famous by the song from Beanie
Man.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.320
Why it called the World Dance is because they're
reaching out for the entire world, over here

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.020
and over there.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:34.580
Everybody get to love over the entire world
and you move.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.310
Lean back.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.700
You're feeling like you're at the advanced
level.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.780
Add some swag to it.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.420
Left, right, double on the left.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.660
Right, left, double on the right.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.030
Everything moves at the same time.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.520
Arms and legs.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.590
There you go.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.140
Double. one, two.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.690
There you go.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.670
And make the steps big.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.170
Exaggerate it.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.270
Exaggerate it.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.020
Big movements.
