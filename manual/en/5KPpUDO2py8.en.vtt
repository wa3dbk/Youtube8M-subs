Accessing Your NAS Part 1: Mapping a Folder Using ASUSTOR Control Center

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.966
One of the easiest ways to access your NAS is to map a folder from your NAS to your PC using ASUSTOR Control Center.

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:27.566
Please note that your NAS and PC must be on the same local network when mapping a folder. 

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:33.733
The first step is to make sure that you have opened up ASUSTOR Control Center. 

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:40.999
ASUSTOR Control Center is designed to locate any ASUSTOR NAS devices on your local network. 

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:54.132
As you have probably noticed, there are a whole bunch of ASUSTOR NAS devices in the left hand panel. Please disregard this as you will likely only see one NAS on your local network. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.800
Select your NAS from the panel on the left.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.533
Next, click on the “Connect” button and then click on “Map Local Network Drive”.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:12.766
Now, enter the username and password for your NAS and then click on “Next”.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:20.033
Select the folder from your NAS that you wish to map and then assign a drive letter for it.

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:24.033
Click on “Finish” once you are done. 

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:30.333
In our example, we have selected the “Media” folder and have assigned “Y” as the drive letter for it.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.000
The folder from your NAS should now appear and be mapped to your PC as a network drive.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.700
Now you can easily drag and drop files from your PC to your NAS.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.400
And even create new subfolders. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Now you are ready for Part 2: Using Your NAS IP Address to Connect from Windows
