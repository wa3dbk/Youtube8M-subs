00:00:01.402 --> 00:00:04.496
740th Combat Group is the name of our unit.

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:07.743
In Army parlance, a group is equivalent to a battalion.

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:12.585
Our headquarters is located at Fernando Air Base, Lipa City.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.356
Our group has 4 squadrons, which are companies in Army terms

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:20.571
and are deployed all over Batangas province.

00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:23.153
The main reason of our presence before you

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:27.695
is because of our mandated mission and vision -

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:33.117
one, is to have a prosperous community;

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:37.555
establish a civil government: in barangay-level

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:41.077
to have a barangay captain, council, and police; and

00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:46.740
also to have a national police and soldiers loved by the people.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.975
And before we achieve such progress,

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:56.961
we believe that we must first address the problem

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:59.874
that hinders development. And what is this problem?

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:04.723
It is called insurgency.

00:01:04.723 --> 00:01:06.744
There are different types of insurgency,

00:01:06.744 --> 00:01:10.537
one is the CPP-NPA - and that is what we have here.

00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:14.728
And this must end.

00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:21.567
What we are doing is not only to stop the CPP-NPA

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:27.273
but also to pull you away from their influences.

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:32.211
As the saying goes that prevention is a lot better than cure.

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:38.243
That's why we are discussing these, to keep you away from them.

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:44.689
Our children should be geared by their parents for a better future,

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.990
and, while still very young, not to become rebels.

00:01:49.223 --> 00:01:54.746
This recruitment of minors is an outright violation of human rights

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:56.035
perpetrated by the CPP-NPA.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.360
We showed you this presentation for you to become aware

00:01:59.568 --> 00:02:02.470
how the CPP-NPA deceives our fellow countrymen.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.551
The CPP-NPA believes in social change through bloody armed struggle.

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:15.712
And that is through - violence!

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:20.894
You have seen earlier, that even minors are

00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:23.378
already used by the NPA as combatants because they

00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:28.331
need them to launch a wide and massive bloody revolution!

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:32.269
And that is what we are preventing from happening.

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.109
We are here not only to capture NPAs...

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.545
The common notion about soldiers is that they are out to capture NPAs,

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.859
always looking for war!

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.538
May I ask you, just among us,

00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:52.803
what's your common perception when seeing soldiers?

00:02:53.761 --> 00:03:01.573
May I ask? Yes, what do you think?

00:03:01.822 --> 00:03:06.571
"There's trouble!", "There's gunfighting!", "There's war!"...

00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:11.321
In your community, we can't deny the fact that some soldiers live here.

00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:13.959
How long have they stayed?

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:19.066
Maybe, at least a month. In that duration,

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:23.591
have you seen any gunfighting? Any war at all?

00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:25.527
None. Right?

00:03:25.527 --> 00:03:31.869
It is because our soldiers are not looking for war.

00:03:32.217 --> 00:03:38.497
What they are looking for is how to serve the people.

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:45.091
Soldiers only use arms if needed.

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:55.490
We, who love peace, don't make unnecessary trouble.

00:03:55.848 --> 00:04:00.852
This can be proven by the soldiers who live here.

00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:03.567
Had any soldier made any trouble?

00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:08.320
If there is one, you must report it. I need to know it!

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.116
Because that is wrong. We will correct them.

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:16.844
Maybe there will be some, because soldiers too are humans.

00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:18.647
They also have weaknesses and sometimes forget.

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.412
Just as I've said to the Brgy. Captain, that if there is

00:04:20.412 --> 00:04:23.424
any soldier misconduct, it must be reported at once

00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:26.425
so we can correct them immediately.

00:04:26.425 --> 00:04:32.646
What we've come here is not to make trouble

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:36.740
but to preserve peace instead.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:45.613
This is our mission. So we can have a condusive place for progress.

00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:50.377
We showed you earlier, the government's programs.

00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:56.160
Part of it, is the rice distribution directly from NFA.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.986
So you'll have affordable rice.

00:04:57.314 --> 00:05:01.629
How much other people cost, is also the same for you.

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.735
There is no additional charge. Because the trucks used are from

00:05:05.298 --> 00:05:08.696
the government too. It is free.

00:05:08.696 --> 00:05:18.503
These little things we do, in order to help you, to serve you, are what we do.

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:22.436
This is what we want you to ponder upon.

00:05:22.706 --> 00:05:25.782
We showed you the deception schemes

00:05:25.782 --> 00:05:31.500
to you, to our countrymen by the CPP-NPA.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:38.096
We are doing this, so you'll not end up like what happened

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:39.753
to Comrade Liway (whom the NPAs killed her husband and shot her son).

00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:42.617
We don't want you to be deceived and regret later on.

00:05:42.617 --> 00:05:44.878
So in case, if in the future, some NPAs approach you,

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:48.254
you know how to avoid them.

00:05:48.254 --> 00:05:54.799
Remember my friends, peace situation in our community

00:05:54.799 --> 00:06:00.888
is not the soldiers' sole duty. They can't do it alone.

00:06:01.123 --> 00:06:08.767
This must be done by us - together.

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:13.609
Soldiers can't solve insurgency alone, they also

00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:16.435
need your help.

00:06:16.435 --> 00:06:21.925
Solving insurgency, or our problem regarding the CPP-NPA,

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:33.558
is akin to a fish inside an aquarium or a fishbowl.

00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:41.055
If we continue to supply it with water, the fish lives.

00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:46.172
In other words, what I mean is that we must refuse them.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:49.921
Let us not support them. Instead, let us advise them

00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:55.843
that the path they're treading is wrong.

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:58.675
Because, they themselves are already victims

00:06:58.952 --> 00:07:02.706
the very reason they joined. Right?

00:07:02.706 --> 00:07:08.623
That is what we need from you. Let us make them aware that they

00:07:08.623 --> 00:07:11.388
are victims already (and let them not be used by others).

00:07:11.388 --> 00:07:14.860
Let us not be afraid to speak up that we don't need them.

00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:17.747
Can they do anything about it?

00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:20.952
We don't have ill feelings to the NPAs.

00:07:20.952 --> 00:07:25.232
If you know NPAs here, report them to us.

00:07:25.232 --> 00:07:28.395
Let us encourage them to return to the folds of the law

00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:30.547
and we'll show you how we helped them.

00:07:30.547 --> 00:07:37.464
I repeat my friends, we don't have ill feelings to NPAs - they are victims.

00:07:37.464 --> 00:07:39.800
And we are prepared to help them too.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.658
For them to be obligated to return to the law,

00:07:45.658 --> 00:07:50.171
we must first cease supporting them.

00:07:50.514 --> 00:07:53.248
It is because they need people's outmost support.

00:07:53.248 --> 00:07:56.774
Even if they have the intention, and yet no support,

00:07:56.774 --> 00:07:59.075
they will fail.

00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:05.538
That is what we must do together, so we can achieve

00:08:06.393 --> 00:08:13.862
peace and therefore progress will prosper in our country.
