00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.313
- I think it's best to talk
about treating cystic fibrosis

00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:06.513
based on its symptoms in
different organ systems.

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:09.602
So, let's go one by one
and let's start with GI.

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.333
And I want to start with this because

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.300
I just remembered this
little boy I took care of

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.105
in a camp once who has CF,
and, before he ate anything,

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:20.680
breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.914
we had to give him these enzyme pills.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.309
They're not that much hard to swallow,

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.871
but it just struck me that he
really shouldn't eat anything

00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:31.112
without them, because
the nutrients he's eating

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:34.373
would be a waste without these
enzymes to help him digest.

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:36.707
So, remember that, our pancreas here,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.340
with their little head
there, helps us digest

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.272
by naturally secreting
these enzymes to digest

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:47.239
the sugars, the fats and
proteins in our diet.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.265
And you might think, well, I thought

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:51.213
absorption happened in the
gut, and you'd be right.

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:55.581
So, let's see if I can
draw this correctly.

00:00:55.581 --> 00:01:00.271
If we have our stomach here, stomach,

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.801
and then our gut follows,
I'm just going to

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.471
draw it like this, it's
a big, tangled mess,

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:09.701
and you're right, that nutrients
get absorbed in this tract

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:13.281
and goes to our blood, but
the pancreas is responsible

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.271
for secreting the enzymes
to help it break down.

00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:18.871
For example, protein is
really hard to break down.

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.801
Without these enzymes, the
gut wouldn't be able to

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.577
do anything with the food.

00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:26.511
In cystic fibrosis, since
these ducts are clogged up,

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.414
there's nothing we can
really do to unclog them

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:29.366
at this point.

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.066
So, what we can do is make
these synthetic enzymes

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.131
that mimic what the
pancreas usually makes.

00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:37.535
You just give it to the
person to take by mouth.

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.873
So, it's our way of
trying to do nature's job,

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.574
in which case it's not happening

00:01:41.574 --> 00:01:44.834
in the GI system of CF patients.

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.100
Aside from that, this little
boy that we took care of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.436
also had to way up his
calories, because even with

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:53.676
all these enzymes and
even with eating a lot,

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:57.006
it's hard for him to
grab onto the nutrients,

00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.796
and also in the GI system, the
pancreas also makes insulin.

00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:01.576
Let's write that here.

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.400
Which is the thing that helps
us regulate blood sugar.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.880
Not everyone who has CF has a problem with

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.875
the insulin tract, but sometimes they do,

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.141
and it's called CF-related diabetes.

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:16.040
So, if they need it, we might
have to do diabetic therapy

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.346
and think about giving
them insulin, but, again,

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.672
it doesn't happen to every CF patient.

00:02:20.672 --> 00:02:23.103
Next, let's talk about the lungs.

00:02:23.103 --> 00:02:25.809
The lungs, not only are
they very affected by CF,

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.211
but this is where a lot of the

00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:29.547
mortality and morbidity come from.

00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:32.706
In fact, CF used to be
a pediatric disease,

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:35.636
because not a lot of
people lived to adulthood,

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:37.876
and thankfully, that's
changed with all this therapy

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:40.036
that we're talking about, but, still,

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:42.306
there's a lot of lung infections,

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:43.946
and they have all that
thick mucus in there.

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:45.606
The bacteria's just trapped.

00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:47.936
It's the perfect environment
for them to grow.

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:49.876
So, it's not uncommon for CF people to

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:52.396
keep getting one pneumonia after another,

00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:53.746
and that's very taxing on the body

00:02:53.746 --> 00:02:55.416
and people can die from that.

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:58.416
So, a lot of patients
with CF have to spend

00:02:58.416 --> 00:03:01.676
maybe half an hour each
day wearing this vest.

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:02.116
Let me try to draw it.

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:04.176
It looks like a big, bulletproof vest.

00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:09.167
It's heavy and it's got
hoses that are connected here

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:11.601
that lead to a machine
that kind of looks like

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.503
a big vacuum cleaner,
and when you turn it on,

00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:17.841
the whole thing just shakes
while this person's wearing it.

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:20.180
It looks like they can't
even complete a full sentence

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.506
because it's shaking so
hard, and that's because

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:26.610
usually in the lungs, we have cilia,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.276
these little green hair-like things

00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:31.037
that clear the mucus for
us, but since it's so thick,

00:03:31.037 --> 00:03:33.474
we need this mechanical
way to shake things up

00:03:33.474 --> 00:03:35.577
so they can get the mucus out.

00:03:35.577 --> 00:03:38.896
So, I'm going to write here, shake.

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:41.036
I imagine it's very uncomfortable
and hard to get used to

00:03:41.036 --> 00:03:44.507
in the beginning but the kids
I met who do this every day,

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:46.547
they're so used to it, it's
just another thing they do.

00:03:46.547 --> 00:03:49.313
They put it on, read a
book, and then they're done.

00:03:49.313 --> 00:03:51.277
So, this vest has really helped a lot

00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:52.913
to clear some of that mucus

00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:56.064
and try to temper down the infection rate.

00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:58.731
Now, this is mechanically
trying to clear the lungs.

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:02.101
We also sometimes give them
anti-inflammatory drugs,

00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:06.636
anti-inflammatory, because
the lungs are so inflamed

00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:09.006
by all the mucus and the
things happening in there,

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:10.846
it's nice to give them
anti-inflammatory drugs

00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:13.096
to try to open up the
airways a little bit,

00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:15.546
make the person a little more comfortable,

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:18.636
and, of course, if they
have any signs of infection,

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:21.436
having a pneumonia again,
then we do not hesitate

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:25.676
to give them antibiotics,
ABX stands for antibiotics,

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:27.636
try to stop the infection at the source,

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:30.376
try to stop the infection
before it begins.

00:04:30.376 --> 00:04:33.836
Now, even with all this therapy,
it's very hard on the lungs

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:37.906
to go through this every
day, so, as a last resort,

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:39.966
sometimes the lungs can be so damaged

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.576
that people need lung transplants,

00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:44.106
and this, of course, brings with it

00:04:44.106 --> 00:04:47.276
a whole host of possible complications,

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:49.826
so we really try to keep
them away from transplant

00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:51.846
by doing these daily therapies

00:04:51.846 --> 00:04:53.976
and see how it progresses.

00:04:53.976 --> 00:04:55.022
Now, skin...

00:04:55.022 --> 00:04:58.434
I've said before that CF
patients have very salty sweat

00:04:58.434 --> 00:05:00.806
because the chloride doesn't get absorbed,

00:05:00.806 --> 00:05:02.646
therefore neither does the sodium,

00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:05.909
and all the sodium chloride
or salt ends up on the skin.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.247
So, if we have a person's
arm here, and their hand,

00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:12.646
usually our sweat is
salty, because not all the

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.176
sodium chloride gets absorbed,

00:05:14.176 --> 00:05:17.033
but for CF patients especially,
there's just a lot of salt

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:20.107
sitting on their surface of their skin.

00:05:20.107 --> 00:05:21.977
Now, remember, we need
a very careful balance

00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:24.644
of sodium and water and all
the chlorides in our body.

00:05:24.644 --> 00:05:26.979
So, a lot of patients
with CF might have to

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.409
put a lot of salt in
their diet just to try to

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.149
replace what they're losing all
the time through their skin.

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:35.249
So, these are some of
the mainstay therapies,

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.479
kind of the basic things that
we do for people with CF.

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.809
Of course, whatever complication comes up,

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:44.109
we'll deal with as they come,
but the basic principle here

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:46.149
is to maximize their nutrition,

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:49.009
make sure their lungs are
working as well as possible,

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.909
and keep their ions and fluids
and everything balanced,

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.809
and those are the basic, daily,

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:58.748
really life-extending
therapies for cystic fibrosis.
