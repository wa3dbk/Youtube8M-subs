00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:27.590
Each one of us seeks the outdoors for many
reasons; to relax, to play, to hunt and fish,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:01:06.450
to exercise, to learn; to spend time with
our family, to be refreshed and even inspired.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.240
One hundred years ago, in 1908, President
Theodore Roosevelt challenged the nation's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.150
governors and caretakers of America's land
and water to consider what he called "the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.970
most weighty question now before the people
of the United States: the conservation of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:35.090
our natural resources" -- how best to use,
and yet protect, the great American outdoors.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.789
The result was a century of innovation and
progress: much of it arising from community

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.929
efforts to protect the places Americans love,
both public and private.

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:58.090
A nationwide system of national parks, cultural
and historic sites; millions of acres of national

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:09.590
forests, wildlife refuges, and designated
wilderness; a National Landscape Conservation

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:23.260
System; and thousands of miles of trails,
scenic seashores, and protected rivers. And

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.200
on the state and local level, tens of thousands
of parks and recreation areas, and conservation

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.959
commissions that manage watersheds and fish
and game populations for future generations.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.680
These lands held in public trust are special
places that embody the founding principles

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.030
of our nation.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.500
Roosevelt called it our "essential democracy":
that all Americans should be able to enjoy

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:04.400
what these lands provide, and then pass it
on to their children.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.170
America's conservation heritage includes its
private lands as well.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.620
Our homesteads, farms, and ranches play an
important role protecting woods and watersheds,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.140
keeping our air and water clean, providing
wildlife migration corridors, and defining

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.499
our national character.

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:35.249
Americans have always had a strong connection
with the land. Yet our reasons to conserve

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.040
are as vast and varied as our nationâ€™s landscapes.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:47.989
But everyone agrees that our open spaces public
or private, large or small, a city park or

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.590
a neighborhood playground are essential to
the quality of life for all Americans.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:03.810
Now it is our turn to look to the future to
protect and preserve what we hold dear.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:13.599
But first we must understand the challenges
we face today. Global climate change and pollution

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.440
place new stress on natural habitats; complicating
land and water management.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:27.770
80% of Americans now live in urban areas,
many with limited access to clean, safe open

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.290
spaces.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:36.190
Poorly planned development fragments lands,
disrupts natural systems, and imperils productive

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.699
farmlands. Americans are losing touch with
those historical places where our nation was

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:49.060
formed; sites that bind us with a shared heritage.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.140
Our children spend half as much time outside
as their parents once did as we face an epidemic

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.680
of childhood obesity.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.229
Innovation and collaboration will be required
to meet these challenges.

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.530
A start has already been made.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.970
Tens of thousands of young Americans are actively
participating in youth conservation organizations

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:22.310
taking root across the country; a new generation
reconnecting with nature as they build trails,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.000
plant trees, and restore the land.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.210
State governments and local communities are
establishing parks, trails, and environmental

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:41.870
education centers. Innovative partnerships
between farmers and ranchers, sportsmen and

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.050
conservation organizations, private businesses
and public agencies are conserving millions

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:57.440
of acres for the benefit of communities, wildlife,
recreation, and local economies.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.000
Nearly 2,000 land trusts are now part of the
fabric of our country, allowing landowners

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.360
to take an active role in preserving their
land and water for the benefit of future generations.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.569
But this is just a beginning.

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.050
To meet the challenge of conservation in this
new century, we must learn from and support

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.010
the efforts that are already making progress
in cities and towns, counties and states throughout

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.389
the land.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.460
Because more than two thirds of America is
privately owned, we must also nurture and

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.319
support sustainable conservation practices.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.651
And economic conditions require that we be
smarter and more efficient in our conservation

00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:47.710
decisions.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:54.300
America's great outdoors connect us as a people
and as a nation, honor our cultural heritage,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.120
and restore our spirit.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.720
In 1908, Theodore Roosevelt said, "The conservation
of our resources is the fundamental question

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.300
before this nation." And citizens of all types
took action to improve and preserve their

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.300
nation.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:22.289
A century later, we face the same fundamental
question. And we will answer it as well.

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:27.050
Because, as President Roosevelt said, "We
are not building this country of ours for

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.430
a day.
It is to last through the ages."
