Hi, today I am making no-bake 3-ingredient truffle, Brazilian Brigadeiro.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:26.440
First, sift 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.830
Then add 12 oz of sweetened condensed milk in a thick-bottom sauce pan. 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.660
Add in the sifted cocoa powder. 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.840
And over medium heat stir with a wooden stick until combined. 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.740
Now add in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:56.030
and stir continuously until butter is melt.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:06.110
When it boils, stir rigorously until the mixture thickens like this.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.750
Now transfer to a heat-proof bowl and let cool. This is brigadeiro.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.650
To make truffles, rub butter on your palms.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 And make truffles with a teaspoonful of brigadeiro.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.930
Butter will prevent brigadeiro from sticking to your palms.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.090
Then roll it in the sifted unsweetened cocoa powder. 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:40.000
This is a 3-ingredient brigadeiro truffle.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You can decorate truffles with green tea powder, 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
grated coconut, 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
chopped walnuts, 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
chopped pistachio, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.900
strawberry chocolate, etc.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.750
Voila!

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.080
Brigadeiro truffles. 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.740
Itâ€™s so easy to make, you can make them with children. 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.990
This recipe is great for parties and holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.140
Bon appetit.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.880
My favorite is pistachio. Brigadeiro is creamy like chocolate ganache.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.830
And Alex cannot eat this because cocoa is dangerous for dogs.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.980
Thank you, isabella0985, for your suggestion.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.780
There will be more festive recipes this month. 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.980
See you soon, bye!
