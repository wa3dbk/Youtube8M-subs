Hi! My name is Dawn Shannon for Expert Village,
owner of Intuition Salon and Spa I’m also

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.420
a hairstylist and a colorist. Now I’m going
to go ahead and I’m going to put a what’s

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.310
called a toner on her hair. A toner is a great
tool you can use it to tie end when you’re

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.159
doing multidimensional color, it adds shine
to the hair, it also if there were some tones

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:30.380
in the hair that you wanted to eliminate such
as gold you can use a toner to help neutralize

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.010
that color, it something that can usually
easily be done at the bowl on wet hair, you

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.980
can also do it at your chair with dry hair.
Now this particular toner I’m going to put

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.469
on I’m going to put it on quiet quickly,
focusing at the root area it usually stays

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.660
on anywhere from 2 to 30 minutes, I’m going
to use the toner just to keep the color looking

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.660
natural and I’m going to leave it on about
a total of 7 minutes. You can also use it

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:12.940
to add gold tones, red tones, a lot of times
we use it on blonds, go ahead and rub it in

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:32.930
and run it through the ends evenly. I’m
going to take a towel, put it under my clients

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.080
neck so that she’s comfortable some clients
may prefer to sit up and some may prefer to

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.110
sit at your chair and now we’re going to
let it process for 7 minutes. Okay so the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.990
toner has now processed I’m going to remove
the towel from under the clients neck so there

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.290
isn’t color trapped under there when we’re
rinsing and same thing as normal hair color

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:23.370
is you want to use cooler water when rinsing
the hair. I thoroughly rinsed her hair and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.640
I’m very gently since I already have shampooed
her hair I’m just going to very gently shampoo

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:45.540
her hair using a color safe shampoo and again
rinsing the color till the water runs clear

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.930
from scalp to ends and that is how you apply
and rinse a toner.
