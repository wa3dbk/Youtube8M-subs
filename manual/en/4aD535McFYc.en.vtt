(happy music)

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.662
- Hi there! Today I have a holiday classic

00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:17.355
to share with you: green bean casserole,

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.165
but in this recipe we've
slashed fat and calories

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:21.917
so you can enjoy this dish year round

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.722
and not just during the holidays.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.554
To start, I've preheated
the oven to 350 degrees.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.740
Here I have my 8x8 casserole
dish, and first I'm

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.073
adding in one pound of frozen, French cut,

00:00:33.073 --> 00:00:35.623
green beans that I've thawed previously.

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:38.519
If you're making this when
green beans are in season,

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.577
you can certainly use fresh green beans.

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:42.877
Just wash them thoroughly
and snap off the ends

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:44.555
before adding them to the dish.

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:48.101
Okay, next I have a 10
ounce can of reduced fat,

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:50.464
low-sodium cream of mushroom soup.

00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:58.143
Always make a point of buying
low-sodium soups, broths, or

00:00:58.143 --> 00:01:00.716
stocks as you can really
slash a lot of salt that way.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.980
So, let me add this.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:08.877
So next I'll add a 1/2
cup of low fat sour cream,

00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:23.996
and a 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.

00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:32.905
Now I'm going to stir this, and make sure

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:34.623
everything is mixed well together

00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:36.417
and the green beans are well coated.

00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:44.377
So in to the oven this goes, and I'll let

00:01:44.377 --> 00:01:46.222
that bake for about 20 minutes.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.615
So now, while my casserole's baking away,

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:53.671
I'm gonna show you how to make
lightly fried onion sticks.

00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:56.391
As you probably know,
traditional green bean casserole

00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:58.041
is topped with French fried onions,

00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:00.485
which aren't the healthiest
things in the world.

00:02:01.077 --> 00:02:03.678
Our version will have less
saturated fat and calories,

00:02:03.678 --> 00:02:06.175
but will still get the job done
when it comes to making that

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:08.734
oniony, crunchy, yummy topping.

00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:10.754
So, on this tray here,

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.671
I will spread out my onions.

00:02:22.662 --> 00:02:24.229
This is one small white onion that

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.829
I've cut in to thin sticks.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.981
First I'll coat them
with some cooking spray.

00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:36.566
And now I'll sprinkle them with

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:38.813
1/4 cup of whole wheat flour.

00:02:52.064 --> 00:02:53.742
And now, time to cook!

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.496
I'll spray my large skillet
here with cooking spray,

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:04.214
and put this on a medium-high heat.

00:03:06.262 --> 00:03:08.387
Now that it's hot, I'll add my onions,

00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:27.676
and I'll just cook these
until they're crispy.

00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:29.777
This will take about five minutes or so.

00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:33.535
I'll stir frequently so that
they cook and they don't burn.

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:38.248
Now twenty minutes are up,
so out comes my casserole.

00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:39.850
This is looking good.

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.494
So I'm just gonna add half of my onions,

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:48.418
like so,

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:55.151
and I'll just stir this into my casserole.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:05.442
And now, I'll just top the casserole

00:04:05.442 --> 00:04:06.933
with the rest of my onions.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.716
And voila, back in to the oven it

00:04:22.716 --> 00:04:24.766
goes for about five more minutes.

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:32.758
And here's our finished
green bean casserole!

00:04:32.758 --> 00:04:35.440
Looking very much like
the traditional dish,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.040
but in ours it's a heart-healthy version.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.513
In fact, you can now enjoy this any season

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.490
your family's in a holiday mood.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.949
Bye.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.531
