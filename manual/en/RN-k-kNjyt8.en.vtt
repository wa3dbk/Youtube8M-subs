00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.120
I have a memo board at home that 
I wrote my goals for 2014 on.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.440
Fashion week definitely wasn't on there 
for this year or the next.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.760
I think it is a great opportunity.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.720
And I think it helped me to take it a step further.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.440
So... my god.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.880
The shirt is light blue, that's why the coat really pops.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.200
I was invited to participate in Vodafone Firsts Fashion Lab.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.280
And then you are suddenly very big or something
even though I'm not.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.800
Everyone was like: Oh, you're doing the opening 
night with Claes Iversen and Iris van Herpen.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.400
Really big names and I'm just starting out.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.200
I think one of the questions on the sign-up sheet was:
Did you go to fashion school?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.160
That did make me wonder why they 
picked me in the first place.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.600
Him, him and I've got Nick on the website already.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.040
I've studied something completely different.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.800
But I think I inherited passion from my mom. 
Because...

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.760
Yeah, she is a real fighter.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.280
I think she never spent a moment behind her 
sewing machine thinking: I don't feel like doing this.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.680
It came from love.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.960
She used to spend weekends 
in a row working on a single piece.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.680
So that was very special and I never forgot that.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
The reason I want to be here is to see
the way they present the product.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.920
They are really good at that here...

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.560
and put a lot of thought into it.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.280
I think I will find a lot of inspiration here.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm very conscious of what's happening in the streets...

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.040
but also what's being shown on the catwalk.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.840
And I try to translate that into something
that fits into my own collection.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.120
I have two fits now.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.880
They are called the mod and the jog.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.080
This is a seam-sealed, technical jacket.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.160
I get inspired by really modern designers...

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.280
and designers that make adaptations of old products.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.160
As a designer, I see myself as being somewhere in between.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.680
Normally it's always closed. This is...

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.680
Why is it open?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.040
I think it's cool.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.080
As a small label, I am always thinking 
about how I will survive the next season.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.520
So I thought: why not give people 
a sneak preview on my webshop?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.400
So it's immediately available from the runway.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.320
That's the idea.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.560
It's very weird that, 
the fact that you go to a fashion show...

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.520
then you order and you have to wait. 
- Half a year.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.480
Half a year.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.560
And when you see something, you 
want it immediately.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.480
Otherwise if it takes too long,
you forget.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.040
So it's a very good idea.
- Thank you very much, man.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.760
You're welcome. No problem.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.440
We're going to do a rehearsal now to see how
everyone is going to walk...

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.360
and really pull it all together.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.000
Meanwhile we're also doing a shoot for the website.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.200
I am all over the place.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.160
I have made things very difficult for myself.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.480
Normally when you make a sample, you just have to make 
sure it's good enough for the catwalk.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.680
But I also have to make sure it is good enough for production.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.160
Usually there are 6 months between 
the show and production.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.840
So that is what I'm most worried about.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.840
How did that go?
- Not great.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.720
No?
- No.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.920
Terrible?
- Well, it just wasn't right.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.400
So what do you want to do?
- I don't know, let me check with Daniel.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.600
I'm glad that I am doing this with someone.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.800
It really brings tears to my eyes sometimes 
that I'm doing this together with Daniel.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.680
He knows exactly what I want and what I like.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.920
Let's get everyone in the right order.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.160
Sorry, can you just let him through real quick?

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.160
Nice, Robert...
- Floris.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.880
So who am I missing here? Davy?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.400
Now would be a good time to put on your shoes.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.280
Hey guys, what did I tell you?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.680
Can you sit down, please?
- Yes, of course. Sorry.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.120
I'm just a little stressed. So don't think that 
I am mad at you, OK?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.520
I think that for my mother, looking back, 
I made one dream come true for her...

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.960
when I went to university.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.000
But the other dream has always been that 
I'd end up chasing her dream.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.600
That so many people are working towards one goal
and that goal is Olaf Hussein.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.480
That you're working together on something that 
I should be doing by myself.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.160
But there are certain people that believe in it and 
it turns into something really great.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.080
I'm showing everyone a new kind of designer
that's on the rise.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.000
And the fashion world is very open to that.
