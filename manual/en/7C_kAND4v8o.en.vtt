00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[♪Piano playing♪]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.750
It has approximately 3 million parts,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.150
and before it ever takes off,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.090
Boeing engineers already know how 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.990
those parts will effect its flight along with its environment.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.860
From raw materials and production methods

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.760
to fuel efficiency and aircraft retirement,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.050
Boeing is designing jetliners to improve

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.590
every aspect of their use and environmental performance.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.840
Airplanes have very long inservice life spans.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.510
[Jeanne Yu, director of Environmental Performance] My job is to look for ways to continue 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.560
improving environmental performance of those products

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.700
over their entire life cycle.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.020
When jetliners were first built,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.190
there wasn't much thought given to materials,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.250
components, or even whole aircraft

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.940
once their service lives were over,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.410
often 30 or more years after they were originally manufactured.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.070
But that's all changed.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.740
Boeing is now building entire airplanes with recycling in mind.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.010
Take composite wing and fuselage structures, for example.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.040
The 787 is made of composite structure,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.740
which is what makes it lighter weight

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.750
and makes it significantly more fuel efficient

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.530
than the airplanes they replace.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.910
With composites, we've been working very 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.350
hard with the industry to understand how to preserve carbon fiber,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.790
because once you can recycle the carbon fiber,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.290
you can put it into many other applications 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.070
at much lighter cost and much less energy

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.040
than it would take for raw material use.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.600
However, designing for the environment goes well beyond 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.160
high-tech materials such as carbon fiber.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.800
It includes better recycling approaches for the most ordinary materials,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.190
like aircraft carpeting.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.350
We were surprised to find out how often 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.580
carpet is turned over in an aircraft.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.310
So over the 20 to 30 year lifespan on one single aircraft, 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.040
tons of carpet can go to landfills.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.620
That's why Boeing is helping airlines replace small sections of worn carpets

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.760
with recyclable carpet squares.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.150
If there's a stain or a spill,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.280
you can remove 1 carpet tile and replace it with a fresh tile,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.620
and it fits right in, and its seamless.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.460
We love it.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.060
Our customer loves it,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.280
and it's better for the environment,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.950
so that's a win-win-win for all.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.180
What really makes designing for the environment important

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.140
is the scale it represents.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.810
Boeing produces more than 48 large commercial jetliners a month,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.350
so an improvement in an airplane's design

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.560
can be reflected in 1000's of planes

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.180
in just a few years.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.650
There's nothing simple about aircraft.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.050
The real challenge is that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.930
to make an airplane more recyclable or more sustainable,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.670
we need everyone who has anything to do with the airplane

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.930
to begin to think in a more sustainable way.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.700
