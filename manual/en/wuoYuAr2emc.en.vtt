00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.730
Welcome back, today we are doing my brand
follow up video number 2!

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.390
So, let’s get started!

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.370
This is the Super Sizer Mascara by Covergirl
and in that video of the mascara, I thought

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.250
that it was incredible and that it worked
really nice!

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.250
I loved the brush, the formula…

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.140
I didn’t love that it wasn’t waterproof.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.240
It does transfer a little bit underneath my
eye, but besides that I still like this mascara.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.450
I like to use this as the first mascara and
then I’ll go in with a different one.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.910
Probably the benefit roller lash and I just
like to build up my mascara that way.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.180
But I still think this product is really great!

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.380
I’m using it on my lashes today, I feel
like it separates, lengthens and I just have

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.440
to be careful and not add too much on the
lower lash line because then I start getting

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.850
stuff in this area and that’s not cute.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.920
The Maybelline fit me foundation was the best
foundation ever for drugstore and I still

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.920
thin it is.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.060
I have this one, I haven’t been using it
because it is a lighter shade than my skin

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.060
right now.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.940
I did get a Tan from the beach!

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.000
But I still love the formula.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.160
I’ll just mix it with a deeper foundation
from Jordana or a concealer and it will make

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.700
my perfect shade.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.030
I still love the foundation!

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.650
I still don’t like the fact that it doesn’t
have a pump cause its super messy and disgusting.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.450
But the foundation is incredible!

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.000
I think I still stay true to my review video.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.880
And I heard someone say that they didn’t
like it because it didn’t sit on their skin

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.180
right.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.280
And they had dry skin.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.270
I recommend that you check out the regular
fit me line.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.670
I heard those foundation are incredible.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.509
I’ve never tried those foundations though,
because I have oily skin so I would never

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.470
go to a foundation that was for normal skin
because it’s not going to work for me.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.880
But if you don’t like this one, check out
the regular line and see what you think!

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.060
Still love this one!

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.939
The foundations I recently raved about are
the city color flawless finish foundations.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.540
This has concealer, primer, foundation all
in one.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.310
I have the color soft beige and Tan.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.050
Imix them together to get my perfect shade!

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.570
It has been so hot, and this still lasts.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.719
It lasts maybe 6.5 or 7 hours Iwould say.

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.469
And that’s from being in the sun.

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.689
Walking outside at outsides malls, you know…
all of that stuff.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.790
I did use a primer under this because it’s
just what I do.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.719
In the review, I didn’t have a primer, but
it lasted much longer.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.719
It doesn’t break up.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.409
I raved about this product in my full review
and demo.

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.730
My whole idea was to actually show you what
it looked like from using the product.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.900
Rather you liked it or not, I think I did
my job because I shared what it would look

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.889
like truly on you.

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.329
This is the nyx contour and highlight pro
palette.

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.390
Do I still use this palette?

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.390
Yes!

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.390
I still use it!

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.549
I switch off between my Aesthetica contour
kit.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.329
Do I prefer this one over the Aesthetica?

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.689
No, I do not!

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.400
I actually love the Aesthetica contour kit
more.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.629
I’ve been grabbing it a lot more.

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.939
Do I recommend that you get the nyx contour
kit?

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.070
If you are still into super crazy contour
and highlight like I was in.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.409
I was in that whole phase of contour and highlight.

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.430
And I’m not into that anymore.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.579
I’m over it!

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.059
So, I’ve been using Aesthetica which looks
a lot more nicer and I’ve been going for

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:29.920
more of a subtle type of pretty look instead
of just more of a contour and highlighted

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920
look.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.599
I know sometimes, I’ll still beat my face.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.249
I will still be glam, regardless!

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:41.080
I will go at least a day or two out of the
month in full glam because I like doing it.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.730
But for an everyday basis, I prefer Aesthetica
over this one.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.589
But If yo u have this one, It’s not a big
deal!

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:48.819
You can still use this one.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.409
I just use this for more of my heavy glam
type of looks.

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.309
I hope you guys enjoyed this video!
