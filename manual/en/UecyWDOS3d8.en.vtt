00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.179
Hey guys!

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.930
Balucha here and today we are playing a game
that is not Minecraft.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.040
We are playing um...

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.210
Its a Hunger Games game!

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.449
Well not really.. yet.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.289
Oh it's getting dark.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.289
Ummm..

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.779
It's a game that I've been working on; not
the coding.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.779
Just the art.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.779
I'm no master coder.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.160
I have to give the coding credit to mister
Aldo uuh Aldonaac.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Aldonaac?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.330
He has two as in his name.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.330
Which makes it kind of confusing.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.969
I don't know how to pronounce.. that.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760
Uh you saw my new intro.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.510
It looks pretty fancy.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.370
I gotta give the credit to myself.. again.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.190
Uh yeah I've been doing the art for this game.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.690
It's gonna be a singleplayer game with like
a bunch of other tributes trying to kill you.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.920
And like you're gonna be able to collect leaves
and make traps.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.330
It's gonna be like a Don't Starve clone almost
like survival, getting resources with this

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.969
kind of top-down view.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:10.170
Uhhhm... the terrain is random and pretty
much infinite.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.530
Buut it's gonna be shrunk down since the arena...
if the arena were too big you could just like

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.830
keep walking and win automatically as the
other tributes kill eachother.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.080
Uuuum..

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.110
Right now this is all we have.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.400
We have some boulders and trees and bushes.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.439
We have this fancy cursor which will actually
make it so you can click on stuff.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.530
Later.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.460
You move with the ASWD keys or the mouse keys
which doesn't make much sense since theres

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.460
mouse.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.729
This this up here is the clock and it shows
you what time of day it is.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.560
Sooooo any yeah.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.850
Now it's like noon.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.850
And as it goes down you'll see that it gets
darker.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.280
Wait.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.820
ans wait wait wait.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.820
Sh SH!

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.790
Don't cry!

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.790
There it is.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.810
So now it's night time.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.720
Uh there's gonna be torches and campfires
and those those fancy night-vision glasses

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.539
from the Hunger Games.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.310
It's it's just in like pre-pre-alpha stage
right now.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.920
You're gonna be able to play it soon.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.310
Uh the playable character right now is Peeta.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.349
But later, we have plans to make it so that
you can choose your district and your character

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.209
and district will have different buffs.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.420
Aaaand uh yeah!

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.031
So I hope you guys will enjoy this game when
it comes out.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:38.169
I just wanted to share it with you so that
you can seee what I've been working on.

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:51.919
Thank you for watching.
