00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.360
It takes determination

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.200
discipline, hard work

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.960
and a lot of sacrifices

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.140
to pursue my passion.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.000
The people I surround myself with

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.260
they give me support, guidance.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.300
They push me to another level

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.960
so I can achieve my goals.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.020
I’ve developed the skills

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.780
that allow me to cope

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.200
under intense pressure.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.980
I’ve learned how to focus my mind

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.680
keep out any distractions

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.400
and perform at my best.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.580
I use my resources and facilities

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.420
to help me explore new opportunities.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.380
I’ve practised a range of skills

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.720
in order to understand and develop

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.140
my own specialism.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.800
I tailor my training to suit me.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.400
My success has opened many doors for me.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.380
My name is Chrystalleni Trikomiti

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.660
I am an Olympian

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.600
and a Commonwealth gold medallist.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.020
I study law at The University of Manchester

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.920
and this is my story.
