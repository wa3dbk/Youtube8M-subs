Hello, my name is Carolyn Saylors for Expert
Village.com and I want to show you a quick

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:18.680
and easy way to make a simple pillow. Now
that we have it all ready to start sewing,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.960
I am ready to sew this hole up that we left.
Be sure the threads don’t stick out, that’s

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:39.150
part of the pillow there and you want to hide
this knot so put that knot underneath of where

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:53.010
you are starting and then loop it over and
over. It is harder to do with a bigger needle

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:09.610
and do it at an angle all the way down. Just
keep on going all the way till you get to

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:25.670
the end of this hole. You just grab both pieces,
just a little bit of both edges and take the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:50.910
pins out as you go and just go on all the
way down. Trying to do the quicker way you

00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:01.940
just sew it straight across with a sewing
machine.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.850
Now when you reach the end of your opening,
you are going to go through that last time

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:17.061
and then you are going to get another loop
here and then take this loop of thread you

00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:26.200
have left and loop it over that about twice
and that will tie a knot. Put it around the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:36.980
end and there is your knot and that ties it
off and cut it. There is your little round

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.310
pillow.
