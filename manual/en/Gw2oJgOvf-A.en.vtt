Hey everyone,

00:00:01.877 --> 00:00:05.710
this week's video is something that worries a lot of us,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.050
if we're older than the average person with an Eating Disorder,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.915
can we still get help? What do we do?

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:12.853
Stay tuned!

00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:26.329
So this week's video addresses the topic of being older and struggling with an Eating Disorder or Self-Harm.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.638
Now I know, I've been hearing from a lot of you,

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:32.703
and if this doesn't pertain to you, you know, this video is very specific,

00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:36.607
to all of those of you who have reached out to me and told me that you know,

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:38.996
you're married, and you have children, and you're an older adult,

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:43.719
and you feel extra shame on top of the Eating Disorder and the Self-Harm behaviours

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.350
than people who are younger.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.758
And it feels, it just feels bad.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.759
And the thing that I think I wanna say the most about this

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.637
is that there's no shame in it.

00:00:56.637 --> 00:00:58.793
I know you're like, "thanks Kati, that helps a lot...",

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:04.442
but the truth of the matter is, is that Eating Disorder treatment is just starting.

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:08.510
I mean there are many people around the world who tell me that there aren't any possible options

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.407
for them. That the only option is to go into the hospital, and you sit in a bed,

00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:14.782
that they don't have any groups, and people just come in and check on you,

00:01:14.782 --> 00:01:18.723
and they just give you a bunch of paperwork to fill out that's supposed to like help therapeutically,

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:21.218
and that's not really treatment. You know what I mean?

00:01:21.218 --> 00:01:23.520
And for many of you, you reach out to me and I'm like,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.327
ugh, if you could only come to the States, I could get you into this program and I know that you could do better,

00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:32.763
you know, so, Eating Disorder treatment has a long ways to go.

00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:37.237
And probably when you were younger, there wasn't any around.

00:01:37.237 --> 00:01:42.477
And when we don't treat something early-on, it will stay with us.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:43.569
Because this is a mental disorder.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.611
This isn't like, oh, I have a pulled muscle, it'll heal on its own.

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.184
If I just rest, it'll be fine.

00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:51.681
No, this is a mental disorder.

00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:53.793
And if you think about other mental disorders,

00:01:53.793 --> 00:01:55.681
so, let's say we're depressed.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.092
Can children be depressed? Yes, they can.

00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:00.757
Can adolescents be depressed? You betcha.

00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:02.730
Can adults be depressed? Yep.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.475
Can like even older, older adults in like their eighties and nineties be depressed?

00:02:07.475 --> 00:02:09.054
Yeah, they can.

00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:13.836
Is there any shame associated with that? Not really. It's all the same, right?

00:02:13.836 --> 00:02:15.405
We think of it is as the same.

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:17.182
And to be honest, from the therapeutic side,

00:02:17.182 --> 00:02:21.228
I see Eating Disorders and Self-Harm exactly the same.

00:02:21.228 --> 00:02:25.622
It doesn't matter if you come and see me and you're eleven or you come and see me and you're sixty-five.

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:28.569
Because it's the same.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.831
So when I'm talking about Eating Disorders, I'm not talking about only the younger group,

00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:35.691
I'm talking about everybody.

00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:40.989
Because Eating Disorders are all about how we think, and we act,

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.731
in relation to food, exercise, Self-Harm behaviours and things like that, right?

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.811
So it's all about what's going on in here.

00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:49.706
I know we talk "healthy mind, healthy body,"

00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:51.633
but today it's mainly healthy mind,

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:54.549
because Eating Disorders, at the root of what they are,

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.350
are a coping skill to help manage emotions we don't like,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.518
that are overwhelming, or experiences we've had that are the same,

00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:04.354
they're overwhelming, we don't like.

00:03:04.354 --> 00:03:05.966
So it's a coping skill.

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:10.564
And there's no shame in it being longer for us to get better,

00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:12.902
or us being older when it takes hold of us,

00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:16.666
it can happen at any time. Right? If a traumatic event happened to us,

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:19.467
and we never quite processed it, it's still gonna be there,

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:21.431
we're gonna try to cope in different ways,

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.510
and we may have an Eating Disorder.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.103
But we're forty-five. Does that mean we're too old for treatment?

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:30.647
No, it doesn't. And I just want you to, I wanted really to remind you of that.

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:35.417
Because sometimes our Eating Disorder or our Self-Harm voice, whatever that negative voice in our heads,

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:37.757
it will use whatever it can to keep us trapped. So it'll say,

00:03:37.757 --> 00:03:42.766
"You're too old for treatment. They'll laugh. You should be so ashamed you didn't get help earlier."

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:47.305
Blah blah blah. Tell it to shut the hell up. Because Eating Disorders are all the same.

00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:49.298
No matter what age we are.

00:03:49.298 --> 00:03:54.865
And you can even see that if you go to my website, you can see all the different posts,

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:55.635
and we don't know how old anybody is, right?

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.817
And it's all very much the same.

00:03:57.817 --> 00:04:00.855
So, do not forget to subscribe to my channel.

00:04:00.855 --> 00:04:03.650
Cos if you notice, sometimes I put out videos mid-week,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.253
and if you haven't subscribed, you don't even know about it.

00:04:06.253 --> 00:04:09.479
And I would encourage you, because I hear from a lot of people.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.659
And if I hear from a lot, that means there's a lot more even out there struggling with this same issue,

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.539
and this same worry.

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.796
Share this video. Below there's a tab, it has a link,

00:04:19.796 --> 00:04:25.691
I want you to share it to either your Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Facebook,

00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:28.178
I dunno, there's a tonne of different things out there.

00:04:28.178 --> 00:04:31.012
So I would encourage you to share it so we can spread awareness about this.

00:04:31.012 --> 00:04:37.052
Because I want everybody to know that Eating Disorders don't discriminate when it comes to age.

00:04:37.052 --> 00:04:41.381
So we all deserve help and we're all the same. Okay?

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:46.064
Give this a thumbs-up if you like this video, that really helps also share the information,

00:04:46.064 --> 00:04:49.731
and just keep working with me, and let me know if there's other video topics

00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:51.998
you want me to, you know, touch on,

00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:53.534
as we work towards a healthy mind,

00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:55.204
and a healthy body.

00:04:57.504 --> 00:05:03.666
Do do da ba ba do, do do da, I think that went okay.. sometimes I ramble...

00:05:03.666 --> 00:05:09.717
gotta do the disco.. feel like moonwalking... maybe...

00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:11.819
Ugh, my foot's asleep.

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:24.598
So I've been hearing from a lot of you that you've either been suffering from an Eating Disorder for a really long time

00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:27.061
and now you feel like you're "too old" for treatment.

00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:32.300
Or I've heard from some of you that just recently it started, and you've started feeling like you have an Eating Disorder,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.670
but you feel like you're "too old" for treatment.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.213
To be honest I know that a lot of treatment centres are for younger adults, I guess. There are adolescent treatment centres,

00:05:40.213 --> 00:05:43.875
and then there are adult treatment centres, and "adult" starts at eighteen.

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:48.947
So a lot of the treatment centres that I have worked at, I wanna say the mean age was like 25 or so?

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:52.895
I know that for those of us who may be forty, or fifty, or sixty,

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:57.762
who knows right? We feel kinda left out. I mean that doesn't quite feel right.

00:05:57.762 --> 00:06:03.421
Because I mean let's be honest, if we're parents of children that've already moved out,

00:06:03.421 --> 00:06:06.918
and now we're in treatment with these kids that are like just outta high school,

00:06:06.918 --> 00:06:09.572
that kinda feels bad, right? And you can't really relate, right?

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:10.381
I'm doing a lot of air quotes, sorry.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:14.307
But we can't really relate to them, and we feel that age gap.

00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:25.735
But to be truthful, in my experience in various treatment centres we've had people who were forty-nine,

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:30.353
fifty-five, fifty-seven, there was no age limit.

00:06:30.353 --> 00:06:36.760
We wouldn't take anyone younger than eighteen cos we were an adult facility, but we had a lot of older adults in treatment.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.647
And Eating Disorders know no bounds. They will take us whatever age we are. Right?

00:06:42.647 --> 00:06:48.171
And if we don't get, I guess, take control of it and take care of ourselves when it comes on when we're younger,

00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:51.014
then we can be older and have an Eating Disorder.

00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:53.686
So what do we do? First thing I want you to do,

00:06:53.686 --> 00:06:56.416
is I want you to look into different groups in your area.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:03.018
Okay? Cos a lot of areas have Eating Anonymous groups, there's CBT groups, a lot of treatment centres

00:07:03.018 --> 00:07:07.596
have groups that go on for the people who have "graduated" from their program,

00:07:07.596 --> 00:07:10.929
and they'll have it on like Mondays/Tuesday nights, and they're free.

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:15.432
So you can honestly with a lot of them just ask, "Hey, can I join your eating group?"

00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:18.565
And it tends to be older people there as well.

00:07:18.565 --> 00:07:21.268
The truth of the matter at the very core of all of this,

00:07:21.268 --> 00:07:23.413
it's all the same.

00:07:23.413 --> 00:07:26.517
And I know you're thinking, Kati, shut up, it's not the same.

00:07:26.517 --> 00:07:28.345
But it's the same.

00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:34.817
And I bet if you read somebody's post who's sixteen and struggling, and you're forty-six, it's the same.

00:07:34.817 --> 00:07:38.605
Our Eating Disorders are the same no matter what age we are.

00:07:38.605 --> 00:07:43.099
I could honestly meet one of you and tell you exactly what I think your Eating Disorder is saying to you.

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:45.665
Because it's this mean, nasty voice.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.000
