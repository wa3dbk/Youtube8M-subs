00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.100
In this video we

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.900
will provide an

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.259
overview of engineering stress-strain
diagram instrumentals

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.800
Engineering stress-strain diagrams are developed

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.800
from physical testing. A carefully
prepared test specimen is subjected to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.500
a tensile test in a universal testing
machine

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.900
A testing procedures is typically guided by
a standard

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.189
such as ASTM American Society for
Testing and Materials

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.070
This ensures that everyone who's performing the tests follows the same procedure

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.400
Stress-strain diagrams allow us to plot the
results from tensile tests

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.800
and graphically identify important
mechanical properties

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.900
As a reminder, stress is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.800
force per unit area that results from an
applied load. Now these these applied loads

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.400
could be

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.500
in tension, compression, shear, torsion or any combination

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.000
Strain is the physical deformation
response of a material to stress

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.430
So an example of strain would be elongation of material

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.500
When a test specimen is first placed
in a tension testing machine

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.880
the force is increased and the strain is proportionally increased

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.900
If we look on our stress-strain diagram
this is the linear portion of our graph

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.500
If you were to release the specimen in this
region the specimen would return to its

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.580
original shape, so no deformation has
taken place

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.400
If we think about the specimen at the
micro-level the bonds are stretching

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.790
This is considered the elastic region
and the stress-strain diagram

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.790
The slope of the line in the elastic
region

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.800
is the modulus of elasticity, also know as the material stiffness

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.100
As  we increases the load being applied to the test specimen we willl reach a point

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.160
where there is no longer linear behavior

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.680
this is our proportional limit. With a
little more loading past our proportional limit

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.400
we will have noticeable permanent
deformation that takes place in our test

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.000
specimen

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.400
This point is our yield stress. Yield stress

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.000
is the stress associated with this point. Yield starts at 0.2 percent strain

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.960
for most metals

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.100
What this means is if the stop our
tensile test

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.869
and unload the specimen we find the 
engineering strain is 0.002

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.800
Note since there is a degree of recovery

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.600
we do not draw the unload line straight down. We draw parallel to the elastic curve.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.200
One thing to also realize is at a 
microscopic level we have dislocation

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.860
motion and permanent deformation that has
occurred

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.340
that is why we are now in what we would
call our plastic region

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.800
With additional force the test specimen
will eventually begin to neck

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.900
or rather the diameter or thickness of the test specimen decreases in size

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.100
We call this point the ultimate tensile
strength or UTS.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.200
This is the maximum possible engineering stress that the specimen can take

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.140
in tension

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.500
If we continue to load our specimen with additional force

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.980
we will find that this system will
eventually fail

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.500
At this point our bonds have completely
broken. As we did with the yield stress

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.640
if we want to understand engineering
strain at fracture

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.600
we need to unload parallel to our modulus of elasticity line

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.200
For designers modulus of elasticity yield strength and ultimate tensile strength

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.230
are all important mechanical properties

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.200
We need to make sure we are designing
components as well as products that

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.300
can withstand the strength of the materials that are being used within the product

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.400
We need to make sure our component as well as our products

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.120
do not go beyond the yield strength
or ultimate tensile strength when they're in

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.700
service

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.200
or failure will end up occurring. These are some of the

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.770
elements that design engineers need to
take into account from mechanical

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.270
properties
