00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:10.100
If you're trying to add both fade in/out to black or white this way, you'll end up with

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:18.066
one video effect instead of two on the same video clip.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:45.799
To add both fade in/out to black on one video clip, begin by selecting Multiple Effects here.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.033
Here, add both Fade out to black and Fade in from black.

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:27.999
Now try doing the same here for fading in/out from white.

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:30.699
Another way is to split the clip to add fade in on the first video clip

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.066
and fade out on the last video clip, if you find that you have one full video on the storyboard.
