00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.810
It’s kind of like good motivation when you’re
working out to feel like you could be attacked

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:13.060
by a basement dwelling serial killer at any
moment. It really helps you bang out the reps.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.029
Hi, it’s Emily from Bite Size Vegan and
welcome to my creepy basement gym. So, I said

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.139
to you guys, when I first moved into this
house (oooh!), I don’t know if you remember

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:32.720
that but I said I would eventually give you
a tour of my gym as it is. And so, that’s

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.660
what I’m going to do. I’m gonna show you
my basement gym then I’m going to show you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.889
my outdoor gym, and that’s it. I’m not
very used to doing super informal videos,

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:48.129
as many of you know, but it’s happening
so. I was going to do a more complex video

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:56.180
today but after Wednesday’s video I just
don’t have a brain much anymore trying to caught up on sleep.

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:04.570
So, you’ve got to forgive the creepiness
of this gym. Here’s my stand. Right now

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.829
it’s got little wimpy weights on it because
I was...I don’t know what I was doing.

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:15.380
I was doing something high rep the other day.
But as you can see I’ve got some bumper

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.430
plates. And there’s this rock that lives
in the basement, and I don’t know why the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.149
rock lives in the basement, but it’s been
there since I moved in. So, I just got a couple,

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.490
a couple of free-weights, a couple of bumper
plates. Got me an olympic lifting bar. So,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.280
in this creepier back room back here is pretty,
it’s pretty scary. (Uhh!) So, that is the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:51.689
creepy weight bench with some super disturbing
surroundings. So, here’s my pullup bar.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.979
I’ve got a little bit of band assist if
I want to do higher reps or do really slow

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.280
motion, or work on my negatives, and things,
I then will use the band, and then take down

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:12.760
that. It comes with 4 of these, and then I can
take some off to make it more of a challenge

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.850
or just not use it at all if I want to do
that. But, this is the only door that this

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.550
would fit into that happens to be in the laundry
nook, so there’s that. I’ve also gotten

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.690
pretty creative with things to a certain extent.
So, I have this bar here by the water heater

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.260
that I will use to do rows off of or some
band work that I have tied around there.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.829
I'll show you that in a second. That’s about
it. I have my yoga mat as well and then I’ll

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:54.030
do walking lunges up and down around here.
Anything after this will look high end. Oh

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.909
yeah, and of course I bring my computer down
so that when I’m between sets I can answer

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.460
a couple of comments or a couple of emails.
I’m still very behind so if you have emailed

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.670
me recently I am doing my very best, and I
am very very sorry that it’s taking me so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.390
long. Please be patient and know that I do
respond to every email personally. It just

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:29.340
can take a while sometimes especially when
I’m doing videos that take 60-70 hours to

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:38.689
create so. I hope you enjoyed this. I feel
like this is really boring but apparently

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.810
people like the informal videos from time
to time. So...and to be able to put out more

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.310
videos, kind of have to because you can’t
do, you know, ‘The History of Veganism’

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.450
3 times a week. No, there’ll be no sleep
at all. I did that for awhile, nope, not good.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.519
So, let’s go see the outdoor gym.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:07.260
Okay, we are outside now and get ready to
see my incredible outdoor gym. Bam, there

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:15.539
it is! Look at the masterpiece, it’s incredible.
You can get super fit on this outdoor gym

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.800
and you get to look kinda cool with this little
dog here. Came off of a Mack truck this guy...that’s

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.330
what he is, so I’m going to take you with
me.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.420
So, I thought I do a little bit of narrating.
This is a restaurant in town that will make

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.800
anything vegan..any of their dishes vegan
which is pretty cool. Ooby is also in the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.580
room with me so she’s going to co-narrated
by snoring. So, this is just a back bike path

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.010
that goes out, actually guess it’s East,
and goes out East to a neighboring town. And,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.040
there’s just some really gorgeous moments
along this bike path. I typically, up until

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.690
I moved here, would not bike on bike paths.
I just bike to get places, but everything

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.920
here is about 5 minutes away, so then I don’t
ever get to actually bike anywhere. And along

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.330
this path that I just whizzed past, there’s
a nature, a wildlife sanctuary. There’s

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.590
a little sign saying that and I always think
it’s kind of sad that we have to create

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.600
specific sanctuaries for wildlife when they’re
supposed to be wild, and be out in nature.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.100
And yet, now they have to be regulated to
these tiny places, but this goes out to Mount

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.280
Tom, which is what that is. It’s a big...well,
it’s a big mountain as far as Massachusetts

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.320
is concerned. And it’s really just gorgeous
out here. Some really nice farm land. It kind

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.720
of makes me nostalgic for Iowa but it’s
a real beautiful ride, and it’s something

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.300
that I’ve started doing again recently as...whoop,
little bunny, working out, and being outside.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.080
Whoa, it’s a really little baby bunny. It’s
something that I stopped really being able

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.520
to do and that’s another beautiful shot
here. I’m all over the place with my narration,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.820
you just have to forgive me. But, with Bite
Size Vegan getting as busy I stopped taking

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:23.150
these moments to drink in nature, and have
some time. So, I’m trying to get back to

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.200
that so I can stay healthy and grounded. It’s
really hard to find that balance because I

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.830
feel guilty every time I’m not doing something
directly for the animals. And here’s a kitty...hi

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.380
kitty! I made a little bit of a clicking noise
so that he would know I was there because

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.570
I didn’t want him to run in front of the
bike. So, just kind of be careful when there’s

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:50.040
other little...little guys around. So, this
was just a beautiful ride today and so, I

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.450
just thought I take you guys along with me.
I’m still kind of recuperating from not

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.960
sleeping but I hope that you enjoyed coming
along with me. It was kind of nice to do something

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.850
a little different. Please subscribe if you
enjoyed it. Let me know if you liked having

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.420
an informal video every now and again. I’ll
talk to you soon...go live vegan.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.460
And now Ooby shall narrate.

00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:17.662
[heavy breathing]

00:07:19.924 --> 00:07:23.414
[more heavy breathing]

00:07:24.704 --> 00:07:27.274
and once again [heavy breathing]

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.280
yeah you guessed it [heavy breathing]
