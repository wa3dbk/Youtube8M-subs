00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:05.658
President Komorowski:
(as translated)
Mr. President, ladies and

00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:15.024
gentlemen, dear friends, I think
we feel it all too well that

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:20.158
it's worth having dreams,
but dreams come true when,

00:00:20.158 --> 00:00:23.925
apart from dreams, we have
courage and determination to

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.558
pursue such goals as
freedom and democracy.

00:00:27.558 --> 00:00:31.458
Mr. President, today in this
room you are meeting the

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:34.458
Polish democracy.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:38.858
These are those who fought for
the Polish freedom and for the

00:00:38.858 --> 00:00:42.358
democratic state,
and they fought well.

00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:45.925
Those are the people who fought
in the anti-communist position;

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:48.058
those are the people
of Solidarity.

00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:52.558
And here in this room, you also
see those who have come here to

00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:55.325
meet you, and those are
the protectioners of

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:57.058
today's democracy.

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:00.991
Those are the ones who will take
part in the today's processes

00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.258
of democratization.

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:04.858
Here we see the representatives
of the both chambers of

00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:05.958
the parliament.

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.558
There are ministers; there are
also representatives of the

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:11.625
major political
forces in Poland,

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:13.725
in our democratic Poland.

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:19.124
I also would like to indicate
that that part of the Polish

00:01:19.124 --> 00:01:25.725
democracy, which is not directly
involved with politics,

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:28.224
but they co-create
Polish democracy,

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:31.692
those are nongovernmental
organizations as they are

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:37.425
watchdogs; they, in fact,
incentivize us as to take due

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:40.591
care of democracy as our
constant challenge and our

00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:45.825
constant commitment, and to also
be in touch with the society.

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:48.958
Also there is the former
prime minister, Mazowiecki,

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:53.258
together with us, and he is the
person who would like to talk

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:56.958
with you about our Polish
experience in transformation;

00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.825
that is, when we were passing
away from the communist regime

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:05.591
and getting onto a
democratic society.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:14.325
And once again, I would ask
to speak Mr. President first,

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:18.825
and then the former
prime minister.

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:21.325
President Obama:
Well, thank you very
much, Mr. President,

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:27.858
and thank you for the great
honor of appearing with

00:02:27.858 --> 00:02:29.291
all of you.

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:33.491
I want to express my thanks to
everyone who is here today to

00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:39.658
share with me their
experiences and expertise in

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.725
democracy building.

00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:45.658
I look forward to listening and
learning from Poland's esteemed

00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:49.224
democracy leaders and
younger activists.

00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:54.858
I have to say that it is
especially a treat for me to be

00:02:54.858 --> 00:03:03.858
able to see so many of you who
inspired us in America when the

00:03:03.858 --> 00:03:07.558
Solidarity movement
first appeared.

00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:11.792
I was still a
relatively young man.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:16.558
I have a lot of gray hair
now, but at the time I was

00:03:16.558 --> 00:03:18.158
still studying.

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:26.058
And I remember at that time
understanding that history was

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:29.058
being made because ordinary
people were standing up and

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:34.758
doing extraordinary things with
great courage and a great --

00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:37.958
against great odds.

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:42.291
And the Solidarity leaders and
others in this room launched a

00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:45.991
peaceful revolution that
eventually led to a regime's

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:51.991
collapse and the downfall
of a broader system of

00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:53.858
Soviet repression.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.725
And that's had ripple effects
and ramifications around the

00:03:56.725 --> 00:04:03.224
world, not just in Central
and Eastern Europe.

00:04:03.224 --> 00:04:07.358
Your actions charted a course
for freedom that inspired many

00:04:07.358 --> 00:04:10.725
on this continent and beyond.

00:04:10.725 --> 00:04:12.525
And it has many
relevant lessons,

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:17.091
so we want to encourage all
states undergoing similar

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.658
experiences to
learn from Poland.

00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:25.091
We all know that in the
aftermath of the overthrow of a

00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:31.091
repressive regime,
emotions run high.

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:35.858
But new democratic governments
have to show themselves to be

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:39.991
able to channel that energy
in constructive ways,

00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:43.692
to hold themselves to
higher standards than their

00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:46.991
authoritarian predecessors
in being inclusive,

00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:52.792
respecting the rule of law,
respecting minority rights,

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:56.391
believing in freedom of
expression even when we don't

00:04:56.391 --> 00:04:59.658
agree with what's
being expressed.

00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:04.792
And so I think that Poland has
navigated that process as well

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:08.558
as any country in
recent history.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.625
I very much value the
contributions that Poland is

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.525
making in Tunisia.

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:16.425
I appreciate the fact that
your foreign minister has now

00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:19.625
visited Benghazi.

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.991
So, again, let me thank
everybody in this room,

00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:27.325
but the people of Poland, for
being an inspiration to change

00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:28.325
around the world.

00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:31.658
And I'm very much looking
forward to hearing some of the

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:35.325
observations that those who've
fought long and hard for

00:05:35.325 --> 00:05:43.591
democracy may have as we face
similarly transformative moments

00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:44.991
around the world.
