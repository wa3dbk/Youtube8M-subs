00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.650
Selwyn and Pip Job. We’re at Cumnock um..
central west of New South Wales.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.089
Biodiversity it is ultimately um… well bio
is living things. Diversity is obviously lots

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.440
of different types of things.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.960
In a natural, if we’re looking at this natural
setting biodiversity would be in the different

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.789
types of species that are here. Plants and
animals and birds and um microscopic organisms

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.769
and biology and things.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.160
And then it’s that genetic diversity so
just like we have in the human race, lots

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.989
of different genetics, building different
genetic strengths and so on. So, that’s

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.770
ultimately what biodiversity is.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.520
Ecologists and scientists around the world
do say that biodiversity is probably the most

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090
critical issue there is to human kind.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.039
For without it, you sacrifice all sorts of
things and you put yourself at an incredible

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.500
risk of susceptibility to environmental challenges
that can happen and that’s not just from

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.190
droughts and floods that’s from… just
say locus plague is a great one. So there

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.710
are biological threats as well.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.710
If you have a genuine care for.. whether it’s
the natural world or that you leave your land

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.790
in a better place than when you got it, it’s
about your attitude and how you perceive the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.110
world that we live in.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.880
I try not to think that what we’re doing
is sustainability ’cos to me that reflects

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.579
that um.. you’re comfortable where you are.
I’d rather see that what we’re trying

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.240
to do is regenerative. We won’t accept stagnation.
Trying to just keep going forward. Repair

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.759
the landscape and do greater things with it,
bring it back to it’s potential.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.740
Having kids made me probably appreciate more
that we’re not the only living thing that’s

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.740
here. I often like to say that what we’re
doing is not just for the human species, but

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.689
that we’re actually trying to look after
future generations of plants, birds, animals

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.450
‘cos we’ll have to live here together
and it’s biodiversity we all need to interact

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.289
together. If we don’t have this, we don’t
have a human race.

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.360
It couldn’t be more simple than that.
