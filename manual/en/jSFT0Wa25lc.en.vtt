00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:18.020
I love Disney.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:30.340
And if I were a teenage girl with uncomfortable
sexual appeal, Disney would love me, too.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.340
I mean, that's what they do.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.510
They have a whole team dedicated to it.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.670
Find future babes, put 'em on TV.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.789
Give 'em crappy shows, little girls watch
them...and dad's fine with it, because there's

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.920
no freaking way Bella Thorne is 16 years old.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.600
Unless Disney cut a deal with Mother Nature.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.010
Which is possible, Disney has a lot of money.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.430
It's That's So Raven 2.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.590
Obviously, That's So Raven was one of the
earlier examples.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.409
It was about a teenage girl who had psychic
powers and huge boobs.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.750
They're very subtle, the Disney Channel.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.440
Anyway, That's So Raven 2 is a sequel.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.010
Which means there are two of these games.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.220
Which means someone looked at the first one,
which I have to think is just as bad as this

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.390
one...and said, "Hey, we should make another
one."

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.050
That's literally the last conclusion I would've
reached.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.210
So you play as Raven.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.410
Apparently, because that's so.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.980
And even though all you're doing is walking
around, this is one of the most f*cked up

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.380
games I've played in a long time.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.950
I mean, the entire first chapter, seriously...is
about how Raven thinks her boyfriend is messing

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.950
around.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.950
With her friend Chelsea.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.130
Who would grow up to be super hot, because
Disney's team of perverts is the best in the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.180
world at what they do.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.950
But what does Raven do?

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.130
Oh, just locks her inside the school.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.130
You know.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.090
Like a rational person would.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.190
So where does it go from there?

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.070
Well, if you guessed anywhere other than total
boredom, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.570
Every level follows the same formula.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.940
You collect all four pieces of Raven's vision,
which is apparently a physical thing that

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.930
can be split into pieces...and then you find
the exit.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.660
And that's almost always a tremendous pain
in the ass, thanks to some unthinkably obtuse

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.660
level design.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.390
I mean, just figuring out what to do sucks.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.880
Which doesn't bode well for, you know, actually
doing it.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:33.540
There are just so many questionable design
choices.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.640
Like, in every single platforming section,
Raven can barely reach the platforms.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.930
She's always hanging by a finger, like it's
f*cking Indiana Jones or something.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.450
And it boggles my mind why anyone making a
game for little freaking girls would decide

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.230
to design levels like that.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.270
Because it's never hard, it's just frustrating.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.660
And no little girl is gonna put up with that.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.360
Look, little girls are way smarter than little
boys.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.900
Of course, the mechanics suck, too.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.870
And the hit detection doesn't help.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.060
Sometimes, it takes several jumps to actually
grab a platform, even though you were clearly

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.060
jumping high enough.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.480
Hey, you know what would've solved that problem?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.520
Making a game that wasn't a pain in the freaking
ass to play.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520
It's unbelievable.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.890
Like, who comes up with this stuff?

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.080
And you know what's even crazier?

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.910
(End of video) The enemies are high school
boys, who punch Raven in the face.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.819
I can't tell if this is a kid's game or the
Attitude Era.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:35.520
And the presentation is a little weird, too.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.530
Like, the game actually looks okay, and it
sounds about as adequate as licensed games

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.530
do.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.240
But the Raven sprite drives me crazy.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.550
I mean, she walks around with this unbelievable
strut.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.510
It's, like...a super model walking down the
runway would look her and be like, "Man, what's

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.660
that b*tch's problem?"

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.660
Like, what is that?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.660
With the hand?

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.780
What, does she have an invisible tray of food?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.300
And speaking of sending the wrong messages
to girls...they made the Raven sprite look

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.040
nothing like Raven, whatsoever.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.600
This is like Wonka sent Raven to the taffy-pulling
room.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:17.489
You know, with a licensed game...I'll be honest,
the expectations are lower.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.190
Maybe they shouldn't be, but the reality is,
they are.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.250
This game doesn't even meet those.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.520
It's never even remotely fun, it's clunky,
it's too frustrating for its audience...and

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.070
it's got some questionable messages for its
audience, too.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.380
Like, seriously, punching girls in the face?

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.620
I mean, it's one thing to bomb people.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.100
This made me ten times more uncomfortable.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.350
Freaking...future babes.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.280
It's That's So Raven 2: Supernatural Style,
for the Game Boy Advance.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.080
This whole thing's, just...so uncomfortable.
