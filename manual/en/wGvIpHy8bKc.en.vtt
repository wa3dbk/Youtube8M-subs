00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.047
The orthographic projection

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:09.367
Body 1: Isometric view

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:17.652
As a rule, objects are represented in 3 views. 
These views are called front view, side view and top view.

00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:29.816
Front view

00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:35.382
Side view

00:00:35.383 --> 00:00:46.779
Top view

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:56.341
Front view

00:00:56.342 --> 00:01:08.839
The side view from the left is drawn horizontally 
besides the front view on the right.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.230
Side view

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:32.462
The top view is drawn vertically the front view 
markedly under this one.

00:01:32.463 --> 00:01:46.332
Top view

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:57.591
The distances between the three views are 
about the same size. They must be tall sufficiently 
going to regard the dimensioning.

00:01:57.592 --> 00:02:14.900
The dimensionings are inserted now!

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:24.313
The dimensioning is carried out in mm 
(at building plans in cm).

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:34.390
Marking symmetry axis

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:47.449
The orthographic projection
As a rule, objects are represented in 3 views.
These views are called front view, side view and top view.
The side view from the left is drawn horizontally 
besides the front view on the right.
The top view is drawn vertically under the front view.
Distances between the three views: 10 mm of the axes
The dimensioning is carried out in mm 
(at building plans in cm).

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.259
The orthographic projection

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.873
And now it's your turn!
Making the orthographic projection:
At first think over: Front view, side view see how and
Top view?
Do an outline on a block sheet.

00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:04.436
Start with the drawing now:
Fix and draw of the middle cross.
Draw the 45Â° line.
Draw the right and lower body edge of the 
front view with 10 mm of distance to the axes 
and then the rest of the front view first.
