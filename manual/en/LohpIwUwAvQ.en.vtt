Hi, guys, and welcome back to Haul ROX with
me, Alana.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.010
So in this week's haul, I'm going to show
you loads of my favorite bikinis and swimsuits.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.150
So stay tuned.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.150
[Music]

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.430
So first up, I have a bikini from Topshop.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.830
The top is £18, and the sizing is in UK sizes.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.110
So I know you can get cup sizes, but this
one is in UK sizes.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.650
But it fits really well.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.410
What I liked about this one was it's got this
really cool kind of outline, so it's not just

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.230
a boring straight edge.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.230
Something a little bit different.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.630
So the top was £18.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.860
And the bottoms, they come separate, are £12.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.260
So £30 for a bikini, it's fairly well priced.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.890
And I think the colour and the design really
stood out for me.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.530
I also picked out this suit from ASOS.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.530
So bright.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.600
So many colours!

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.149
I love it.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.060
And this is from ASOS, and it's £18, so like
that one.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.060
It's got a little halterneck.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.789
But what I like most about this is you can
take the little straps off.

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.063
Just take them off, so you won't get any tan
marks.

00:01:09.063 --> 00:01:11.979
So you can just sunbathe, none of these strap
marks.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.490
No one wants any of that.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.090
And this bikini actually comes in cup sizes,
so you can be real precise about what size

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.130
you have.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.709
Because some people are a lot smaller round
the waist and have bigger cup sizes.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.890
But this one is like bra fitted, so it's perfect.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039
And the bottoms, they come separately as well.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.369
They were £12.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.869
A lot of the ASOS bikinis actually do come
in cup sizes, which is great.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.409
This one as well.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.250
This top was £16.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.009
And this is halterneck, as you can see, with
two kind of straps.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.179
It's got kind of that underwire as well, so
it's got really supportive.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:57.920
And the colour is so cool, for that ombre
kind of two tone feel to it.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
Love that.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.959
And the bottoms were £12, and they've got
little drawstrings on the sides as well.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.770
So, kind of ties in with this little tie bit,
as well.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.140
And this one is from ASOS, and it was £28.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.380
So this does look really confusing as I'm
holding it up, but I'll pop all the links

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.920
and stuff in the description box.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.340
So if you want to have a look on that, you
can see exactly what it looks like, on.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.380
It's not a swimming costume you'd wear to
a swimming pool, you know.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.780
Still a little bit sexy, and it's got little
bits of skin still showing, so it's very unique,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.780
that's what it is.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.860
Everyone needs a black bikini for the summer.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.390
It's a bit like a staple piece, kind of just
goes with everything, and it's never going

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.250
to go out of fashion.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.200
This is quite unique, because it's kind of
got like a necklace on it, kind of like built

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.430
in, and it goes into a halterneck.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.230
So it really is like a necklace.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.020
So it's a bandeau, and it fastens with a little
tie.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.260
And this one I got from River Island, and
it was £16.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.200
This is something a little bit more fancy,
so it's quite Deaverish.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.900
I could imagine wearing this tonight for Ibiza
or something.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.420
It's a little bit more goey outie than a bikini,
maybe at a pool party.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.400
I mean, you still want to stand out if you're
in a black bikini.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.060
What I really like about the bottoms is it
kind of incorporates the whole, top and bottom,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.410
by having the gold plating at the bottom as
well.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.190
The bottoms are only £10.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.080
It's a quite good priced bikini, considering
how intricate it is.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.140
This is a massive wow bikini.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.310
It's such a bright colour.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.060
And green neon.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.980
You know, all these really bright colours,
are really on trend for the summer.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.680
So if you really want to stand out, this is
a good choice.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.120
This one I got from ASOS, and it's by a brand
called South Beach.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.700
The top is only £12.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.819
It's one of these bandeau bikinis again.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.930
Bandeau bikinis are so good because most of
the time you can remove the straps, so no

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.930
tan marks.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.630
And the bottoms were only £10.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.740
And they're sort of drawing in, that ruffled
effect, on the hip.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.130
This is a very party, 'look at me' bikini.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.730
I really like that one.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.730
Something a little bit different.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.569
Not everyone's going to be wearing one of
these.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.760
So, another bandeau bikini.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.060
Bandeau bikinis are probably my favorite bikinis
out of all of them.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.270
This one's from H&amp;M and it's £12.99.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.310
And it's got that tie dye.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.060
It is definitely tie dye, but it reminds you
of animal print as well.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.319
So lots of little runes.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:28.400
And a little zip that goes up the middle in
a bronze, and it looks like a little shark

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.600
tooth, horn thing in turquoise.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.779
And as you can see, I absolutely love turquoise
stones, and that bikini has got that.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.389
And the bikini bottoms are £7.99.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.499
And you can really see that tie dye on there.

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:46.150
So I think it's quite classy, and with that
little horn on it and the zip, it's just got

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.680
some extra detailing which kind of makes it
stand out a little more.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.189
So H&amp;M, I think they do most of their bikinis
in UK sizes.

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:55.530
This was in UK size again.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.300
This one, actually £7.99.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.280
So, such a bargain.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.750
And it's got the blue and white tie dye effect,
which I really like, but it's also got the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.219
standout straps.

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.699
And even the linings stand out, as well.

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.059
And the bottoms are £7.99, and they've got
little ties at the sides.

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:16.059
It's quite nice.

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:18.610
And it's got that neon lining again.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.800
H&amp;M's really, really good for bikinis, actually.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.319
They've got such a big selection, and I know
Beyonce has recently done a little bikini

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.470
collection with them.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.039
So it's really worth having a little look
at that.

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.050
I hope everyone enjoyed my Swimwear Haul today.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.999
