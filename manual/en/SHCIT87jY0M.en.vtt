Recognizing Hip Dysplasia In Dogs
Hello, I'm Dr. Mike. Today, were going to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.660
talk about hip dysplasia in dogs. To cover
this topic, were going to visit with Anthony

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.130
Cambridge, who is board certified in veterinary
surgery. Hip dysplasia essentially is a deformity

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.890
of the hip joint. It can lead on to degeneration
of the joint, arthritis, inflammation, and

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.960
pain. The vast majority of dogs acquire hip
dysplasia, likely as a result of an inherited

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.830
factor. And that's combined with factors such
as body weight, rate of growth, possibilities

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:49.220
of trauma during development, and other factors
such as environment play a role in this. We

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.439
commonly see hip dysplasia in breeds such
as golden retrievers, Labradors, rottweilers,

00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:00.430
and the German shepherd is probably the most
common in our practice. Most owners are going

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.820
to recognize some type of discomfort. Often,
reluctance to play as a puppy, there going

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.230
to see a change in the way the hind legs are
being used, often smaller dogs and younger

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.990
dogs will bunny-hop using both hind legs together
to get around or especially going up stairs.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.240
They may recognize pain when the dog first
gets up after a period of rest, or they may

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.479
see early exhaustion compared to other dogs
they've had experience with in the past. If

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.100
owners feel that their dog is possibly suffering
from hip dysplasia, the simplest, best solution

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.549
would be to see their local vet to get first
an examination, and then quite possibly, x-rays

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.450
to follow. A veterinarian is going to examine
a dog to determine if it has hip dysplasia.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.359
Some dogs can be examined awake, however,
often it's useful to sedate

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:55.150
the patient to determine whether the hips
are lax. Laxity is the key finding in dogs

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.789
with hip dysplasia. There is a test for laxity
that we refer to as the Ortolani and we can

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.009
demonstrate that on this model. In the Ortolani
we push on the femur under sedation, the femoral

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.340
head rises out of the joint, the femoral head
is now subluxated, we lift the leg up, and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.430
it clicks back in. Were feeling for that click
back in to tell us that the hip was actually

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.980
out. If we confirm
this, this is hip dysplasia, regardless of

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.260
what we see on an x-ray. As always, it is
best to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.319
discuss with your veterinarian the ideal treatment
options for your pet. I'm Dr. Mike, I

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.290
hope this information has been helpful, and
thanks for watching.
