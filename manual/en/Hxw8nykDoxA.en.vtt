00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.432
As the title suggest, this is a fail video.

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:10.658
As you can see here, I was supposed to be 
 making a jelly roll cake which sounds amazing.

00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:15.082
But baking is my shortcoming. I love to bake, not I don't.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:20.874
I love to eat baked goods. They taste so amazing and I want 
 to be this amazing baker but I'm so so bad at it.

00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:27.214
Vegan baking is so hard. This turned out better than 
 I expected, but it was still a fail.

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:32.693
I did not expect to be able to roll it, like I am 
 rolling right here. I thought that was going to be impossible.

00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:37.662
But my jelly, just starting off, I made my 
 own jelly, and it didn't gel enough.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:42.748
Like it was still too liquid-y. I needed to take 
 out more liquid or put in more cornstarch.

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:48.622
One of the two, or let it cool down. Something?! 
 But, the cake just absorbed all the liquid.

00:00:48.622 --> 00:00:56.006
Which is amazing. It tasted great actually, it tasted fantastic. And if you 
 want the recipe, it is just my normal recipe for

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.325
vanilla cupcakes and I just put it in a cake pan.

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.325
vanilla cupcakes and I just put it in a cake pan.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:02.043
Over what should have been parchment paper, but that 
 was another flaw. I didn't have parchment paper.

00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:11.122
I only used wax paper. So, it is vanilla 
 vegan cake with blackberries, like frozen blackberries,

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:18.042
in a little bit of sugar, a lot a bit of sugar, 
 raw sugar. And then, I cooked them, simmered them,

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:21.989
and then added in cornstarch. Took out some of 
 the liquid first, and then added in cornstarch.

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:27.353
Still didn't jell enough and as you can see, the cake exploded with moisture.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:33.181
It just exploded. It was so said and disgusting 
 looking, but it tasted so good.

00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:40.900
I still ate quite a bit of it before I decided I was being 
 a fat butt and I just need to trash the whole thing.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:45.350
Because, I wasn't going to present that to anybody and I 
 definitely wasn't going to present it to you guys.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.670
And I just would have ate it and felt bad about myself, but 
 I am so glad that I was not depressed and I

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:54.470
was able to cut a piece off and plate it up for the thumbnail.

00:01:54.474 --> 00:02:01.250
I looks so sad, but you know, things happen, baking is 
 hard. Savory is a little easier because

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.880
you can fix things as you go along.

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:08.750
You can add more salt, you can take out liquid, you can add more 
 thickener, you can turn up the heat, turn down the heat,

00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:12.900
and you can even scrape off the burnt parts, but baked goods;

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:18.940
once it is done and ruined, once it is bad, it is 
 really really bad. But I still had fun doing it.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.940
First causality of the project, hope you enjoyed. Bye.
