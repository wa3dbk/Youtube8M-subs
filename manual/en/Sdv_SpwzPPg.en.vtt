00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:01.599
I forgot.

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.740
I'm Zel Rolland, and I want to talk to you
about some of the new Boo rigs that we're

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.680
going to have this year at ICAST.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.790
One of them is what we call the Boo Flex Rig.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.570
What this rig allows an angler to do is like
no other.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.590
It allows me to put a crankbait on the back
of the rig and fish it at any depth that I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.009
want to fish in; anywhere from 30 feet up
to 10 feet.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.339
It allows me to cover that whole spectrum
that I want to fish with any size crankbait

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.829
that I have in my tackle box, whether it be
a deep-diving bomber, all the way up to a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.210
shallow-water square-lip Excalibur crankbait.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.069
I can fish the bait in actually 10 to 25 feet
of water on the bottom, by using the Boo Flex

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:55.069
Rig.

00:00:55.069 --> 00:01:01.350
Another one is what we call the Boo Teaser
Rig.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.250
Since some states are only going to allow
us, and some tournament organizations only

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.189
allow you to throw one fishing lure with one
bait, this is the deal.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:20.850
This actually has 4 soft plastic white grub
teasers on it, and the rear of the bait allows

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.640
me to attach any bait that I want to put on
it, whether it be a crankbait, a spinnerbait,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.219
or maybe even a topwater bait, if I want to
fish the bait on top.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.340
There's a big variety.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.680
Then we have the spin rigs.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.729
We got a double-willow leaf, which is going
to create a little more vibration when you're

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.899
fishing a bait underneath the surface of the
water.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:58.430
We have it with double-willow leafs or we
have it with the Colorado and the willow leaf.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.859
You got 2 versions of the Boo spin rigs to
attach.

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:11.550
What this allows an angler to do is really
be creative, as far as it opens up a whole

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.750
new can of worms, is what I say.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.890
It allows an angler to take a crankbait or
a spinnerbait, fish it at different depths

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.220
that he's never been able to fish it before,
and catch a lot more fish that's never been

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.750
fished for.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.940
That's the new Booya product.
