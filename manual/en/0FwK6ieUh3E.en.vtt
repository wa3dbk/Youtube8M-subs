Hi! My name is Janie Yasko-Mangum and I am
with Successful Style and Image. Today on

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.501
Expert Village I am going to talk about short
sleeved shirts for men. Short sleeved shirts

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:18.730
for men look wonderful on physiques of men
for social occasions. Short sleeved shirts

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.810
do not belong with suit, they belong on casual
occasions. So when we are looking for short

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.590
sleeved shirts, I don’t want you to get
pigeon _______ in only wearing golf shirts.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.100
You know the golf shirts I am talking about;
the ones that come from golf courses. I am

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.530
talking that you should have some golf shirts
in your closet but also some short sleeved

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.870
button down, short sleeved pointed collars;
a lot of different types of short sleeved

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.770
shirts. Don’t pigeon hole yourself in only
having golf shirts but if you are somebody

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.430
who loves golf shirts, then there are other
kinds of golf shirts that you need to look

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.640
at. Most times golf shirts are solid print.
Remember we talked about the elements of clothing,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.440
let’s look for some design and let’s look
at fabric that is not 100 percent cotton all

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.900
the time. Here we can find cotton that is
a puma cotton that looks or Marino cotton

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:28.490
that looks wonderful. Here let’s take for
instance this golf shirt, as you can tell

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.200
it is beautiful and I want you to see it is
a golf shirt. It is golf but it is very different

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.021
from your normal golf shirts. You see the
design and the pattern on the shirt? Can you

00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:45.860
see the design and the pattern on the shirt?
It’s not only there but it is also in the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.950
back. Look how beautiful the back of the shirt
is. Just gorgeous! This shirt has some polyester

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.280
in it. You can tell by the little bit of shine
that you see on the shirt. The little bit

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.739
of shine. Here it has a collar that is a little
bit lighter color, that’s perfectly fine.

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.530
That looks good. It’s creating even more
dimension. This is a beautiful golf shirt.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.550
Not only it’s not 100 percent cotton, but
it also has a design to it. This is the type

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.950
of golf shirt you need in your closet. You
also have short sleeve shirts. Let me show

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.640
you another type of golf shirt that you can
wear. This is a beautiful one. This has some

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.670
nylon in it. Beautiful! Look how it flows
and drapes. Absolutely gorgeous!. It has straight

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:41.230
sleeves. Absolutely wonderful, the short sleeve
shirts. The last type I want to show you is

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.320
this is the herring bone. A herring bone short
sleeve shirt silk. Absolutely gorgeous! This

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.940
is another type of short sleeve shirt that
you can wear for your social occasion. Thanks.
