00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:09.410
I had some coffee. Can't you tell? We're gonna
be at the CEDIA expo, a Klingon coffee table,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.510
and a glove to help blind people. I'm Cali
Lewis. Welcome to GeekBeatTV number 229. This

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:26.689
episode of GeekBeatTV is brought to you by
HostGator. To start you off this Monday, take

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.619
a look at this. A guy named Nick Woodrow built
his very own Klingon coffee table.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.440
The wood is pine and underneath the top, he's
added 26 rbd diodes that flash in a blue LED

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.930
for the under belly. I don't know how long
it took him, but he says that if you'd like

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.260
him to make you one contact him directly.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:55.140
The LividLobster team here, will be at the
them in order to provide you the best of the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.270
best coming out of CEDIA. From discussions
I've had in the past, I know not all of you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.040
are familiar with what CIDIA is. So, I sat
down with Utz Baldwin, the CEO of CEDIA. to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.500
explain exactly what you should expect to
see.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.990
So, could you kind of briefly explain what
CEDIA is for those people who don't know.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.290
Absolutely. CEDIA is an international trade
association that represents contractors that

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.580
install technology into the residential marketplace.
We also include or have members that manufacture

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.440
the products,as well as all the other professionals
that are in the space that help support the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.440
industry.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.430
So we could find, when we get out there, home
automation, we can find entertainment, I know

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.710
that Samsung is going to be showing off their
new TV, accomplish a broad range of things,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.909
but in the home space.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.050
Absolutely, one of the most interesting things
though, over the last twenty years, the electronics

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.320
system's contractor is really evolving from
their roots and entertainment back in the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.770
days when they were installing home theaters,
distributed audio, to a slew of technologies

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.649
that are available to the residential, to
the consumer, today in the home.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.050
Is that causing training to be very different
for that industry? certainly. I mean think

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.240
about how quickly technology is evolving...

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.240
Yeah.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.040
...and innovation driving new technology on
the home space. So, it could be quite confusing

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.010
for consumers trying to understand what's
possible, what's available. And industry professionals

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.960
as well need training to stay up to date on
the latest technologies, the latest best practices,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.160
so that they can effectively serve their customers.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.300
Yeah. Well we're going to get down into all
of that, and show you guys what exactly going

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.530
on in that industry. We'll have a viewer meet
up with in Indianapolis on September 9th at

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.210
Scottie's Brew House at seven p.m. More details
at lividlobster.com/events. That's where you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.690
can find out where the team and I will be
on a monthly basis.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.980
For example, we have another meet up on September
2nd In Berlin, Germany during IFA. Project

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.010
Taset is a developing technology that help
blind people navigate without the use of a

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.880
stick. Instead of the traditional method,
GrathioLabs is using sonar. It's in the form

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.150
of a glove, so as someone moves their hand
around, they'll feel more tension the closer

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.530
where an object is.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.590
Sometimes they'll know to avoid it if walking
down a street. Other times, they'll know they're

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.870
getting close to the desired object, like
a doorknob.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.080
This is Tacit, a device that gives sonar to
the blind, helping them navigate complex environments.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.900
The prototype works by sending out ultrasonic
pulses from the front of the device. A microcontroller

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.200
reads the time it takes for the pulses to
return, then tells the serbo-motor to rotate,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.490
putting varying amounts of pressure on the
wrist.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.120
When objects are far away there is little
to no pressure. The closer the object, the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.400
firmer the pressure. Tasit has a fast response
time, quickly allowing the user to since what

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.510
is in the area with a sweep of a hand. It
can be worn on the right or left hand and

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.870
requires almost no training to use. It can
easily be put on, and taken off by touch alone.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.850
From the back of the hand,it can be aimed
anywhere. Doesn't interfere with the since

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.660
of touch, or general use of the hands.

And one more for fun. It is Monday after all
and I know some of you are in need of a pick-me-up,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.960
even if you don't actually use pencils, you
might want to pick up a couple just to use

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.620
this. The Walky Robot pencil sharpener, it's
a little desktop pencil sharpener that will

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.009
sharpen your pencil and entertain you at the
same time, and that entertainment comes at

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.550
