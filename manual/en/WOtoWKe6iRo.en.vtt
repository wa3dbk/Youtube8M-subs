Three V-Taper Back Workout Tips --How to Get
Wide Lats

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.760
Although a bigger, wider back is the goal,
sometimes, a bigger, taller weight stack is

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.260
not the answer.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.010
What's up guys?

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.759
Jeff Cavaliere, AthleanX.com.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.449
The key to the video, how to get a bigger,
wider, V-tapered back.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.939
Now, I mentioned in the intro, we have to
resist the urge to always go for a bigger,

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.270
taller, weight stack meaning loading up the
weight.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.359
Because, as you see, there is different goals
for different exercises.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:42.289
Some exercises, our goal should be to simply
move weight, where in other exercises we really

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.929
should be looking to contract the muscle that
we are working.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.859
There's a big reason why, especially with
the back; because with the back, what we have

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.970
is a situation of out-of-sight/out-of-mind.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.269
You can't see it.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.899
You don't really have that much of a conscious
effort that you put into it.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.109
Yeah, you're pulling hard, and the tendency
is to do a lot more of that moving away-type

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.449
exercise than there is to put that conscious
contraction.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.369
So, what I recommend, my best tip, if you
are trying to build a wide, V-taper, is that

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.549
you better activate the lats.

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.890
You had better develop the lats through their
full range-of-motion in order to do that.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.180
So, how do we do it?

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.250
A couple of different ways.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.750
First of all, we have to get a wide set up.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.439
If you're doing pull-ups, that means a wide
grip.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.509
If you are doing some kind of a cable set-up
here, then get these cables out wide.

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.439
As you can see, I don't necessarily like the
bar as much.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.729
I like the individual cable handles because
it allows me to do that.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.110
Why is that?

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.610
Because it gives us a little bit of a better
angle of pull for the lats.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.610
Alright.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.530
The lats are going to run in this direction,
just like that.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.680
And, ironically, they are going to attach
all the way, the only muscle group that actually

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.930
connect the upper body and the lower body
here; where we are going to have it attach

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.470
to our arm, the back of our humerus here,
and all the way into, really, the top of our

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.210
iliac crest, our hips because of the fascia
that connects through the back in the lumbar

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.210
spine.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.520
So, it is that big of a muscle and we want
to make sure that we take it through its full

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520
range.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.950
So the first we want to do is get those handles
out wide so that our arms are in like a "v"

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.800
position to actually help to get that V-taper.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:27.190
Now, when they come down, we want to pull
so that the elbows come in close to the body,

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.810
in tight.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.050
Up and out all the way so that we get a stretch,
and then in and down and tight.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.710
Now, here are the two tips: We are going to
turn our hands this way.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.710
Ok.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.710
Turn them out.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.290
Turning them out is actually causing internal
rotation up at the shoulder joint.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.270
The lats are going to help us internally rotate.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.620
So if you want to fully contract them, and
we are talking about actually contracting

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.620
the lats here.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.690
That's the key, guys for developing that shape.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.150
We want to turn our hands out.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.070
Now, same concept.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.100
Down, up wide, pull down, and squeeze.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.130
Up and out, down and squeeze.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.580
All the way out.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.580
Down.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.580
Squeeze.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.580
Ok.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.510
So now what's the last tip?

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.820
The last tip is: if we want to really enforce
what we are doing here, and we want to really

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.971
work on contraction, yeah, you might have
to drop that weight down because we are not

00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:34.840
talking about generating momentum here for
lat pull-downs, We are talking about actually

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840
contracting.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.320
So, you are going to want to make sure you
do that and drop the weight.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.490
One technique you could use is what we call
one and one-half reps.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.700
That allows us to ensure that we have to slow
it down and also drop the weight.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.050
With one and one-half reps, as a matter of
fact, we are going to go up just a little

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.080
bit.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:02.400
With one and one-half reps, basically, we
are going to come down, squeeze, up half way,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.540
back down and squeeze again, and then up and
full.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.540
Ok.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.820
Down, pull in, half way, back down, and then
up again.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.530
Now if you have not been doing these types
of exercises and really contracting your back

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.610
deliberately, you will see a big difference
when you start to train this way.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.430
As a matter of fact, you are going to be humbled
a bit by how much you might have to cut the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.610
weight stack down to do this.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.230
But, the benefits of this combined with heavy
weight training -- those exercises where you

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.060
are just moving your weight around -- is enormous.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:51.620
It's what allows us to get more V-taper in
the back because we are actually conscious

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.690
of contracting the muscle.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.860
So, guys, when you're training, as we do in
AthleanX, you got to have a balance of both.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.319
Functionally, sometimes, we just want to move
weight; we want to have a purpose and be functional.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:10.669
Other times, we want to have a real deliberate
contraction so that what we are doing is purposeful,

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.820
and we are actually engaging the muscle fully
through its full range-of-motion.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.720
And, in the case of getting the V-taper and
developing the lats fully, that's where you

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720
want to be.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.151

next week if you guys like this video.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.419
I'll tell you some things that you can specifically
do for the rhomboids that might help you just

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:43.419
as much.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.539
