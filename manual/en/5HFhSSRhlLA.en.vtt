Language: en

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.080
You know, youtube's automatic captions never work.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
In fact, I think a balloon made of paper holding a broken quill pen, could actually do a better job than this.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:13.910
I wonder how long it will be until someone notices that I am overwriting these things.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.900
You know, I always liked a god ice cream...

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.160
Do you like ice cream?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.710
It is good.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.349
The gameboy advance is pretty cool actually.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.930
I did have 3 of them,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.109
but I sold one to help raise money for a PSvita.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.950
I am quite enjoying my vita at the moment, however the money I raised with the gameboy never contributed to

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.410
it.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.030
Instead I bought myself a chocolate cake, and some lemonade.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.590
Do you like lemonade?

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.120
At the moment I am retyping these captions

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.969
because I am waiting for my review of Tetris to upload.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.320
And I have

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.590
nothing better to do really. 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.770
I could try to script another video while I wait, or play some SSX Tricky

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.570
but I cant be bothered.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.850
Instead I am

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.650
Doing this rather ridiculous thing.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.200
I wonder how long I can keep this up for?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.680
Have any of you guys played the Italian Job game that was 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.710
released on pc ages ago. It was

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.009
fun, but you can tell it was a budget title.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.009
Number 9 in this video is good.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.320
But not as good as this cookie.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.299
This cookie

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.960
tastes amazing, you should try one. It is white chocolate chipped.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.970
But then again, not everyone likes white chocolate.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.299
Nomnomnomnomnom.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.909
.....

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.729
Yeah, so how are you today?

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.880
It is 32 degrees Celsius outside. 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.399
Super hot.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.369
I wonder what the weather is like in America....

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.700
Minnesota maybe? New york? Chicago? 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.800
Some place....

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.940
Man I am bored.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.190
I think I need a faster internet connection.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.480
My upload speed is very slow.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.599
2mbps is not a great number....

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.650
I think I might go and make tea later

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.700
because I like tea.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.930
Ahhh

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.349
I have an idea!

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.849
If you are actually reading this, for

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.319
Some rather ridiculous reason then maybe you should suggest

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.940
what videos I should make next. That would be

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.560
pretty cool actually.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.330
Or just recommend me some games to play while I am waiting for an upload.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.069
Uploading is boring.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.080
Tagging videos is a bit of a pain in the arse too.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.230
Hmmm, actually I might stop this retyping now.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.709
Yeah, I think I will.

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.459
Well It was nice talking to you! And so I know that you read this, type BANANARAMA! in the comments!

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.680
After this caption you will be left to watch YouTube's interpretation of my speech..So Bye!

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.909
and trust me if you've ever played on
real tournament having

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.290
a number in the title your game was
everything

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.890
they should have called this something
like death destruction for Serena

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.470
tournament 2001 make your turn addition

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.470
now that would sell a game what would
happen if you cross a side-scrolling

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.040
shooter

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.190
up with the well-crafted RPG and Nando's

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.830
extra hot chicken burger well wanna
searching bag a sickness %uh saga is the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.530
answer

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.230
I have had a lot of fun with this game
and it was a strong contender for this

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.230
last on the list

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.290
with Mega Man Battle Network lacking a
little bit behind

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.769
but I think it this one would be a
little less well-known so here it is in

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:07.790
her she'll stay

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.069
number three VDN

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.450
to there were very few Schmucks

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.079
that I would consider more fun than AT&amp;T
has to why I'm not sure

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.470
is a fantastic music beautifully
rendered graphics a perfect difficulty

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.009
curve

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.220
the huge range is unique up grazing
weapons are buried

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.419
enemy types and boss fights I have no
idea

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.790
but what I do know is that this is a
great game

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.210
and really makes you forget about life
just for enough time to be happy for

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.290
once

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.850
number two lil does %ah don't worry I
whimpered be I promise

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.350
drill dozer is an action platformer with
originality coming out its is

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.710
is a charming fun platformer with some
good puzzling and started in

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.740
this even take Zelda ask boss battling
into the platform formula

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.900
the developers clearly went to town into
making this game

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.060
the best they possibly could no arm bar

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.990
why are on Mega Man I just tried again 0

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.360
this Dame has the award not only being
my favorite game on the list

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.800
but the game that I most enjoyed without
being able to complete it

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.220
this is a hard game but everything is so
well made and tight

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.100
well the graphics are so pretty I can't
help but love it

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.580
the setting goes something like this:
you a Boston yet out casually 0 after

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.160
waking up a century of the supposedly
died

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.120
being resurrected by scientist named CEO
in a cyber of that gave its life to

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.490
exchange your own

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.210
you decide to help out around help the
rebellion destroy some stuff

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.380
the Mega Man log a super funky the end
all you need to know is this is a great

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.240
game and it's available in a really

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.930
pre-release collection for the Nintendo
DS if you are so inclined to buy it on a

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.930
more modern system

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.500
up
