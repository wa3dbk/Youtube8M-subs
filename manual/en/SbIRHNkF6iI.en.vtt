If you wonder why we using these plastics cups

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.216

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:24.491
No shit, glass cuts, okay, okay?

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:27.468

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:58.500
Ow! (laughs)

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.173
Hit it with some simple syrup.

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:03.965
Now hit is with some of this.

00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:09.694
- [Scott] So you have acne on...

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.213
- Apparently when you drink too much, you break out.

00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:13.653
(both laugh)

00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:14.918

00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:32.987
I need you to pour right, Brittany, pour right.

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:34.206
- Oh my God, look at this!

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:35.913

00:01:35.913 --> 00:01:37.677
Oh Brittany, God, I keep messing with this girl.

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:38.397

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.460
- Strawberry what?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.677
- Daquir-- strawberry-- strawberry mix!

00:01:44.677 --> 00:01:46.593
(giggles)

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:50.270
- [Scott] Maybe you should read it, you smart ass.

00:01:50.072 --> 00:01:52.995
- Naw, girl, don't make me, breathe for Brittany

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:54.436

00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:01.571
(laughs)

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:04.090
- Malibu, oo, look at that yes.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.134
Could you help me from behind,

00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:06.830
could you just wrap your arms around me just to show me

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.828
kinda guide me?

00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:09.291
- Yeah 'cause I'm Scott, I'm always--

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:12.391
- Go real low, go real low, go real low!

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:13.807
- Brittany does not act like that!

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:14.945
(laughs)

00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:16.524
Brittany never acts like that!

00:02:16.524 --> 00:02:18.730
Look I'm Scott, look at my fat.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.983
I'm so fat.

00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:20.947
(laughs)

00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:23.005
I need to go to the gym.

00:02:25.634 --> 00:02:29.221
I know Brittany you always say there's babies in here.

00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:30.858
Your mother should have swallowed you whole.

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:33.531
- You sound so country.

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.943
Coming from an island, that's kind of weird.

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:39.611
- Uh, uh, we have horses in the Bahamas, and cows.

00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:41.108
I'm bohemian, man.

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:43.871
(both laugh)

00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:45.898
Shabop!

00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:49.282
- Ah! How you like them apples?

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:53.948
There you have it, the patriot paradise spike bomb cocktail.

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:55.731
Put your lips on that, go ahead.

00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:03.689
- Ooh, firecrackers!

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.825
- Look at Brittany, ladies and gentlemen.

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:07.102
Could you turn?

00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:09.122
You little ratchet model.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.917
(laughs)

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:14.962
Okay?

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:18.364
This beautiful lady is advertising

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.022

00:03:21.022 --> 00:03:23.727
Ow, can I pinch yours?

00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:24.621
You started-- ow!

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:25.701
You started first!

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:26.674
- You see that, you see that?

00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:29.262
He spit on my lip! He spit on my lip!

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:30.877
He spit on my lip.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.339
And he's weak.

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:33.837
He's so weak!

00:03:33.837 --> 00:03:35.300
- I can't help it if she's so fat.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.681
You got to stop puttin' on weight.

00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:37.702
- I'm fat?

00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:38.782
This is fat.

00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:39.897
No, stop! Don't touch me!

00:03:39.897 --> 00:03:41.081
(laughs)

00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:41.940
- Ow!

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.019
- I'm gonna throw you in the pool

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.680
but you have his mike, so...

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.700
Were you thinking about throwing me in the pool?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.952
I have a mike on too, you better stop.

00:03:48.952 --> 00:03:51.570
- Not with my mike on.

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:54.211
You see that wrestling move?

00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:55.674
- [Brittany] Don't look at my stretch marks.

00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:56.835
(laughs)

00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:58.239
- Hi, it's Amanda from Melbourne, Australia

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.621
