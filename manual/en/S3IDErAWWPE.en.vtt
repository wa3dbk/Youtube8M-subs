Hey Fitlifer.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.080
Drew Canole.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.720
Welcome to this week's Saturday Strategy.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.440
I'm excited you're here coz on today's Saturday
Strategy, I'm gonna show you my secret Nootropic

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.900
Juice recipe.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.110
Now the reason this is a secret is because
this is something that we've used to completely

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.740
change our mental clarity in the morning,
boost your brains up, revs up your metabolism,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.960
analogy that I like to use is that if your
could remember this, when you were a kid,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.440
running through the field first day of spring,
smell the fresh cut lawn and the sun shining

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.090
down on you after a long winter, this is what
this orange juice is gonna feel like.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.520
So you wake up in the morning, you want that
instant metabolism boost, you want your brain

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.960
fired up so that you could face the day and
be the most productive person that you know

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.190
you can be.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.180
So what are the 7 ingredients in my secret
Nootropic juice recipe?

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.760
Number one, the most important ingredient
in this, is Oranges.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.370
Most people buy orange juice in the store
that's pasteurized, meaning its heated up,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.000
its killed a lot of the enzymes.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.740
This fresh oranges are loaded with beta-carotene
and I like to call 'em the sweet sister of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.740
the lemon.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.740
They taste great.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.460
Lemons alkalize your body, its so does this
sweet sister.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.220
Its gonna alkalize your body in the morning
and in alkaline state, your brain and your

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.480
body operate much more effectively.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480
Next stop, we have cucumbers.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.540
When you stumble out of bed when you wake
up in the morning, you got to hydrate your

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.540
body.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
It's important to drink at least a liter of
water or you can simply have this juice recipe

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.470
first thing in the morning.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.250
And when you do, cucumbers, one of these guys,
is about 3 glasses of water which are amazing,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550
loaded with a lot of Silica, great anti-aging
properties.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.900
Another one, one of y favorite things I'm
gonna add to this juice recipe, is the Jalapeno.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.100
I like spicy food I'm gonna put a little bit
in there when its spicy, it has an active

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.580
ingredient in this Jalapeno that actually
thins your blood which is good for your circulation.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.060
Turmeric, one of the greatest anti-oxidants
in the planet and is anti-inflammatory.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.740
Meaning, its gonna rid the inflammation in
your brain when you get rid of the inflammation

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.970
in your brain, what happens?

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.180
Your thoughts starts happening quicker.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.030
You can live on purpose Fitlifer.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.610
You can start making creatively, writing and
doing all those things that maybe, you haven't

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.960
done in awhile but you love to do and you
know you want to do 'em.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.250
So, turmeric is awesome.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.130
We got MCT oil, a lot of long distance runners
use this.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.240
And according to herblist.com, basil actually
helps with cerebral circulation.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.160
Cerebral circulation increasing the neuro-synapsis
of your brain, you think more quickly, you

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.250
become more effective, and that is what its
all about.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.670
Coconut, acts like a transport, used in the
Vietnam war as saline bags and nutrients become

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.260
40% more absorbable when you combine them
with coconut water.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.720
This maybe the very best juice recipe that
you've ever drank in your whole entire life.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.630
First of, you gotta peel your oranges.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.580
We have 2 cucumbers, were gonna drop those
in the juicer.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.250
We have a handful of Basil, knuckles of turmeric,
and we have our Jalapeno and were gonna add

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.330
our MCT oil with coconut water to finish it
off.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Here we go.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.970
The moment 
of truth.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.780
That's amazing.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.110

metabolic type on what type of food you should

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.540
be eating that gives you a grocery store list
what to get in the grocery store.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.540
Because let's face it.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.510
There's a lot of misinformation out there
and your probably not getting the body that

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.510
you want.

So who won the juicer last week?

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.740
The juicer is going out to Paula.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.800
Paula won the juicer because she just got
50 and her back gets breaking, she's encouraging

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.410
everybody in her community to start juicing.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.509
Her blood work is back, it's never been better.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.520
She lost 42 pounds, so congratulations Paula.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.270
Give her a big round of applause.
