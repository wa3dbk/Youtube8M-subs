00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.530
hey folks this is Rhykker, bringing you an
update to Diablo 3 patch 2.3 crusader

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.210
hammerdin build. now this will just
be a quick update and I will assume that

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.869
you've already seen my main video on
this subject

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.710
after some changes in the PTR and his
new strategies emerged this bill has

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.519
changed slightly and we're gonna go over
these skills and items that you now need

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.140
so the main change is that the animation
on falling sword used to be really

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.250
clunky but now it's been sped up you
land a lot quicker and you can act

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.079
quicker after landing the Howard inset
also now bucks the damage of falling

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.850
soared by more than they used to but
really is the removal of the cockiness

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.170
that is the major selling point for the
next change is that we are dropping the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.750
generator I suggest that a variant in
which we would not use a generator and

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.469
that is what we're gonna go with instead
we're gonna use accurate champion profit

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.140
and in fact we're gonna get quite a bit
of time on this as we're gonna go over

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.449
in just a moment

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.390
next we're changing this to a wholly
built so we're swapping out plus a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.200
hammer limitless for a blessing hammer
thunderstruck this will increase the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.799
number of hammers that are being thrown
out there next we're dropping Steve

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.049
charge we're gonna replace that with
iron skin steel skin for more

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.040
survivability at those higher drifts
that will also allow us to swap out loss

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.460
of justice for laws of Valor critical
that's gonna wrap or attack speed and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.630
allow for some crazy fast hammer spend
an extra switching out plans 42 scared

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.759
to run on the provoke room and that
about covers the school changes on to

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.150
gear we will be swapping out our thunder
god vigor for a witching hour that's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.130
gonna give us more damage overall at the
cost of survivability but we're also

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.320
gonna get faster attacks be there and
that's going to mean more hammers not

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.570
only does more hammers me more damage
but we're bringing in an obsidian ring

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.799
of the zodiac that means we're dropping
focus and restraint rings with the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.009
Obsidian ring of the zodiac every time
we hit with a resource pending attack

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.140
like blessing hammer we reduce the
remaining cooldown on one of our skills

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.299
by one second

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.989
this is going to help us gain a lot more
uptime on actress champion profit the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.100
other rings will want

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.340
are the convention of elements and you
need again one of those you'll be

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.880
getting through York an ice cube and a
likely be Europe sitting ring of the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.690
zodiac through the armor you gonna want
to use in the cube we're swapping out

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.520
chrome stuff bracers for the sexy pants
of mister yet this will not only

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.600
increase our damage as we stay on the
move but also our resource generation

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.680
and this is able to work for us because
the Hammers don't necessarily deal for

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.790
damage when you first cast but as a
flying through the air so you're able to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.680
cast move cast move and as long as you
keep stutter step in that way

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.660
sexy pants bonus won't drop off and will
continue to benefit from them

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.370
Gabrielle spam braces are a must endure
bracer slot and the last change will

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.430
make is that we're swapping out the
molten wildebeest dessert for the Google

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.020
of swiftness again we want more attacks
be finalized by saying that PTR is still

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.920
ongoing and more updates may come to
this built over time 2.3 releases so do

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.450
