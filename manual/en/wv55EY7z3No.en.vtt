00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.470
A FORMER PEANUT EXECUTIVE IS
FACING LIFE IN JAIL AFTER HE

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.770
KNEW THAT SOME OF HIS PRODUCTS
WERE TAINTED AND AS A RESULT

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.800
SOME PEOPLE DIED FROM HIS
TAINTED PRODUCTS.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.270
BACK IN 2008,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.630
2009, PETER BUT IT WAS RECALLED
IN THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.499
OF THE SALMONELLA OUTBREAK.

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.509
NINE
PEOPLE DIED, AND SOME 700 PEOPLE

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.609
WERE EXTREMELY SICK.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.429
ACCORDING
TO REPORTS, THE WASHINGTON POST

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.521
TO BE SPECIFIC, PEANUT BUTTER
AND PEANUT PASTE PRODUCED BY THE

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:36.880
PEANUT CORPORATION OF AMERICA
WERE LATER FOUND TO BE

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.120
CONTAMINATED, TRIGGERING AN
OUTBREAK THAT KILLED NINE PEOPLE

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.010
AND SECOND SOME 700 OTHERS.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.430
THE
COMPANY'S OWNER HAD GIVEN THE

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.470
GO-AHEAD TO SHIP CONTAINERS THAT
WERE PARTIALLY COVERED IN DUST

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.050
AND RAT CRAP, ACCORDING TO

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.570
DOCUMENTS.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.440
STEWART PARNELL IS
FACING POSSIBLE LIFE BEHIND BARS

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.160
FOR THIS.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.220
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY
LAST YEAR ON SEVENTY-ONE

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.340
CRIMINAL COUNTS.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.259
SO THEY DIDN'T CHARGE HIM
WITH ANY NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE OR

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.229
ANYTHING, BUT THOSE ARE
SIGNIFICANT CHARGES AND THEY

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.679
FOUND HIM GUILTY.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.460
IT DOES SOUND
AMAZING, RIGHT?

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.460
IN AMERICA, FOR

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.399
A CORPORATE EXECUTIVE TO BE
CONVICTED AND MAYBE GET A LIFE

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.399
SENTENCE.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.810
HE DIDN'T EVEN SMOKE
POT, AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.869
NO, IN

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.069
THIS CASE WE HAD A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE DIED.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.069
AFTER PEOPLE WHO

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.689
WERE CONTAMINATED WERE KIDS.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.700
IT'S A DISASTER, BUT IT STILL

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.639
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME.

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:46.259
SO
MANY CORPORATIONS DO SO MUCH

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.189
DAMAGE AND THEY NEVER GET
BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.189
UNTIL I

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.139
READ LATER ON THE ARTICLE, IN
2009, BECAUSE OF ALL THESE

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:53.869
PROBLEMS, THE COMPANY WENT
BANKRUPT.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.950
SO I FIND IT, THEY ARE

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.950
NOW POOR.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.709
THAT ALLOWS
PROSECUTORS TO GO AFTER THEM AND

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:00.899
TREAT THEM LIKE EVERY OTHER

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.219
PERSON IN AMERICA.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.149
IF THEY WERE STILL MAKING MONEY,
WOULD THEY BE BROUGHT ON

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:17.239
ANY CHARGES?

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.349
THERE ARE MULTIPLE OTHER
CORPORATIONS INVOLVED IN THE

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.630
FOOD INDUSTRY THAT HAVE HAD
SALMONELLA OUTBREAKS OVER THE

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.849
PAST FEW YEARS.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.439
THERE'S BEEN
LETTUCE WITH SALMONELLA

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.890
OUTBREAKS, A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT
TYPES OF FOODS.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.890
IT IS ALWAYS

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.420
SURPRISING TO ME TO SEE THOSE
STORIES POPPED UP AND NO ONE

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.910
EVER PAYS CONSEQUENCES.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.129
THIS GUY
COMES ALONG AND LIFE BEHIND

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.129
BARS?

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.129
IS INCREDIBLE.

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.220
BUT YOU
READ THE DETAILS OF THE STORY

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.989
AND YOU SEE HOW SHADY YEARS, AND

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.970
IT PROVES THAT CORPORATIONS ARE
AMORAL DOT IS ABOUT THE

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.590
BOTTOM LINE, THE CHEAPEST WAY TO
PRODUCE THE PRODUCT SO THEY

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.430
CAN PROFIT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.599
PARNELL NOT ONLY KNEW ABOUT
THE CONTAMINATION, BUT HAD

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.610
WORKED TO COVER IT UP WHILE HE
CONTINUED TO SHIP THAT

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.640
PRODUCTS TO FOOD PROCESSORS.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.180
IN ONE EMAIL FROM MARCH 2007

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.310
HE TOLD HIS CREW, "SHIP IT,
JUST SHIP IT.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.180
I CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE
ANOTHER CUSTOMER."

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.280
IT LEFT HIM TO LOSE MULTIPLE
CUSTOMERS IN THE WRONG WAY.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280
I'M

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.549
HAPPY THAT YOUR ARE GOING AFTER
HIM, AND I AM NOT DEFENDING HIM

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.349
AT ALL, I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.580
THEY ARE GOING AFTER HIM.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.300
WOULD
IT BE AMAZING IF CORPORATIONS

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.620
WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE ANYTIME

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.030
THEY HARM TO PEOPLE?

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.530
YOU
PRIVATIZE THE GAMES AND

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.280
SOCIALIZED LOSSES.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.280
I PUT

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.690
POLLUTION INTO THERE, OR INTO
THE RIVER THAT YOUR KIDS LIVE BY

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.470
OR SWIM IN, WELL, THOSE COSTS
ARE ON YOU.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.580
I'M NOT GO TO JAIL

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.769
FOR THAT, I'M USUALLY NOT EVEN
GONNA PAY A FINE.

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.769
IF I DO IT'S

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.829
GOING TO BE A TINY FINE.

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.940
THEN I
SAY BIG GOVERNMENT,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.499
OVERREGULATION, AND I PAY
POLITICIANS TO THE SAY THE SAME

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:05.060
AND I PUT THE LOSSES ON YOU.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.060
IN
THIS CASE, THE LOSSES WERE

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.501
SIGNIFICANT AND THEY HAD NO
MONEY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES, SO

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:16.000
BE HERE THEY ARE LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.500
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT
NINE PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.210
OF WHAT THIS COMPANY DID, WHAT
YOU THINK ABOUT A LIFE SENTENCE?

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.040
DO YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE?

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.940
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO
LOOK AT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.160
AMERICA WHERE YOU CAN GET A LIFE
SENTENCE FOR SMOKING POT.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.160
SO

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:43.960
FUCK YEA, IT MAKES SENSE.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.699
IF HE
WASN'T A CORPORATE EXECUTIVE

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.490
WOULD HE GET LIFE BEHIND BARS?

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.180
VERY LIKELY.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.812
SO, SHOULD THE LAW

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:51.812
APPLIED TO HIM EQUALLY?

00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:52.812
YES.

00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:57.360
THE
POINT WHERE I GET CONCERNED IS

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.960
WHERE WE ARE THROWING A TON OF
BUSINESSMEN IN JAIL AND IT IS

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.090
OVERZEALOUS PROSECUTION, AND
MAYBE THEY KNEW OR DIDN'T KNOW,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.540
BUT WE ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT
POINT.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.740
THAT COULD HAPPEN, BUT

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.660
THAT IS NOT THE COUNTRY WE LIVE
IN.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.830
IN THIS CASE, NINE PEOPLE

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.290
DIED BECAUSE THIS GUY WANTED TO
MAKE AN EXTRA BUCK.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.290
YEAH, I

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.840
THINK LIFE BEHIND BARS IS

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.010
POSSIBLE.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.870
WE WANT YOU GUYS TO WEIGH IN
ON THIS AS WELL, SO IF YOU GO TO

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.030
THE TYT APP, DOWNLOAD IT BY
GOING TO THE APPLE STORE, WE

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.030
HAVE A

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.030
PLURAL UP FOR YOU.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.240
LET'S TAKE A
LOOK AT THE RESULTS SO FAR.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.740
AGAIN, BUT ON THIS AND TELL US

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:50.039
WHAT YOU THINK STOP A WHOPPING
EIGHTY-FOUR PERCENT OF YOU HAVE

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.510
SAID IS SO FAR THAT THIS IS A

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.039
FAIR CHARGE.

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:09.960
KEEP IT REAL.
