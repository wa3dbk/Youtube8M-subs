00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.390
Sometimes in medicine, you'll
see that words get used a lot,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.760
and sometimes their
meaning is pretty

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.659
simple or straightforward
and can be understood.

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.200
But the words
themselves end up being

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.640
kind of tricky and confusing,
and I think some of that

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.770
has to do with the fact
that these words in medicine

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.460
often come from Latin,
and so we haven't really

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.430
changed the word.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.680
And so because Latin is not
a language that any of us

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.660
are really familiar
with, it ends up

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.790
being that the terms
become confusing.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.415
So what I'm going to
do is I'm actually

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:37.470
going to lay out
four words for you.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.300
Going to put out four words,
start with "chronotropy."

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.310
And we're going to go through
them one by one, basically

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.340
kind of describing
what they mean.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.400
So chronotropy refers
to the heart rate.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.005
Now I should put in
parentheses a simpler way

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:54.380
to maybe think
about these terms,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.950
so chronotropy has to
do with heart rate.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.230
A second term is "dromotropy."

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.555
And dromotropy has to do
with conduction velocity.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.490
How fast a signal is
going from one cell

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.990
to the next,
conduction velocity.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.070
And then we have
"inotropy," and inotropy

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.980
has to do with contractility,
how hard the muscle is

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.450
contracting, the
force of contraction,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.500
you can think of it as
the force of contraction.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.240
And "lusitropy,"
and lusitropy has

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.050
to do with the relaxation,
how fast it's relaxing.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.940
So let's go through
these one at a time

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.000
and talk about the effects
of the sympathetics

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.540
and the parasympathetics
on this.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.440
So the other thing I'm
going to do maybe in white,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.150
I'm going to write out
where, where these things are

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.969
primarily being affected, right?

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.719
Where and then we'll
talk about synthetics

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:10.729
and parasympathetics.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.650
OK.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.150
So where is the
first one happening?

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.790
So we talk about
chronotropy and, of course,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.370
it's not just one cell
that's going to be affected,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.000
but in general, what cluster of
cells are we thinking of here?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.690
You're right if you
think about the SA node,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.950
and this is where the
heart rate is usually set,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.860
and sympathetics are
going to basically make

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.380
the SA node go and fire
faster, because they're

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.820
going to allow more
sodium into those cells.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.320
So it's going to get up to
the threshold for an action

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.190
potential more quickly.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.460
And parasympathetics basically
do the opposite, right,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.710
they're going to allow less
sodium to get a flow in,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.060
and it's going to take longer to
get to the threshold potential.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.450
So what about dromotropy?

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.467
This is a word that's
maybe less commonly used,

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:00.050
and that's why I
wanted to throw it up

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.175
just so that you're at
least familiar with the fact

00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:03.220
that it exists.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.870
But dromotropy has to do
with conduction velocity.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.133
So how fast is the signal being
conducted through the heart?

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:13.950
You remember for
this, the major delay

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.630
ends up being in the AV
node, right, the huge delay--

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.580
sometimes we say it's 1/10 of
a second-- is in the AV node.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.910
So what happens in the AV node
with sympathetic stimulation.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.730
Well, you remember when you
have sympathetics around,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.450
they allow the calcium to come
into the cell more quickly.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.690
So you actually have a
faster conduction velocity.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.970
So actually there's a less
of a delay with sympathetics,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.480
and with parasympathetics
there's a longer delay, right?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.330
Again, it's slower the
AV node because you

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.550
have less calcium coming
in during the action

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.990
potential of the AV node.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.670
So the slope of the
action potential

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.020
is slower, is lower,
in parasympathetic.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.420
Now, what about these last
two, inotropy and lusitropy?

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.000
Well, both have to do with
the ventricles, contractility

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.030
and the force of contraction.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.860
And then relaxation
is how quickly

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.930
are the ventricles relaxing.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.250
So I'm going to write for
both of them "ventricles."

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.029
And I'm putting both
ventricles left and right,

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.300
because it's not just one
or the other, same rules

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.520
apply in both sides.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.410
So ventricles.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.210
And already I can tell
you that parasympathetics

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.960
are going to have very
little effect here,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.100
right, because we said
that really sympathetics

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.990
affect your ventricles, and
the parasympathetics simply

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.657
don't have a similar effect
to counterbalance it.

00:04:39.657 --> 00:04:41.740
So I'm just going to put
a little white line there

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.690
to imply there's no major
parasympathetic effect

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.620
on either inotropy or lusitropy
from a ventricle standpoint.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.910
All right, so sympathetics.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.965
What do they do for inotropy?

00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:55.230
Or in terms of inotropy?

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.822
Well, you remember,
contractility

00:04:56.822 --> 00:04:58.280
is related to the
amount of calcium

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.740
that's going to come in
during the action potential.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.470
So what's going to happen if you
have sympathetic stimulation?

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.470
Well, you're going to get
more calcium in there,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.700
so you're going to have a
harder contraction or a stronger

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.790
force, I'll just put
"harder contraction."

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.980
Meaning the muscles are
going to squeeze down

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.770
more forcefully than
they would otherwise.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.930
And what about relaxation?

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.800
Well, this is the
interesting thing

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.560
we talked about with the
sarcoplasmic reticulum, right?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.480
That's what's going to
mop up all the calcium

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.300
and allow our heart to get
back into a state of relaxing,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.070
and it's going to happen much
quicker with sympathetics,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.500
because they stimulate
those ATP channels,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.570
or ATP pumps to get
calcium pumped back

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.000
into the sarcoplasmic
reticulum, and away

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.040
or sequestered from
the cell itself.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.200
So they basically create
a faster relaxation.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.640
So these are kind of the
quick and dirty overview

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.266
of these four words, and
again, you may or may not

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:03.640
hear these words, but at least
you're familiar with them.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.290
Chrono, dromo, ino, and lusi.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.090
These four words describe
the major functions

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.510
of the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nerves

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.244
on the heart.
