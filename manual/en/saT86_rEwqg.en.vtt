00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.940
Hello everyone. I'm going to offer a short review of
the Alzo Digital Pan-L-Lite Twin.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.150
As a corporate and event shooter, I'm always on the lookout for well made gear

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.269
the represents a solid value, ease of use, and
durability.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.859
In about 8 months of use, this light has become my go-to light for 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.390
single person interviews.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.740
It compares favorably to fluorescent lights
costing much more

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.000
and includes some unique features that I
will point out.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.170
The Pan-L-Lite weighs in at about 8 lbs with tubes, stand mount, 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.650
and honeycomb grill.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.740
It uses the standard T52G 11 bulbs available in 5600 or 3200K

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.810
The included bulbs are a direct replacement for the Kino Flo Diva Light.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.550
Thus they have  high CRI of greater than 90. 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.110
Light output is 400 watts using the equivalent of 110 watts of power.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.950
The Pan-L-Lite operates an
international voltage ranging from a

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.059
100 to 240 volts.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.700
The bulbs are rated for 8000 hours of use.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.870
Unlike some caselights, the Alzo lights include 4 way barn doors.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.980
These powder-coated barn doors are not removeable,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.600
but fold back flat help protect the bulbs
during transport.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.900
A lightweight honeycomb grille is also
included.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.170
The grill mounts in place with spring loaded  clips.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.380
A removable stand mount allows for vertical or
horizontal mounting.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.369
it also allows for a angle adjustment

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.220
without resorting to heavier or bulkier yokes, goosenecks or ball joints.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.549
Also included is a white diffusion cloth
that attaches to the barn door's via velcro tabs

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.740
The vented back panel has a single
illuminated power switch 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.790
and a marked slide dimmer.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.480
Here's what I like about the Twin Lite:

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.310
Low heat output keeps your talent cooler.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.040
Power usage is less than tungsten light
for equivalent amount of lumens,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.780
therefore less chance of blown fuses

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.819
A larger light source equates to a softer
light which is more flattering 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.790
on your talent.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.059
A built-in slide dimmer means no need to
carry an external dimmer.

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:23.989
Lightweight aluminum construction and
a thin profile makes it easier to transport.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.909
Built-in four-way barn doors and a
removable honeycomb grille 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.419
helps control light spill.

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.229
Here a few things i'd like to see
improved:

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.669
The top handle does not fold.

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.559
Fluorescent bulbs take a little while to
reach full outputs so you should allow one or

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.239
two minutes.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.300
A centrally mounted AC input

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.839
would make for a neater cord hang.

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:48.219
I give the Alzo light high marks for
being a full featured case light at an

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.909
attractive price.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.179
If you're looking for more power, a quad light is available with 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.519
twice the output.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.389

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.159
Thank you for your time and happy
shooting.
