00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.709
a trade in Spain derailed last Wednesday
killing 80 people

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.180
and now it turns out that it's been
confirmed that the

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.910
train was speeding at very very fast
going about 120 miles an hour

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.129
doubled the speed limit for that train
1515 Barack personals

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.560
fifty miles an hour morning about one in
I'll

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.810
yeah now I driver about trade was a man
by the name a Francisco Jose

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.590
cars own and I he is now detained in the
hospital where he is receiving treatment

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.050
I he has been accused of manslaughter
and views are probably going to stand

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.340
trial as a result of that

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.030
however he has been formally charged yet
up now he feels terrible about it as he

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.629
showed

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.899
I but before this accident happened she
had posted online the following

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.829
a match where Russia would be traveling
alongside a Civil Guard and passing them

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.510
so that their speed traps go off he

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.469
that would be quite a fine tour an FAA a
red fay

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.510
which is the name of the company that he
was working for so obviously he got of

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.949
fun

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.970
speeding in and playing these games that
look he's a 30-year veteran

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.170
I don't know if he was bored a bite to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.540
you got people's lives at stake here and
here he comes is of course that is so

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.650
fast

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.270
I mean it you know one thing you need to
watch out for leads the that there's not

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.290
tons of things that go over on a train

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.630
like the you're looking merge into
another train or something like

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.470
ask every once in a while like what do
you think about going super fast have a

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.159
psychologist doctor drivers like

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.460
the one safety thing you really need to
watch out for i think im surprised there

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.210
isn't a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.850
there wasn't some sort of control I just
stop anything going on Spain

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.960
other last year and yeah I just

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.329
assorted imagine it so high-tech that
used to

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.350
me I just imagine that that come around
a curve it automatically slows to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.360
fifty-mile they should look into that
yeah I so there's apparently some sort

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.540
of alarm goes off

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.600
if driver is going way too fast and in
this case the alarm didn't go off but it

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.380
was too late

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.090
he said I fucked it up I want to die
yeah and he came away with minor

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.990
injuries

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.000
now that you know about this now they
say the least 378 people have died

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.629
hundreds injured I don't know how you
live with yourself and

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.879
and you know I we see the most horrible
mistake you can make

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.550
and you would think with 30 years
experience you'd know better but I mean

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.390
I remember

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.060
as a friend of mine was 18 and he was a
goofball

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.750
by nature and use it to take a curve and
a car were in the car with him so Honda

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.310
Civic

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.319
and he's like let me see a fascinating
concerned I was thinking don't

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.379
don't that's a bad idea right and I was
like 15 at the time

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.870
and each tries to take a relief as a
bowl mix the Kirk

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.660
destroys the car literally wrecked the
car right we're all fine

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.870
I me but there was a eighty-year-old
goofball their

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.330
you been driving trains for thirty years
I don't care how poor you are and how

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.019
much you want

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.610
speed in go do it in your own car so
what are those mistakes bed we used to

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.260
talk about

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.340
your state you can't recover from United
really depends on what kinda mistaken as

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.550
I mean it was a mistake worn out by

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.709
him slipping even if he was tired
because Jens level I slept in the Nile

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.879
I'm sure this is how it works but he hit
that fell into the accelerator

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.230
right and then because he was but he
would go over around and coffee or

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.810
whatever

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.500
and then couldn't recover in time you
know then I would think

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.420
you at some point would be like oh that
was a terrible mistake at the worst

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.360
possible time

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.959
but it wasn't deliberate callousness it
was this is the lib risk and was like

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.530
delivery time is based on a sister the
fact that he posted the picture 11 tire

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.659
lead but also it mean we mention a
couple times that he's a better

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.400
in 30 years that may actually have
worked against it because someone is

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.629
brand new might be incredibly scared
about causing some cutbacks and where as

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.290
he's done

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.840
hundreds thousands have different trips
you know on this train

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.150
and I've never had an accident before
apparently I can up the ante a little

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.569
bit

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.250
perhaps rare mind doing executed tire in
a backyard ago

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.150
that tired ever in a baby before near
yeah he's a tiger and if you take a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.430
train at a certain speed around a curve

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.989
there's something called physics and it
will fall
