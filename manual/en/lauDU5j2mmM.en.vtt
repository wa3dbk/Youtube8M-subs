00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.210
Now, I'm going to take the pieces of hair
that we left out, and I'm going to actually

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.760
fold them over the scarf and kind of incorporate
them in, so they are going to hide part of

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.360
the scarf.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.080
Taking little sections, I'm going to start
here in the back.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.710
You can do a little twist before you send
it back, if that helps you out.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.430
You're just going to twist it up and pin it
in place.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.930
Now, we're just going to move right along,
we're going to take the next section, we're

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.430
going to clip it up, bobby pin it in place.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.350
I like to use two bobby pins to make sure
everything is secure, especially when her

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.050
hair is so short.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.899
You can see on the side, it just kind of gives
it almost a braided look on the side.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.280
Now, we're getting towards the front and we
want to decide how much hair we want to leave

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.559
out.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.690
I like her bangs, I like a little softness
around the face, but I think I'm going to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630
pull one more piece up.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.430
I'm going to incorporate it into the hair.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.200
Another great thing about how we left this
top piece loose, is you don't have to be too

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.070
neat with your bobby pins because you know
that they are just going to get covered up.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.340
We'll just continue doing that to this side
also.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.609
One trick that I always suggest when using
bobby pins is never open up the bobby pin.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.060
A bobby pin is only made to hold a certain
amount of hair, so when you open it up before

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.079
you use it, you are actually putting too much
hair into the bobby pin.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.430
This part can be really fun because you can
decide which hair you want to leave down around

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.450
the face, how much softness you want to get.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.139
Then I would actually add a little bit of
teasing to the base here.

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.780
You could do this before or after, it doesn't
matter.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.649
I just want a little bit more height, kind
of here in the center.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:01.310
I'm just combing the hair, and then combing
it in the opposite direction that it lives.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.169
Teasing is great if you have short hair.

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:06.789
It allows you to get a lot of volume and a
lot of texture in the hair.

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.610
It's one of the biggest things we struggle
with when we have shorter hair is how do we

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.610
get it textured?

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.810
It always kind of looks the same, so a tease
really helps with that.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.280
And I'm just kind of teasing random spots,
not trying to get too round of a shape, just

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.690
trying to give it a little bit of movement
at the top.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.570
I like to keep a little part in the hair.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.720
We already parted it on this side.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.130
I'm going to keep that as opposed to making
it a perfectly round silhouette.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.860
I don't want it to have a 1950's feel.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.410
I want it to be a little softer than that,
so I'm not going to make it too perfect, is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.470
what I'm saying.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.080
So that's just a really fun style to do with
a bob.
