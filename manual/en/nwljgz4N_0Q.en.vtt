Hi, I'm Linda and I'd like to talk to you
about using Gildale Softwood Bedding Pellets.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.600
You'll need a wheelbarrow, preferably a plastic
one but it doesn't really matter. A bedding

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.480
fork, I use a plastic one but you can use
a metal one as long as the tines aren't too

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.480
wide, and a bucket of water. At this time
of the year, I probably use one to two bags

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.280
per week per horse. If you were stabling a
horse a lot more, if they were only out for

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.280
a few hours a day you'd probably use half
a bag to a bag every other day. First we pour

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.760
the water in, and let the pellets expand.
For each bag, I pour a full five-gallon pail

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.350
- that's a pail right to the top. Pellets
expand very quickly, especially in warmer

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.760
weather. It takes about two minutes, normally
I will add the water to the wheelbarrow and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.949
use a different wheelbarrow while I clean
the stall. By the time I'm done the stall

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.949
which is less than five minutes, the pellets
are ready to be loaded into the stall. We

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.430
can scoop out the buns and not waste any bedding.
The bedding filters through the fork. And

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.120
then, around their wet spots - and sometimes
you can see them, sometimes it's more hidden

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.120
if the bedding's a little deeper. I'll just
scrape away the dry stuff, the wet shavings

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.510
stick together - they come out in a clump.
And because my horses pee in exactly the same

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.020
spot, I'll take a scoop or two of the dry
pellets there because I know they're going

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.020
to be soaked by the horse. Then I cover them
up. The reason you add water to the shavings

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.470
is to make them expand and break down. This
makes a more comfortable bedding for the horse,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.550
and the smaller surface area of the shavings
actually makes them more absorbant. See these

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.550
are already soft and crumbly, and that's what
you're looking for. There's no water sitting

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.680
at the bottom of the wheelbarrow. Makes excellent
compost for the garden, this stuff becomes

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.120
(with the manure) like peat moss and makes
great stuff to put in your garden. Then we

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.120
just spread it out. And as you can see, there's
no dust at all. That's it. I found when I

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.930
first set up the stalls, these are twelve
by twelve stalls, that we put in eight to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.930
twelve bags per stall. That was winter so
it was about six inches deep, using eight

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.189
to ten bags. I use a lot less in the summer,
this is more my summer bedding which is three

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.290
to four inches thick. The pellets are more
convenient than using bailed shavings for

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.290
a number of reasons, they take up less storage
space for one. They are more absorbant, especially

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.159
for urine. Gildale Farms delivers right to
my barn, I don't even need to be home. I just

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:44.159
call them up or email them, and when I come
home the pellets are there.
