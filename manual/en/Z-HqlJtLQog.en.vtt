So, hello everyone, i am MrHardasLt and today i am doing an unusual video- Minecraft lesson video.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:20.180
And today in lesson i am gonna show you how to do easy, very simple to do in Survival, in Multiplayer, very useful-

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.900
Automatic baking system

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.140
So, we need 18 cobblestone, 15 iron, and 60 wood.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:01:09.340
First, make the crafting table, here. So, then we need to make 7 chests.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.080
Sorry for big noises :D

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:27.380
Then, use 3 chest and some of iron, and make 3 hoopers.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:54.700
Then, do everything that I will do.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.600
Then, with 8 cobblestones make furnace.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.600
Place 2 chests here.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.580
Then, place furnace here.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.920
Then, place hooper just like that-

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.520
Then, place hooper again just like me.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.260
Place 2 chest here, in the top.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.360
And, here- place the last hooper.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.220
And that's all! We've done our baking system.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:19.860
Now, we can test our system: get some sand, or other thing, that we can cook in our system, and get some coal.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.520
Then, place the sand in the chest

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.560
And in the hooper- place all the coal.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.640
Look, the glass is going to the chest!

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.540
So, thank you for watching, and all this time you were with MrHardasLt. Like, Subsribe, and share!
