The Singing Walrus. Let's write the letter C!

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.019
Hey kids!

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.769
Now we're going to write the letter C, as in 'cat'.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.689
C-c-cat!

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.980
You'll need a practice sheet and a pencil. 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.800
Go to our website to download our free practice sheet.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.290
First, we'll write the capital C.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.390
That's the big C.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.390
Start at the top and go around to the
bottom.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.780
Let's try that again.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.980
Go around to the bottom.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.980
Now you try.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.230
Now check if you did it right.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.550
Great job! Now we're going to write the
lower case c.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.799
That's the small c.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.420
Start in the middle and go around to the
bottom.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.710
Let's try that again.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.220
Go around to the bottom.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.310
Now you try!

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.380
Now check if you did it right.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.380
Well done!

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.410
