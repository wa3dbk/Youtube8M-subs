00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.800
European Elderberry.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.289
Sambucus nigra.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.780
This variety is Black Beauty.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.710
Notice the dark foliage on particular cultivar,
giving it it's name; the Black Beauty.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.510
There are many different varieties of the
European species, including some that have

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.390
this dark foliage, some with a very lacy cut
leaf effect, some with a variegation that

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.480
includes white to sometimes pink and yellow
and green.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.680
These flat topped clusters, called cymes,
of lightly fragrant but distinctly elder smelling

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.150
flowers, appear in late May and are a part
of our landscape for at least two weeks in

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.280
early June.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.990
As well the dark foliage is a wonderful accent
through the whole growing season.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.700
In the fall you get a great set of very useful
berries, for bird, man &amp; squirrel.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.159
In the Summer the berries set and turn from
a green to a dark, sometimes black, often

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.159
blue.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.719
They are edible, best used as a jam.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.950
They make wines and cordials flavored with
elderberries.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.149
Medicinally, it has been used to treat the
H1N1 virus that was such a scare a few years

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:59.439
ago, as well as other upper respiratory inflammatory
issues.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.750
Elderberry can grow 15 to 20 feet tall and
creates quite a colony of young plants, as

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.780
it can grow at least that wide.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.760
There is at least one native American species
that you find often in the mid-West growing

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.230
in large colonies.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.260
It's a great ground cover.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.370
It's a wonderful forage for wildlife and it's
very important in wildlife management in parts

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.790
of the mid-West.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.920
Plant Elderberry in full sun to part shade,
in any good garden soil.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.080
Available in pots, as a balled and burlaped
youngster in good local nurseries or by mail

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.190
order.
