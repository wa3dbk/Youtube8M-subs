00:00:01.045 --> 00:00:05.844
Eleven-Eleven-Eleven, what a legendary date for a mathematical mind,

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:09.776
and I want to say first off that there's nothing really significant about this date in particular,

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:14.148
but it is neat to see the 1s monopolize the shorthand form, which occurs once a century.

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:17.423
There are some things that come to mind, though, when I think of the number 11,

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:19.754
and specifically, 'one-one'

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:24.425
First -- Genesis 1:1 - In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the earth.

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:26.938
We see that this is the overarching heading to Creation.

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:33.700
We see God is our wonderful and creative God who provides us new beginnings, and this is true even today.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.270
He provides us new beginnings through Jesus.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.309
John 1:1 - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.589
the next few verses...The same was in the beginning with God,

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.382
as well as everything that was created was created through Him,

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.851
and nothing that was made was made without Him.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:55.517
Eleven verses after that, 'The Word was made flesh and He dwelt among us'

00:00:55.517 --> 00:01:01.095
We see that Jesus came as a sacrifice for our sins.  He lived a perfect sinless life,

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:04.164
and He gives us new beginnings through faith in Him.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.805
We can also take some lessons from the number eleven,

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:10.501
and specifically, some negative examples that we shouldn't follow.

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:14.888
There were 11 rulers in the Old Testament who were pointed out for being angry at God's prophets

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:16.689
when they brought them His message.

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.823
Let's not be like that!  Hebrews warns us so many times, 'Do not harden your hearts!'

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:25.920
So let's not be like Pharaoh, or Herod, or Balak, or Zedekiah --

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.258
let's always have humble hearts before God, always attentive to His voice, to His Holy Spirit's leading,

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.460
and let's walk in His blessings.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.857
Of the Twelve disciples that Jesus picked, only eleven remained faithful,

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:43.003
and some people will say that Jesus was a failure because He picked Judas Iscariot to be His disciple...

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:48.008
Not so!  It's very clear that Jesus had a very sovereign plan in all of this.

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.057
In Mark, there's a theme of 'Discipleship Failure' --

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:57.118
and the disciples pre-Pentecost (before the Holy Spirit was poured out) didn't get some of what Jesus was saying or doing or predicting.

00:01:57.118 --> 00:02:01.447
Jesus was saying, 'I need to be betrayed into the hands of sinners and be sacrificed...'

00:02:01.447 --> 00:02:06.055
'and give My life as a ransom for many, and then I'll resurrect on the third day!'

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:09.196
And He was telling them this, but they totally didn't get it sometimes!

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:13.531
But we see here that Jesus knew what He was doing, even in picking Judas Iscariot...

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.036
but a lesson here -- don't be a Judas!

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:21.509
So many times we want to be a John and lay our heads on the bosom of Jesus, and be so close to Him,

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:29.383
but instead, we're a Judas and betray Him in our sin.  Let's repent!  Let's follow Jesus and love Him more each day.

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:35.222
So I would say, 'Seize the Day,' but instead, I'll say, 'Carpe Diem pro Iesus'

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.683
Seize the Day for Jesus.

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:40.961
And in the last 11 seconds of this video, you might want to find a place to pray,

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:44.197
to commit your life to the Lord, to purify your heart before Him,

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:48.756
and may the Holy Spirit enable you, regardless of how mundane or how unique a date is,

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:53.782
to do what He has for you to do 'Today' -- God bless you!

00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:54.000
