00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.320
NATHAN COOPER: Hello, my
name is Nathan Cooper.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.750
I work at the US Mission to
International Organizations

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.680
in Vienna.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.120
And I come from the
beautiful state of Oregon.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.320
It's a state with
majestic natural resources

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.960
and a fiercely
independent character.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.360
Before I talk a bit extensively
about the state's history

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.260
and culture, let
me quickly dispel

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.720
three common misconceptions
about my home state.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.380
First, many people often
guess Oregon is somewhere

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.970
in the middle of the country.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.800
Actually, Oregon is on the
West Coast of the United States

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.840
just above California.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.210
Second, although you may
have heard of called Oregon,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.150
locals pronounce it Oregon.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.970
And last, contrary to what
weather maps often depict,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.760
Oregon is not the wettest
in place in America.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.410
That's actually Hawaii.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.130
Oregon is perhaps
most famous for it's

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.160
dramatic and diverse landscape.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.640
It's rugged coastline
contains sprawling beaches

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.520
and a fascinating
array of marine life,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.720
including noisy sea lions
and vibrant tide pools.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.470
The western half of
the state is dominated

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.910
by the volcanic
Cascade Mountain range.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.540
There you'll find famous
peaks like Mount Hood,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.480
dense evergreen forests,
and rushing rivers.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.350
The Western Willamette
Valley is also home

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.400
to the state's two
largest cities,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.080
Portland and Eugene, as
well as a world class

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.700
wine making region.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.450
And a vast high elevation
desert covers the eastern half

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.630
of the state.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.720
Southern Oregon's Crater
Lake is the deepest lake

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.840
in the United States.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.300
It was formed by a collapsed
volcano in the Cascades.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.090
These kinds of
natural resources have

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.430
attracted explorers and
adventurers to Oregon

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.144
since its earliest days.

00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:45.560
Archaeologists
have found evidence

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.900
of human settlements in
what is now known as Oregon,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.570
dating back at
least 15,000 years.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.670
Large numbers of
Native American groups,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.420
including the Umpqua, Malala.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.050
Klamath, and Chinook
called the area home

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.340
in the 1500s, when Spanish
explorers first encountered

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.400
the Oregon coast in 1543.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.970
Centuries later,
President Thomas Jefferson

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.670
commissioned explorers
Lewis and Clark

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.550
to cross the continent in search
of a commercial route for trade

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.660
with Asia.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.330
In 1806 they reached what
is now known as Oregon.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.800
Lewis and Clark's successful
continental crossing

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.770
led to Oregon joining
the Union in 1859.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.090
They're still considered
Oregon's forefathers today.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.360
OK that's probably enough
of a history lesson.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.890
Now for a bit of trivia.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.850
It's the only state with an
official nut, the hazelnut,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.170
which is also sometimes
called a filbert.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.030
It's the home of Nike.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.080
It's also the global
capital of windsurfing,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.480
based in Hood River, Oregon
on the banks of the Columbia

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.660
River.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.870
Oregon has more ghost
towns than anywhere else

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.710
in the former wild west.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.110
And Oregon has some strangely
named communities as well.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.720
My favorites include the
towns of Weed, Drain, Nimrod,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.770
and Boring.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.390
Oregon is physically the
seventh largest American state,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.120
but ranks only 29 in
terms of population.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.870
Politically, Oregon is
both extremely independent

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.780
and strongly polarized.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.050
Oregonians pioneered
direct legislation

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.370
by the state's citizens
through ballot initiatives

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.350
and referendum, a system now
used throughout the nation.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.590
This democratic device
allowed Oregonians

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.800
to go against the national
grain with policies

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.420
like banning self-pumping
at gas stations

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.390
and doing away with state taxes.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.630
Oregon's independent streak
comes through clearly

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.690
in the state's motto.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.630
"She flies with her own wings."

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.430
Consensus among
citizens in Oregon

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.790
is sometimes hard to come
by, as recent studies

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.840
have shown that
Oregonians represent

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.830
some of the most extremely
liberal and conservative voters

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.420
in the entire nation.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.910
Although Oregonians
are generally

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.850
a pretty low key bunch, more
than a few famous people

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.180
have come from the state,
including President Herbert

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.600
Hoover, the actress Sally
Struthers, Kim Novak,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.030
and Ginger Rogers, the track
star Steve Prefontaine,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.870
and the writers can Ken
Kesey and Raymond Carver.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.180
To find out more about the
state, including information

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.512
about its economic base,
please visit Oregon.gov.

00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:01.970
I hope you've enjoyed this
quick introduction to the Beaver

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.470
State.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.970
And I hope you'll have a
chance to visit it one day.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.920
