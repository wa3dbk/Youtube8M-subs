00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.944
"Breast Cancer and Alcohol: 
How Much is Safe?"

00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:09.150
Recently, the IARC,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.480
the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.700
the official 
World Health Organization body

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.700
that decides what is and what is not
cancer-causing,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.460
concluded that alcoholic beverages 
â€” all alcoholic beverages,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.740
are to be considered 
carcinogenic to humans.

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:26.977
Most recent research 
has focused on acetaldehyde,

00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:31.730
the first and most toxic alcohol metabolite,
as a cancer-causing agent.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.460
It seems that bacteria in our mouths
oxidize alcohol into this carcinogen

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.712
called acetaldehyde, 
which we then swallow.

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:42.720
There's convincing evidence

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.720
that alcohol consumption 
increases the risk of breast cancer,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.650
but most of the data derived 
from studies

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.440
that focused on the effect
of moderate or high alcohol intakes,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.500
while little was known 
about light alcohol drinking,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.140
like up to like a drink a day,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.607
hence this new meta-analysis of studies

00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:02.607
that compared light drinkers 
to non-drinkers,

00:01:02.607 --> 00:01:06.046
and found a moderate but significant
association with breast cancer,

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:09.206
based on the results 
of more than 100 studies.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:13.864
They estimated that about 
5,000 breast cancer deaths a year

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:16.024
are attributable to light drinking,

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:19.762
meaning nearly 5,000 women 
that died of breast cancer

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:21.052
maybe wouldn't have

00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:24.109
if they just would've stayed away 
from alcohol completely,

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.160
leading to an editorial 
in the medical journal Breast

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160
that concluded:

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.737
"women who consume alcohol chronically
have an increased risk for breast cancer

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:35.153
that is dose-dependent 
but without threshold,"

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:38.423
meaning there's apparently 
no level of alcohol consumption

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:41.580
that doesn't raise breast 
cancer risk at least a little.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.250
So, "no safe threshold".

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.710
Any level of alcohol consumption 
appears to increase the risk

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
of developing an alcohol-related cancer.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.098
For example, 
the Harvard Nurse's Health Study

00:01:54.098 --> 00:01:57.360
found that even consumption 
of less than a single drink per day

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.490
may be associated with 
a modest increase in risk.

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:04.340
Forget a single drink, 
what about a single sip?

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.750
A new study found that even 
holding a teaspoon of hard liquor

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.250
in your mouth for five seconds, 
and then spitting it out

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.460
results in carcinogenic concentrations
of acetaldehyde

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.580
produced from the alcohol 
in the oral cavity

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.080
instantly after a small sip 
of a strong alcoholic beverage.

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:23.253
And the exposure continues 
for about ten minutes

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:24.820
after spitting it out.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.600
And you didn't even drink it!

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.000
Even alcohol-containing mouthwash
can give you a carcinogenic spike.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.300
The researchers conclude,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.460
"All in all, there is a rather 
low margin of safety

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.900
in the use of alcohol-containing 
mouthwash."

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.864
"Typical use will reach 
the concentration range

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:45.864
above which adverse effects 
are to be expected."

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.590
"Until the establishment 
of a more solid scientific basis

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.220
for a threshold level of acetaldehyde 
in saliva,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.980
prudent public health policy 
would recommend generally refraining

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.760
from using alcohol in such products."

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.210
So why isn't the same recommendation
made for alcoholic beverages?

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.193
Well, as the Harvard paper concludes,

00:03:05.193 --> 00:03:08.933
"Individuals will need to weigh the risks
of light to moderate alcohol use

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:10.510
on breast cancer development

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.800
against the benefits 
for heart disease prevention

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.934
to make the best personal choice 
regarding alcohol consumption."

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:21.140
They're talking 
about the famous J-shaped curve.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.076
While smoking is bad 
and more smoking is worse,

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:27.450
and exercising is good 
and more exercising is better,

00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:31.730
for alcohol there appears to be 
this beneficial effect of small doses.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.073
A six-pack a day increases 
overall mortality,

00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:38.073
but so does tee-totaling.

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:42.900
The #1 killer of women 
isn't breast cancer, it's heart disease,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.040
and a drink a day reduces 
the risk of heart disease.

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:50.959
Why just reduce the risk 
of heart disease, though,

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.280
when you may nearly eliminate 
the risk of heart disease completely

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.940
with a healthy diet?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.480
So a plant-based diet that excludes 
certain plant-based beverages

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.420
may be the best for overall survival.
