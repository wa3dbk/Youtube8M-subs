00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.900
MONTY: Hello.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.780
Monty here again.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.920
And this is "Inside Sesame
Street." Little Jack Horner

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.910
from the nursery rhyme had it
all, a corner, a Christmas

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.740
pie, a plum.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.190
But his life took a turn for
the worse when he gave up

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.480
eating with his thumb.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.560
Katie Couric, standing in for
a vacationing Prairie Dawn,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.940
has the heart-wrenching story.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.880
KATIE COURIC: Thanks, Monty.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.620
I'm here with Jack Horner, who
sat in the corner eating his

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.830
Christmas pie.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.730
He stuck in his thumb and pulled
out a plum, and said,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.580
hey, what a good boy am I.
And I must say, it is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.160
not a pretty sight.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.960
What's happened to you, Jack?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.080
JACK HORNER: Well, I got tired
of eating with my thumb all

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.640
the time, you know.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.890
Thumb, plum.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.000
Thumb, plum.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.880
Thumb, plum.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.130
KATIE COURIC: Yeah,
I get the picture.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.830
JACK HORNER: Yeah.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.690
Right, so I decided to try
something different.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.580
KATIE COURIC: And
what happened?

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.280
JACK HORNER: Well, I got
into some weird stuff.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.830
Instead of my thumb, I
stuck in my hair and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.494
pulled out a pair.

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:07.490
Yeah.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.660
And then I stuck in my cheek
and pulled out a leek.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.310
And then I stuck in my knees
and pulled out some cheese.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.780
And then, and then, I
stuck in my feet and

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.146
pulled out some meat.

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:26.630
And then, and then, and then--

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.210
KATIE COURIC: Do you want
to take a break?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.175
JACK HORNER: No.

00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:30.860
I'm OK.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.905
Where was I?

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:32.830
KATIE COURIC: Feet, meat.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.670
JACK HORNER: Oh yeah.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.170
And then, I stuck in my snout
and pulled out a trout.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.400
KATIE COURIC: And it hasn't
worked out for you, has it?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.100
JACK HORNER: No.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.360
Just made me a food and body
parts rhyming mess.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.180
I mean look at me.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.840
KATIE COURIC: That's not
easy to do, Jack.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.925
What's next for you?

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:51.430
Have you given up?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.120
JACK HORNER: No.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.810
I'm going to make a comeback.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.760
I'm going back to
the simple life.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.770
I'm just going to eat with my
thumb and say, little Jack

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.850
Horner sat in the corner, eating
his Christmas pie.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.199
He stuck in his thumb and
pulled out a plum.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.610
And, whoa, said, whoops,
I hit Katie in the eye.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.325
Sorry about that, Katie.

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:19.450
KATIE COURIC: No problem.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.292
Back to you, Monty.

00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:23.180
Have you ever thought
of using a fork?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.420
MONTY: Thank you, Katie.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.660
That was a plum of a story.
