Kid President: Wh-wh-what? What, what!
People of the Internet! This is the best day!

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.500
Today I'm saying this because I'm going to
talk to somebody! Somebody who is awesome.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.760
I've been really hard on you, you guys.
I keep complaining about stuff that grown-ups

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.000
do, so I thought it would be good to introduce
you to a grown-up who is so cool! Let me pull

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
out my president phone.
Phone, connect to the guy who made my favorite show.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Hello?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Pen Ward: Hey, hello Kid President! Wait,
wait I can't hear you guys. Okay I can hear

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
you now.
Kid President: I got some questions for you.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.400
Pen Ward: Okay, cool man.
Kid President: Cool beard, where did you get it?

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.090
Pen Ward: Aw man, Kid President, I guess I

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.650
grew my beard when I was working on a cartoon
called Flapjack and I wanted to look more

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.229
like a pirate. I guess I got it naturally
from the inside of my face, and it came out

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.799
of it, to answer your question.
Kid President: So what's going on behind you?

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:27.900
Pen Ward: Well it's a couple of people back
here. Storyboard supervisor and Ken Osbourne over here is the head

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.600
writer. Everybody say hello to Kid President.
Kid President: Thank you for making my favorite

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.560
show!
Pen Ward: Thanks man!

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.799
Kid President: What were your favorite things
to draw when you were a little kid?

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.030
Pen Ward: When I was little, I liked to draw
video games. Like Super Mario...

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.000
Kid President: I like Super Mario too!
Pen Ward: Cool man! I'm stoked to have something

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.030
in common with Kid President.
Kid President: Can we be best friends?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.030
Pen Ward: Yes! We already are best friends!
Kid President: This is the most important

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:13.110
question that you've ever heard.
Do you toot?

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.110
Pen Ward: Do I toot? Yes, very much.
Kid President: [laughs]

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.000
Pen Ward: I can't not toot. Even if I wanted
to stop tooting it's impossible.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.450
Kid President: [giggling]
I'm sorry I asked that question. I just really

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.849
wanted to know!
Pen Ward: It's a good question, and I wish

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.849
I got that question more often.
Kid President: Aren't kids awesome?

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.280
Pen Ward: Yes, yeah man!
Kid President: This year is the Kid President

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.220
medal of awesome! I'm gonna hand it to you
through the screen.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:11.000
I present you, this Kid President badge.
I made it myself boy, did you like it?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.159
Pen Ward: I like it a lot! I really like this
scribble on the back!

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.379
Kid President: Pen, you're my hero, thank
you! Thank you for making my best show in

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.599
the world!
Pen Ward: You're welcome, Kid President.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.239
Kid President: Hey girl.
Pen Ward: Hey girl!

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:35.000
Kid President: [laughs] Aw yeah, this is the
night! Bye girl!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.500
Pen Ward: Bye girl!
Kid President: See ya, boys! It was nice talking

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.000
to you!
[crashing sound]

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.200
That was awesome. Do you know someone that
deserves a medal of awesome? I want to give

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.280
medals of awesomes to kids all over the world.
Does anybody know what time it is? It's dance time!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:14.819
[dance music]
