00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.450
Marriage equality is on the rise

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.570
but despite this trend religious beliefs
remain a major obstacle to acceptance

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.120
Many conservative Christians believe
the Bible condemns

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.789
all same-sex relationships

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.439
That question drove my own intensive
study this issue I came to terms with

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.029
being gay

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.239
as my parents and my church in Kansas
believed

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.170
that gay marriage was wrong. What I learned when I studied the relevant

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.190
scripture passages

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.370
changed my parents' minds

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.950
along with the views and many other
Christians in my life.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.850
There six passages in the Bible the
refer to same-sex behavior,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.710
three in the Old Testament and three in
the New Testament

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.210
The most famous passage is the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.850
God sends three angels disguised as
men into the cit of Sodom, where the men

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.380
of Sodom threaten to rape them

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.560
The angels blind the men, and God
destroys the city.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.350
For centuries, this story was interpreted
as God's judgment on same-sex relations

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.270
But the only form of same-sex behavior described is a threatened gang rape.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.649
Ezekiel 16:49 sums up the story's focus on violence

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.420
and hostility toward strangers. "And this was your sister Sodom's sin:

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.810
she and her daughters were arrogant

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.680
overfed, and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.770
needy.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.060
In Leviticus 18:22, male same-sex
intercourse

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.630
is prohibited and violators are to receive
the death penalty

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.640
Do not lie with a male as one does with a woman.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.720
It is an abomination. Other things called
abominations in the Old Testament

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.540
include having sex during a woman's
menstrual period, eating pork, rabbit, or

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.729
shellfish,

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.930
and charging interest on loans. But they're part of the Old Testament law code,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.260
which was fulfilled by Jesus.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.780
Hebrews 8:13 says that the old law is
obsolete

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.660
and aging

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.740
Romans 10:4 says that Christ is the
end of the law

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.700
so the Old Testament doesn't settle the
issue for Christians. But let's look to

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.250
the New Testament, which contains the
longest reference to same-sex behavior

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.140
in the Bible

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.200
In Romans 1:26-27,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.770
people who turned away from God to
worship idols are then turned over to

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.240
their own

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.920
lusts and vices. "Even their women
exchanged natural sexual relations

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.120
for unnatural ones. In the same way men
committed shameful acts other men

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.939
and received in themselves the due
penalty for their error.

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.950
Paul's words here are clearly negative, but
the behavior he condemns is lustful.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.249
He makes no mention of love, commitment, or faithfulness.

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.389
His description of same-sex behavior is
based solely on a burst

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.170
of excess

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.890
and lust.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.260
In the ancient world, same-sex behavior
mainly occurred between men and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.069
adolescent boys,

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.810
between masters and their slaves, or with prostitutes.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.700
Most of the men engaged in those
practices were married to women, so

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.670
same-sex behavior was widely seen as 
stemming from out of control lust -- 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.640
a vice of excess like, gluttony or
drunkenness.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.640
And while Paul labels same-sex
behavior unnatural,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.230
he says in 1 Corinthians 11:14 that for men
to wear their hair long

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.870
also goes against nature, and most
Christians interpret that as a reference

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.810
to cultural conventions.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.480
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.319
In the last two likely references to
same-sex behavior in the Bible

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.470
two Greek words -- malakoi

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.970
and arsenokoitai -- are included in lists of people who will not inherit

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.730
God's kingdom.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.530
Many modern translators have rendered these
terms as sweeping statements about gay

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.970
people

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.980
But the concept of sexual
orientation

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.390
didn't even exist in the ancient world. Yes,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.760
Paul did not take a positive view of same-sex
relations

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.850
But the context he was writing in is worlds
apart

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.870
from gay people in committed, monogamous
relationships

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.160
The Bible never addresses the
issues of sexual orientation

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.320
or same-sex marriage

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.130
so there's no reason why faithful
Christians can't support

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.670
their gay brothers and sisters. It's time.
