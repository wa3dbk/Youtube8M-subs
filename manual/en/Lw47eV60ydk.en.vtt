00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.640
Prepare thin Armenian flatbread (lavash) at home is very simple. 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.029
It is no more difficult than fry pancakes or muffins. 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.999
The result will undoubtedly please. 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:16.630
For the recipe we need: 500 g flour, 1 tbsp vegetable oil (you can do without oil) 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.599
1-2 tsp dry yeast, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp salt and 1 cup of warm boiled water. 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.399
Take a large bowl. 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.700
Pour half a glass of warm water into a bowl. 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:42.230
Add the yeast, sugar and leave for 15 minutes. 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.500
Add vegetable oil. 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.300
Salt to taste. About 1 tsp. 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.390
Add flour portions and knead the dough. 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.000
Will need to add the rest of the water. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.500
When the dough becomes difficult to mix with the help of the whisk, 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.760
then begin to knead the dough by hand. 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.600
Add the flour and knead the soft, elastic dough. 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.200
I use almost all flour. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.420
May stay a little flour to sprinkle the table. 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.700
It turns out such a soft, elastic dough. I put it in the bowl. 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.950
Cover with a lid and leave in a warm place, to rise it up. 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.810
1 hour passed. 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.789
We shift the dough on the table. 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:20.600
Knead a bit the dough and form small balls. 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:27.600
We put them on the table and leave for 10 minutes. 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:31.800
10 minutes passed. Balls have increased slightly in volume. 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:36.900
Bake flatebread will be in the biggest pan, which I have. 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.700
I have a griller diameter is 28 cm. 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.900
Can be baked on a baking sheet in the oven or on the surface of a gas stove. 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.800
I will roll out the dough.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:03.800
Take one ball and roll out very thinly on a floured surface. 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:27.200
Need it a little stretch. Roll out on. 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:52.800
The dough is almost as large as I need. You can stretch a little bit. 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.929
The dough is almost not broken. It stretches well. 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:02.769
I have already pre-heated the pan. Put on medium heat. 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.700
While it is warming up a bit, I'm stretching the dough.

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:19.100
Put on the dry surface of our future thin flatbread. 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.900
Cooking from 15 to 30 seconds - depending on how heated pan. 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:31.249
Waiting for the flatbread turns out white and turning it to the other side. 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:33.680
The flatbread should not be brown. 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.800
The flatbread becomes white. It is slightly browning on bottom.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.700
Turn out and cook again for about 15 seconds. 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.099
The flatbread is ready. 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:47.990
We shift it on the plate. It is slightly dryish. 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.100
They should be slightly moistened with water, that they were softer. 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.849
They can be placed between the two wet towels. 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:10.000
While the first flatbread is baking, I`m unrolling the second. 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.600
Lavash can be served instead of bread to any dish. 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.300
You can make delicious rolls of the flatbread and sandwiches. 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.500
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.000
