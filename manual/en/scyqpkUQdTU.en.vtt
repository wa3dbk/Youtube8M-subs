00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.480
Cold emulsified sauce

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.840
Mayonnaise

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100
In fact, Mayo is a very versatile sauce

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.360
It is a very sauce base sauce

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.860
Like everyone is familiar with

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.720
Tata sauce

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.500
It is using Mei Nai taste

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.520
The base sauce

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.880
Before Vivian shared it for everyone

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.820
How to make

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.320
More desktop flavors

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.140
Sweet

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.760
Beautiful and beautiful salad dressing

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.000
Everyone can use

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.240
Beautiful and beautiful salad dressing way

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.760
To emulsify sauce

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.200
Today Vivian demonstrated this way

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.400
It is a hand-held food processor.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.860
Hand-held food conditioner

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.240
When making sauces

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.400
It will be very, very fast

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.460
About 10-20 seconds

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.420
Soy sauce can be quickly emulsified

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.900
Then let's take a look

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.060
In the end how to quickly complete

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.300
What about emulsified salad dressing?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.400
Then we come to prepare

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.260
Prepared to have

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.640
Two egg yolks

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.060
1/4 lemon

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.300
White vinegar

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.240
Rice vinegar or apple vinegar

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.100
1/2 tbsp

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.560
Liquid grease

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.280
300ml

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.580
WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.600
It is the so-called Merlin spicy sauce

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.360
Proper amount

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.860
A few drops will do

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.980
TABASCO SAUCE

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.780
A few drops

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.320
a tablespoon of mustard

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.520
Dioscore mustard is usually used in French.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.060
1/2 tsp salt

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.920
Above is all the materials

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.380
Have you shared it before

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460
Table-top beautiful beauty salad dressing emulsification process

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.480
The previous film was a more traditional technique

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.520
It's slowly mixing in oil

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960
Today I want to use a faster method

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.960
That's a quick way today

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.200
Everyone can try some brand of fruit juicer

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.920
Because of the knife head

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.280
What is used today is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.340
Vertical stir bar

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.900
Stirring with such a cup

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.080
Or you can buy

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.540
Daily necessities

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.120
Some are longer

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.060
A little higher stirring cup can also be

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.280
Vertical mixer

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.380
I use this label today

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.500
Yes

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.380
OK, don't advertise for him

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.160
Everyone can see

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.340
I use him

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.920
As long as it is any commercially available vertical mixer

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.280
I think it should be possible

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.440
There are such functions

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.340
With vertical mixer

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.140
Will reduce a lot of time

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.140
very fast

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.420
When everyone will see me for demonstration, I will know

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.060
Very fast

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
First of all

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.680
Put all things first

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.280
Put in the seasoning cup

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900
Put the two egg yolks in first

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.300
Everything is put in

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.920
Salt is also coming in

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.660
vinegar

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.720
Put in

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.720
wasabi

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.040
If you are afraid of mustard friends

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.600
Can put less

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.300
But today's recipe

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.500
Yes

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.880
Traditional Western formula

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.320
Some friends

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.320
May not like this kind of sweeter

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.460
Western style

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.900
Or Japanese salad dressing

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.300
It is not sweet

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.320
May be more suitable for everyone

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.560
My beautiful and beautiful salad dressing formula

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.894
At last

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.680
Put 1/4 lemon into it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.800
Take a little notice

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.760
Part of the seed

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820
You can also filter it next

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.700
To plunge again

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.980
TABASCO SAUCE

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.800
Let's add some more

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.140
You sprinkle it two or three times

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.180
Merlin spicy sauce

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.600
WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.200
I accidentally added more

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.140
It doesn't matter, maybe add two or three drops.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.980
The last thing added is

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.180
Our oil

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.440
Part of grease

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.600
Fall over

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.540
A total of 300ml of oil

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.060
Put it all together, it doesn't matter

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.300
To emulsify

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.840
Its movement is very fast

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.120
It is divided into two layers

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.920
The bottom is the portion of the egg yolk

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.200
Above is the grease

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.460
We are at one go

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.720
Put the stir bar directly into the bottom

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.520
To start

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.820
Please look

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.480
Already done

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.260
Very fast

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.340
Please remember to remember

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.180
Pull up the power cord

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.560
Scrape it again

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.000
Otherwise tragedies will occur

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.480
I never turned off the machine

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.180
So put my own finger

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.420
When you scrape

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.540
I used my hand to put a salad on the head

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.720
When you scrape it

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.460
I put my hand on it

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.060
At this time, it is recommended that you quickly pull out the power

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.880
Then we scrape it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.080
This is what we are demonstrating for everyone today.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.980
Cold emulsified sauce

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.840
Mayonnaise

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.040
