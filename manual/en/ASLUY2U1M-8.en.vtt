00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:16.560
How come some insects are able to walk

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.135
on the surface of a pond,

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:19.815
but you quickly sink to the bottom

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:21.417
when you try to walk on water?

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:24.811
And why do lakes freeze from the top down in winter?

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:28.823
In a word, the answer to all these questions is polarity.

00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:30.490
Water is a simple molecule

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.946
made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms,

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:35.862
but it is essential to life.

00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:39.324
In fact, water makes up approximately 60%

00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:41.954
of the adult human being's body weight.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:44.372
The polarity within those water molecules

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:46.624
gives this common substance the properties

00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:49.413
that make it unique and life-sustaining.

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:51.545
Polarity refers to the unequal sharing

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:53.604
of electrons within a molecule.

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.551
For water, the bonding between the oxygen atom

00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.635
and two hydrogen atoms within a single water molecule

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:03.020
is like a tug-of-war between a big, strong football player

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.189
and a cute little toddler.

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.063
Oxygen is a larger atom,

00:01:07.063 --> 00:01:09.772
with more protons in its nucleus than hydrogen.

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:13.170
These positive charges are like a person's physical strength.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.485
They're able to attract

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:16.855
the negatively charged electrons in the bond,

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:19.450
just like a strong individual is able to overpower

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.021
a weaker individual in a tug of war.

00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:24.204
So, oxygen is able to attract

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:27.123
more than its fair share of electrons.

00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:30.273
Because hydrogen is smaller and has less strength,

00:01:30.273 --> 00:01:31.550
or fewer protons,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.547
it loses the tug of war

00:01:33.547 --> 00:01:36.733
and attracts fewer than its fair share of electrons.

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:39.720
So, the oxygen in water behaves as though it's negative,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.139
and the hydrogens behave as though they're positive.

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.846
The bonds within a single water molecule

00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:48.163
are called polar covalent bonds.

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:50.859
Covalent means that the electrons are shared.

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.945
But, as we just learned,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.277
polar means that these electrons are not shared equally.

00:01:56.277 --> 00:01:58.938
In water, the oxygen acts negative

00:01:58.938 --> 00:02:01.655
and the hydrogens act positive.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.701
Since negative and positive attract,

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:06.495
that oxygen is attracted to the hydrogen atoms

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:08.149
in neighboring water molecules.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.932
A special type of bond forms between water molecules,

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.962
known as a hydrogen bond.

00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:16.770
Hydrogen bonds don't just happen in water either.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.961
They can form between a water molecule

00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.470
and different substances that are polar or ionic.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.602
Water's ability to stick to itself is called cohesion,

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:28.323
while water's ability to stick to other substances

00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:30.560
is called adhesion.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.987
Now, think back to the initial questions.

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:36.903
First, why are some insects able to walk on water?

00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:39.571
Surface tension due to hydrogen bonding

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.698
creates a thin film on the surface of water

00:02:41.698 --> 00:02:43.159
that gives enough resistance

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.586
for super-light insects to walk on.

00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:46.769
You can't walk on it

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.805
because the hydrogen bonds aren't strong enough

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:50.545
to hold you up.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.918
Why does ice float on top of liquid water?

00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:54.685
For most other substances,

00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:57.888
the solid state is more dense than the liquid state,

00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:00.390
but that is not the case for water!

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.599
Hydrogen bonds keep water molecules

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.554
farther apart in frozen water than in liquid water.

00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:07.518
The farther apart the molecules are,

00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:09.773
the less dense that solid is.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.227
So ice is about 9% less dense than water,

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.441
which means it floats on the top.

00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:17.943
That's why lakes freeze from the top down

00:03:17.943 --> 00:03:19.861
and aquatic life is able to survive

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:21.947
through a cold winter every year.

00:03:21.947 --> 00:03:24.656
It is the polarity of the water molecule

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:26.907
and the resulting hydrogen bonding

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.996
that account for water's unique properties.

00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:33.127
So, the reason that water is so special,

00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:34.440
from inside your cells

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.877
to the world's oceans,

00:03:35.877 --> 00:03:40.826
is simply because it is a polar molecule.
