00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.900
ALICE MONAGHAN: He looks nice.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.830
INNKEEPER: Oh, but
he was troubled.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.230
You see, he had two great aunts,
Mary and Elizabeth

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.680
Washbrook, who, in 1878, took
money from some foreign power

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.792
to try to kill Queen Victoria
with witchcraft.

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:40.402
WITCHES: By the names and signs
of evil angels, Puziel,

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:43.710
Guziel, Psdiel, Priziel.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.750
INNKEEPER: And all of his
relatives since, one way or

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.640
another, had been bad.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.910
So he went off to
France to prove

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.150
that he could be otherwise.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.040
Even if it only meant to die
young for his country.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.220
But he didn't die.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.700
He should have, but--

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.120
as he used to tell it-- a women
appeared to him there in

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.241
the trenches, even as the blood
was draining out of him

00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:08.928
from a dozen ragged holes.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.602
He drank from that cup.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.546
And, though it should have been
impossible, he got well.

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:25.490
And he came home.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.390
And then, for a year or more,
he simply wandered from

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.290
Plymouth to the Western
Highlands,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.810
Blackpool to Southwold.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.080
One end of Britain to the
other, and back again.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.055
And he used to say it was as
though he was seeing all for

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:47.400
the first time.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.500
And a great weight was
lifted off him.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.270
One day, he found this old place
and bought it and was

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.455
content a long time to draw
pints and tell his tales.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:05.380
GEORGE WASHBROOK: A lady in
white with a gold cup.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.400
MAN IN TAVERN: Eh, pull
the other one.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.825
INNKEEPER: He grew old.

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:13.030
He outlived a wife, children,
all his friends.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.950
And as his years piled
on him, he got a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.380
sense that he was waiting.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.404
ALICE MONAGHAN: Waiting
for what?

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:23.970
INNKEEPER: For something he
felt was coming to him.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.800
ALICE MONAGHAN: What
about Hellboy?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.070
He told me to get rid of it.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.360
Throw it in a pond.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.350
INNKEEPER: It was put in your
keeping for a reason.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.475
It's for you to decide what's
to be done with it.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.556
HELLBOY: I think this
suits me better.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.585
ALICE MONAGHAN: Oh my god.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.290
HELLBOY: Nimue.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.690
NIMUE: Not anymore.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.802
HELLBOY: Guess I don't really
care who you are.

00:04:15.802 --> 00:04:16.228
NIMUE: Ah!

00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:18.350
But you do know me.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.019
Rasputin tried to set me free
the day you were born.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.110
He failed.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.566
But I forgave him.

00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:27.935
I held him close and guided his
hand, and when he tried

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.636
again, he cracked the
wall of my prison.

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.820
Through that gap I've stretched
my long arm back

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.420
into the world.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.100
I cast my shadow over all.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.820
No light, no hope.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.140
And finally, Nimue's madness and
lust for power drew me out

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.880
like a serpent to nest
in her black heart.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.275
And now, all that was mine
in the beginning

00:04:57.275 --> 00:04:58.830
will be mine again.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.850
HELLBOY: Son of a bitch!

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.290
NIMUE: Hellboy, whatever you
are, whatever you were meant

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.845
to be, you've come too late.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.550
Listen.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.330
Listen!

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.330
The dragon commands!
