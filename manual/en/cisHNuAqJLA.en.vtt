HI my name is Lauren with Makeup by Dodge
and today we will be talking about how we

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.990
can play up your eyes the easy and fast way.
Now Gina already has her full face of makeup

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.280
on say she went to work and it is daytime
she kind of had this to go out or get the

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.091
groceries or whatever. Now she wants to go
to dinner so let's play them up a little bit

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:25.900
you know, let's put a little extra color and
a little more drama to them. So as we had

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.020
discussed before you have three colors in
your eyes in your eye shadow. You have your

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.239
highlight which we put on the brow bone. We
have our mid tone. If you close your eyes

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.159
Gina which is just pretty much swept all over.
It really brings contour to the eyes and then

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:45.929
we have the darkest color called the contour
color. The contour color is what you want

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.949
to change whenever you are playing up your
eyes. You can lighten it up. You can darken

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.859
it a little bit. You can change the color,
just change the contour and you'll completely

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:06.689
change the color or your eye style. So for
Gina we picked a nice lilac plum and we put

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:17.899
it in the very corner of her eye, the outer
corner and we sweep it up into her crease.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:25.710
Gina has very deep set eyes which is awesome
for applying eye makeup but this same tactic

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:40.469
can be used with any eye shape.
Put it into the eyeliner that you have just

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:48.969
a little bit. Look up. As you can see it is
a little bit more dramatic. If you wanted

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.859
it even more dramatic you can sweep the same
color, maybe a little bit lighter just underneath

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:01.499
your eye in the very corner, look up, just
up here and you'll have a completely different

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.839
look.
