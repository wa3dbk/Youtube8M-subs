Lets make a video

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.656
Ahhhhh!

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.200
*sigh* okay

00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:16.312
(intro music)

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:19.511
Hey guys!

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:20.788
So if any of you don't know

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:22.884
I'm half Japanese half Caucasian

00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:25.492
And since the town I'm living in is only 1% Asian

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:28.240
I have to put up with stereotypes on a daily basis

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.040
Everyday I hear stupid things like

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.199
Are you Asian or Japanese?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.994
Hey Motoki, wake up!

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.762
Oh wait, no your eyes are just like that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.700
Ching Chong Ling Tong Ling

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:40.365
Hahahaha

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:43.065
Are you related to Jackie Chan?

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.473
*gasp* Godzilla!

00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:51.511
So today I figured I'd clear some things up about Asian stereotypes

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:54.206
First up, all Asians have squinty eyes

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.470
No we dont

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.850
I hear all the time that Asian guys have small... uhm...

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:06.317
Egg roll

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.635
What's the next one

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:13.672
There's the stereotype that all Asians are really smart

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:14.872
Especially in math

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.300
It's not even true, like personally one time

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.449
I got an A-

00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:24.450
Mom: Motoki! You have A-? You dishonor on family! You dishonor!

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.089
I get asked all the time if I eat dogs

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:30.692
Really? Really?

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.024
No that's disgusting

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.021
Cats are way better!

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.997
All Asians eat rice everday

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.998
Yeah we do

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.235
All Asians know Kung fu

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:42.540
I don't know Kung fu, I don't know karate, I don't know martial arts

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.500
I'm good at fruit ninja...

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:48.240
All Asians are bad drivers

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.520
pshh, I'm a great driver

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:06.290
Okay fine, I'm not the greatest driver

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:08.699
A lot of people say all Asians look the same

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:09.490
No we don't

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.930
Hear one sec, I'm going to bring my brother

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.730
Hey KJ!

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:15.070
KJ: What?

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:16.040
Come in hear

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.240
See? We look nothing alike

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:23.950
The Asian race is said to be yellow

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.850
Yellow..

00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:29.720
I don't.. Homer Simpson is yellow. I am not yellow.

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:34.160
I'm not, I don't, I'm not, emerhaehh

00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:36.660
