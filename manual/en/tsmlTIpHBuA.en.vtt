00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.920
One of the things I love about teaching tennis
and studying the game of tennis

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.920
is that there are different ways to swing the racket,
and there’s different ways to play tennis.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.200
You can swing more to low-to-high,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.160
even on the forehand side, you can swing
low-to-high, and finish like this.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.000
You can also work on your hand turn, your racket head acceleration,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.480
and swing more across your body like this.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.240
And the same holds true on the two-handed backhand.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.760
A guy like Novak Djokovic, when I’ve studied him,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.340
I feel like his backhand,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.580
he goes more low to high like this.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.260
And then, there are other guys that have
absolute world-class backhands.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.020
Of course, Novak has that as well

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.720
and they have a different swing path.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.960
They swing more across their body.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.260
So, Andy Murray is a guy that really stands out
for me, where, when he swings,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.920
he really uses a lot of his non-dominant arm

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.780
to swing across his body like this,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.020
and the finish, where his hands end up,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.980
it’s usually around by his shoulder right here.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.360
Whereas with Djokovic, it’s more

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.380
low to high, and you’re swinging up over your shoulder more.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.900
So, what I want to show you now is that
Andy Murray style of backhand.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.540
So, I just hit two screamers right there.
I know you can’t see where the ball

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.320
landed, but you can trust me on this, the ball went
very low over the net, and it was a low drive.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.240
And you can drive it, of course, with a high finish,
but in this case, a guy like Andy Murray,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.200
and you can copy Murray’s backhand,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.400
he’s going to take his back-swing,
and he’s going to swing straight across like this.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.900
And then, his hands, if you noticed, the hands are going to finish more by the shoulder right here

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.280
and that just really allows you to create

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.700
a lot of force going across your body.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.060
Now, I would say that this is more of
an advanced stroke.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.500
If you’re just starting the game

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.960
you probably want to go more low to high with it

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.720
but I really feel like if you want to generate a
world-class backhand and hit great backhands

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.760
you can practice this type of swing
where you go across your body.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.860
You’ll also notice

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.460
again, at the very end, look at my relaxed hand here.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.380
This just allows me

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.460
to use my non-dominant arm to swing across.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.000
I’m not a big fan of just swinging with

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.020
one hand to learn how to use the non-dominant arm.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.380
I really think you should have two hands on the racket

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.140
but to make sure you’re using the non-dominant arm, you’re just going to be relaxing your hand.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.680
So, let me give you a couple more shots at this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.040
before we finish up this backhand lesson,
the Murray backhand.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.800
So, I’m just trying to skin this ball

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.080
over the net

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.020
with that low finish.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.600
I’m thinking about going

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.060
across my body. Again, much different
than the low to high swing,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.360
but I want you to go out there and practice it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.900
try it out, and of course, let me know
what you think of the Murray-style backhand.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.040
