Hi guys, this is Kan from Freebird Games

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.200
Hello, we are Ville and Anne from Instant Kingdom
the makers of a cool RPG called Driftmoon

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.000
Hey! My name's Lars Doucet, the lead developer of
Level-up Labs, the developers of
Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.100
I've had a chance to talk with many portals over
the past couple of years to bring To The Moon out
to the public

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.600
and I've had both good and bad experiences,
but working with GOG.com, has definitely been
one of the great ones.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:39.000
GOG.com understends the audience. I think they
want to provide their audience with games that give
them, maybe, a little more in-depth experience.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.300
They're completely DRM-Free I really loved that
they're taking a stance on that. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I love that there's no muss no fuss no gimmicks,
you just get your games, for a good price,
with a good service.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.900
They've always been very prompt, they're easy to
reach out to, and the community over
there is actually fantastic!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If you develop a game that you think can connect 
with the sort of gamer that is willing to commit
a little more time in order to read through words,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.900
then I thing GOG.com is a perfect fit for you. 
I think It'll help you reach an audience that's
really gonna appreciate what you're doing.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.900
Also, of course, the sales are up there as well.
So yeah, personally I have nothing but good things
to say about them. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.900
They do a great job writing promotions and
just getting stuff out there.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.100
One thing that I think is very heartning is when
someone like GOG.com comes along and says:

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.500
We're gonna go back to all those classic games,
we're gonna find the best ones, 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.400
and we're gonna do our best to preserve them. 
We're gonna make them work on modern computers,
and not just like work at all, but work well.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.200
Besides, it's just, you know, fantastic to be
on the same virtual shelf as, you know, 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.000
games like Heroes of Might and Magic 3. 
laughs] That's fantastic.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.400
You get old very quickly. And the kinds of games
I'm making right now, are gonna get old before
I even know it. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.600
And I feel confident that people like GOG.com
are gonna be around to help us
preserve these things. 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.200
We're both very happy to have Driftmoon on GOG.com,
because GOG.com is simply awesome.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.200
Yeah, go them!
