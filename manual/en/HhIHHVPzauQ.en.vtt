00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.900
Thank you for your continued interest in
Missouri’s managed waterfowl hunt program.  

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Missouri’s wetlands provide critical habitat
for waterfowl and wetland dependent species.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.400
These wetlands also make Missouri
a great place to hunt. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.400
In 2010, Quick Draw was launched to offer
waterfowl hunters an alternative draw method 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.900
based on research that shows a major obstacle
for participation 
 in hunting is a lack of time. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900
Public feedback and data analysis has led to
a change for the 2013 waterfowl season.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.400
Over the next couple of minutes we will 
 discuss
the change for the 2013 season, 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.400
the anticipated affects,
the rational for the adjustment,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.400
and Quick Draw beyond 2014.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.400
For the 2013 waterfowl season,
we will lower the Quick Draw/Poor Line ratio.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.900
As you know thus far 80% of the hunting 
 spots
have been offered to Quick Draw applicants.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.400
And the remaining 20%
has been offered to Poor Line.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.900
For the 2013 season we will offer 75%
of 
 the hunting spots to Quick Draw applicants.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.400
and the remaining 25% to the Poor Line.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.400
We also considered limiting the number
of times a hunter can be drawn per season

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.900
through the Quick Draw system; however
we decided to 
 not set a limit at this time.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.900
Based on 2012 statistics we believe we can anticipate
the affect 
 this change will have on hunting spot allocation.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.900
As you know we currently offer 80% off 
 the hunting spots to Quick Draw hunters,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.400
However, 57% of the hunters who actually
go afield are Poor Line hunters,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.400
whereas 43% of the hunters who go afield
are Quick Draw hunters.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.900
This is due to the fact that not all 
 Quick Draw
hunters actually show up to hunt.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.400
This is really nothing new; we experience
several “no 
 shows” for other managed hunts as well.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.400
When we switch to the 75% allocation to Quick Draw,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.400
we anticipate that Poor Line hunters will likely
comprise 
 62% of the hunters that go afield,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.900
whereas 38% of the hunters that go afield will be Quick Draw hunters.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.400
Another change worth noting, when we shift
from an 80/20 ratio to a 75/25 ratio,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.900
will be the fact that we’re going to have to also 
 shift
from a 5 tiered system to a 4 tiered system.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.400
Under the 5 tiered system, the 80/20 ratio,
1 spot out 
 of every 5 goes to the Poor Line.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.400
However, when we shift to the 75/25 ratio,
1 spot out of 
 every 4 will be designated to the Poor Line.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.400
The rationale for this change
really boils down to public feedback.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.900
Since the launch of Quick Draw, the Department has 
 proactively sought public feedback in many ways.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.900
During the pilot over 1,100 comments were received,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.900
the most common recommendation was
to lower the Quick Draw/Poor Line ratio.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.400
Additionally, in 2012 a survey was launched.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.400
This survey specifically asked hunters

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.400
if they would like to lower the Quick Draw/
Poor 
 Line ratio to favor the Poor Line.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.900
54% of the survey participants recommended
 lowering the Quick 
 Draw ratio to favor the Poor Line.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.400
Lowering the Quick Draw allocation by 5%
may not meet the expectations of all hunters.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.400
However, we believe a modest adjustment is appropriate.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.400
First a modest adjustment will enable us to measure the 
 effect a 5% adjustment has on actual allocation.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.900
Additionally, our next feasible option was a 2/3 : 1/3 ratio

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.400
and we were simply hesitant to lower
the Quick 
 Draw allocation by 14% in one season.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.400
Additionally, although the majority of
survey participants wanted to lower the ratio,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.400
it was not a significant majority.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.900
46% of the respondents did not want to lower 
 the ratio,
so a modest adjustment seems appropriate.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.400
Lastly, the popularity of Quick Draw
has increased every year since its launch in 2010.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.900
This graph shows an increase in both the number of 
 applications and the number of total unique applicants.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.400
Each hunter, or unique applicant, can apply
multiple times with the Quick Draw system.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.900
This graph shows the number of times
individual hunters applied.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.400
You’ll note that over 284 hunters applied
 nearly every single time they possibly could,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.400
but the average hunter applied 23 times
throughout the waterfowl season.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.400
This graph shows the draw
success rate for one application.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.900
The increased popularity of Quick Draw
has led to a decline in the success rate.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.900
This decline also played a role in
the decision to make a modest adjustment;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.400
we were hesitant to lower the Quick Draw allocation by 14%

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.900
knowing that such a change would likely
drastically lower the success rate.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.900
The decision to not limit the number
of times 
 a hunter can be drawn per season

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.400
was based primarily on the following details.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.400
First and foremost, the Department conducted
four focus groups earlier this year.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.900
These focus groups were comprised of
a diverse group of waterfowl hunters all across Missouri.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.400
Although consensus was not reached,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.900
generally the focus groups did not view
setting a limit as advantageous.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.900
Additionally, based on 2012 statistics
setting a limit of 2 draws per season

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.400
would only result in an additional 165 spots available

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.400
throughout the entire season
on all three Quick Draw areas.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.400
And this did not seem significant
from a statewide perspective.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.400
Additionally, making this change would have
certainly complicated the drawing system significantly.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.900
Now that we discussed the change for the 2013 season,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.900
I’d like to discuss the future of Quick Draw beyond 2014.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.400
For the 2013 and 2014 waterfowl season
no additional changes are anticipated.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.400
However, in 2015 the Department plans
to conduct a comprehensive review

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.400
of the entire managed waterfowl hunt program.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.400
The managed waterfowl hunt program
consists of not just the Quick Draw system,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.900
but also the traditional reservation system,
the Poor Line,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.400
the every member draw system,
and one member draws.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.400
This review will be conducted in conjunction with
a comprehensive waterfowl hunter opinion survey.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.400
This survey provides significant insight into
the views and opinions of hunters all across Missouri.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.400
As we begin to plan for the future
beyond the 2013 waterfowl season,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.900
the Department would like to thank you
for your continued interest

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.900
in Missouri’s managed waterfowl hunt program.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.400
We would also like to encourage you
to continue to actively provide

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.900
your insight and views on this program
and any program the Department offers.
