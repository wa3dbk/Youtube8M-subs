Hi, My name is Manyaa
Today I will be making

00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:16.757
Beautiful headbands for my dolls
For this activity, you will need some bottle

00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:21.947
cap rings
Some scissors, glue and some decorative items

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:23.277
To decorate your headbands
And off course your dolls

00:00:25.657 --> 00:00:32.657
So now, let's gets started
First I will measure the head of my doll

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:59.167
Now I will stick a decoration
You can use any decorations you want

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.877
Like stars,
Flowers

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:06.316
and hearts
So this is one of the headbands

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.876
Which I have just made
For my doll

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:16.137
Isn't this beautiful?

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:18.846
Let's start with the other doll

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:25.097
First you take the size of the doll's head
Cut the extra part

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:36.947
And stick any sort of decoration
That you want

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:41.746
My two beautiful dolls are ready
You can also put a big flower on a Barbie's

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:45.866
headband
Just like I have put on this one

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:47.676
