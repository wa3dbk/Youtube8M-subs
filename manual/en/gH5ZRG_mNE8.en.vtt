00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:08.940
Hi I'm Blender Babe Tarashaun, and I'm so excited because we just got the newest Blendtec in the mail today.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.020
So we're going to show you an unboxing.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.540
This is the Blendtec Designer 725.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.480
As you can see it's got a new box, from their old boxes.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.140
They've got some really great information on here.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.780
Including me, look I'm on the box!

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.700
Also, it's a very fitness-y type of box.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.820
We believe these blenders are health machines

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.980
they can truly change your life.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.740
And I think the box really displays that because if you're trying to exercise,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.300
you're trying to eat healthy, the Blendtec is the best tool for that.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.360
So we're going to open this up.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.360
I really like the color here too, their boxes used to be blue.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.440
But I really love this bright red, I think it's really pretty.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.440
So it kinda looks like a present, I feel like I'm getting a christmas present.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.960
Oh, congratulations!

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.560
I'm excited, are you?

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.500
So, it looks like there is no longer the styrofoam that used to come with these

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.860
kinds of appliances that really held them in place

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.460
and used to think was necessary but it looks like Blendtec is trying to be environmentally conscious

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.140
and not using styrofoam.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.580
You've got your Blending 101 recipe book and instructions.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.960
We now have an eight year warranty

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.200
so they increased the warranty from seven years to eight years which is really amazing and exciting

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.600
So it comes with a, looks like the new Blendtec Wildside+ Jar,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.460
and let's see what else.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.060
We've got the base.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.540
Which feels heavier than the previous models.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.440
That's exciting!

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.640
So let's test this thing out.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.200
And show you how it works!

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.780
I love this box, definitely love this box. Go Blendtec!

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.420
Now that we've opened the box we're going to go over all the things

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.780
you get inside of it.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.760
This is the new Blendtec Designer 725 base.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.860
Now this is housing the motor which is 3.6 HP.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.700
So it is much more powerful than the previous Blendtec Designer 1560 watts and 3 peak HP.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.700
It has your same, iPhone style slide touch screen.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.900
So we're going to power it on.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.900
And it looks like it talks to us so let's get started!

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.340
It looks like it has the same automatic settings

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.400
so you have six automatic settings.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.800
You've got your pulse button.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.480
What's really different about this one versus the previous Blendtec Designer is the touch slider is 100 different points.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.540
So it's very sensitive

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.100
meaning, I can slightly adjust my finger and you can hear it changing, the speed is changing

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.940
just from the very minuscule movements.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.920
So there is 100 different speeds all along here

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.060
Then you just power it off with the X button.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.840
So it's saying "Goodbye, live well, blend often."

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.700
That's awesome!I 'm really excited to play with this.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.780
So it has five different automatic settings that are not exactly the same as the previous one.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:54.200
We have smoothies, salsa, ice cream, juicing, and soup.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.680
And what's great about this one versus the other ones is that you also have a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.060
self cleaning button, so you'll add a little bit of soap and water to your jar

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.300
and use the self cleaning button.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.060
And then just power it off!

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.780
It will actually turn off, all by itself.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.320
So one thing that's different form this model versus the other models is definitely the salsa button

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.420
that replaces the ice crush.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.340
Most people use smoothie and juice, a majority of the time.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.480
But obviously people really like to make salsas so that's why Blendtec listens to their consumers

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.320
and gives you what you want.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.000
Another really reat feature about the Blendtec Designer 725 is that you can add time.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.720
So for example, we're going to use this soup button which is 90 seconds

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.200
but you can add time

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.340
10 seconds at a time by just pressing the button again.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.500
Which is really great!

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.640
If you have a juice or a soup and you know that it's got lots of leafy greens

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.660
or fiberous vegetables, you want to give it 10 - 20 seconds longer

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.720
you don't have hit the button again or do it manually afterwards, you can

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.560
do it all in one blend by just adding a little bit more time.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.700
That is amazing!

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.640
That is one of the greatest features about the Blendtec Designer 725.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.420
Asides from the power of course.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.980
