Hi! I’m David Kaynor for expertvillage.com.
Now I can also show an old bridge which wasn’t

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:17.680
fitted to this particular top, but by comparison
it’s much smaller: a great deal of wood

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:28.630
has been removed.
This was individualize to some instrument

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:37.540
not to this one but it would fit approximately
like that. Now this bridge has a little piece

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:47.440
of ebony in laid into it; the ebony supposedly
will resist the wear from the strings better

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:56.700
than maple will, so some bridges have a little
ebony insert that supposedly give them longer

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.551
life. This other bridge does not have an ebony
insert, and it’s arguable that it’s a

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:10.150
little more vulnerable to the wear of the
E string, which is after all just a very thin

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:19.220
piece of wire under very high tension. Now
I can demonstrate, I can show a violin with

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.330
the bridge installed on the instrument and
here we can see, if the close up works well

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:37.080
enough, we can see that there’s a very small
piece of plastic tubing on the E string and

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.290
this is acting like a bridge protector. It’s
actually a little line of protection between

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.360
the wire of the string under high tension
and the maple. It’s also arguable that this

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.450
filter is the vibrations of the E string a
little bit, so that perhaps the sound that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:09.039
comes out of the fiddle has a somewhat rounder,
softer richer sound rather than a shrilled,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:17.280
ziggy ringy sound which is associated with
some E strings. And this is an example of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.630
a bridge that’s been individually fitted
to this instrument and therefore is gaining

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:35.430
the best possible transmission of vibrations
at a comfortable string height for the player,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.160
usually me with an arch that sets the strings
at a comfortable orientation for me, and because

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.990
of the fit of the feet, it doesn’t wear
the top anymore than it’s already worn by

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.570
a various bridge, the various owners in the
past.
