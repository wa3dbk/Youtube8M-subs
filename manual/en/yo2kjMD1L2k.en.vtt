[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:36.720
It seemed like an excellent
opportunity to get really, really cold

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.200
and muddy and have some fun.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.360
I think it's going to be
quite tough, actually,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.296
because you've got to not
doubt yourself and your ability

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:45.462
if you want to give it a go.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.160
I would say just have fun with it.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.840
Just have fun.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.215
It's a fun day.

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:54.507
Don't take it too seriously.

00:00:54.507 --> 00:00:57.340
And yeah, we're going to have a--
we're going to have a laugh, yeah.

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:03.252
The biggest event this year,
Tough Mudder Worldwide.

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:09.379
It's also, ladies and gentlemen, today,
officially the five-year anniversary

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:11.375
since the beginning of Tough Mudder.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:12.871
Give me a hurrah!

00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:13.371
Hurrah!

00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:14.868
Give me a hell yeah!

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:15.866
Hell yeah!

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.361

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.820
The mud's quite fun.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.690
I kind of--

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.009
I quite liked the last one, the last
one where you had to run up the hill.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.825
And we're going to
have a good experience.

00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:11.533
Have a good team.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.110
Good team, yeah.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.600
All walks of people doing it.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.260
So not matter what your fitness
levels are, you can definitely do it.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.418
Yeah, Yeah.

00:02:17.418 --> 00:02:19.908
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:10.704
I didn't think I was going to do that.

00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:13.194
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.839
When I'm a granny, and my kids say,
like, oh, you're such a granny.

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:46.630
You're such a bore.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.160
I'll be like, I did a Tough Mudder.
