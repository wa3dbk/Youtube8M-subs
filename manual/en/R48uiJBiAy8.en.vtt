00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:06.869
O.k. Rock groove number four. This time, I'm
going to use my left foot. Basically, all

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:10.120
I'm going to play is quarter notes with my
left foot. So it's going to line up with the

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.370
Base drum. So feet are going to be doing the
exact same thing. they're going to go, one,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.760
two, three, four. It's really important to
go ahead and start learning a little bit of

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.800
this. Because it opens up a lot of options.
It can change the text of the music really

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.220
easily. And create all kinds of cool phrasing
and lots of tricks. Now, only thing that we

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.860
add to it from now, is the Snare drum on two
and four. Now leave the right hand out. Because

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.501
it's usually, if you try to do everything
at once. It's a little tricky. So you want

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:42.010
to isolate the new thing. And the easiest
way to do that, is put it with something familiar.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.540
And the Hi Hat and the Base drum are lined
up. So tuned together. And the Snare drum,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.640
lines up right with it. So everything should
work together. Just take your time and you

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:59.970
can do it. One, two, three, four. One, two,
three, four. Now, once you have that. Go ahead

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.920
and try and do 8th notes on the Hi Hat. And
it opens up a whole other pattern. So that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.324
would be this. Actually, I'll do one measure
of just what I did. And then I'll add the

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:19.240
8th notes on the Hi Hat. And you'll see the
difference. O.k. Here we go. One, two and

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.520
three and four and. So basically, you get
that really cool sound out of it. Just by

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.790
timing that left foot, right. And lining it
up with the Base drum. A little faster, sounds

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:49.960
like this. One and two....o.k. Really easy.
Another trick you can do right away, is just

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:01.539
put the right hand on the Ride Cymbal. Keep
this the same. So now you have this. We'll

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.540
put Base drum on quarter notes. I wasn't playing
clearly. Here we go. One and two and three

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:13.870
and four and. One and two and three and four
and. One and two and three and four and. One

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.290
and two and three and four and. and one. O.k.,
so that's rock groove number four. And just

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.830
introduce you, how to use this left foot.
There's all kinds of other stuff also to learn

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.240
with it.
