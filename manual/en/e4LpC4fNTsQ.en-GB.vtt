00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.820
Hi. I'm TR Ratliff with Xtreme Hog Hunting
Magazine and today we're gonna have a special

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.820
hunt. Brian Miller and I are gonna take Romy
Petrina on a hog hunt here in Hurtsboro, Alabama.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.299
It will be Romy's second or third hunt with
us and I know you're excited to be here today.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.539
I am, I am. I'm ready to go.

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:12.539
We'll we've got our dogs loaded up and Brian
being over anxious as usual. He's ready to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.250
put the dogs in the woods and we're fixing
to turn these beasts loose and see if we can

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.420
put a hog down on the ground in the next fifteen
to twenty minutes. Are you guys ready?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.149
I'm ready.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.530
Let's do it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We got hog bayed, dropped by the pond down
there.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.000
The guys head out in the buggies and are looking
to get a hog quickly.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.000
Brian gets a bulldog.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And heads off into the brush.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.000
As they head into the thick stuff, the dogs
start baying.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.069
The team rush in. Brian gets the hog by the
legs as TR removes the bulldog. Romy holds

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:19.670
the bulldog as Brian pulls the hog out and
flips him over. But, there's more than one

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.540
hog in here. Our very own Ian Harford is wrestling
with a hog not too far away. Ian drags the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.760
hog out of the swamp and puts it down. Romy's
in there and makes a good clean kill. It bleeds

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.769
out quickly, without any suffering.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.180
That's why you take care of it in a humane
manner and that's why we're here for. We're

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.450
taking the hogs away from the farmers and
here he goes. Lets go to number two, are you ready?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.450
 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:54.489
They head across to the other hog and Brian
has him held down. Another quick, clean, efficient

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.000
kill. The hog is out without any suffering.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:05.079
What we've done today, we've taken a man out
of the industrial office and brought him to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.180
the woods and he's helping us maintain this
hog population. Brian, good job, we had a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.180
double bay. Appreciate that this was effort
from everybody, from the camera crew to Brian

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.150
and I here, we didn't expect two hogs at one
time, so everybody had to get their hands

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.969
dirty but good job for everybody.

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.000
It all worked out.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.620
This is a Baconmaker we've been using, we've
sold hundreds of these knifes. And there's

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.730
nothing, it penetrates a hog like a knife
going through warm butter. You can contest

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.950
how sharp this knife is.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.439
To give you proof, I cannot believe that.
I cannot believe that, it went in so easy,

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.150
it really cut like wet butter.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.639
Well that's why we're here for. We gotta take
these hogs away from the population but we

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.730
wanna do it in a humane manner. We don't want
any suffering, we do it as quick as we can

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.529
and good job Romy.

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:03.370
Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.249
Yes sir, thank you.

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:04.499
Unbelievable!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.480
After a very quick and successful hunt, Ian
gives Romy a hand, dragging his hog out of

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.030
the woods. Some really good work from the
dogs and the team Xtreme Hog Hunter Magazine.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.870
Two feral hogs have been taken out of the
massive population that are destroying the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.000
Alabama crop country. Good work boys.
