00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.811
[MUSIC]

00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:11.440
I grew up as a child, enthusiastic passion
about doing things that were adventurous.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.912
Getting out and exploring the planet, whether

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:12.420
that was motorcycles, or boats, or
airplanes.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.200
Flying was something that when I was very

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.150
early age, I found very Inspirational.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.510
It was the ultimate freedom.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.646
Aviation today is really about moving your
body from A to B,

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:40.110
but when it comes to enjoying flying as an
experience,.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.720
It doesn't exist.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.790
I spent about eight years in the Air Force
flying F-16's.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.730
When I left the military and I came back
to Stanford Business School.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.460
I was trying to get out of a flight suit
and into a business suit.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.390
I happened to notice one day in a magazine
a little obscure rule change.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.240
And it was the FAA saying that they were
going

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.050
to announce a new class of airplane called
Light Sport Airplanes.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.300
It is a new class that is licensed for the
pilot and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.130
the concept was, to finally make airplanes
accessible to the average human being.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.240
Make them safe and affordable.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.589
And a license you can get in a matter of a
couple weeks.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.680
So there was a moment when I realized what
aviation could be.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.380
And as an academic exercise, I was going
to study it.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.120
In each class, I would spin them towards
something related

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.135
to this project, so the first one was a
market analysis.

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:33.850
And an a-ha was whoa, there's a big market
here, bigger than I expected.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.934
The other a-ha moment was if a startup

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:39.440
does not do this, it likely will not
materialize.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.330
I had a business plan and I had thrown the
switch to on.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.671
&gt;&gt; Kirk and I met in a design

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.961
class, an engineering design class at
Stanford and every

00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:52.906
project we had, Kirk found a way to

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:56.650
turn that project into some kind of
aviation experience.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.914
We actually reconnected later on when I
was teaching product

00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:02.352
design at Stanford and he was back at the
DSB.

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:04.550
We reconnected over, over lunch.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.695
During lunch it hit me.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:06.908
Can I show you a Powerpoint?

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:09.270
And he goes, alright, so I pull up my
Powerpoint.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.910
&gt;&gt; He basically detailed out all of the
opportunity.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.240
&gt;&gt; And I go, did I, I think you're the guy
I'm looking for.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.880
What you know about the consumer product
design process.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.078
What your teaching at Stanford.

00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:21.340
What you lived and breathed.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.070
The airplane world doesn't know.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.670
I know enough about that to know I need
somebody like you.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.640
&gt;&gt; It's easy for me to go, okay, I can see
where this could be in the future.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.580
And that's why, as the story goes, you
know, the next morning I'm calling him up.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.690
&gt;&gt; He goes, I so get this.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.370
He goes, I, I'm in.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.170
I'm all in.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.080
What do you need?

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.050
&gt;&gt; In a way you could say that the work
Kirk

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.360
did it, the GSP, is directly leading to
this product we have.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.420
&gt;&gt; That's the beginning of the DNA of the
company.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.353
&gt;&gt; If you wanna take advantage of this

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:52.804
recreational opportunity, the best way to
do that

00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:55.255
is to bring recreational flying to the
forefront,

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:57.480
and really make a powersport out of
aviation.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.900
By the time I left Stanford I felt
confident

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.930
enough in my fundamental business acumen,
understanding of things, so

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.400
that I could walk in any board room with

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.720
any business executive, and I felt
comfortable having a dialogue.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.580
And that confidence is important.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.780
And the tool set that I got there was
invaluable in the next phase.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.030
And that is creating the company.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.830
&gt;&gt; As we move from business strategy into

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.220
implementation and design, what should
this airplane be?

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.030
What should it deliver?

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.000
What's the lifestyle?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.410
How will people use it?

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.750
We quickly honed in on this notion of
alright, we'll have an amphibious

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.720
airplane that allows you to fly and land
on land or land on water.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.910
&gt;&gt; It's not airport to airport.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.300
This is airport to off airport.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.500
&gt;&gt; So we have folding wings that allows
you

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.190
transportation to move your airplane
wherever you wanna take it.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.300
It makes it more recreational.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.390
&gt;&gt; Now you can taking it camping, fishing,
exploring, wherever you want.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.180
And so the company is more than an
airplane.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.650
It's about really honoring the human

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.050
experience and delivering you something
that, that.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.330
When you finally go out and fly you find
that you can fly.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.040
It's save, you can learn to do it in

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.770
a reasonable amount of time, you actually
can afford it.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.780
Our goal is for our customers when they
come back from

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.660
the first time and they fly, they go oh my
God.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.190
&gt;&gt; But all those things tie back to that
original strategy that came out of

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.300
the GSB which is we are going to create a
power sport around recreational flying.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.440
It's a two person one engine relatively
lightweight simple airplane that a

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.210
new sport pilot can learn to fly in about
two weeks very safely.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.230
And you look at the airplane you look at
the cock pit and you go

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.890
it's relatively simple, I can understand
this

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.010
cockpit it looks like something I can do.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.620
That doesn't happen by accident.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.750
It happens by people who understand that
process.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.990
&gt;&gt; The design process at icon is really
based on what we learned at Stanford.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.810
And that's the classic ideate, build, test
and repeat.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.640
And you learn from that testing and then

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.020
you go back and you iterate that process
again.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.720
We're the first conventional aircraft
that's

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.010
met the full FAA suspended resistance

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.530
standard, so what that means for you is
that it is very safe.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.736
&gt;&gt; What the A5 is is an unadulterated,
unapologetic,

00:04:56.736 --> 00:05:02.869
representation, an execution of what
flying is romantically

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:09.670
designed to be, and that's this human
aspirational experience.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.209
&gt;&gt; I think both Kirk and I feel that
Stanford

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:16.530
has been transformative in our personal
lives and our careers.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.220
&gt;&gt; I can say this infratically if it was
not for Mike's appearances at

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.760
Stanford both in engineering and design
school

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.560
and the business school, icon would not
exist.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.611
&gt;&gt; All the sort of Stanford networks and

00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:31.520
connections and influencers that we still
rely on today.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.440
It's easy to say that without those

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.170
Stanford experiences Icon would not have
been

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.780
an idea and it certainly wouldn't have
reached the place where it is today.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.854
&gt;&gt; I feel indebted because that, that
experience was, was critical to

00:05:42.854 --> 00:05:46.802
where we have come from today and where
we're going in the future.

00:05:46.802 --> 00:05:56.802
