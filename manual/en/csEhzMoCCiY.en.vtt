00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:06.470
In this step, we're going to talk about the
beginning draining phases of our transmission

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.591
pan. What you're going to want to do is use
a block or a milk crate or possibly even a

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:17.360
floor jack. Place your drain pan underneath
the trans and get it as close as possible.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.810
We're going to start taking out the bolts
from one side and then loosening the bolts

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.860
on the other side to let the pan drop and
drain out as much fluid before we begin the

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:40.370
final removal. I'm going to go ahead and slide
underneath the vehicle and get started.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.320
Alright, what we're going to do is remove
the bolts from one side of the transmission

00:00:45.320 --> 00:01:01.239
pan. I'm going to go ahead and demonstrate
that process for you. Alright. There's a bolt

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.540
right there. They're real small, fine-thread
bolts so you're going to want to be real gentle

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.970
taking them out and putting them back in.
Drop it in my magnetic tray and continue moving

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:36.340
around taking them out. We're going to leave
three bolts on the side that we're not taking

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.020
them out of. But we're going to loosen them
up significantly. We only want to leave about

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.640
three or four threads in the transmission.
What that will do like I said earlier, is

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.329
allow that pan to drop down but not plop off
into our drain pan. When it drops down, we're

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.390
going to drain about 50% of the fluid out
of the pan. We will then remove our drain

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.659
bucket, hold the pan up tight with our hands
and level, take the rest of the bolts out

00:02:03.659 --> 00:03:05.199
and very carefully slide the pan into the
drain pan.

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:10.240
Alright, once you have most of the transmission
bolts out of one side, I got about all the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.889
way around here, of your transmission pan,
you're going to place your drain pan below

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.870
it, like I said, try and get as close as possible
to the trans pan. You're going to take a rubber

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.099
mallet like I have here and start thumping
on the edge of the trans pan. You want to

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:44.109
hit it on this area here. That is the strongest
part of your transmission pan.

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.359
As you can see, we broke the seal and the
transmission fluid is going to drain out this

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:56.279
side of the pan. Those bolts up in here are
still holding it to keep from spilling it

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:03.499
all over the place. That is the proper way
to begin the draining procedure for your transmission

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:03.629
pan.
