(Music)

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.120
in 1916 Ole Kirk Christiansen purchased
the woodworking shop in Denmark that

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.430
constructed houses and furniture.  After
a few years in business, the workshop was struggling.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.630
Ole had to think of
something else if he wanted to remain in business.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.130
After experimenting with a few
other projects, the workshop began

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.700
producing wooden toys, piggy banks, JoJo's (wat are these) , pool toys, cars, trucks and miniature houses.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.989
Following World War II Ole's son Godtfred began working for the company which now officially went by the name of Lego

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.320
In 1947, Ole and Godtfred obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.620
by the British company kiddicraft
kiddicraft called them self-locking

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.059
building bricks inspired by this the
LEGO Group began producing its own

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.799
bricks which they instead called
automatic binding bricks in the coming

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.060
years the company grew exponentially
under the leadership of Olli son gut

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.010
Fred since oleh had passed away the
production of wooden toys was abandoned

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.689
completely as the company now solely
focused on working with plastics the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.430
Legoland park was open in Denmark and as
the bricks grew in popularity Lego

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.400
quickly became a household name all over
the world

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.460
the name Lego is an abbreviation of the
two Danish words lie gods meaning play

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.689
well and while not intention from the
beginning it was later discovered that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.659
in Latin the word Lego can loosely be
interpreted as I put together or I

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.070
assemble they also considered the name
lay Keo with the implication of a legion

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.670
of toys

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.020
another important part of leggo are the
mini figures but the minifigs weren't

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.080
invented until 30 years after the laïkó
bridge its inception came in 1978 in the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.310
form of a policeman with black clothes
and a white hat and to be honest the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.810
design has stayed more or less the same
ever since the figs became more and more

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.640
diversified as more variations were
released but for the next 11 years they

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.390
would all have the same face every
single one of them it wasn't until 1989

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.560
that someone realized how creepy this
becomes after a while and thus some

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.680
other facial expressions were introduced
so far over 4 billion minifigs have been

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.550
produced after the company's decline in
the late 1990s and hitting its lowest

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.590
peak in 2004 when they almost had to
file for bankruptcy the LEGO Group has

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.150
done quite well for themselves in fact
since the release of the lego movie Lego

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.150
is now the largest toy manufacturer in
the world and since 1958 the company has

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.239
produced over 560 billion bricks which
means that as of this moment if divided

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:11.730
equally everyone on earth would have 78
Lego bricks if you tried connecting a

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.150
Lego brick from 1958 with a brick from
today

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.980
they would still interlock this is
because Lego uses a universal system

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.290
that means that despite variation in the
sign size and purpose they all remain

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.820
compatible even LEGO DUPLO bricks which
are several times larger than ordinary

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.010
bricks still connect which is quite
impressive given that only 6 pieces of

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:43.200
2x4 bricks would produce a staggering
950 million 100 3765 possible

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.430
combinations some quite amazing things
have been constructed using Lego bricks

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.610
for example the world's tallest Lego
structure at 34.76 metres top gear

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.690
presenter James May built a real house
made out of Lego using 3.3 million

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.090
the absolute largest model ever built
with only Lego bricks is this full-scale

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.060
model of an x-wing fighter from Star
Wars

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:20.730
it required 5.3 million bricks and four
months to build according to the company

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.980
the only proper way of describing the
bricks is by using the word Lego as an

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.740
adjective and not as a noun so saying
Legos is actually wrong and you should

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.840
instead be saying Lego bricks
since 2007 on beaches all over the world

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.840
people have found this giant mini
figurine okay that sounded extremely

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.090
paradoxical a giant Lego man has washed
ashore on beaches across the globe with

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.400
the message no real than you are
obviously the message is that you can't

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.750
trust Google Translate it's believed
that these things were created by a

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.460
Dutch artist that goes by the name of
ego Leonarda which is almost certainly

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.680
fake as the first four letters spell out
Lego when inverted no one's entirely

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.210
sure why he or she is doing it but the
LEGO Group has at least on several

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.020
occasions denied any involvement if you
take a look at the head of a minifig

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.669
you'll find that it has a hole at the
top the reason for this is that in case

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.870
a child should accidentally swallow the
head they would still be able to breathe

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.880
even if it got stuck in their throat

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.470
while the lego movie might look like it
was created using stop-motion the entire

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.270
movie is actually CGI the entire
production process was specifically

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.130
designed to make it look like
stop-motion tiny dense specks of dust

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.419
and even smudges of fingerprints on the
models the lighting and of course the

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.930
iconic shopping movements stop-motion is
so well known for

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.190
of course known exception will be the
live-action segments but a really cool

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.570
thing is that they made sure that every
brick in piece seen in the movie also

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.650
exists in real life so that if you
passed any scene you could actually

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.599
build it for yourself even in a scene
like this all the buildings and the

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.740
grass
and everything you see were made using

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.060
individual digital bricks and pieces you
want to know why they did that because

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.509
everything is awesome the poplar is
everything is awesome now available in

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:37.979
fucking swedish
I'll ting aft it's all tingly flick the

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:49.880
