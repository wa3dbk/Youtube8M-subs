Hey, what's up, design nation!

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.840
In this session I'm actually gonna answer 
questions.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.519
I got a tweet from a wordplay, who's having
troubles with complex geometry in SketchUp

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.030
She was trying to get the blow image, and
where she left up when she decided to reach

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.349
up for help, it's at the top.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.480
I decided to take a stab at this and I actually
came up with a really simple solution.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.870
The first thing that I did, was a came in
and a drew a 5 feet line, and then I came

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.050
up 10 feet, the shape that she's trying to
get is very ovular, in meaning like an oval,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.620
so I'm gonna draw half of the and just look
for a very gently curve and that looks okay,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.809
so I'm gonna copy this, hit M to move, and
then hit cntr and then flip this along the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.780
red direction.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.300
And then bring that in.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.130
I delete this middle line so now I have a
symmetrical object.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.130
I hit M for move and I'm gonna move this down
a little bit, so it looks a little more fluid.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.030
And that's so where I'm looking forward.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.160
Now what I wanna do it extrude the shape,
so I'm gonna extrude the 5 feet, and we are

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.370
gonna select this, hit S for scale, and I'm
gonna scale that down.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.750
I'm gonna select this side and I'm going to
hit control so it scales both sides equally.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.500
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna offset
this face.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.819
And push it in.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:02.000
So if I want, I can now scale this guy as
well.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.979
And if I wanna to, I could select this point,
hit M for move, gonna hold up on my keyboard,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.590
so it allows me to move on a blue axis, and
I'm gonna bring this, so it matches up with

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.590
that one.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.630
Now just move everything out because there
is some joint here, I'm gonna select these

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.690
2 faces, right-click and go to soften and
smooth edges, and I wanna to be the least

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.340
amount as possible, so I'm just gonna drag
all the way to the left and then take to the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.110
right until that line goes away, and do the
same on the bottom.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.980
Double-click, double-click, smooth soften,
and there we go.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.600
