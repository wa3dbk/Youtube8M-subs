00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.380
Brooklyn Tech is a pretty amazing
place.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.580
It's a specialized high school here in New York City.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.360
They really specialize in pumping out 
engineer-ready students.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.200
My name is Tom Curanovic and I'm the Senior
Mechanical Engineering instructor here at

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.430
Brooklyn Technical High School.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.170
When I started here about two years ago
the course were specifically geared

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.880
towards computer numerical controlled
machinery

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.080
and in the last 12 months we've been
making drastic changes towards rapid prototyping

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.840
specifically with the MakerBot.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.060
We're able
to get through more material,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.310
the students are able to absorb more
manufacturing related knowledge.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.450
They're able to check their parts and
verify designs

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.320
probably in the same class period verses
on the traditional methods we were doing

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.960
about two years ago
they would have to wait a day or two

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.359
or sometimes by the end of the week.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.180
The MakerBot and the new era of rapid
prototyping and the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.710
vast accessibility is opening up the
field of engineering as a whole.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.010
We're seeing a lot more interest from
all sorts of students starting as early

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.119
as freshman year.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.800
One of my students, Vishnu Sanigepalli

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.820
is in my afternoon class and the first
thing he did was he said,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.360
"Hey what does that little black box do?"

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.700
From kindergarten to eleventh grade
everything was on a piece of paper.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.380
That kind of set me off when I went to engineering 
where you usually don't get what you expected.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.300
I'm Vishnu Sanigepalli. 
I'm currently a senior at Brooklyn Tech High School.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.520
I just started working on the 3D Printer, first thing.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.740
As the first product came in, I was more and more
intrigued on how to create more projects.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.980
The design process that I noticed in him 
just blossomed tenfold.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.780
Right away he was more involved in the mechanical theory.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.440
Right now he's interested in 
applying more of his math skills.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.780
So last year, in Calculus BC,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.119
at the end of the year
we were trying to figure out

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.430
the solid we were going to get from
intersecting two cylinders

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.060
and trying to see it on the computer and
trying to draw it on the board

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.240
was really difficult.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.460
I was like, 
"Oh, why don't I print out a 3D model for the surface?"

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.500
I was sitting there for about 30 minutes,
staring at the printer as it printed layer by layer.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.440
Before, it was just in my mind or on a piece of paper
or on a computer

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.360
and that wasn't as cool as 
having the project in your hand

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.920
because you're able to touch it and you're
able to feel the project itself.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.720
Mr. Curanovic and Mr. Pigis, my other
engineering teacher

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.140
asked me to create an instructions set
on the MakerBot

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.880
because I was working on it
all the time.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.420
They told me to teach in
front of the class so that all the students can get it.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.980
There are students that sometimes
they'll look at the picture

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.300
and they'll look at the 3D model
and they'll say

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.040
"Can you just walk me through it
once more?"

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.079
and they're probably more of a verbal
learner.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.079
Some students are completely visual and
some of the students, and now most of them

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.480
thanks to the MakerBot are more
tactile learners

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.020
so they'd rather see it, play with it,
look at it, and say

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.060
"Hey, can't we do this with this next time?"
