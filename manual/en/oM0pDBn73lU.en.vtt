00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.170
Here's an awesome way to stop overfishing:
Let's just close the oceans!

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.260
Easy peasy!

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.950
Right?

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.650
Guys?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.700
Hey piscivores, Trace here for DNews -- We're
killing the oceans.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.400
In the middle of the last century, aggressive
commercial fishing really hit the oceans hard,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.430
trying to get high-protein fish into our diet.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.980
In 1989, 90 million metric tons of fish were
taken from the ocean.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.730
Since that peak, the number of fish caught
has decreased every year since, and not because

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.860
we don't WANT more fish, but because they're
simply -- not there.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.710
In the year 2000, the BBC assumed genetically
farmed fish would be sustaining the world

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.100
by 2025, that's not far off.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.640
At the time, the United Nations estimated
70 percent of the world was threatened by

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640
overfishing.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.420
Then, in 2003 the journal Nature estimated
of the biomass of all fish in the ocean was

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.260
only 10% of what it was before commercial
fishing.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.730
It's sort of like, we HAD 10 fish, and we
ate 9 of them.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.539
At the moment, the international community
agreed to fish in seasons, with catch quotas

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.320
and minimum size limits -- with the hope this
would allow time for the fish to mature, spawn

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.060
and build the population.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.189
News flash, it ain't workin'.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.189
Why?

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.119
Because we're not really managing the fisheries,
it's essentially a free for all once ships

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.579
are in international waters.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.829
According to the World Wildlife Federation,
"the global fishing fleet is 2-3 times larger

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.419
than what the oceans can sustainably support."

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:32.419
So what do we do?!

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:37.289
A new plan published in PLOS Biology has a
pretty radical solution that they say will

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.840
sustain the fish population forever...

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.179
CLOSE THE OCEANS // OKAY EVERYONE, CLOSE IT
UP, WE HAD A GOOD RUN.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.179
Seriously?

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.179
Close the oceans?

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:47.179
Would this work?

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.310
According to the researchers' models, Yeah.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.599
Not only would it work, but we'd make money
in the long run.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.149
Their plan is close the high seas --- which
are real, it's not just a pirate joke.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.469
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
define the high seas as international waters

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.149
more than 200 miles from land.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.510
If you do the math, that's 64 percent of ocean's
surface and 95 percent of its volume, all

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.599
unfishable.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.709
Closed.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.540
But only for a few years, then when they're
reopened again under new regulations, we can

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.930
fish sustainably FOREVER!

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.459
Yes, it sounds a little far fetched, but last
month, the director of the international consulting

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.870
firm McKinsey &amp; Company said the SAME THING!

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.239
He said, we're SUBSIDIZING high seas fishing,
which increasingly is not a profitable enterprise.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.220
Ships meander around the oceans, looking for
remaining populations.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.540
If we designated the high seas as conservation
areas it would cost us $2 per person on average,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.019
but we'd get $4 back in the long run.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.040
Once populations rebounded, there would be
more fish to catch, which is good for business

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.120
AND conservationists.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.829
A study in Science from 2006 says if we don't
do SOMETHING then by 2050 it's all over; we're

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.249
going to have no more fish to eat.

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:06.959
Under the PLOS Biology plan, each country
could regulate its own 200 miles of fishing

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.109
waters, and thus maintain healthy populations
of local fish and allow for the global population

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.109
to rebound.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.760
Iceland, Australia, New Zealand and the United
States have already begun attempts to rebuild

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.230
their fishing stock, but there's a LOT more
to do.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.460
Would this mean you CAN'T have sushi for a
while?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.500
Not really, but the sushi you have might be
more expensive as only a small portion of

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.829
the fish will wander into the acceptable fishing
areas.

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.590
Yes, there WOULD be economic impact around
the planet, but if we don't do SOMETHING we're

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.130
on track to hunt fish to extinction.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.130
Is it worth it?

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.130
Should they work it?
