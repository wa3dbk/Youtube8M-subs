00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:09.311
Mundia is a site that lets you create, discover, and share 
 your family history in a fun and easy way.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.991
Here is a map of the latest activity of Mundia members around the world.

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:23.125
Here are recently uploaded member photos...

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:30.734
And here are the most popular family names on the site right now.

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:38.194
Now I'm going to type in my family name to 
 see what I can discover about my family.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.876
It looks like there are about 8,000 Aguilars in the Mundia network.

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:54.753
And about 2,400 in the United States alone.

00:00:55.261 --> 00:01:01.267
Here are some fun family facts about the Aguilar family.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.306
I'll click on the 2,400 matches to see who those people are.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.584
Here's a list of those other Aguilars.

00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:21.790
Here is an "Aurora Aguilar".

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.372
I remember my mother had an aunt whose name was "Aurora". 
 So I'll click on her to find out more.

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:38.244
I'll register so I can see Aurora's information.

00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:50.890
As you can see, registering is easy and it's also free.

00:01:56.332 --> 00:01:59.770
Now I can see Aurora's information.

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.340
It looks like she was born in Texas.

00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:09.780
Here are some events that happened in her life.

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:15.020
And here is a list of other family members in her family tree.

00:02:15.512 --> 00:02:22.320
It looks like there are 493 in her tree 
 right now. I'll click on that to see.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:37.410
Here is Aurora and here is the rest of her family. I'll zoom 
 out so I can see how big her family tree is.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.220
This is really interesting. This makes me want to create my own tree.

00:02:47.407 --> 00:02:51.460
I'll start by adding my father.

00:02:59.397 --> 00:03:03.740
And then I'll add my mother.

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:22.590
Then I'll add my brother.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:35.700
And I think I'll add and invite him to my tree 
 because he knows a lot about our family. 

00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:42.630
So he could probably help me out.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:04:01.560
And I also know some information about my father's mother 
 so I might as well go and add her.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:19.200
I know she was born in 1900 and 
 I know she died sometime in 1959.

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:42.480
So that's 3 generations. To make it more fun and 
 personal, I'll go ahead and add my profile photo.

00:04:57.728 --> 00:05:01.730
There. Oh and it looks like there are some 
 hints for some people in my family.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I'll go and see the hint for my grandmother.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Mundia hints are based on information from millions of family trees worldwide...

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
...They help you grow your tree and find relatives around the world.)

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.220
So I'll go ahead and copy all of these to make 
 sure I have the same information. Then I'll save it.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.560
There. As you can see, it's really easy to create your family tree.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.200
And the hints help you build it out even faster. You 
 should try it. It's fun and it's very easy.
