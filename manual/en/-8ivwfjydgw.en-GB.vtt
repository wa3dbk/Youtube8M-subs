00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.049
Okay so I've just received this package today,
it's been quite a while since I've got a puzzle

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.750
in the post. This is from Tmart, now I can't
remember what puzzles I've ordered from Tmart,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.750
but going by the small size and the pointiness,
I'm thinking it's probably a Mozhi Pyramorphix,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.770
I think that's what it's called anyway. Let's
open it up and find out what it is... and

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.239
I was right, this is the Mozhi Pyramorphix.
And there you can see it says 'Toys' there,

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.989
'For ages 3 years and up', you've got like
these little pictures of cars and stuff. So

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.200
the only other thing in the packet is some
sort of flyer advertising products on Tmart.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.310
So I think this is actually a 2x2 shape mod,
I can't remember how much this cost, I think

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:39.719
it was only a couple of pounds. So I'll show
you how the size compares to a regular sized

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:09.819
2x2, so it's quite big. Turns okay, it does
have that Mozhi cheapness feel to it. So yeah,

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.239
so let's scramble this up, so as you can see
it shape shifts. Okay so that didn't really

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:04.909
go well, I've basically solved it again by
accident, maybe I wasn't scrambling it in

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.549
the right way I'm not sure, if this is a 2x2 shape

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:19.549
mod then it shouldn't be that easy to solve.
Yeah I don't know, I'm not sure if I'm scrambling

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:42.200
it properly or not (laughs), I'll have to
look into this puzzle. I mean I've watched

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.109
some video of this puzzle on Youtube before
buying this, to see if it was something that

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:53.599
I wanted, but I've not actually looked into
how it properly works if you know what I mean.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.900
So yeah that's the Mozhi Pyramorphix, thanks
for watching.
