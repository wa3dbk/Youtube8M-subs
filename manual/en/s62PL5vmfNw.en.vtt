00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.890
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.130
Have you ever seen a material
do this when it gets heated?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.510
This is not an
ordinary material.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.540
This is a shape memory material.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.915
It has the ability to
remember a specific shape

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:27.610
and change into that
shape when heated.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.200
So how do these materials work?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.180
It's all based on
phase transformations.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.080
You've probably seen
phase transformations

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.110
when water freezes.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.710
This is a transformation from
liquid water to solid water.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.400
There is also a phase
change when water boils.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.670
Here, the liquid water
becomes water vapor.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.010
Well, what is the difference
between the phases?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.630
The difference is how the
individual water molecules

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.990
are arranged.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.710
In liquid water, they're
loosely packed together

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.866
so they can move
past one another.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.450
In ice, they're
tightly packed together

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.262
and they can't change places.

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:06.720
But did you know
there are actually

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.030
multiple solid phases of ice?

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.830
There's a hexagonal
ice phase that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.660
is stable till negative
150 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.170
And a cubic ice phase that is
only stable below negative 150

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.610
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.800
So how does this fit into
shape memory materials?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.240
These materials also have
multiple solid phases.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.820
There is a low temperature
phase that is called Martensite.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.380
But if we increase
the temperature,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.192
the atomic alignment
changes into another phase

00:01:39.192 --> 00:01:39.900
called Austenite.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.119
So at low temperatures,
we have Martensite.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.952
And at high temperatures,
we have Austenite.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.970
How do we set the memory shape?

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.880
To set the shape
that we want, we

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.040
must hold the material
in the Austenite phase

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.270
at high temperatures.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.640
Here, we have used screws
to hold the wire in place

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.591
on a metal plate, which we
then put into the furnace

00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:04.090
to heat it.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.070
Inside the furnace, the wire
transforms into Austenite,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.380
which sets the memory shape.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.700
When we cool it down, it
transforms into Martensite,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.120
but it does so without
changing the shape.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.760
In the graphic, you can see that
the atoms have the Martensite

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.610
structure but they align
in a zigzag pattern,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.040
so the overall shape
does not change.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.600
Now we can bend the
wire however we like.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.870
The material does
not change phase,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.700
but the alignment pattern
changes slightly so that they

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.050
align in one direction.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.800
This results in a
permanent shape change.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.710
Now if we heat up the wire, it
goes through the phase change

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.520
from Martensite to Austenite,
and it returns back

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.330
to its original shape.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.480
We can repeat this for
almost any shape we want.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.160
Shape memory
materials also exhibit

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.380
another special property
called superelasticity.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.520
Here's the same
shape we saw before,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.070
and now we will pull it.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.240
But unlike before,
this time the shape

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.650
doesn't change but it goes right
back to its original shape.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.390
This is called superelasticity.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.170
This also works because
of phase transformations.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.640
This material is a slightly
different composition

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.300
so that at room temperature,
it is in the Austenite phase.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.280
If we stress the
material, we can force it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.600
into Martensite phase, and
this will change the shape.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.990
But if we release the
stress, it goes right back

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.230
to the Austenite phase
and the original shape

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.310
because that is where it is
stable at this temperature.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.520
You may have seen this
before in eyeglasses

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.890
that can be stretched without
being permanently bent.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.040
We've shown you how
the shape memory

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.810
effect and superelasticity work
based on phase transformations.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.460
This is an example of how
material scientists study

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.470
materials.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.880
They try to explain
observed properties in terms

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.890
of the internal structure.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.399
Then once they understand
the underlying principles,

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.300
they can use them to make
even better materials.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.150
