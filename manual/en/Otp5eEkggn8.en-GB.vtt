00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.789
Mazda is slowly but surely creating one of
the most appealing model ranges of any manufacturer,

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.490
with the 2, 3, 6 and CX-5 all scoring highly
in our reviews. And now, the Mazda CX-3 has

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.180
arrived into one of the quickest growing segments,
taking on the likes of the Nissan Juke.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.069
And, with style being so crucial here, it
looks like Mazda is onto a winner. I think

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.379
the CX-3 has a really neat design, which is
set off beautifully by this Metallic Soul

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.069
Red paintwork and Gunmetal alloy wheels. It’s
very compact too, so it should be great to

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:51.399
drive in the city.
Hop in the drivers seat and the interior feels

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.829
modern and sporty, with a large rev gauge
dominating proceedings. Every trim level also

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.649
gets this seven-inch screen, with a controller
placed next to the handbrake. It’s a piece

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.620
of cake to use, and safer than prodding at
a touchscreen one on the move.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:16.140
In this Sport Nav trim, there’s also a heads-up
display, so it’s easy to keep an eye on

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.690
your speed. Materials are impressive, although
this half stone leather interior is an £800

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.940
option we’d probably avoid, as white leather
tends to be rather tricky to keep clean.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.310
Headroom in the back isn’t as impressive
as the front, so tall friends might complain.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.610
The sporty looks also mean the rear windows
are small, so visibility can be an issue.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.090
Rear parking sensors are standard on the SE-L
trim, while Sport Nav models get a reversing

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.360
camera.
The boot in most CX-3’s measures 350-litres,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.810
but the Sport Nav we’re testing has 287
because of a Bose subwoofer which unfortunately

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.960
takes up some space. It compares well to the
352-litre Juke, but the Yeti is more practical,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.760
with 416 litres. The boot lip is quite high,
but on the plus side, there’s an artificial

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.340
boot floor so you can put some valuables or
shoes under here. And when fold the rear seats

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:23.400
down, they sit almost completely flush.
So, you know it looks great, but how about

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.329
how it drives? Well, around town it’s actually
really good fun. The steering is very sharp

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.590
and quite light, while the gearbox is a delight,
with a really snappy feel. You’ll soon find

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.579
yourself nipping in and out of traffic and
attacking mini roundabouts like hairpins on

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.489
the Stelvio pass.
But, it’s not perfect, because the ride

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.459
is quite firm, especially with these 18-inch
wheels fitted. The steering also a bit darty

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.029
at motorway speeds, so it’s not as relaxing
as the Yeti on a longer trip.

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:05.749
Engines include a 1.5-litre diesel, or a 2.0-litre
petrol with 118bhp or 148bhp. The diesel is

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:13.790
best for economy, with 70mpg, but the size
of the petrol shouldn’t put you off, as

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:31.239
both can return over 44mpg.
The CX-3 is

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.540
quite pricey to buy though, with a starting
price of £17,595 playing against £14k for

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.340
an entry-level Juke or Renault Captur, while
the Yeti range starts from £17k.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.749
While the crossover crowd might be getting
bigger, there’s still room for the CX-3.

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:54.730
It looks great, has a pleasant interior and
it’s good fun to drive.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.819
It’s not perfect though, the ride is quite
firm and the petrol models aren’t class-leading

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.919
for efficiency. But, if you can overlook those
minor complaints, the CX-3 is a very stylish

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.459
new model we’re sure you’d be proud to
own.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.709
