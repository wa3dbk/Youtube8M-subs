00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.019
We're in Sweden with
Volvo's new rally car.

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:06.783
Time for a demonstration.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.417
It's difficult to stay objective,
because I'm having so much fun

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.304
on the snow covered roads
and frozen lake in Sweden.

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:50.488
There are worse days.

00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:55.162
For those who hadn't noticed: we're
in the Volvo V40 Cross Country.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:58.200
It's not called the XC40.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.735
The Swedes may want to build
a smaller SUV, below the XC60.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:11.263
They themselves said the successful
Range Rover Evoque made them think.

00:01:11.263 --> 00:01:17.423
The V40 Cross Country isn't
a very special model.

00:01:17.423 --> 00:01:22.137
Look at it like this. There's the
normal V40 and the V40 R-Design,

00:01:22.137 --> 00:01:24.977
which is sportier, has bigger
rims, other bumpers...

00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:29.247
At the other end of the spectrum
is the V40 Cross Country.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
A bit higher on its wheels (40 mm).

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.088
There are also bigger wheels
available, up to 19 inch.

00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:42.974
Different bumpers to make it
the V40's tougher brother.

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:44.820
That's what it is.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.405
We're driving the T5 with AWD. Not
the most relevant one for Holland.

00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:08.729
But that doesn't mean we can't
have fun on snowy surfaces.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.508
Wow, it does that very well.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.000
Volvo has gone down a different road.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.974
No longer the safe understeer and
systems continually kicking in.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:26.352
When you switch off DSTC
it'll go into sports mode.

00:02:26.352 --> 00:02:29.098
It remains a safety brand.

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:31.868
More power goes to the rear wheels.

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:37.100
It's a Haldex system, which needs
spin on the front wheels to react.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.715
However, it's the 5th generation,
so it's much faster.

00:02:39.715 --> 00:02:46.608
In essence it has more oversteer than
when driving in normal mode.

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:48.409
It works pretty well.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.821
I'm a 5-cylinder fan.
The T5 sounds amazing.

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:07.177
Lots of power. 254 hp, so
6.1 seconds to 100 kph. 

00:03:07.177 --> 00:03:11.018
Strangely enough, with AWD it's a bit
slower. 6.4 seconds.

00:03:11.018 --> 00:03:17.400
The maximum speed is the same for the
whole V40 Cross Country range. 210 kph.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.400
Only the D2 with manual
gearbox is slower.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.799
That version is interesting
for the Netherlands.

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.568
You probably consider a V40 for its
20% additional tax liability.

00:03:29.568 --> 00:03:32.744
A V40 Cross Country has that as well.

00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:42.483
For about 2.500 euros extra you
have a different looking V40.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.500
One drawback: automatic.
Still no flappy padals.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.000
It seems to be on the list. In Sweden
they've discovered the flippers.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.786
I think it's so much better
to select your own gears.

00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:20.600
But if I have to advise you,
go for the T5 AWD.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.400
It really is a wonderful car.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.148
You can trash it around more
than expected of a Volvo.

00:04:28.148 --> 00:04:33.756
It oversteers within reason
and drifts over all wheels.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.681
But if you don't feel like that,
you can switch ESP on.

00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:42.090
It gives you lots of traction.
Great for going to winter sports.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.306
You can put your foot down on the
Autobahn. The T5 has plenty of power.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.000
