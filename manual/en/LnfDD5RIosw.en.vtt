00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.560
I've already filled in my brows using the
dip brow pomade in ebony.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.640
Then, i'm going to prime my eyes and take
this black eyeliner pencil by Rimmel London;

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.230
i'm lining the center of the lid and working
my way out.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.980
Just basically, following my eye shape.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:48.080
Then, i'm going to take this flat rounded
brush and i'm going to smudge out that line.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.370
Flip the same brush over and blend out that
harsh line in the crease area.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.710
Taking my "itsjudytime palette" I'mm taking
this bronzy color and i'm going to pack this

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.880
on the inner corner, working my way to the
center of my lid.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.951
From the same palette, i'm taking this darker
color.

00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:14.409
It has like, a reddish/maroon type of vibe
to it.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.190
And i'm going to pack this on the outer corner.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.030
Then, i'm going to take a Sonia Kashuk blending
brush and blend out any harsh edges.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.479
Then, take this color from Anastasia Lavish
palette, it's called "Cream" and i'm going

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.570
to highlight.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.770
Then take this black color from my sephora
it palette and i'm going to make the outer

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.439
corner more intense.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.200
Line the waterline with that same black eyeliner
pencil and tell me, who should I collaborate

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.219
with next?

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.579
I'm so excited to be doing these collaborations.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.749
I love it!

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:56.509
And, I would really love your input on who
YOU think I should contact to collaborate

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:14.240
with!

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:53.170
Then, i'm gonna show you what i'm doing with
my hair today.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.500
So, I'm keeping it natural.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.069
I haven't straightened it or used any hot
tools in a while, so... um... this is basically

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:13.239
what I do to keep it out of my face and keep
it tamed!

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.239
(Giggle)

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.680
Al-right, my loves, thank you so much for
taking time to watch!

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.290
