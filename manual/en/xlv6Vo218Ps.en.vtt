00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.110
Hi I'm doctor andrew dixon from radiopaedia.org and in this video we're going to take

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.600
a look at the Jefferson fracture which
is a burst type fracture of C1 due

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.280
to excessive axial loading with
fractures occuring through both the

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.190
anterior and posterior arches

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.769
so here is a case from our iPad app of a
twenty-year-old male involved in a

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.349
motorcycle accident. Here's his lateral
cervical spine radiograph and we'll just zoom in

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.829
to show you some of the abnormalities. You can
see here that the altantodens interval

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.550
is significantly widened. This should
normally be less than 3mm

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.700
and you can see out the back this lucent line through the posterior arch

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.840
representing a fracture. On the PEG view we see that both at the lateral

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.740
masses of C1 are displaced laterally
relative to the lateral masses of C2

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.510
you can see with my laser
pointer that C1 is overhanging C2.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.080
This should normally be a straight line like
this, however we can see that both sides have displaced

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.360
laterally.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.300
Now the only way that can happen is if
the arch of C1 is broken in two spots.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.480
And we can see here on the CT that is in
fact the case.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.520
you can clearly see a fracture through
 the posterior arch

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.220
and a fracture line here through the anterior arch.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.610
now the other important thing to note
is this bone fragment here

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.830
which represents an avulsed fragment from
the insertion of the transverse ligament.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.720
this is a rare but important finding in
the setting of Jefferson fracture

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.290
as it implies instability and explains
why this patient had a widened altantodens

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.910
distance of the lateral view.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.560
so unlike the vast majority of Jefferson's fractures which can be managed

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.150
conservatively with immobilization, this
patient may in fact require more

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.560
definitive surgical management.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.840
so there you have it, the Jefferson's fracture
of C1.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.740
you can find out more on our radiopaedia website where there are several other case

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.770
examples.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.899
and this case is featured in our radiopaedia iPad aap which can be found in the App Store.
