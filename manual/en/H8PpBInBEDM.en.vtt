Hi. This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.
Iâ€™m going to show you how to create a surreal,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.240
trippy, multi-directional portrait from a
face photographed in profile and the same

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.080
face photographed facing forward. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.080
For illustration purposes, I provided this face facing forward

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.250
and in profile, so you can follow along. Because
they're not for redistribution, I embedded

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.370
watermarks on them, but you can apply the
techniques that I'll be showing you to your

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.739
own photos. The first step is to make a selection
around your subject, so we can isolate the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.610
face from the background. There are many to
make selections, but for this example, I'll

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.540
use the Quick Selection Tool. I'll use a size
of 9 pixels and drag over the subject until

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.560
her face is completely selected. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.600
At the top, click the Refine Edge button or you can go to Select and Refine Edge.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.300
 I did an in-depth
tutorial on Refine Edge, so to save time,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.970
I won't be going over all the details here.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.120
Check "Smart Radius" and increase the Radius a little. 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.600
Brush over the hair 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.260
and output it as a New Layer with Layer Mask. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.320
Then, click OK. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.459
Notice, in the Layers panel, you now have
a new layer with a layer mask of the selection

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:48.459
next to it. Open the file of the subject facing
forward. Make a selection around the subject,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.860
refine its edge 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.840
and brush over the hair. 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.200
This time, save it as a "New Layer". 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.820
Make the bottom layer visible and active. 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.120
We'll fill it with
white. First, make sure your foreground and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.140
background colors are black and white, respectively.
If they aren't press "D" on your keyboard.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.620
Since the background color is white, press
Ctrl or Cmd + Delete. 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180
Open back up your subject's profile. 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.760
We need to place it into the "face
forward" document. Press "v" to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.160
open your Move Tool and drag the image onto
the profile's tab. Without releasing your

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.160
mouse or pen, press and hold Shift as you
drag it down on the image and release. Pressing

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.100
Shift kept this document centered. Drag the
top layer below the middle layer and drag

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.780
the layer mask next to the middle layer. 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.140
Temporarily hide the top layer by clicking off the eyeball next to it. 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.140
Click off the chain link between
the middle layer and the layer mask. This

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.650
will allow us to move and resize the layer
and/or the layer mask independently of each

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.330
other. Click the layer to make it active.
To resize and position the face, so the lips

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.270
are synced up with the lips of the profile,
open your Transform Tool by pressing Ctrl

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.430
or Cmd + T. First, go inside the Transform
and drag your image, so the lips are aligned

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.630
with the lips on the profile. To enlarge the
face, go to a corner and when you see a diagonal,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.870
double-arrow, press and hold Shift as you
drag the corner out. When the face is sized

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.010
and aligned to its profile counterpart, press
Enter or Return. 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.280
Next, we'll replace the face forward nose with nose from the profile. 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.220
If you look at it long enough, this creates a

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.560
mind-bending, optical illusion that melds two different perspectives of the same face. 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.080
Make the profile visible and active. 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.620
Click the Layer mask icon
to make a layer mask next to the profile.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.460
Invert the layer mask by pressing Ctrl or Cmd + I.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.200
Invert your foreground and background colors by pressing "x" on your keyboard.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.540
 Open your Brush Tool and open your Brush picker.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.220
I'll make the size of 90 pixels. The Hardness
is 0% and the Opacity and Flow are both 100%.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.420
Brush over the area to reveal the profile nose. 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.500
To mask out areas, press "x" to place black on your brush 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.760
and before you start brushing
again, make your brush smaller by pressing

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.090
the left bracket key on your keyboard. 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.200
This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV. 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.560
Thanks for watching!
