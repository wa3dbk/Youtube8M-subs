Hi my name is Dave Andrews and today I am
going to show you how to create an input box

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:18.199
in Excel VBA. Let's open up Excel by clicking
on the start button and going to all programs,

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:28.560
office, and Excel. Now we need to open up
the Excel VBA and to do that hold down the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.329
All key on your keyboard, press F11. This
opens up the VB editor and what we want to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.879
do is go to the top and select insert, select
user form. This pulls up the new form for

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.840
us to drop what are called controls on. The
control that we want is the text box and so

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.539
just grab the text box and just drag it right
there on to our form. Now that we have our

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.989
form created we need to have some way for
that form to be shown from Excel. So close

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:13.770
the VBA and insert some kind of object I'm
just going to say picture so find a picture

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.660
and there, there is our object that is going
to set off this user form. To cause it to

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.700
do so we want to right click on the picture
and say assign macro and now with the assigned

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:40.340
macro window say new which opens up our VBA
again and we want to say user form 1.show.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.270
Now we can close the VBA and click off of
that picture and now as you can see my hand,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.390
my little cursor is a hand and if I click
on that picture there is my user form and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:02.020
my info box. My name is Dave Andrews and I
have just showed you how to create an input

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.530
box using Excel VBA.
