00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.280
Hello and welcome to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.980
Day 10 of the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.510
DeFranco Nation Movie Club

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.030
today, yes I know

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.780
I'm wearing the same clothes as yesterday

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.430
it's disgusting

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.080
it is a laundry day

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.630
I just lied, no it's not

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.530
I'm just disgusting

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.740
and today we're going to watch the movie

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.160
The Prestige

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.280
because if you're not familiar with

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.230
the DeFranco Nation Movie Club

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.780
we're trying to watch a new movie

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.830
a day for 30 days

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.280
you do that a ton of ways

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.280
but the easiest way that

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.830
we're trying to do it is signing up via

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.380
netflix.com/phillyd

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.780
you get free 30 days

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.930
of instant streaming movies,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.880
get DVD's sent to you

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.820
it's a good time, and the reason

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.980
The Prestige is interesting

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.730
is because it's another

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.730
Christopher Nolan movie,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.730
which is the second

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.700
in the first string of movies.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.680
You guys are addicts

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.980
but you've also turned me into

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.080
a very big Christopher Nolan fan,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.680
last movie we watched from him of course was

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.260
Memento

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.780
and the description of the movie is: 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.380
At the dawn of the 20th century,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.280
rival magicians

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.080
Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman)

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.080
you're welcome ladies

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.280
and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale)

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.330
yeah...

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.980
endeavor to reveal each other's secrets. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.610
Obsessed by the escalating competition,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.680
the two illusionists begin to

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.280
perform increasingly risky tricks,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.560
which soon turn deadly.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.430
Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.230
also star in this taut psychological thriller

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.980
from director Christopher Nolan.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.730
so it sounds good,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660
my DVD has arrived in the mail yesterday

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.680
so that's how I'm going to watch,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.980
like I said there are tons of ways to watch it,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.750
which is what I'm going to do,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.880
while you watch the 15 seconds trailer clip

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.930
and then we'll meet back in the middle

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.760
We're back!

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.440
The Prestige

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.230
shortly put,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.680
an amazing, a fucking amazing movie

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.630
the acting,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.580
the sound,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.480
the story,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.980
just everything is amazing

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.430
it's a beautifully,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.180
well put together story,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.680
it's a very mysterious story, 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.710
that even just leaves you puzzled 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.470
the entire time, 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.780
so let's kind of just break down the story

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.330
without going into crazy amounts of detail

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.090
until later

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.110
when we spoil it for people.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.360
Starts off with the two magicians

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.480
Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.780
they start off together

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.630
working together and there's a rivalry 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.550
that magicians have

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.560
and so it's there,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.360
it's there naturally

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.060
until Christian Bale

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.880
silly goose,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.980
accidently kills Hugh Jackman's wife, whoopsy

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.530
this is a rollercoaster of events

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.610
of them fucking up each other shows

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.210
Christian Bale getting shot in the hand,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.200
a lot drama,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.230
ladies calm down, so much drama,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.980
but then things start looking good for Christian Bale

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.380
he meets a girl, they have a baby,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.180
and he invents this amazing trick called

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.080
The Transported Man

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.310
where he enters a door and  almost instantly

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.400
exits a door on the opposite side of the stage

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.150
looking like he instantly transported,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.830
so this makes Hugh Jackman insane

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.180
he goes to almost every show

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.330
and he's like "How's he doing it?!" 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.980
and so he decides to do his own version

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.280
called The New Transported Man

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.530
but because he doesn't know the trick,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.680
he uses a stunt body,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.080
which is just a dude that looks like him, 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.260
which lucky for him,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
is an alcoholic

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.530
and he gets a new show girl

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.530
Scarlett Johansson

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.280
which is a good time

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.980
and his show has amazing success

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.230
because he's a better showmen

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.310
than Christian Bale.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.130
Then Hugh Jackman

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.480
because he's a sexy man,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.730
starts having this sexy time 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.530
with Scarlett Johansson

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.330
that's a good deal,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.680
but it's not enough for him

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.480
because he wants to know

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.280
how you do the trick

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.480
because his verison of the trick

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.780
he doesn't get to do the bow

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.960
he doesn't get to do the prestige

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.980
he's by himself under the stage

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.180
and so because he can not be content

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.000
with what he has,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.030
he sends Scarlett Johansson

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.680
over to Christian Bale,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.460
who's actually

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.330
he's a nice guy when he's not screaming at you

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.600
because you're fucking up his lights,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.640
and so they fall in love

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.760
and they get together

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.680
which isn't a good thing

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.580
because like I said before, 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.260
he has a wife, 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.280
then things go back and forth,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.630
they keep fucking each other over,

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.430
I'm going to skip certain parts of the movie for you,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.300
Hugh Jackman comes out

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.780
with the "real Transported Man"

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.430
it's his last show and it's amazing

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.430
he enters this machine 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.860
that was made by Tesla,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.930
who of course spent most of his life

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.530
trying to control AC, alternating current

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.680
and then almost instantly 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.230
he's like 500 yards away

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.160
taking his bow,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.580
and this makes Christian Bale insane, 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.130
and so then we're just going to spoil the movie

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.750
so spoilers for the next 20 seconds

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.680
skip ahead to the annotation here

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.330
that'll be when the spoiler has stopped

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.340
so turns out that

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.230
Tesla's machine actually makes clones,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.980
and Hugh Jackman is cloning himself,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.360
going through the trap door,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.590
landing in a water tank

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.430
and letting himself die

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.550
and then the cloned version  

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.380
was over there,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.680
and so literally on each show,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.480
he would have to kill himself

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.430
which is also how he tricks

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.280
the government into thinking that

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.580
Christian Bale killed him

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.580
which puts Christian Bale's character

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.880
on trial and then ultimately he hangs for it

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.950
but Christian Bale ain't going down like that

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.030
and it turns out, Christian Bale was able to do the trick

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.100
because he had a twin brother no one ever knew about

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.430
he was the most dedicated magician of all time

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.060
and so Christian Bale or his tiwn

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.430
finds Hugh Jackman, shoots him, kills him,

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.780
he gets his baby girl back,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.480
because Hugh Jackman 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.380
was going to be an asshole

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.780
and take his girl from him, his daughter.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.130
and they go off into the sunset, 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.980
also Christian Bale's wife killed herself

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.530
and Scarlett Johansson left, if that's notable

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.280
and we're back,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.110
to all the people that didn't want to see the spoiler

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.860
aliens right?

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.280
I'm joking, 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.080
ultimately it is a story about

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.030
how passion, competition,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.630
and obsession will drive change,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.080
will drive innovation

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.030
but at the same,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.230
it can and will destroy you

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.230
without flinching,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.160
because it can overwelm a person,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.230
because a human being is just that, 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.810
a human being,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.430
and we are good, we are evil,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.830
and this movie was just phemoninal

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.780
so thank you once again to you guys 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.880
who recommended this movie

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.940
you have made me a very very big

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.980
Christopher Nolan fan

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.130
of course in the comments down below, 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.000
do two things, 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.310
one: let me know what you thought of this movie, 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.830
what it meant for you, et cetera

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.830
and of course let us know 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.080
what movies you would like us

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.430
to add to the Netflix queue,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.630
because that's how we've adding them 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.680
each and every time

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.630
even though you guys set us up with The Prestige, 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.730
which isn't available on Netflix instant queue

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.980
so that's your fault, not mine. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.180
but guys of course we are moving on

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.830
to a very different movie, 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.480
Samuel L. Jackson is back with
