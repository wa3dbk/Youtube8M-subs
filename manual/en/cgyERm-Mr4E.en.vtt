00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.700
Did you know that when setting up Windows
XP the quick format option actually doesn't

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.610
do anything bad and saves you a heck of a
lot of time on modern drives? I'm Dan Afonso

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.330
from Afonso Consulting and Enfold IT, and
this is how to install Windows XP. Now, I'm

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.289
just going to tell you straight out, this
is a fairly straightforward process, if you've

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.960
got standard hardware, any consumer hardware
really. It's not really going to be a problem

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.300
for you. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go through the installation. I'm doing

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.910
it in VMware because bringing in additional
hardware to do it is actually kind of difficult

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.450
so we're just going to do this virtual. The
only difference between this and what you're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.260
going to do is there's no CD station. So,
I've already put the CD in the drive and we're

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.601
going to start up the machine. Now the first
thing you're going to notice is, besides the

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:53.960
machine booting, is that it's going to pause
here inside its loading windows. If you already

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.370
had an operating system on a machine it would
ask you to push a button in order to boot.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.859
It's also asking to push F two, F two for
automated system recovery and F six for additional

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:12.179
drivers. Automated system recovery is if you
break your machine and have an automated system

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:17.939
recovery disk. The F six is far more important
to this. If you have an obscure raid driver,

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
if you have you know some sort of you know
raid zero if you're a hyper gaming machine,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.400
you're probably going to need to hit F six
and pop in the floppy disk. Yes, a floppy

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.210
disk. If you don't want to make a floppy disk
you'll have to make a custom boot CD for Windows

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.649
XP. We're not going to cover that here. We're
just going to move on. The first thing Windows

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.749
is going to do is it's going to initialize
itself. It's an informational screen that

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:44.479
lets you know if you want to repair, setup
or whatnot. In this case we're just going

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.859
to setup, so we're hitting enter. In user
license agreement you have to accept it in

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.700
order to continue on. Now this is a disk partitioning
portion, if you want to use the whole drive,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.740
the C drive, and I highly recommend you do
this, unless you're going to dual boot or

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.889
have some sort of other partitioning scheme
in mind, just hit enter and it'll use a default.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:10.860
If you need to partition what you would do
is you would push - you would push C. And

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.920
just - for create a partition. And then you
could type in how much you want and you know

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.051
make multiple partitions and whatnot, then
select them from the list, so for this case,

00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:25.230
sure, we'll make a seven gig partition and
then I'll create another partition over here

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.670
just to show you in general, you have really
no need to do this. So create this and we'll

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.530
use the quick format NTFS, because it's significantly
better. It's going to format now. So once

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.450
it's done copying all those files, it's going
to reboot the machine into the graphical portion.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.879
It's after a good long while you're going
to get to the regional language options screen.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.099
If you need to change your language, your
input method or anything like that you could

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.450
customize that, but for most people this is
going to be the normal, hit next. Type in

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.379
your name, and your organization. Hit next.
Now you're going to give your product key,

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.560
for obvious reasons I'm not going to type
in mine on camera, but we'll just type that

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.870
in and go to the next screen. All right, the
next screen you get to name your machine.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:26.489
And I'm going to name mine Bob. Bob is a good
name. And you can set your administrator password.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.299
And anything you want, you should probably
make this something reasonably secure like

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:41.129
not password. The next screen, just wants
to know date, time and most importantly the

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.541
time zone. Now you don't really have to set
the date and time here, we'll figure that

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:49.510
out once it connects up to the internet. But
your time zone is important, so set that,

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.980
hit next. Here on in it's going to configure
your network, it's going to ask you whether

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.780
you want to do this customized, default, why
don't you just pick typical, it'll get you

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.620
going for now. If you need to change something,
do that later. Most people won't need to change

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.200
anything. And finally your work group. If
you have set up a work group in house, feel

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.269
free to use it, if you haven't the default
is fine. And from here on in, it's just going

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.010
to finish the installation. Once it comes
up, all you really need to do is run Windows

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.490
update, it'll start doing this in the background,
automatically. Let it finish, you should be

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.730
all set from there. This has been how to install
Windows XP and I'm Dan Afonso of Enfold IT

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.770
and Afonso Consulting. Enjoy.
