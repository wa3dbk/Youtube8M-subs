00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.880
Pause at any street corner to enjoy a vivid
slice of Neapolitan life.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:13.689
And don't forget to look up. With no yards,
families make full use of their tiny balconies.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.260
Roberta: This is Basso living.
Rick: Basso living, what does that mean Basso?

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.660
Roberta: It can mean low.
Rick: So literally low.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.820
Roberta: Yeah, it's like a small apartment,
2, 3 bedrooms, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 people join

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.030
the family.
Rick: Okay the traditional sort of romantic

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.960
life in the streets?
Roberta: Life in the streets, yeah. 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.440
Many people might have money to go away from here but they still stay here.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.379
No taste of Naples is complete without a pizza.
Antica Pizzeria da Michele is a favorite.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.600
Baking in just the right combination of fresh
dough, mozzarella, and tomatoes in traditional

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.750
wood-burning ovens, this restaurant is considered
by many the birthplace of pizza. They brag

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.450
it takes several years of practice to get the dough 
just right. Catering to pizza purists, the menu

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.430
is brief...just two kinds: marinara comes with 
tomato sauce, oregano, and garlic, no cheese.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.000
Margherita celebrates the unification of Italy. 
Named after the first Italian queen,

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.229
it comes with the colors of the Italian flag:
red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese, and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.869
a garnish of green basil.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.540
Italians who come to the States are not 
impressed by thick and fancy pizzas.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.700
Judging from the enthusiasm of those 
munching these hot and tasty pies,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.770
what really matters is not the
quantity of ingredients but the quality.
