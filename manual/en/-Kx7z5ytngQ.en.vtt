Ok, so we just finished painting our ceiling.
We're going to give that a couple hours to

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.090
dry and in the meantime, we're going to do
some prep work on the walls. When you're dealing

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.260
with plaster, we got a couple nails here that
we got to pull out. Usually just takes a pair

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:23.239
of pliers just like that. Now when you're
dealing with plaster, you pull a nail out

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.859
like that, a lot of times you're going to
bring some plaster with it. Leaves kind of

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:37.040
a bit of a pimple there. So what I'm going
to do is give it a light sanding. You can

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:58.040
use like a 150, 120, 100 grit paper. I'm using
150 in this case. Just very lightly sand it.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:17.820
So now we're going to go ahead and patch those
holes. Now we're going to use a different

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:30.560
patching material than we used on the ceiling.
That was a joint compound and this stuff is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.591
a little bit heavier duty and the nice thing
about it is it sets up and dries within a

00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:55.789
couple of hours so we don't have to wait all
night. Anywhere you see a hole, just go over

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:03.090
it really smoothly. Don't worry if its a little
chunky because we're going to sand it after

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:20.280
its dry.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.610
Ok, I think I got most of them. We're going
to let that dry, should be an hour at least

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.520
and in the meantime we'll move on to something
else.
