Hi everybody! Malik the magic guy for expertvillage.com.
Now another cool self-working trick and this

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.889
one I like because you could borrow a deck
and do this from a shuffled deck of cards.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.880
What I am going to do is remove some of the
cork cards from the deck; actually, all the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.700
cork cards from the deck. Let me take these
out for you real quick so you can see them

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:31.840
coming out. There is all the Jacks, Queens,
Kings are going to come out of the deck and

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.680
there is 2 more right there. Now I am going
to separate them so that no 2 cards are the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.980
same color and value are together so I am
actually going to do this to myself. This

00:00:45.980 --> 00:01:02.960
is kind of a secret of the trick here.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:12.729
I am going to show you in a second that these
have no 2 pair of cards next to each other.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:22.670
So there is 12 cork cards in the deck, that
makes 6 pairs of cards so there is that pair

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:39.280
because he is different, there is 2, 3, 4,
5 and 6. Now if we put the cards on the top

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.990
of the deck, give it a little snap and little
shake, all the cork cards are going to pair

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:58.970
up. Now the 2 red Jacks are together, the
2 red Kings, the 2 Black Jacks, the 2 Red

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.900
Queens, and the 2 Black Kings. All the cork
cards have paired themselves up and that is

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.409
an easy, almost self working trick. I am going
to show you how to do that one in just a moment.
