00:01
KATJA: Life does not stop when you're pregnant

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.700
and its not an illness.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.990
00:12
COMM: Most women would say pregnancy is the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.160
time to take it easy, but not Kat Harjanne,
the weight lifting fanatic from Brighton,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.250
continues to lit 100 kilograms weights despite
being less than 2 months from her due date

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.380
00:26
KATJA: When I first fell pregnant I was a

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.680
little but worried that I might not be able
to exercise but I then looked into it and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.020
researched online so I found out that a lot
of positives about exercising pregnancy.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.170
00:39
COMM: 39 year old Kat is a dedicated follower

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.690
of cross fit which combines weight lifting,
cardio training and gymnastics and being pregnant

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.530
doesn't disrupt her grueling routine.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.789
00:53
KATJA: It is quite funny that at work i'm

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.750
not allowed to lift a box of paperwork but
at gym I can lift or dead lift 100 kilos off

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.760
the floor.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.960
I train about 4/5 times a week and I feel
absolutely fantastic.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.770
my energy levels have kept up and its helped
me throughout the whole pregnancy.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.000
I literally continued living as normal um
and also hopefully for the birth itself it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.720
will be quite easy, fingers crossed.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.320
01:23
COMM: Despite controversy surrounding pregnancy

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.409
and heavy exercise Kat's fiancee Jason is
her number 1 supporter

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.470
01:31
JASON: I'm very proud of Kat, she's really

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.860
showed determination and how women can actually
achieve certain physical goals even thought

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.440
they are pregnant, so um I hope she is an
inspiration to other would be mothers that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.220
they can still carry on exercising and looking
good.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.570
I cant wait to become a father and you know
just feeling the baby move and seeing how

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.370
happy Kat has been I cant wait to see the
smile on Kat's face looking into the baby's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.890
eyes and yeah and start getting this family
rolling.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.329
02:01
COMM: Kat insists that she's never put her

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.960
baby or herself at risk despite little being
known about cross fit and pregnancy.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.690
02:10
KATJA: I've spoken to the mid wife and I've

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.260
told her that I do cross fit and asked if
I should stop or change anything and she so

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.670
far told me that if I feel fine then thats
all good to continue, so the last 9/10 weeks

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.130
that I have left I'm going to very much listen
to my body and see who I feel everyday and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.410
just literally reduce or scale down any of
the weight or the movements if need be just

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.041
to make sure it is safe for me and the baby

00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.640
02:37
COMM: And when she's not lifting weights,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.860
Kat is just like any other mum to be, looking
forward to welcoming her baby

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.150
02:44
KATJA: The exercise helps me to be a bit more

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.480
in control but however the whole labour is
very much unknown so obviously there's a huge

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.209
question mark and a little but scared, anxious,
nervous, excited about the whole thing because

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.890
the getting to meet the little bump you've
been carrying for 9 months its probably the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.040
most amazing thing in the life.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:35.950
I'm hoping that I can continue lifting weights
at near to the end but I take everyday as

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.760
it comes.
