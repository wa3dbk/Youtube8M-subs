Hi I'm Diana Korten and I'm here today with
Helen to talk about flea control and prevention.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.969
Basically the first thing you want to do is
if your cat is infested with fleas the very

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.100
first thing you are going to want to do is
give him a bath with a flea prevention shampoo.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.960
I like to use one that is natural that doesn't
contain any carcinogens or toxins because

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.160
what we are going to do is we are going to
bath her and then we are going to let the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.469
shampoo soak in and actually kill the fleas.
I prefer to do a cat bath in the kitchen sink

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.700
because I feel like you have more control.
You can use a sprayer too, just make sure

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:51.079
the water is not cold.
So we are going to get the fur, she has real

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.010
thick fur so we are going to get that nice
and wet, let the water really saturate the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.239
fur. The thing that you want to think about
too is that the fleas aren't just living on

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.970
the cat, the fleas are living all around your
house and if your cat just has a couple of

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.650
fleas you can just go right to step two and
use the Advantage but if they have a real

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.260
flea infestation and you are having a problem
in your home you are not only going to want

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.510
to do this bathing treatment on the cat as
well as steps two and three, you're also going

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.110
to want to take care of the whole house and
that means if you have carpet, using a product

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.521
that will get into the carpet and possibly
having a professional cleaning because you

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:35.530
have to remember those fleas leave eggs behind
and they have about a three week life cycle

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.280
and if you don't take care of everything you
are going to have another round of fleas because

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.020
just treating the cat isn't going to be enough
to get rid of the entire problem. So I'm just

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.830
applying some flea shampoo here. I'm going
to drain the thing here so we can get this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.120
flea shampoo really well into her fur. You
want to be sure and concentrate it around

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.030
the neck and other areas where the fleas really
like. You want to be very careful about not

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.620
getting the shampoo in her face, get it around
the neck here, oh that's such a good kitty.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.469
So thats carpet with floors you are going
to want to vacuum and if you have a vacuum

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:25.700
cleaner bag you can put that bag in the freezer
before you throw the bag out because the freezer

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.370
will kill the eggs and the fleas. Now that
she is all soaped up we are going to go ahead

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.469
and put her in the cat carrier for ten minutes
and let that flea shampoo do its job. What

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:47.560
I like to do is go ahead and cover the carrier
with a towel to keep it warmer in there and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.060
keep her feeling secure. Now once the cat
is dry you are going to want to do some longer

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.900
term flea prevention by using a product like
The Revolution, The Advantage or Front Line.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.709
All of these are really excellent products
and what you want to do is take the tube,

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.040
they call come in different packaging. You
are going to break the tube open and then

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.540
pour the medicine right here, the flea control
product right here on the back of the neck.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.760
The idea is that the cat can't lick it then.
It's not toxic to the cat but you certainly

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.230
don't want the cat to be digesting it all.
However, if your cat is going in and outside,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.249
since it does take about 24 hours for the
product to kill the fleas, you may need to

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:36.730
do a little bit of maintenance and for that
we have flea comb and what I like to do with

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:45.129
this is pour a little bit of dish soap in
a dish with some warm water and you want it

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.939
to be kind of sudsy. What you are going to
do is you are going to flea comb the cat so

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.269
you are going to take this comb and you are
going to run it right through the fur right

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.720
against the skin and the idea of the flea
comb is that if the cat has any fleas they'll

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.870
get caught in between the tines of the comb
and then what you would do to drawn them is

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.940
dip them in the soapy water. Water alone will
not kill them. They won't drown in just water

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.469
but if you put them in soapy water then they
will drown.
