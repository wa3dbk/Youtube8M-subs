"Heart of Gold: Turmeric vs. Exercise"

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.370
The endothelium is the inner
lining of our blood vessels.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.650
Laid end-to-end the endothelial
cells from a single human

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.840
would wrap more than four
times around the world.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.670
And it's not just like an inert layer;
it's highly metabolically active.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.100
I've talked about how sensitive
our endothelium is

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.250
to oxidation and inflammation.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.980
And if we don't take care of it
endothelial dysfunction may set us up

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.399
for heart disease or a stroke.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.600
Are we ready to heed our endothelium's
early warning signal?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.010
Well, if it's all about oxidation
and inflammation,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.500
then fruits and vegetables should
help. And indeed they do.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.660
Each daily serving of fruits or vegetables

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.989
was associated with a 6% improvement
in endothelial function.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.170
Now these fruit and vegetable-associated
improvements in endothelial function

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.399
are in contrast with several
negative vitamin C pill studies

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.530
that failed to show a benefit.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.490
It can be concluded that the positive
findings of the fruit and vegetable study

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.340
is not just because of any one
nutrient in fruits and veggies.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420
Rather than searching for the
single magic bullet micronutrient,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.420
a more practical approach is
likely to consider whole foods.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.049
Thus, increasing fruit and
vegetable consumption

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200
is likely to have numerous
beneficial effects

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.049
due to synergistic effects of all
the wonderful things in plants.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.520
Exercise helps too, but what
type of exercise helps best?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.659
Patients were randomized
into four groups:

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.579
aerobic exercise (cycling
for an hour a day),

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.740
resistance training (using weights
and elastic bands), both, or neither.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.939
The aerobic group kicked butt.
The resistance group kicked butt.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.340
And the aerobic and resistance
group kicked butt as well,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.329
compared to those who
sat on their butts.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.149
Note that your endothelium doesn't care
if you're on a bike or lifting weights,

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.640
as long as you're getting
physical activity.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.650
And getting regular activity.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.349
If you stop exercising, your
endothelial function plummets.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.849
Antioxidant pills didn't work.
What about anti-inflammatory pills?

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.579
Drug companies aren't going
to give up that easy.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.250
After all, there's only so much
you can make selling salad.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.860
For those who prefer plants to pills,
one of the most anti-inflammatory foods

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.980
is the spice turmeric.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.019
Researchers in Japan recently compared
the endothelial benefits of exercise

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.129
to that of curcumin, the yellow pigment
in turmeric and curry powder.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.189
About a teaspoon a day's worth
of turmeric for eight weeks

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.629
compared to 30 to 60 minutes
of aerobic exercise a day.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.969
Which group improved their
endothelial function more?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.310
The group that did neither
experienced no benefit,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.310
but the exercise group significantly
boosted their endothelial function,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.400
and so did the curcumin group.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.269
The magnitude of the improvement
achieved by curcumin treatment

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.989
was comparable to that
obtained with exercise.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.379
Therefore, regular
ingestion of curcumin

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.709
could be a preventive measure

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.109
against cardiovascular disease
in postmenopausal women.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.959
Furthermore, their results suggest
that curcumin may be

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.329
a potential alternative treatment
for patients who are unable to exercise,

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.109
but ideally we'd do both.

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.010
In this study they looked at
central arterial hemodynamics.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.999
Basically, if our endothelium is
impaired, our arteries stiffen,

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.159
making it harder for
our heart to pump.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.269
But compared to
placebo, we can drop

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.590
that pressure down with
turmeric curcumin or exercise,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.680
but if you combine both, then
you really start rocking and rolling.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.249
They conclude that these findings suggest
that regular endurance exercise

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.989
combined with daily curcumin ingestion

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.359
may reduce the pressure against
which your heart has to fight

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.079
to a greater extent than
one or the other.

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.000
So healthy eating and exertion
for our endothelium.
