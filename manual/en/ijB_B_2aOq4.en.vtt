hi this is kelsey mays for cars.com and
one in 2008 ford fusion looking at

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.530
ford's new sink system now Ford
partnered with Microsoft make the sync

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.160
voice recognition technology which will
be available in most bored lincoln and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.480
mercury vehicles by 2010 and the system
starts with the USB plug your ipod or

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.220
zune or any other mp3 player

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.580
there's also an auxiliary jack in case
you don't have a USB port most in car

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.599
audio systems have one of those these
days to infusion this actually goes in

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.039
the center console through the USB port
goes and if you have an auxiliary jack

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.040
is where that would go to start by
pressing the button on the steering

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.970
wheel

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:51.380
name please say a command USB USB and
there you go it will pick up right where

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.260
you last left off when you left your mp3
player running

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.860
I think indexes all the songs on your
mp3 player and so within a few minutes

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.890
you should be able to say any artist
track or out let's give it a try

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.680
USB please say a command okay artists

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.520
Foo Fighters well playing artist who
fighters

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.870
have been searching for the play opens
within an artist for example on the foo

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.290
fighters on my ipod i have six albums
but i can't remember the names of most

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.940
of them by just pressing this button and
saying we're fine album now sometimes it

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.850
won't work and that's probably because
you need to go on to your computer and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.140
change the settings in the album's to
get them to show up in the indexing but

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.610
that's the idea behind it

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.990
you can also set the songs to shuffle if
you like well you asked me

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:48.190
please say a command shuffle on chef
Ilan and you can turn shuffle off USB

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:56.740
please say a command shuffle off shuffle
along or you ask me

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.050
please say a command shuffle off shuffle
own

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.649
all right well that's why they make
shortcut buttons now if your software

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.039
mp3's are completely updated so it can
be a little bit frustrating

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.400
try as I might I couldn't get my ipod to
start playing songs when I got back into

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.820
the car unless i press the button on the
steering wheel waited for the audio time

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.989
from sink and then said USB anything can
and USB sync engineer Jeff astrouski

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.280
said that was likely because my ipod had
outdated firmware and the properly

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.860
updated devices should play songs right
away

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.910
what's more a number of songs on my ipod
are apparently missing metadata and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.030
that's all those electronic tags that
store everything from genre to album

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.230
title for each mp3 Ford spokesman allen
hall told me that song from legitimate

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.299
sources like itunes or purchase CD
usually have all this data embedded and

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.630
that allows them to easily categorize
all the songs but without such

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.390
information many songs won't show up on
request

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.390
I found this out the hard way play album
abbey road

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.820
well playing all the men rod other than
I have plenty of music from shared

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.880
sources are downloaded during the
napster days but soda countless other

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.300
drivers and having such songs go missing
can be quite frustrating

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.750
one other point worth noting is that the
novelty of saying stuff sort of wears

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.480
off after a while i've been using the
system for a week and I have to admit

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.480
that I've kind of feel like an idiot
every time getting into the car having

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.930
to press a button and saying USB you
have to do that because it kind of puts

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.420
your the whole system on standby
whenever you get out of the car and come

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.080
back in

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.810
we called sing customer support and they
told us that there really wasn't any

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.160
other way to do it

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.340
there's no sort of stealth mode you can
just press a button and start things up

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.090
again you do have to say USB every time
you get in if you got with your friends

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.090
a lot they might start making money for
having to do that

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.670
