Whitney Hawkins "My mom's a middle school
language teacher, which I think has got to

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.630
be one of the toughest professions in the
country, and watching her work with her students

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.779
over my childhood and now as a college student
really inspired me to go into teaching. I'm

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.050
a science major, and I see a huge need for
teachers of science in our school system,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.820
and so I just what to do what I can to try
and be there to help fill that gap."

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.940
Holly Copper "...The opportunity to touch
students' lives, to instill in them a love

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.200
for learning, and the desire to become lifelong
learners, is really special and important

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200
to me."

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.840
Chad O'Hara "I'd like to become a teacher
for kind of some of the clichÃ© reasons,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.840
I'd like to make a difference, and teaching
is one of the careers where I know that can

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.840
be done...."

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.260
Shenae Neal and Shanea Neal "I've been dissatisfied
with with a lot of the teachers I've had,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.450
so I decided instead of complaining about
it, I would do something about it, so I should

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.000
become a teacher. I should act instead of
sitting here observing."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.940
"I'd like to be a teacher because I've always
had this love of language, and I'm going to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.400
be an English teacher. And I've always wanted
to impart that on other people, I want them

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.750
to love English as much as I do.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.830
Laura Stocke "I wanted to be a teacher for
a very long time. I was actually in the school

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.130
of engineering, studying to be a chemical
engineer for about two years. While tutoring

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.099
at elementary and middle schools in Charlottesville,
and I just discovered a love and passion for

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:39.190
kids and teaching so I transferred out of
the engineering school into the education

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.190
and decided to teach."

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.530
Coro Wilbur "I think the reason that I want
to be a teacher is mostly the teachers that

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.360
I have had growing up, they were the largest
influence in my life. I got to come to this

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.060
amazing school and become the person that
I am because of them, and I think the greatest

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.189
thing that I can do is sort of return that
favor to someone else."
