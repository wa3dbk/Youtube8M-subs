00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.560
jay is going to take us through the final
touches of our kitchen and that means

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.309
getting the shelves back inside as well
as adjusting doors and drawer fronts jay

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.660
how do we do that

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.369
well in our wall cabinets being
standard construction

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.379
comes with a half inchthick wall shelf if
this was select or ply select the shelf

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:29.869
would be three-quarters of an inch thick
being a double door cabinet we also have

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.539
a center mullion strip for extra
support and there is an additional

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.570
shelf clip located on the back of that

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.309
we also have six way adjustable hinges
on the full overlay doors

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.529
and we can now show you how to adjust
those in-and-out up and down and side

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:51.340
to side so you get complete level on the
doors throughout the kitchen

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.600
the first screw on your hinge

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.900
will allow from the in-and-out location
from the face of the cabinet

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.320
the second screw here

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.480
will allow for the up-and-down location
moving the door from top to bottom on the face

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.310
frame

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.110
the final screw will allow the opening
and closing

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.000
shortening the distance between
the doors of your cabinet

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.820
this allows for properly aligning all the
doors on a finished cabinet

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.190
with reinstalling the drawer box you may
notice at first that it is a

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.600
little tight

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.779
all you have to do

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:35.900
is open and shut the drawer a couple times
and it will self correct itself

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.130
there may be some unfortunate
circumstances that cause you to require

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.210
a touch up kit

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.970
to deal with minor nicks and scratches on
your cabinets

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.170
for that reason we highly recommend

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.010
that you purchase a touch of kit

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.610
in that kit you'll find that we include a
crayon as well as a touch up marker

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.060
so you can take care of those nicks and
scratches

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.970
jay is going to demonstrate how to do that

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.759
the wax crayon can be applied to
any minor nick or scratch

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.979
in the material simply apply it and you
can rub your hand through it to blend it in

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.919
almost acting as a wood putting but it
is the same color finish of our product

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.280
the finish marker

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.709
simply take this shake it to activate it

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.159
draw on a piece of scrap wood or paper to allow the liquid to flow out

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.089
then you can touch up any voids in your finish

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:29.800

installation video

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.990

points of cabinet installation

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.030
cutting and installing moulding and trim and even dealing with the decorative

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.840
aspects of kitchen cabinetry

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.149
will help you in the future

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:44.279
