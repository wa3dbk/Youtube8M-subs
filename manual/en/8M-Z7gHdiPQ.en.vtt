00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The artist had to create this picture in

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.333
complete darkness. It’s a

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:17.334
photogram, the earliest photographic process.

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:21.100
He’s fumbling in the dark, that’s exactly what we do

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.800
when we fall in love. He bought rabbits from a farmer who raised rabbits for meat.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.100
He brought them home and very carefully removed their

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.467
guts. He laid out a huge sheet

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:40.000
of color photographic paper, and then in the dark

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.233
placed the rabbits onto the paper. He was doing this purely by touch. Then he exposed them to a

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:51.000
quick,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.367
bright flash

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:57.333
of light. It was only at the very end of the process, when he unrolled the developed paper that he

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:07.667
saw, for the first time, what he had created. And there’s something so magical about that. You get this

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.000
sensual explosion of color. And it’s

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.100
something that you can’t completely control

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
and you can’t completely predict. When he made this piece,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.367
the artist, Adam Fuss, was going through a period of romantic turmoil.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:29.433
He’s using this very traditional symbolism of fertility, of innocence,

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:34.600
and sacrifice. It’s a picture about love and the things that

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.800
happen to us when we open ourselves up and become

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.367
literally entangled with another person. It’s an emblem of suffering.

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:49.934
When you are truly in love and then you lose it, you feel like you’re

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:53.200
being emptied out, like you’re being eviscerated, and that’s,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.233
that’s the feeling that he

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.700
captures in this image.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.967
The photogram process

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:15.400
is like love: not knowing where you’re headed or what your

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.900
ultimate connection is going to be, and then having it

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.200
revealed to you in a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.934
bright, sudden

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:27.367
flash. That’s what a great work of art does: it turns this

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:31.667
mass of feelings into a concrete,

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:42.800
visible form that can speak directly to each individual looking at it.
