00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.390
At Laughing Dog Farm, heirloom tomatoes are
one of the most amazing crops that we grow.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.580
We've been thrilled by the heritage, and the
flavors, and the histories, in each and every

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.669
one. In the last 10 years we've trailed over
200 varieties. Of course, now we're only growing

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:23.710
about 20. And each and every variety has traits
and qualities that we want to hold onto and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.499
exploit to the max. So early in the year,
I grow my special varieties, each variety,

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:38.070
one pot per variety; try to keep them labeled.
This is a black brandy wine. Now a lot of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.870
people have heard of the brandy wine, but
not too many people have grown black brandy

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.080
wine. It's pointless for me to why it's poetic,
about black brandy wine, you're just going

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.140
to have try it yourself, it's amazing. And
you can see, in this one pot, I might have

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.140
150 plants, and that's a lot of plants. So
what are we going to do with all those valuable

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.410
plants? Well, we're going to start peeling
them away, and finding them homes. Right now

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.100
I have more than I can work with. So I'm going
to take this clump, and tuck it right back

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:17.590
in its home for future development, and I'm
going to work with this clump. And of those

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.799
black brandy wines, I want to advance some
of these recruits here to a higher level,

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:33.749
so we're going to use these six packs, and
our freshly mixed compost rich potting soil.

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:39.390
Notice that I'm not too worried if two go
in the pot, don't go in the cell at once,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.280
two is fine, because they can be dealt with
later. But the transplant will stimulate their

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.259
roots, and they will get going, and their
growth curve will pick right up, and that's

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:59.049
what we want, is at least a few pioneers to
lead the charge into the 08 tomato season.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.749
There you have it folks, black brandy wine
