00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.220
8:52 is the time.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.300
Are you looking to decorate the guest room
or your bathroom in your home?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.160
Before you do, we have something just for
you.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.910
Very creative towel folding.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.161
Not only is it a unique way to display your
towels, but it can be a craft for you and

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.660
your kids when your on your mid winter break
and bored out of your gourd.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.430
Joining us this morning to show us how is
John Pullum.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.760
He’s the creator of a new towel folding
video.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.800
Who knew there was such a thing?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.210
But how did you get into towel origami?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.730
Well, actually I’ve seen it on cruise ships
and what have you and I tried to find books

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.910
on it and just a couple of pictures in books
and a lot of text, I’m more of a visual

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.910
person.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.969
and there were no DVD’s or videos on it.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.620
My background in TV I thought, produce one!

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.390
So, I did in 2 Volumes.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.350
So, this is the kind of thing that you see
in the up scale hotels and cruise ships and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.999
things like that and brought it to life.Yeah,
and the kids love it, you know if you have

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.649
a kid that doesn’t want to take a bath,
if you say, hey, there’s going to be a towel

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:57.829
creation when you get out.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:58.829
It’s just great.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.390
And my kids once again, love it and I’ve
had a lot of orders on the website from hotels

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.500
and different people that were in cruise ships
and once again, its just a great thing to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.360
do on this mid-winter break and the kids are
going crazy when its too cold to go outside.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.840
It looks a little intimidating to me.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.530
I’m not the very crafty type.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.720
So show us, show us that it is not that hard.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.580
It’s not difficult and there’s no pins,
there’s no Velcro needed and actually these

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.580
are just regular towels.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.990
I’m going to show you a very simple one
because we don’t have a lot of time.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.850
One bath towel, you fold it to about the half
way mark, just like that and have it pretty

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.850
even.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.500
This side, you fold it over, just like so
and you’re probably about 3 or 4 inches

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.090
over the half way mark.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.250
You want to fold it into thirds.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.090
So what I usually do, I grab it here and pull
it up, so it’s almost like a Z type shape.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.030
Now this is the way you fold a dress shirt
and once again nice displaying towels.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.680
These aren’t towels to take home, these
are just, you know like a fancy napkin at

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.710
a restaurant.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.800
You know it took them a little bit of time
and they put that extra touch on there.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.480
So, all you have to do, is fold this down,
on an angle, just like collar.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.480
OK.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.100
You fold that down on an angle.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.119
So you basically have the collar of the shirt.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.010
You can then get a couple of mints (laughing)
or buttons I you prefer.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.010
Right.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.010
That’s nice.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.280
I just wasn’t sure that he studio lights
would be too hot for this mints.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.280
Nah!

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.939
And you can get a little PostIt note tag.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.590
For the shirt collar like the tag.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.939
This one says hello Julie, Alisa, Jonathan
&amp; Yukari.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.079
Hey, that’s my family.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.819
You could also put welcome to the hotel, thanks
for staying, love you, sorry I missed you,

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:32.819
whatever.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.639
So, this just a way of displaying you know,
very, very simple way of displaying your towels

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:43.349
and today for the FOX 2 viewers, I have 15%
off for the double set of DVD’s on the website

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.200
FoldingMagic.com . So if you go there they’ll
get 15% off and it’s just you know, the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.900
motor skills are going and the crafts are
going and its great for hotel or your guest

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.900
room.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.249
Ok, now what kind of towels are good for this
kind of thing and what kind aren’t?

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.989
Actually, I discuss this on DVD’s as well.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.150
These are just regular standard that I got
at a chain, you know department store.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.609
The real thin towels you know for like say
for the elephant head over there.

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.060
It would just too flimsy, so it might fall
down.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.310
Mid range towels, I mean it can cost $10,
you know anywhere from $8-$10 for a descent

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.310
towel.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.849
Are new towels are better than older towels?

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.519
Well new, if you want to show of to your guests,
you don’t want towels that are all tattered

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.519
and bad.

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.829
Especially at the hotel.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.859
But you can do these, I mean these are few
months old, so any towel will do as long they

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:32.859
are not holey.

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.819
OK. you don’t want holey towels anyways.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.330
Give us the website again?

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.749
