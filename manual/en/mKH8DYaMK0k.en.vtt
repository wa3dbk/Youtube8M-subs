00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.860
As part of the major Verona Road (US 18/151)
reconstruction project, the Wisconsin Department

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.710
of Transportation created this simulation
video on how to safely navigate Stage I of

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.850
Verona Road, from the Madison Beltline (or
US 12/18) south to Raymond Road in Madison.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.180
Stage I construction will be completed in
2016.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.979
From the westbound Beltline to southbound
Verona Road, motorists should take the Verona

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.239
Road exit toward Dodgeville.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.019
As you exit, follow the signs and pavement
markings to choose the appropriate lane in

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.000
order to reach your destination.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.930
The new Single Point Interchange accommodates
all vehicles, including large trucks and oversize-overweight

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.930
vehicles.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.720
Youâ€™ll notice some turning movements occur
simultaneously, such as left turns from the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:33.280
Beltline to Verona Road and Midvale Boulevard.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.130
Once on Verona Road, motorists can continue
south to Raymond Road and beyond, or turn

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.200
right onto Summit Road (as shown in this video)
to access area businesses and neighborhoods

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.469
on either side of Verona Road.

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:53.789
Remember, left turns are eliminated at the
Atticus Way and Summit Road intersection.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.859
To access businesses and neighborhoods on
the west side of Verona Road, simply turn

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.249
left or right to your desired destination.

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:10.410
If you wish to access the other side of Verona
Road, motorists should turn left at the T-intersection.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.840
After making a left turn at the signals, travel
toward the new roundabout located under Verona

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
Road.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.180
As you approach the roundabout, yield to all
traffic on your left and enter the roundabout

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.150
when there is a safe gap in traffic.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.030
While in the roundabout, follow the signs
and pavement markings to reach your desired

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.450
destination.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.860
In this video, the driver will exit toward
Atticus Way.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.090
Once you arrive at the signalized intersection
at Atticus Way, you can travel straight or

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.370
turn right to access area businesses and neighborhoods.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.379
To return to Verona Road, simply turn left
at this intersection as shown in the video.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.101
As you turn right onto Verona Road, you can
merge into the far right lanes (as shown)

00:02:59.101 --> 00:03:05.659
to travel east on the Beltline, or merge into
the two far left lanes to reach the westbound

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.489
Beltline, or stay in the middle lanes to continue
north to Midvale Boulevard.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.010
Just follow the signs and pavement markings.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.010
In summary, left turns are eliminated from
the Atticus Way and Summit Road intersection.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.379
In order to access either side of Verona Road,
all movements are right-ins and right-outs

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.319
which improves safety, mobility and efficiency.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.109
Lastly, remember to follow all signs and pavement
markings to safely reach your destination.

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:50.659
