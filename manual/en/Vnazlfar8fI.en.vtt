Hello children Lovely to see you there is great story from the bible

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
just waiting for you ya story time. I Hope you all remember that you have to pay attention

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I will ask you a question at the end of the story

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
yes we do well then Peter was one of Jesus's favorite disciples

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
now Peter continued visiting many places to spread the news about Jesus

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
rising from death Peter one day went to a town called Jaffa

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it was a coastal town and it was very beautiful

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Garin Jaffa lived a woman called Tabitha she was a follower of Jesus

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and that's the good Christian  she helped the poor

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and was known for her skill in needlework

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
once tabitha became very ill the Christian society in Jaffa were very sad about this

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
a few days later Tabitha died of her sickness

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
during that time Peter was visiting Jaffa  when some Christians there heard that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
they had once called Peter to Tabitha's house

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Peter soon reached her house he went to the room by the dead body layed

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
ready to be buried many people who were mourning her death stood there surrounding the bed

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Peter first sent out all the mourners he then knelt down on his knees

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and prayed after some time he looked at Tabitha and said get up Tabitha get up

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
she immediately opened her eyes and got up slowly

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Peter then called all the mourners back into the room to see the miracle that had just taken place

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
all of them were very happy to see Tabitha alive again

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
everyone in the town of Jaffa heard the story this led to many more people deciding to become Christians

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Tabitha was brought back from death by Peter I thought only jesus can do that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
well  Peter have the Holy Spirit in him so could do great things

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
now the question is what is the name of the town were tabitha lived

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I want to answer I want to answer the town name was Jaffa  that is Right freckles

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
