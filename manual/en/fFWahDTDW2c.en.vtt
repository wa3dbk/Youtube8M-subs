00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.420
I'm expecting that the boat will just perform nicely today.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.260
Yeah, should be great!

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.460
The weather is also a pleasant surprise.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.100
Our boat is controlled by the same principle as a bicycle.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.700
Of course there is a difference between steering on water or on solid ground.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.820
It is certainly challenging, but that also makes it a lot more exciting when you DO succeed in controlling it...

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.300
...enabling us to fly over the water, much like a bike on a road, really.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.660
We held a selection procedure within the team. This started with everyone listing their preferred functions.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.400
I signed up to pilot the boat. It was decided this week that I would indeed be the main pilot...

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.320
...and that I will indeed be the one to pilot the boat during the races

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
My main task is of course to make sure that I am always well-rested, so that I can control the boat to the best of my ability.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.940
This mostly means that I don't just control the boat...

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.960
...but also need to keep a keen ear out for instructions from the strategy team.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.320
Our strategy is mostly concerned with the speed of the boat, so I need to follow those orders whenever possible.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.740
In the end, that's what makes our boat so special:

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.300
the fact that it functions like a bike allows us to reach very high speeds with great efficiency!
