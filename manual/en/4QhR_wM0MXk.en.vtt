00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.100
So, where have you got to with creating an enterprise?

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.100
I don't know any more

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.800
Really?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.000
I don't think my project corresponds to the modern world

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.800
But why's that? You know, that makes me think...

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.800
because  what I really want is to start a plan for an enterprise with a different vision, and

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.000
with employees who feel involved, you know?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
Yes, yeah ok but you know, you could maybe ...

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.200
But no, you know it's the profit that really counts, people have not been made the priority for a long time.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.000
Yes but anyway, look.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.500
Actually, you know what's needed, it's to invent a new management style in business, you see?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.100
Where the money would only be a commodity to oil the wheels , yes that's it.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.500
a means of helping the enterprise that would allow it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.300
to develop the activity in a responsible manner, to create jobs

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.900
and especially to allow all those that put work into it

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.100
to progress and to profit from it together

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.700
Yes, yes, you mean a worker cooperative

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.000
Err, a worker cooperative?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.120
A cooperative and participative organisation.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.400
Like all businesses, a worker cooperative should be profitable and able to develop itself

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.000
and to see sustainable projects through, but it has a democratic base

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Democra...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.870
Wait a minute

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.940
Can we see it on the drawing board?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.100
a table please !

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.910
Thanks!

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.800
OK I will explain it to you

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.400
The worker cooperative model can adapt itself to all enterprises and adheres to four main principles

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.280
Firstly: the employees of the worker cooperative are also the bosses of their enterprise

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.700
They can include external partners,  but they must remain a majority shareholder of the capital

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.630
Secondly: like all cooperatives, the worker cooperatives are based on equitable sharing

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.260
of the power

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.290
the risks

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.480
the information

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.740
and of course, the profits

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.000
The big decisions are voted in general assemblies according to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.300
the principle "one person = one vote"

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.100
Thirdly : the pooling together of skills and know-how to benefit a project

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.100
so that whatever the job

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.510
and whatever the size of the enterprise

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.700
the aim is to sustain it for the employees and for future generations

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.500
Well, if of course, a cooperative can develop itself on an international level

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
but it's decision centre remains there where it was born

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500
By definition it is an enterprise local to the area.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.600
Mais si ton projet est plutôt d'utilité sociale,
However, if your project is to promote social interests

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.400
and it is active in local development such as the environment, the culture, energy or health

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.469
there is a social cooperative, a cooperative which will benefit everybody involved

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.000
The mechanisms are the same as for the worker cooperatives

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
except that it allows you to put all the stake-holders ar the heart of the project,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the employees

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the volunteers

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the community

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.500
or even those receiving the benefits.
 
54
00:02:34,500 --&gt; 00:02:35,400
Oh ok

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.900
and does it also work if we are alone?

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.900
Yes of course

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.200
by becoming an employee of a CAE, a cooperative of activities and employment,
58
00:02:42,200 --&gt; 00:02:43,400
you can test your project

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.500
whatever your activity .

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.300
You would have your payslip and the CAE would take care of the paperwork, the accounting.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.200
In short, so you can get on with developing your activity

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.779
whilst being surrounded by professionals

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.700
and a network of producers, like yourself, who you can exchange with .

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.500
Worker cooperatives are a genuine network to be found in all regions,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.800
they are there to help you. They accompany you right from the start of your project

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800
and all the way throughout its development.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.800
They provide you with their cooperative, legal, strategic and commercial expertise,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.500
with training adapted to your needs and of those in the enterprise.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.000
That's it ! any questions?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.300
Err ...yes, I have one

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.500
How do you know all that about worker cooperatives?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.000
Ah well that's another story. That will be for anot
