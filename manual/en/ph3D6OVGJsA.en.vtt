00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.770
Hey whats up it's chris from chris beat cancer dot com.
today I want to talk about water

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.360
I get a lot of questions about what kind of
water filtration we use at our house

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.559
 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.460
I used a water distiller for eight years 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.630
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.010
but they strip everything out of the water so you need to add minerals back in

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.090
 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.540
after eight years our distiller started to leak

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.560
and so we had to make a decision 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.299
buy a new distiller or buy something else

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.630
 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.950
in the last few years ago I kept reading
and hearing a lot of good things about Berkey water filters

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.900
 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.920
after enough research I became convinced that it was an amazing device

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.070
 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.419
 

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.570
And we bought one last year (2012)

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.420
and so we've been using it for almost a
year now and i think it's about time for

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.179
me to explain why I love it and

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:03.700
why i think it's the best

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.300
water filtration system

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.000
This is the Berkey

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.920
We have the Big Berkey (2 gallon model)

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.939
There's five reasons why i think it's the
best you can buy

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.350
the first one is the Berkey removes 99.99% of contaminants 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.200
that includes

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.840
 bacteria parasites viruses

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.030
and toxic

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.280
pollution from manufacturing companies
that ends up in our ground water

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.340
 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.470
99.99%

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.490
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.490
It also has and extra fluoride &amp; arsenic filter

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.360
 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.760
and that removes 95% of fluoride and arsenic

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.890
 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.300
 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.950
 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.450
to less than fifty parts per billion 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.290
 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.720
which is an unbelievably tiny amount

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.299
So that's a good thing. Most water filters not remove fluroide.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.009
You have to get fluoride out of your water.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.820
It will destroy your pineal gland

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.770
and your thyroid

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.110
It is a toxic poison

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.609
It does not help your teeth

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.190
i have not used fluoride

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.359
toothpaste in eight years and i've
not drank fluoridated water in 8 years

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.039
and my teeth are as healthy as they've ever been

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.199
 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.599
You don't need fluoride in toothpaste or water

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.549
It is a mineral that comes naturally to your body through plant food

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.639
 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.730
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.040
The third reason is: It doesn't take any electricity or water pressure, which is amazing 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.489
It's a free standing device

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.319
You just fill up a pitcher with water

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.179
you pour it in the top

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.369
and the water filters down

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:50.859
into the bottom unit

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.440
You see the water dripping?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.300
that is the filtration system. 
The two white filters are the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.349
fluoride arsenic filters

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.429
The main two filters are in the top

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:06.469
 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.510
No electricity. No water pressure.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.290
which is great

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.240
You can take it with you. It's portable.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.299
We took ours on vacation last year

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.389
the waters tastes amazing. It is clean pure
water also this does not strip out minerals

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.260
 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.479
It leaves the water in a neutral ph which
is very important

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.759
I's extremely economical. This is
reason number four.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.130
this is the Big Berkey. It's 2 gallons.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.570
They make smaller and bigger ones. This model is about $250.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.700
That sounds like a l lot of money for a water filter when you can buy

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.659
a cheap filter like a Brita for $20-30

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.189
 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.449
But get this.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.370
This particular model will filter 6000 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.469
gallons of water before you have to replace the filters.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.269
That's less than 2 cents per gallon

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.149
And it will last you eleven

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:01.819
years

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.199
eleven years

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.469
before you have to replace the filter
and that's if you go through

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:07.780
 five gallons of

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.079
water per week

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.789
which is pretty average

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:14.919
I'm sorry, if you go through 10 gallons of water per week

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.800
It will last you

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.310
eleven years

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.080
That's 2 cents per gallon. Incredibly economical. 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.379
$250 bucks is a lot of money up front

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.840
but over the next eleven years it will save
you a ton

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.000
plus you get super clean pure water

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.639
This thing will even filter pond water

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.760
really anything you pour in the top it will filter through

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.680
and clean and come out the bottom

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.550
there's a little spigot on the front, you just put it on the edge of your countertop

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.120
We fill ours up every night before bed

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.760
It only take a few hours to filter though, but in the morning its ready.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.620
 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.989
and if for someone reason we forget we just fill it up in the morning and its ready in an hour or so

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:00.110
 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.699
The reason we have this model is there is 4 people in my family

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.770
It's the perfect size. If you have a bigger family you might want a bigger one.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.800
What else?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.089
That's pretty much it.

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.500
I can't think of any other reason to buy it

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.560
That's five really good reasons. It removes 99.99% of bacteria

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.060
It removes 95% of fluoride and arsenic. It's portable. It doesn't require electricity 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.439
And it's extremely economical.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.880
I going to put a link below the video

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.810
 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.759
 There's a lot of different Berkey

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.139
distributors out there online

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.249
and we found one who will give you a deal if you buy

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:46.949
the berkey filter, you get 50% off

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.869
the fluoride filters 

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:52.400
which are extra

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.360
So that's a pretty good deal

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.860
I'll put a link to them below the video and on chrisbeatcancer.com

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.409
Hopefully that is helpful to you

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.259
Look forward to hearing your comments.  If you have a Berkey already please

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.619
comment and let me know how you like it
