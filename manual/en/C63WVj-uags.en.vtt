00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:03.503
The President: What a spectacular day.

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:06.339
The Rose Garden is
especially beautiful this

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.042
time of year, and I thought
what better place to have

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:12.412
members of Congress and
members of the Cabinet and

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.949
some outstanding advocacy
groups come to celebrate

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.385
something else 
that is gorgeous,

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.588
and that is a bipartisan
piece of legislation.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:25.392
(applause)

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.762
The main reason I'm here 
is to say thank you.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.364
I want to thank everybody
who's here who helped to

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:35.902
pass the Medicare Access and
CHIP Reauthorization Act,

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:39.506
otherwise known as the
"permanent doc fix."

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.676
This law finally 
solves a serious problem.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.746
As all of you know, almost
every year for the past 13

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.016
years, doctors who care for
Medicare patients faced the

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:53.386
possibility of an arbitrary
cut in their pay.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.989
In 2010 alone, 
it happened five times,

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.324
and Congress repeatedly
scrambled to stop it from

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.226
happening, and patched it
over.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.629
I remember being involved 
in a few of those

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.732
patches myself.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.567
All of us said again 
and again,

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.936
let's just try to fix 
this once and for all.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.138
And this time, 
we finally did.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.540
No more temporary patches.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.708
(applause)

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.911
I am really
excited about it.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:24.751
I actually signed the bill
into law last week just to

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.719
make sure that America's
doctors didn't get hit by

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.456
any deep cuts, even 
if it was just for a day.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:33.693
And so I wanted to make sure
we signed it without

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:36.362
the fanfare.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.065
But I figured we could all
still enjoy each other's

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:43.236
company -- because we did
not just settle for fixing

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.506
an old formula; we replaced
it with a better one.

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.174
We're moving away 
from the old model,

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.044
which incentivized more
treatment over better

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:54.781
treatment -- something 
that cost a lot more money.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.950
From now on, we're going 
to compensate doctors based

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.222
more on how well they help
their patients get healthy

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:04.057
and stay healthy.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.658
And that's a smarter
approach,

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.994
and it's going to get better
results for patients.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.896
And I'm confident 
it's also going to be more

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:12.031
cost-effective.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.101
I shouldn't say this with
John Boehner here,

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:18.605
but that's one way that this
legislation builds on the

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:19.739
Affordable Care Act.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.644
(laughter and applause)

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.546
But
let's put that aside for

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:27.146
a second.

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:30.550
(laughter)

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.085
This legislation also
extends funding for the

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:35.387
Maternal, Infant, and Early
Childhood Home Visiting Programs,

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:35.888
which --

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:36.222
(applause)

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.092
-- Yay!

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.327
Which helps connect tens 
of thousands of new moms to

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.097
nurses and social workers,
and critical support that

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.799
they need 
for the first months after 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.334
a child's birth.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.037
That means it's a big
victory for working families

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:53.873
and a big victory 
for our children.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:56.876
It extends funding for
community health centers,

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.279
which is a vital resource
for families and

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.780
communities nationwide.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.749
(applause)

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.584
And finally, it
funds the Children's Health

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.519
Insurance Program, which
ensures millions of kids get

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.656
the care that they need to
grow up healthy and strong.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:10.757
And there's nothing 
more important than that.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.225
(applause)

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:16.729
So obviously a lot of people
were involved in this

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.365
process, but a couple of
special thank-yous.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.001
First of all, this would not
have happened without the

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.736
Speaker of the House, John Boehner --

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.470
(applause)

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.104
-- and we very much

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:30.009
appreciate his
leadership on this.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.379
It would not 
have happened without the 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.414
Democratic Leader, Nancy Pelosi.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:38.217
(applause)

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:39.586
It wouldn't have
happened without Senators

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:42.722
Orrin Hatch and Ron Wyden --

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.625
(applause)

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.360
-- and Representatives Fred Upton,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.431
Frank Pallone, Paul Ryan,

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.632
Sandy Levin.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.233
(applause)

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.835
I see McCarthy
there.

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:56.736
He counted votes.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.304
(laughter)

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.740
We're grateful
for that, as well.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.610
But most importantly, I just
want to thank everybody for

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.213
showing that Republicans and
Democrats can come together

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:11.250
and put aside partisanship
for something important --

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.821
not just on small things,
not just on the must-dos,

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.390
but on things that actually
make the country

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.725
work better.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.761
We did not, in this case,
simply kick the can down the

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:27.967
road; we solved a problem,
and we made life better for

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.435
a lot of people.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.304
And we crossed one of
Washington's perennial

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:35.541
"cliffs" off the list for
good.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.010
And we proved that's
possible.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.746
And my hope is, is that that
helps build a little more

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:43.449
momentum to get some other
good stuff done.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.285
I've said this before: We're
not going to agree

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:47.253
on everything.

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:50.023
I mean, there are some areas
where -- that's why we have

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:53.493
a party system -- there are
strong disagreements.

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:57.497
But where we can find areas
of agreement,

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:00.566
where we can focus on common
sense and focus on the

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:05.638
people who sent us here, 
I think there's nothing the

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.508
American people would rather
see than us be able to make

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:11.044
this town work.

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:12.311
And this was a great start
and a great example.

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.413
(applause)

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:14.247
So I want to thank
everybody.

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:15.381
Appreciate it.

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.083
Enjoy this beautiful day.

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.051
Thank you, everybody.

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.352
(applause)
