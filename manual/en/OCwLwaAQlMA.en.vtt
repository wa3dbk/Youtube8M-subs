00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.060
The number 36 is three
times as large as 12.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.910
Write this comparison as
a multiplication equation.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.300
So they're saying that the
number 36, we'll type 36,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.880
is equal to 3 times 12.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.646
And I will use this
little star thing.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.270
Let's see, if I were
to put an x there,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.561
would that have worked as well?

00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:27.430
No, they would have
viewed that as 3x.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.640
So to get this little star
thing, which is normally

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.790
when you're typing on a computer
how you show multiplication,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.860
to get that you have to
press Shift and the number 8.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.300
And it also sometimes shows
up on a numeric keypad.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.730
But by doing that, I was
able to show multiplication.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.420
So this could be read
as 36 is equal to 3

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.100
times 12, or 36 is 3
times as large as 12.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.610
Let's check our answer.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.160
Got it right.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.920
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.340
We can compare the numbers
4 and 20 using addition

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.860
by saying that 20
is 16 more than 4.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.390
Fair enough.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.310
That's right.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.740
We could also compare 4 and
20 using multiplication.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.060
Fill in the blank correctly
to compare the numbers

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.100
4 and 20 using multiplication.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.880
So they're saying 20 is
blank times as large as four.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.380
Well, we know that 4 times 5
is 20, or that 5 times 4 is 20.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.410
So 20 is 5 times as large as 4.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.770
If I do 4 five times,
I'll get to 20.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.760
So let me check my answer.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.970
There you go.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.910
Let's do one more.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.120
The number 6 is three
times as large as 2.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.780
Write this comparison as
a multiplication equation.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.470
So once again, we could
write that 6 is equal to 2,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740
and then I press
Shift and the number 8

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.670
to get that times
symbol, that little

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.830
asterisk
snowflake-looking thing.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.992
2 times 3.

00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:55.450
So I could write
it like that, or I

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.260
could write 2 times
3 is equal to 6.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.810
Either of those would be
completely valid things to say.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.624
So here I'm saying 6
is-- well, actually,

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:04.790
I'd like to say it this way.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.810
I'd like to say three
times as large as 2.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.710
I think that's a
little bit more fun.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.980
So this is exactly 6 is
3 times as large as 2.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.660
And we're done.
