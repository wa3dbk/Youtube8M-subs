00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:10.940
A: Alright, Swoop, this is your favorite part
of the game.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.099
Swoop: Ah, shootin' the ball, right?

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.099
A: Yeah.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.099
How to get bucket!

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.230
Swoop: Right, you know bro, you know what,
I have a different couple ways to shoot the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.230
ball, man.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.230
A: Uh-huh.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.980
Swoop: My first way, of course, is the granny
shot here, that's the best way to become a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.980
good shooter.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.740
Or you have the two-hand, one-foot fling.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.740
I'm all for...

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.740
A: Real good (?) move right there.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.740
Swoop: You like that one right there?

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.870
I'm workin' on my moves (?) about practice,
man.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.490
A: But listen, we're gonna show people the
proper way how to shoot the ball.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.490
Swoop: That's not the right way.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.490
A: That's not the right way.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.570
Swoop: The two-foot fling is not gonna do
it.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.570
A: No.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.570
Swoop: No, OK.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.570
A: You see your leg right there?

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.644
Swoop: Oh, but I was, yeah, that's how you
gotta balance.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:41.120
A: Alright, you look like you're a dancer.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.740
Swoop: Oh, that's dancin' stuff, man.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.040
A: Yeah, you look like a ballerina.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.120
Swoop: You think so?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.740
A: So we're gonna let DP the correct way to
shoot the basketball with good form...

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.740
Swoop: OK.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.740
A: ...good balance...

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.740
Swoop: Alright.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.740
A: ...and good follow through.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.740
Beef!

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.740
Swoop: Beef!

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.740
Both: Balance, eyes, elbow, follow through.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.740
A: There you go.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.740
Swoop: I do that, see?

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.120
A: Now, we're over here with the expert, DP.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.750
He's gonna show us the basic fundamentals
on how to become a better shooter.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.119
First you wanna get the ball, you wanna get
good hand placement.

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.439
You wanna form a 'T' with your hands right
here, with your two thumbs and this is your

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.869
guide hand, and this is your shooting hand.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.790
So, you wanna have your hands here.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.719
You got good leg placement.

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.140
Good knee bend right here.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.749
His right foot is slightly in front of his
left for balance.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:23.749
Swoop: OK.

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.439
A: Eyes should be on the front of the rim,
get that ball right over the front of the

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.439
rim.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.789
Keep your elbow in, your right elbow here,
in this case, 'cause he's right-handed.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.819
And you want to get good follow through on
the shot.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.340
So he's gonna show us a couple repetitions
on great technique.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.380
Repetition and muscle memory.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.509
Here we go.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.509
There's DP.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.549
Follow through.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.590
Bam.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.590
Follow through every time.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.829
Swoop: Not bad, not bad.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.700
A: There you go.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.100
There he is.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.759
Notice the follow through, notice the balance.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.029
Every time.

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.729
Shot's the same every time.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.929
And then he just gets shots up there.

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.990
Every shot, you want it to look the same.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.200
You want every shot to look the same.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.500
Follow through.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.329
Good muscle memory.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.179
Follow through.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.179
Good muscle memory.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.179
Move it back.

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:12.179
Swoop: Oh, move back a little bit.

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.620
A: When he moves back the shot still looks
the same.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.360
It's a natural flow, natural shot.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.819
Every one goes in when you use the proper
technique.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.900
Little toilet bowl action.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
Face.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.980
There you go.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.980
Nice.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.980
Follow through, all net.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.980
Swoop: All net.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.250
A: This is an expert, Swoop!

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.700
Swoop: This expert!

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.120
A: This is an expert!

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.020
Swoop: Yeah, but what you say...

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.020
A: [SS]

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.569
Swoop: ...this is not gonna work for me.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.849
A: No, that's not gonna be what we're looking
for.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:44.849
Swoop: That's not gonna work.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:45.849
But I'm working on it.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.849
A: No, no, no, that's not what we're looking
for.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.110
We're looking for an expert to show us, and
then...

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.450
Swoop: There it is, OK.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.790
A: Alright, there you go.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.400
Swoop: OK, let's get that thing going, alright!

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.420
A: Look at him [SS] go.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.420
Swoop: Oh, alright, OK.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.310
A: Look at him go, look at him go there, Swoop,
see that?

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.500
Swoop: There it is, there it is.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.090
A: It's all in the pass, too, Swoop.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.530
A good pass makes a good shot.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.629
Swoop: So shooting is all about preparation...

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:04.629
A: Yes.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:05.629
Swoop: ...good form...

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:06.629
A: Yes.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.849
Swoop: ...balance, muscle memory...

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:08.849
A: Yeah.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:09.849
Swoop: ...repetition.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.849
A: That's a lot of things to remember.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:11.849
Swoop: Wow, that's a lot.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.849
A: But guess what?

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.730
If you focus on your shooting technique first...

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.730
Swoop: Right.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.709
A: ...then you'll be able to become a better
shooter once you do it over and over again.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.739
Just to go over some of the key points.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.840
You want to have great balance, eyes on the
front of the rim, keep your elbow in, and

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.959
have a nice follow through on the shot.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.859
Bam!
