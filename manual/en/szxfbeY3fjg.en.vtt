00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:53.300
Because of its extraordinary
success both as a democracy

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.633
and as a market-based economy,
Poland is a model and example

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.734
for nations around the
world working to build

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.200

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:22.867
still has a lawn service, who
explained how he had just gotten

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:26.767
his chicken potpie out and the
storm started coming and he went

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:30.200

There's no doubt in my

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:52.000
There's no doubt in my mind

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.500
And as President, I can promise
you your country will be there

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.266

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.266
