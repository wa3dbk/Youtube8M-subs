Hello, and welcome to the screencast, Microsoft
Word Headers and Footers. Today we are going

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.309
to insert headers and footers onto a poetry
assignment in order to give it a more professional

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.080
and polished look. As you can see, I already
have the document open on screen.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.770
The assignment has mostly been completed.
All we have to do is apply the finishing touches,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.510
so let’s explore the different header options.
To do this, click on the Document Elements

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.250
tab below the toolbars, and then click on
Header.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.060
As you can see, there are many different options
for the header styles. However, if you look

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.460
over here on the left, you can see that it
says “Odd Pages.” For right now, we want

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.780
to put the same header on all of the pages.
So let’s click on it and choose All Pages.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.670
The amount of options has decreased significantly,
but it will do for what we need.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.129
Let’s choose the first option. The examples
shown in the toolbar show how the text will

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.420
show up on the page. The first option allows
text to be aligned on the left, right, and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.469
in the center on the same line. This is helpful,
because I want all of the information to be

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.970
on the same line. First I will double click
on the left Text box and write the last name.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.780
Now I want to add the name of the assignment,
so I will double click on the middle Text

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.660
box and type in Poetry Survey. I will do the
same for the date on the right. Double click

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.050
and type in 9/20/10.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.710
Now we want to insert page numbers, but at
the bottom of the page. SO put your cursor

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.890
where the Footer is, and then go to “Insert,”
“Page Numbers.” As you can se, the position

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.390
is at the bottom of the page, or the Footer.
And the alignment can either be on the left,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.670
center, right, inside, or outside. Because
this assignment is going to be opened up like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.000
a book, let’s put the page number on the
outside of the page, and for right now we

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.060
are going to show the number on the first
page. So click, “OK.”

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:04.020
And as you can see, page one is on the right,
but page 2 is on the left. Since we’ve already

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.209
inserted a Footer, the page numbers, if we
were to insert one of these footers, then

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.200
it would delete the page numbers we already
have down. So I will just show you.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.640
Look at the many options for footers, and
see how the page number is on the right side?

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.720
Now select Even Pages, and see how the page
number is on the left side? That is so that

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.580
when someone reads the document, he or she
can open it up like a book, and the page numbers

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:39.610
are on the outside edges of the pages just
like we put. Okay let’s look at our pages.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.600
As you can see, the Header and Footer are
on the title page. However, we don’t want

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.510
that because it would be repetitive on the
title page. We just want them on the inside

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.790
pages. So go up here to Toolbox, select “Header
and Footer” and say “Different First Page.”

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.540
As you can see the Header and Footer have
been removed from the title page, but they

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:12.100
remain on pages two through four.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.930
And that is the screencast for today. Thank
you for watching!

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.950
