00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.270
Hi, I'm Chris Tavano for Tundra Restaurant
Supply.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.250
In today's video I'm going to show you the
durability

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.500
and longevity of Victorinox knives.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.320
Here we have a brand new 8" chef knife.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.619
I'm going to pull it right out of the package.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:30.779
We're going to peel it right out of here,
if I knew how.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.779
Brand new knife.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.920
What we're going to do from here, I've got
two markers.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.260
I'm going to mark up the blade.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
Now that we've got our Victorinox knife properly
marked up

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.760
and unique to iself I'm going to hand this
off to our testing department

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.510
and we'll see what it looks like after its
vigorous trials.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.110
Here we go!

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.100
We're testing this Victorinox knife three
things.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.050
The first is dishwasher safeness.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.470
Now I don't recommend putting your knife in
the dishwasher,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.440
but oftentimes it finds its way there.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.280
Just be sure that you keep it in a stable
condition

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:16.660
so that way the blade doesn't get knocked
around and flaw the integrity of the edge.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.030
As we all know, big reasons why we don't put
blades in the dishwasher is,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.980
one, a safety concern.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.330
Grabbing that blade is very dangerous.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:46.230
But also the high temperature, the chemicals
and sanitation and soap,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:02:05.110
and the agitation of the machine itself 
creates a lot of harm for that fine edge

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.810
The second thing that we're testing for

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.340
is how well your blade holds up to cutting
technique and poor use.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.659
Always remember, as previously stated,

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.990
never use a complete straight down motion
with your blade

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.750
as that is very harmful to its edge.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.120
Also be sure what kind of cutting board you're
using.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.879
Never use a glass cutting board, as those
are just for decoration.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:45.459
So, also know that wood cutting boards are
also harmful to your blades as well,

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.989
even though we highly recommend wood cutting
boards.

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:58.239
Be sure that you notice the difference between
end grain vs. a side grain.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.799
End grain is what you want to use; side grain
is much more harmful to your blades.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.879
The third and final thing that we're testing
for

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.049
is resistance and durability to storage.

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.310
Knife magnets are great because they keep
your knife isolated

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.920
and away from any other blade or utensil.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:28.400
However, blades often find themselves in a
haphazard drawer

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.989
knocking themselves into other things that
are metal,

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:40.690
whether it be another knife or utensil or
tongs,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.799
really decreasing the integrity of your edge.

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.260
Now that we've done the rigorous testing

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.970
of the daily ins and outs of a kitchen,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.510
let's see how well this knife blade hones
and cuts a tomato.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.370
Notice the nice artistic drawing that we put
on this blade

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.290
before the rigorous testing that it went through.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.170
As you can see, the red's still there.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.650
It's just turned a little bit more pink,

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.719
and it's definitely got some wear and tear.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:14.629
Let's see how well this thing hones.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:24.100
Now that we've honed this knife we'll test
it on this nice ripe tomato.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:35.890
I'm 
Chris Tavano for Tundra Restaurant Supply

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.730
and that's the durability and longevity of
Victorinox knives.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.790
