00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.570
The first thing you want to do when you paint
your chevron wall is to measure the wall across

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.570
and up and down.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.570
That's how you find the middle.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.850
You measure across, divide by two.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.400
Measure up and down, divide by two, and that's
the middle of the wall.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.599
When you find the middle, you mark it with
a dot and that will be your starting point.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.550
The angles will look the same at the top and
the bottom, and on the side.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.909
Then you decide how far apart, how big you
want your chevrons to be.

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.390
I'm going to do ten inches.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.730
You start from your dot and then you measure
ten inches up and down.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.580
Then you draw another dot.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.360
From that point you're going to use this part
of a level.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.550
It's a 45-degree angle and from there, you're
going to go up and over.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.260
As soon as that little bubble gets in the
middle, you draw your line.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.810
Again, I'm going to do these about ten inches
apart.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.730
They don’t have to be the same.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.690
It depends on what kind of pattern you want.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.070
I'll go up and over ten inches.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.500
I'll flip my level over like this to make
this level with the ground.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.219
Then I'll go down and over ten inches.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.950
You keep doing this pattern until the entire
wall is done.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.899
This is what probably takes the longest part
when you're doing your chevron wall.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.799
Then after that you need to tape your wall.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.530
When you start taping your wall, you have
to decide which part you're going to paint

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.249
and which part's going to be the same.

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:36.890
I decided that in here, I'm going to paint
it a lighter gray.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.899
When you put your tape on the wall, you want
to make sure that you're going to cover the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.380
pencil marks that you made to make your line.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.960
You're going to put the tape just a hair over
those pencil marks.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.329
You're going to want your pieces of tape to
overlap a little bit because you're going

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.560
to need to use your X-ACTO knife to make the
edges perfect.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.569
You're going to want your edges to look like
this when you're done using your X-ACTO knife.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.560
Facing the space that you're going to paint.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.140
Don't worry about this space on the outside
because you're not painting that, so you don’t

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.820
need those edges to be clean.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.440
When your whole wall has edges like this in
the space you're going to paint, you're ready

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.570
to paint your wall.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.480
When you're done painting your wall, you don’t
have to wait for it to completely dry.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.330
You don’t want it to be completely wet.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.290
You want it to be a little in between and
that's when you peel your tape off and your

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.420
chevron wall is done.
