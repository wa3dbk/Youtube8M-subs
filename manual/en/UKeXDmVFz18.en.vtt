00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.700
My name is Maegan Woodin, and I'm a professional
dancer, choreographer, teacher and student.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.300
I have danced for MTV, Diana Ross, Marc Jacobs
and have appeared in many music videos.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.330
You can find more information about me and
my career, as well as photos and videos, at

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.330
www.dgtnyc.com.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:27.160
I'm going to be talking to you about ballet.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.250
Chaines Turns are turns that are done on a
diagonal usually that are very very fast turns.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.620
And your arms can be in a basic first position
and I'm going to demonstrate your Chaines

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.750
Turns with your feet together in first position.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.260
So you wanna make sure that your spotting
the corner or the area that your going to

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.110
be finishing and also you're going to think
about your arms being fully engaged and wide.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.410
You want to make sure that your arms don't
sink in as well as your chest because then

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.940
you'll spin in all sorts of directions.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.040
It's also important that you try to think
about going towards that direction just as

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.110
we talked about in pique turns.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.220
You want to make sure that you're always stepping
ahead, not of to the side because where ever

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.630
you're stepping is where you're going to be
going.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.020
So I'm going to demonstrate on a very basic
level just the action of Chaines Turns with

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.100
your arms in this position.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.630
This position just helps you become very lifted
and supported in your back which is crucial

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.610
to doing Chaines Turns very fast.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.320
And I'm also going to show it just by flipping
front to back front to back.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.160
Practicing Chaines Turns on a basic front
to back movement is good at creating speed

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.030
and also helping with the fluidity of the
movement.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.430
So demonstrating the very simple version,
your going to point your toe out to the side

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.450
and you're going to come up to a very shallow
first position.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.690
From this position spotting the corner you're
going to flip.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.650
Making sure your heals are turned out, and
flip.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.830
And flip.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.510
And flip.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.380
And it's very good even if you are a professional
to practice that every once in a while.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.060
It's good because it engages your back as
I said earlier.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.090
And it's a very simple version but it's very
effective.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:19.489
I'm now going to demonstrate the actual Chaines
Turn with more speed.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.829
And if you get dizzy when you're turning in
Pique Turns or Chaines Turns it's always good

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.879
afterward to stop and look at something stationary.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.060
I always look at my hands.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.450
And you stop and just freeze at them and then
you will instantly not be dizzy.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.499
It's always good to keep your spot which is
very important in doing any turn.
