00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.930
Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes, the prologue
to Phantom Pain, and if this was a meal this

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.010
would be the starter before the main.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.670
Coming in at only a handful of hours of that
gameplay wise if that, it's short and intense

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.420
but that's if you just play through once on
the main mission, there's more to it than

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.420
that.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.630
Also, where gameplay hours are reduced, so
are the long endurance test cut scenes that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.480
Hideo Kojima is notorious for.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.430
You're in Omega Base, a US Naval Prison Facility
full of sneaky treats, hidden secrets and

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.210
many a passage to explore and all this in
the usual MGS stealth mode and believe me,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.480
you can tell this world has been built for
hiding.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.120
It's 1975, you're Big Boss aka snake and this
one is set in a time a little after Peace

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.400
Walker, so what can you expect?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.010
Well, Ground Zeroes brings new methods of
sneaking around as well as the choice to lead

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.430
the story in whatever order you so wish based
on the mission you decide to play.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.820
BUT there's only six missions in this one
Omega Base map so don't expect an expansive

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.559
experience in those straight up terms.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.449
The price tag may lead some to call this a
glorified demo but for the first time in the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.330
MGS series there's open world gameplay that
you'll want to get to grips with while you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.630
wait for Phantom Pain to be unleashed.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.860
Don't you want to see what Konami are up to
now?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.280
Well this is your chance and it's pretty great.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.700
Of course if this is your first go at the
Metal Gear Solid games then you might want

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.799
to start from the beginning to enjoy the journey
rather than the beginning of something new

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.610
which could seem like an introduction.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.180
The beauty of a game like this is that you
can replay and change your rules, maybe you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.520
want to partake in a bit of casual combat,
blow the heads off everybody or try for the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.770
trophy of remaining completely undetected
there's a lot more to this game than first

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.090
meets the eye but it depends on what you like
to do.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.040
Sure if you want to just play the main mission
your game time will be significantly less

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.450
but if you want to master the controls and
experience everything involved in MGS then

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.659
you'll get a lot more out of it.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.090
It's an incredible looking game built on the
brand new Fox Engine to mark the move to next

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.270
gen for the franchise.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.290
The attention to detail is phenomenal and
your enemies dotted around the facility are

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.460
responsive and unpredictable.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.880
You're gifted with a set of binoculars which
can be used to pick out your enemies position

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.119
much like Far Cry 3 and the iDroid, full of
information and a map system.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.330
As I said earlier the cut scenes are reduced
and partnered with a better, more fluid narrative

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.790
and animation but where the cut scenes are
gone, a series of cassette recordings come

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.810
in its place.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.810
A difference worth noting in this game is
your inventory is no longer on a keep basis,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.860
you have your weapons and they are disposable
and interchangeable but only in specific holds.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.560
All in all this new addition to the Metal
Gear Solid family makes is like when you discover

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.170
a show you really like and you binge out until
it's all gone and you wish you'd done it slower.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.370
In Ground Zeroes, you know the end is coming,
and you want it to last longer because you

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490
have to wait a while for the next instalment.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.239
You'll end up binging anyway and probably
over and over again.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.420
Like I said earlier this is a starter course
to the main event Phantom Pain which is so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.000
far lined up for a 2015 release but you usually
order starters when you're starving and need

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.950
to get your fill because you just can't wait
any longer.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.290
Sure Ground Zeroes is pretty short in game
terms but you can damn well bleed it dry while

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.420
you wait to get yourself involved with the
next main squeeze in Kojima's closet of creations.
