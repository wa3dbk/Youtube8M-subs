00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.635
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey, math class.

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:06.172
Okay, we are starting the
crusade of dividing decimals,

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.608
and there's a lot of
different kinds of problems,

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.845
so we're going to be looking
at them all kind of separately.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.749
Kind of, the easiest problem is
any time you have a whole number

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:20.253
and you're dividing it
into a decimal number.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.090
It's the one -- it's the one
that's most like dividing with

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.091
whole numbers.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:29.996
All I have to do is bring the
decimal point straight up,

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.732
and then I can, like,
basically, ignore it,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.935
like it's not really there,
underneath because I've brought

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.172
it straight up and then I'm
going to divide just like I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.173
usually would.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.278
So can -- I'm going to use
my piece of paper here.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.579
Can 8 go into 9?

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:47.313
Yes, it can.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.448
It can go 1 time.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:53.753
I have 1 left over, slide
that over, drop the 7 down.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.688
Can 8 go into 17?

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:56.856
Yes, it can.

00:00:56.923 --> 00:01:02.295
Goes 2, and I have 1 left over.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:06.299
Slide it over again, drop
it down, and I have 16,

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.469
which I know it
can go into twice.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.473
So I end up with zero down here.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.207
Okay?

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:19.312
So, this is what I'd started
out with, 9 and 76 hundredths,

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.847
divided by 8, right?

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:26.319
And I find out that the
answer is 1 and 22 hundredths,

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.656
and I come out
with no remainder.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:30.857
Okay?

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.392
Let's look at another example.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.664
Again, this is the closest --
the closest to whole number

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.833
division as we'll get.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.701
You'll see in the next
videos we, kind of,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.937
are going to add another step.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:49.509
But, okay, so all I have
to do, 25 divided into .

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:53.813
3125, I'm going to bring my
decimal point straight up, and,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.649
then, like, ignore it -- ignore
-- act like it's not there,

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.285
and treat this like I was
dividing whole numbers.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:02.889
So 25 can't go into 3.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.657
But it could go into 31, right?

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:15.401
It could go in there one
time, minus 25, which is 6.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:15.935
Slide over.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.837
Going to drop the 2 down.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:23.843
25 can go into 62
twice, which is 50.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.446
Then I subtract.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:27.647
I have 12 left over.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.250
I'm going to drop the 5 down.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:36.322
25 can go into 125 -- oh, gosh
I think five times, right?

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.759
I know there's twenty -- like,
if I'm thinking quarters,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.495
there's four
quarters in a dollar.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.130
So one more would give me, yeah.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.666
It goes 5 times.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.435
125.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.839
So, again, I come
out even down here.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.341
And then you can see that we
have -- we've kind of run into

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:56.409
problem up here.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:03:01.514
Because, like with multiplying,
if my decimal point ends up way

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:04.317
over here, I have to fill
in the spot with something.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:10.189
So if it really was just 25 into
3,125, my answer would be 125.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:14.160
But because it's really -- let
me put the decimal point back in

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.728
there -- because it's really .

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:21.301
3125, I have a spot right here
that I have to fill in with

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:21.968
something.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.305
I can't just have a
decimal point, a blank,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.106
and then have my number start.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:30.476
So I have to fill in that
spot with a zero, okay?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:34.881
So dividing a whole number into
a decimal number and we'll kind

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:39.285
of continue on in the decimal
progression after this.
