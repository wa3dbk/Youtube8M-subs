00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.473
- Hey guys.

00:00:00.473 --> 00:00:01.693
So I don't know if this is going

00:00:01.693 --> 00:00:02.813
to be my new background.

00:00:02.813 --> 00:00:04.433
I'm just kind of testing it out.

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.574
Let me know in the
comments if you like it.

00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:08.314
So a few months ago, I wrote a post

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:09.925
on new media rock stars called,

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:11.765
"How to Design Merch."

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:14.605
And I thought I would
also turn it into a video

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:17.165
since maybe not all of you guys saw it.

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:18.325
So if you want to read the article,

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:19.625
I'm going to link it down below

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:21.765
or you could just watch this video

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:22.845
since I'm going to cover all

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:23.965
of the same things.

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:24.965
And before I get started,

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:25.965
I just want to mention that

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:28.465
the buying books shirt is back in stock

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.328
on my DFTBA store.

00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:31.446
I know a lot of you guys wanted

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:32.986
to buy one and they've been out of stock

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:35.344
for awhile but now they're back in stock

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:39.456
so go ahead and go forth
and put it on your body.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.536
Oh and before you freak out

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:41.736
that there's no lady's cut,

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:43.686
the new t-shirt/fabric that they're

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:45.657
printing on is more form fitting

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:48.857
so the unisex is sort
of like a lady's cut.

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:50.777
It will look fine don't worry.

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:52.298
You'll look good in it I promise.

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:53.838
Okay, so now on to the video.

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:55.279
I have designed merchandise

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:57.979
for several You Tubers over the years.

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.679
John Hank Green, VidCon,

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.859
The Lizzie Bennet Diaries,

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.700
Squaresville and most
recently Wheezy Waiter.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.635
The most important thing I want to stress,

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:07.035
is to produce something

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:09.157
that you would want to buy.

00:01:09.157 --> 00:01:10.758
Don't make mediocre products

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:11.858
where you just throw your name

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:14.278
on some random stuff
that nobody would want

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:16.518
if it wasn't for your influence.

00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:17.998
Think about your target audience

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:19.198
and where they shop.

00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:20.938
Are you appealing to teenage girls

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:22.298
who love Mod Cloth?

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.119
Nerdy kids who like (mumbles) geek

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.580
or maybe hipsters who
like Urban Outfitters.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.440
You can make a mood board by pulling

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.560
images of products from those sites

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.840
that you think that your
audience would love.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.120
So now, think about the role

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.900
that you want the product
to play in people's lives.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200
Do you want to releases a beautiful poster

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.640
for your audience to
decorate their room with?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.731
Or start with an obscure inside joke

00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:45.011
so that people can wear it

00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:47.203
and hope that somebody else recognizes it?

00:01:47.203 --> 00:01:49.023
Or do you just want to shout your brand

00:01:49.023 --> 00:01:52.045
loud and clear so it
becomes free advertising?

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.645
Whatever you decide, just make sure

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:55.105
you build your design out of

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:58.211
existing branding elements
that you already use

00:01:58.211 --> 00:02:00.829
in your videos to create
a strong visual link

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.730
between your videos and your merchandise.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.110
If you want to learn more about branding,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.111
you can watch this panel that I was on

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:08.511
at the last VidCon where we talked

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.831
about branding for an entire hour.

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:12.591
So when you're picking
your merchandise products,

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.632
don't be afraid to think outside the box.

00:02:15.632 --> 00:02:18.355
I loved Jenna Marbles' stuffed dogs

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:20.015
since their so cute and you might

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.756
want to own them anyway, even if you know

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:23.917
nothing about Jenna Marbles

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.698
The Foo have a music channel

00:02:25.698 --> 00:02:28.038
and they put their logo on guitar picks

00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:30.398
and Hannah Hart put the
My Drunk Kitchen logo

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:32.038
on a wine glass.

00:02:32.038 --> 00:02:33.018
There's nothing wrong with doing

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:35.918
yet another t-shirt
since those do sell well.

00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:38.040
But if you want your
merch to be memorable,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.560
try to be a little creative.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.100
However, be realistic.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.160
It might be worth paying more

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.720
to print on v-neck shirts if your

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.560
audience is mostly female since those

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.440
tend to be a lot more flattering.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.620
But if you don't have a huge audience,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.360
don't shell out a ton of money

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.801
making premium merchandise
that might not sell.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.701
Be realistic about the amount of products

00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:01.619
you can offer and who
might actually buy them.

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.399
And if you have a younger audience,

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.619
try to offer a couple
of lower priced items

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.120
like stickers or bracelets

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.900
since they might not have a ton

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.201
of disposable cash to spend.

00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.541
So now you have your mood board,

00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:13.741
you know what kind of products

00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:16.241
you want to make but maybe
now you're realizing,

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.181
you're not a designer.

00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:20.461
If you can tell me what CMYK stands for

00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:21.781
or if you don't know the difference

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:23.971
between a vector and a raster file

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:26.373
then maybe you should hire a professional.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.974
I made a video called, "How to hire

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.595
"a freelance designer."

00:03:29.595 --> 00:03:31.197
Which is all about how to hire

00:03:31.197 --> 00:03:32.495
a freelancer designer.

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:33.796
Or you could look in to having

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:35.036
your merch company design

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:36.657
your merchandise for you.

00:03:36.657 --> 00:03:37.997
I know that that's a service that

00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:39.437
District Lines offers and maybe

00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:40.760
some of the others too.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.058
Or if you see merch that you like

00:03:42.058 --> 00:03:43.438
from another You Tuber,

00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:44.978
just ask them who designed it

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:46.900
and maybe that person will be up

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.780
for doing your merch as well.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.598
However, make sure that you can pay

00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:52.678
your designers a decent wage.

00:03:52.678 --> 00:03:54.818
Your not going to get
a professional t-shirt

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:57.238
design for five dollars so respect

00:03:57.238 --> 00:03:58.919
the price quote that you get.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:03:59.999
Some designers might be open

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.099
to splitting the revenue with you

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.781
instead of a flat fee but usually only

00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.279
if you have a huge channel

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.101
and they're sure that it's going to sell

00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:10.650
and I think DFTBA is the only company

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.110
that offers automatic revenue split

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.930
but correct me if some of the other do

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.131
and I'm totally wrong.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.813
Or if you really can't afford

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:20.234
to hire a designer,
some designers might be

00:04:20.234 --> 00:04:21.974
open to a skilled trade.

00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:24.074
Can you write them a theme
song for their channel?

00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:26.674
Code their website, build them a new desk.

00:04:26.674 --> 00:04:28.774
It never hurts to ask but not everyone

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:30.595
will be open to it so don't be offended

00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:32.015
if they say no.

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:33.716
So now you have your merch designs

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:35.596
but where are you going to sell them?

00:04:35.596 --> 00:04:38.336
I sell my merch on
DFTBA since I have known

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:41.876
Allen and Hank for years
but it might not be

00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:43.857
the best option for everybody.

00:04:43.857 --> 00:04:45.039
There are a lot of options.

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.577
I have a list right here.

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:48.497
District Lines, Spread
Shirt, Rodeo Arcade,

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:50.838
Big Cartel, ForHumanPeoples, Etsy,

00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:53.978
Cafe Press, Society6 to name a few.

00:04:53.978 --> 00:04:55.979
Just like shopping for a You Tube network,

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.761
compare what cut they're going to take

00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:59.599
out of the profits, how
much freedom you have

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:00.959
with your designs and what type

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:02.339
of merchandise you can sell

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:03.339
and just talk to your friends

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:04.619
who use the various sites

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:07.802
and decide which one is right for you.

00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:09.601
So now that your merch is up for sale,

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.293
it is time to promote it.

00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:12.671
This could be a whole other video

00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:14.371
all about different types of promotion

00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:16.332
but the main point is

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:17.366
don't turn your channel

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:19.121
into a constant infomercial.

00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.499
Just do a few mentions on
your social media sites.

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.628
Include a link in the description
of all of your videos.

00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:26.268
If you can include the merch product

00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:29.160
in your video organically,
like how Daily Grace

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.584
with I mean, it's Grace did with

00:05:31.584 --> 00:05:35.302
the "You've been hazed!"
shirt, that's even better.

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:36.702
If you have a lot of friends on You Tube,

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:39.202
you can also send them
your merchandise for free

00:05:39.202 --> 00:05:40.983
and then if they decide to put it

00:05:40.983 --> 00:05:44.817
in their video, that is
free advertising for you.

00:05:44.817 --> 00:05:46.017
And encourage your audience to post

00:05:46.017 --> 00:05:48.046
pictures of themselves wearing or holding

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:49.875
your merchandise since any promotion

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:52.295
outside of your own channel's is just

00:05:52.295 --> 00:05:54.291
going to reach an even wider audience.

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:55.831
Just a warning though, I am weary of

00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:57.573
doing contests for free merch

00:05:57.573 --> 00:05:59.211
as soon as you release it.

00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:00.592
Your audience will enter the contest

00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:02.233
hoping to win for free and then when

00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:04.555
they don't win, they
might forget to come back

00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:06.995
and actually buy the merchandise.

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:08.595
So that might not be the best

00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:10.115
strategy in the world.

00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:12.435
So those are about all
of my tips and tricks

00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:13.935
on making merchandise.

00:06:13.935 --> 00:06:16.375
Asking your audience to actually hand over

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:19.015
money to you is really asking a lot.

00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:21.236
So be considerate and respectful of them

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:23.116
by making products that you think

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.796
that they really want to own.

00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:26.316
So if you want to see a list of some

00:06:26.316 --> 00:06:29.193
of my favorite merchandise
by other You Tubers,

00:06:29.193 --> 00:06:31.494
I have a new sublime list right down below

00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:34.294
where you can check it out
and see why I like them

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:36.374
and if you want to buy
any of my merchandise

00:06:36.374 --> 00:06:38.614
including the buying books shirt,

00:06:38.614 --> 00:06:40.406
I will link that right down below.
