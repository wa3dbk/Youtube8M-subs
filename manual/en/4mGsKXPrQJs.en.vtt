00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.200
I enjoy timetrialling when I have good legs
and when I have bad legs it can be the worst

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.200
thing.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.900
Two long straight roads and on the way it’s
tailwind and on the way back it’s a headwind,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.280
so it’s quite hard – a really fast course.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:45.520
A lot of numbers and stuff… it’s like
ten minutes easy warmup, then sprint, then

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.080
five minutes progressive ride on the threshold,
and so on, then a small break, and then the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.360
final warmup is like… one minute efforts
over threshold.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.120
Normally it’s power-based but I don’t
have a powermeter here so I use my heartbeat.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.880
Ten minutes before the start, I stop.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.420
Yeah, so we wear a skinsuit, yeah, because
it’s faster – I hope so it’s faster.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.780
&nbsp;Then like, a timetrial bike – disc wheel
I the back and in the front a high-profile

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.780
wheel.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.090
Normally we use also bigger chainrings.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.329
Normally it’s 53, now I use 54.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.420
Then like the helmets – special helmets,
aero helmets.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.631
And we have special gloves from Endura, they
are longer, they say they are faster… and

00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:34.631
then cover-shoes.

00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:42.479
Let’s go, let’s go.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.450
Good, good, good.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.439
Good.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.420
Spin, spin.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:11.140
On the bars, on the bars.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.140
Ok, left.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.140
Ok, acceleration, acceleration, gears down.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:40.350
Now we go for the speed, now we go for the
full speed.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:03:05.940
Good, good, good, go, go, go, go, go.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.990
It started slow, and it ended slow.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.990
It doesn’t feel good.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.400
Like, on the warmup I felt already that the
legs are tired and painful, so yeah.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.270
You build a lot of acid and lactate, and yeah
to try and help the body to recover faster

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:35.340
and to pedal it out of the muscles, so for
that it’s to actually just to get a bit

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.340
of the lactate out of the legs.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.940
I don’t like it, but I have to do it, so…
normally you should do it for 20 minutes,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.770
but I think I will do 5 or 10.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.090
Tomorrow is a rest day, we’re flying home
so, no worries…
