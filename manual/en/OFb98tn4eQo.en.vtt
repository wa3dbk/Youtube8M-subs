Hello, my name is Jose Zuniga. I'm representing
expertvillage.com. We are going to talk about

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:12.410
soil preparation, whether it is for indoor
or outdoor herb gardens. For indoor herb gardens,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.800
it's real simple. All you need to do is just
get the potting soil. Today we just happen

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.269
to use organic... oh not to the top, give
it about one inch of space. Now if you are

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:35.540
also working with seeds, just fill it up.
Now that is simple. Now when it comes to outdoor

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.580
soil preparation, what you need to do, once
you have your location ready, be sure that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:49.890
it is completely cleaned. You go back with
the shovel. Loosen up the soil. Once you do

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.620
that, then you go back and follow it with
a garden weasel. And what this is going to

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:06.420
do, the garden weasel, is loosen it up, releases
all the roots from other plants that were

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.400
there in the bed. So we remove them completely,
and you do that to the entire bed. Now once

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.171
you have done that, sprinkle it a little bit
with the potting soil, and you would do that

00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:28.180
to the entire bed. The entire bed needs to
be just completely, completely covered. Once

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:37.770
again you mix it up with the garden weasel.
There we go. Now you selected the area that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.540
you are going to start planning the herbs,
so just do a little hole. So once you have

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.890
an idea where they need to be, just start
digging the hole. As you could see the soil

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.260
is dry, and it is okay for it to be dry because
most of the herbs you have to control their

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.640
drainage. The water drainage needs to be controlled.
So that is why it is not wet right now. So

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.730
that is all you have to do; just kind of dig
the hole, get them ready for the plant. We

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:17.530
are going to add a little bit of potting soil.
There we go, one. Let me get some more over

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.319
here. That wasn't that bad was it? Now this
is how we do the soil preparation for indoor

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.670
and outdoor herb garden.
