00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Gumbo, Freckles come out, come out, wherever you are.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Over there, On that great book is Grand Old Holy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
She is really old and wise and tells us wonderful stories, when she is awake that is.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Oh! and we love to sing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hello children nice to see you back again. Do you know what Tubby Did today.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They ate my sandwich he is so greedy. I will never talk to him ever again.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
No I didn't now children stop fighting

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Don't you want to hear a story from the Bible today. Yes please do.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I don't want to sit next to him all right children Today's story is about David and Absalom.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
David was a young boy who was chosen by God to be the king of Israel.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
After he became king he had many sons and he loved all of them dearly.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
As David grew old his son started fighting over who would get to be the next king of Israel.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Though David knew about the fights he did nothing to stop them.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
One day and on David's eldest son was killed by Absalom

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
His own brother. After killing Amnon Absalom left Jerusalem and raised a strong army to defeat his father

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And take away his throne. David was very angry with Absalom.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But he loved him too dearly to fight back.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
First he left Jerusalem so that the city would not be under attack.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Then he told his soldiers protect the city but do not harm Absalom.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Absalom rode into the battleground on his horse as he was riding

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
He passed under an old oak tree his long hair got caught in the branches

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Leaving Absalom hanging helplessly as his horse ran away.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Soon David soldiers found him and they killed him.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
David soon heard that Absalom was killed and was really very sad.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
He cried Oh! How I wish I had died instead of Absalom.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh! my Dear son is dead. Soon David's other sons also tried to take the throne

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But failed. David finally chose his son Solomon to take his throne.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The question is, What was the name of David's son who wanted to defeat him and take away his throne?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Absolu, Absole,  Absalom see I was paying attention.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Oh! and I am sorry Gumbo I did eat a sandwich but I was hungry.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Please let's not fight I forgive you. You can eat my sandwiches any time.
