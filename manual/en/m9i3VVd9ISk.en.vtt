00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.389
Hi Gang!
Here's a neat heat engine made using material

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.890
from a coffee bag,
and that sort of opens and closes like a flower.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.710
The petals of the rotating part are strips
cut from the coffee bag.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.630
Behind it on one side is a glass of hot water,
meaning the air around is it hot,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.630
and on the other side is a glass of cold water,
with cold air surrounding it.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.689
You can see the petals straighten out in the
hot air,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.339
and curl back up in the cold air,
making it an unbalanced wheel that keeps on rotating.

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.529
It's pretty simple to make and in this video
I'll show you how.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.680
For the stator,
I've made this stand with scrap wood

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.160
and two stiff scrap aluminum bars.
In this bar I've made a tiny indentation near the top.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.600
I attach some neodymium magnets to one bar,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.379
and tape some more to the other bar.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.989
For the rotor,
I've cut this round plastic disk,

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.019
and stick a needle through it.
By putting the sharp end of the needle in

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.769
the tiny indentation,
and with the help of the magnetic fields,

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.679
the needle just sits there,
and turns very easily.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.659
But, the disk is unbalanced,
always coming to a stop with the same side down.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.500
So I sand away some plastic from that side.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.570
It still isn't balanced,
so I sand some more,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.420
until finally the rotor stays pretty much
however I orient it.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.119
Then I start cutting up the coffee bag,
and cut a strip from it.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.070
The strip is 1/2" wide by 2 1/8" long.
A piece of duct tape holds it onto the disk.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.740
Then I attach another piece
and make sure they both stretch out the same

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.140
distance from the center.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.610
But notice that one petal always hangs down,
so the whole thing is unbalanced.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.460
After trimming a little from the petal that
was hanging down,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.409
the rotor balances better now.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.759
I give the petals a little curvature
using the blunt edge of a pair of scissors.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.840
I then put out two glasses of water,
one hot and one cold,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.860
along with the stand
and the heat engine's rotor.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.210
From the top you can see this petal straightening
out

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.710
in the hot air surrounding the glass containing
hot water,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.979
and this petal curling up in the cold air
surrounding the glass containing cold water.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.270
Eventually I add all eight petals.
But notice that since it's now heavier

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.859
I've also had to add more magnets.
And as you'd expect

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.150
the rotor is unbalanced again,
with the same side always hanging down.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.290
To fix it this time I add a little extra tape
on the opposite side.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.660
And now it stays put wherever I leave it.
It's balanced.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.170
After using the scissors again to give all
the petals a curvature,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.620
I give it a try.
All that careful measuring and balancing has

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.540
paid off
as it works the first time.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.709
You can see the petals straighten out on the
hot side,

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.180
and curl up again on the cold side.
There's not a lot of power here,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.860
but it's pretty neat to watch.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.030
Well thanks for watching!
