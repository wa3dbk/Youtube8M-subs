Hi I’m Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
this is my detailed break down of Eibachs

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.900
anti roll sway bar kit, for all 2005-2010
V6 and GT Mustangs.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.810
If you’re not familiar with sway bars, here’s
what you need to know: as far as basic suspension

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.680
components go, sway bars are one of the biggest
tools for reducing body roll and understeer

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.270
through turns.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.460
This kit from Eibach should make for flatter
cornering, and a more stable car in just about

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.680
any driving situation.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.879
We know what they should do in theory but
we want to see how these sway bars perform

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.820
in real world situations.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.010
So with that said we’re going to take our
06 GT out on the street, look for some turns

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.640
and see how our car handles now in stock form.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.079
Alright, so we’re out in our 06 GT, doing
a little test drive before we install those

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.519
Eibach sway bars, and honestly the car feels
ok, but let’s be honest, these are bigger

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.670
cars, they’re kind of heavy, so there’s
going to be a little understeer through turns

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.550
when you push them hard, there’s going to
be a little bit of body roll.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.549
However, I definitely feel there’s room
for improvement, so with that said, let’s

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.650
get our GT back to the shop.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.120
This kit consists of a 35mm tubular front
sway bar, and a solid 22mm rear bar.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.550
As for the construction, Eibach decided to
go with a cold form, aircraft grade steel,

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.610
and then finished everything off in a very
cool red powder coat.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.640
This kit also features high quality polyurethane
bushings, complete with a greasable fitting,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.360
which is only going to prolong the life of
your bushing, and help keep any excess noise

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.260
to a minimum.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.910
Installation of the front/rear sway bar should
only take you about 2 hours but does require

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.930
you to do some crawling around underneath
the car, and removal of some stubborn bolts,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.580
so just be sure to have your favorite can
of penetrating oil on hand before you get

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.580
started.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.780
Once you have everything off the new Eibach
kit should go on relatively easily, thanks

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.680
to the new end links hardware and brackets
that are including with the kit.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.930
Now that we have our Eibach anti roll kit
installed on our 06 GT behind me, let’s

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.330
get it out of the shop 1 more time and see
the difference this kit makes.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.790
Alright, so we’re back out on the road in
our 06 GT with the Eibach sway bar kit installed,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.130
and the car just feels so much more planted
already, I mean we’re already a couple of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.320
turns in, and we’ve already got to feel
what a difference these make.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.770
I don’t want to say totally eliminated the
body roll because that would be unrealistic,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.260
but here we go, nice right hander.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.840
We’re moving along, and we’re pretty flat,
this car is cornering a lot better than it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.160
did in stock form, and it’s really, really
a lot more confident.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.660
You don’t want to hammer on it through the
turns because when you add a larger rear sway

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.870
bar like that, it will make the rear end a
little bit more happy meaning it’s probably

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.050
going to step out on you a little bit easier.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.560
But I for one like that, it makes the car
a lot more fun to drive.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.959
These sway bars without a doubt would be a
vital, vital addition to any suspension build,

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.980
and really made a world of difference right
here on our 06 GT.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.410
So that does it for the Eibach anti roll sway
bar kit, which you can find right here at

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.580
