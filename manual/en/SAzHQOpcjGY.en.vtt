00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.510
Motorola RAZR and DROID RAZR.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.120
Expected Q4 2011.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.840
The Motorola RAZR (known as the Motorola DROID
RAZR on Verizon Wireless in the US) is an

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.480
ultra-slim dual-core Android smartphone that
manages to stand out from the normal black

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.160
slabby crowd of touchscreen phones with a
design that is just as sharp as its name suggests.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.120
Motorola have taken a somewhat brave decision
to re-use the name from the classic Motorola

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.730
RAZR V3 and its many descendants.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.680
The original RAZR V3 looked really cool, but
was pretty awful to use, and Motorola's addiction

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400
to the RAZR line nearly killed the company.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.000
Obviously, this new RAZR is nothing at all
like its namesakes, but Motorola must surely

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.540
be hoping that customers remember how cool
the original V3 looked rather than how bad

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.940
it was underneath.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.320
The striking physical design sets the new
RAZR apart from other phones.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.929
At its thinnest point, the RAZR is just 7.1mm
thick.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.420
The back of the phone is covered in laser-cut
Kevlar - the sort of stuff they use for body

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.810
armour - and the screen has Gorilla Glass
on the front to protect it.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.149
The RAZR has a nanoparticle-based water repellant
system called Splashguard that covers the

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.470
case and even the electronics inside.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.440
When you get past the remarkable external
characteristics, the RAZR is a pretty powerful

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.630
beast underneath as well.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.289
Inside is a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor coupled
with 1GHz of RAM.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:53.479
On the front is a 4.3" 540 x 960 pixel super
AMOLED touchscreen.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.200
On the back is an 8 megapixel camera with
1080p HD video recording, plus there is a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.869
secondary 1.3 megapixel camera for video calling.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.420
A 16GB microSD card comes preinstalled in
the handset.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.010
This specification might sound eerily familiar..
and that's because it is almost the same as

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.320
in the upcoming Motorola ATRIX 2.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.500
Although the two handsets look very different,
perhaps the most important difference is that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.250
the RAZR is heading to Europe while the ATRIX
2 isn't.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.420
The Motorola RAZR is an Android 2.3.5 device,
the latest revision of Google's "Gingerbread"

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.790
operating system.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.170
Coincidentally, the RAZR's launch almost coincides
with the anticipated announcement of the first

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.390
Android 4.0 smartphone, and it remains to
be seen just how that operating system will

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.200
compare with this.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.530
Motorola have enhanced the OS with some of
their own applications such as Smart Actions

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.010
which allows for all sorts of clever actions
depending on location, time or who is calling

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.290
you.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.910
As the iPhone 4S shows, sometimes these advanced
software applications really do make the difference.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.350
Of course, the RAZR does everything that any
other Android phone does, so it has WiFi,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.010
GPS and access to a massive collection of
applications plus useful things like a web

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.980
browser and turn-by-turn navigation pre-installed.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.840
One thing missing is an FM radio and of course
there's no physical keyboard either in a device

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
this thin.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.690
In the US, the DROID RAZR is a CDMA device
with LTE 4G connectivity.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.510
Motorola aren't saying exactly what is in
the GSM-based RAZR that everyone else is getting,

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.230
but the screenshots indicate that it supports
HSPA+ for near-4G speeds (if your carrier

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.590
supports it).

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:58.610
This is a fairly big but relatively lightweight
device at 130 x 69 x 7.1mm and 127 grams.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.760
Inside is a very large 1780 mAh battery which
can power the Verizon Wireless model for up

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.010
to 12.5 hours talktime and 8.5 days standby
time, although we don't know the figures for

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.510
the GSM/HSPA version.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.910
As with the ATRIX 2, the RAZR can be used
with the Lapdock 100 or the upcoming Lapdock

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:28.220
500 Pro, turning the RAZR into a netbook-like
device with a proper keyboard and large display.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.139
Motorola say that the RAZR will be available
starting in November in most markets worldwide

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.760
(including Europe and North America).

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.349
The DROID RAZR will be available on Verizon
for just under $300 with a new contract, also

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.169
from November onwards.

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.530
That's about the same price as the iPhone
4S with 32GB of memory, so expect carriers

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.780
to pitch it at a similar price worldwide.
