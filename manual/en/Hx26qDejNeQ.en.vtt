00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.050
Hi everyone. Today I'll teach you about safe operation and maintenance of your BCS walk-behind

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.240
tractor. I'll also touch on the proper uses
for three of the many BCS attachments.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.440
The first thing we are going to do is fill
this machine with gas. We've let it cool down

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.279
for 5 minutes before doing this. On top here is the "dead-man" switch (aka kill switch)

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.140
and down here is the clutch. To start the
machine, you're going to squeeze the two handles

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.970
together and put the clip in. You'll want
to make sure that your machine is out of gear

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.870
and that your throttle is all the way forward.
The top lever here is the choke and to start

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.270
the machine you're going to turn it all the
way to the left. Once the machine is started,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.270
you'll want to turn the choke all the way
back to the right, which would be off. So

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.270
you can see how the machine started to move around there.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.890
Sometimes it can jump into gear

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.270
so you'll want to give it room in front and
behind for that to happen without you getting

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.270
caught under the attachments.
Today I'm going to use the rototiller attachment

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.860
to show you how the kill switch works. If
you let go of both of the handles in your

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.550
left hand, the machine will stop automatically. So with any piece of farm equipment, you want

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.470
to make sure you are dressed appropriately. So today I have earplugs to protect my ears,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.660
and then I also have closed-toed shoes, long pants, and a comfortable but snug fitting

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.170
shirt. So, we are going to start to use the
machine to plow up that field and we're going

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.940
to stay in first gear when using all of the
attachments today. We are going to go into

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.630
second gear to move around the different parts of one field and we might use third gear to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.110
go from one field to the next. If you do use
third gear, realize that it is a very fast-paced

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.850
gear and you're going to have to run after
the machine so just be careful when you do

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.810
that.
Now I'm going to briefly show you the proper

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.440
uses for three of the many BCS attachments.
The Berta rotary plow is used to break ground

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.730
in areas new to planting. This process is
called primary tillage. It is also used for

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.400
making raised beds. The rototiller is used
for breaking up soil clumps after primary

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.560
tillage. The hiller/furrower attachment has
a very specific job; certain plants, like

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.049
potatoes, need extra soil added to the bed
during the season. If you're planning on using

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.840
this attachment, you'll need the rototiller
so you can hook it to the hitch underneath

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.890
the safety hood.
For certain attachments like the sickle bar

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.519
mower, you're going to want the handlebars
to be in front of the wheels, rather than

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:50.519
following like with the rototiller. In order
to do that you're going to remove these levers,

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:57.670
squeeze the handle (in your right hand), and
rotate all the way around. Then you'll put

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.670
the levers back in place, and you're ready
to go. After every day in the field, it's

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.319
important to wash the machine. The first thing
we're going to do is take knife and take out

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.849
anything that's wrapped around the shaft and
be especially careful to remove material that

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.849
wrapped really close to the bearings here.
Then, once that's all cleaned out, we're going

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.120
to use this hose to hose out the inside of
the safety shield and around the tines. You

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.609
need to be careful to remove any material
that's wrapped around shafts or moving parts.

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.739
This includes this attachment, as well as
all other attachments, and the drive wheel

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.319
shafts back here. If this type of maintenance
is not performed, you won't be able to use

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.439
your machine for very long.
When transporting the tiller, you'll need

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.290
to use two tie-downs. We found the best way
to use the tie-downs is to put them through

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.599
the wheels so that the tiller is secure on
the trailer.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.930
Before the start of each day, there's a few
things you need to check before you can get

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.739
going. The first is your engine oil. So you're
going to unscrew the dipstick, pull it out,

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:14.239
and wipe it off with a clean cloth. Then you'll
carefully screw it back in and then screw

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.970
it back out. To make sure that your reading
is accurate, you'll want to make sure that

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.680
your machine is on a level surface � we
have ours blocked up here. So we are checking

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.530
to see if the level of the oil is about three-quarters
of the way up the dipstick, and we look good.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.350
If it was less than that, you would add more.
The next thing you want to check is your air

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.350
filter which is back here in this black box.
So we'll unscrew the cross-shaped nut and

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.970
pull off the black cover and we'll see the
pre-filter. It looks pretty clean but if it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.760
were dusty we could either blow air from the
inside out or we could rinse it and then let

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.780
it dry before we start working. And the last
thing you want to check at the start of every

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.490
day is your tire pressure to make sure there
is not any sag in the tires.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.900
Additionally, there are things you need to
change once a year. The first is your engine

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.910
oil. Again, you'll want to change that out
once a year. And additionally, you have to

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.690
do that about every 100 hours which, for a
commercial farm, would be about the mid-season

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.790
that it's being used in. The next thing is
that you'll have to replace your spark plug

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.720
which is back here between the air filter
and the engine. You'll also want to check

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.890
your gear oil � which is back here � and
add lubricant to any moving linkages like

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.380
the PTO or the gear shift levers. And then
the last thing you'll have to do once a year

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.340
is change your fuel filter. And if you have
any more questions about specifications based

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.340
on their model or any other questions you
may have, then you'll want to consult the

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.760
book. But, if you do those things, then your
machine should be well taken care of.
