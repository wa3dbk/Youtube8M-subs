Oh, hi. Glad to see you're back again at Expert
Village. My name is Kat Litrenta and I am

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:12.320
a professional entertainer. And I've been
taking you through on this segment, on how

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.430
to be a big band 1940's star. And you, know,
there's not really much you can do to the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.640
hair other than going and buying a wig, maybe
with a roll in the front. If you want to take

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.460
a look 40's films, of some of those wonderful
Joan Crawford films, where she takes her hair

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.910
and then make a roll out of the front of it
like that, and it's all rolled back. Wow,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.630
don't worry about that. What I suggest is
go and get a snood or, what they might call

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.950
it in modern times, a hair net. This hair
net comes in lots of different colors and

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.860
they're very inexpensive. And if you put them
on your hair, just right, you can put them

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:08.460
all around the back, stick your hair in, what
it does is makes a roll of your hair. They

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.720
call it a snood. Well, now you've got your
snood on. Stick some of that behind your ears,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.670
because I've got an awful lot of hair. And
you've got this little bitty piece up on top

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.510
here and you're going to say, what am I going
to do with that? Well, what we're going to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.560
do with that is, well, first of all, you know
what we could spray that out of the way. Let's

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.020
spray that out of the way. We haven't used
any spray, there you go, that'll keep that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.700
hair out of your eyes. We're going to cover
the top of that snood with the cap. And the

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.409
cap, part of the costume, finishes it off.
I mean, is that just adorable or what? You

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.340
got your snood with your rolled hair and you've
got your overseas cap. We're going to pin

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.819
that on so it doesn't fall off. Bye-bye.
