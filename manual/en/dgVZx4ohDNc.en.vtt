00:00:00.228 --> 00:00:01.366
- Hey guys.

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.479
Spring is the season for brunches

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.283
so today, I wanted to arm
you with a really easy,

00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:08.862
fabulous recipe that looks impressive

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:10.834
but comes together in minutes.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:13.904
It is my quiche cup with lemon-dill cream

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:15.886
topped with smoked salmon.

00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:18.265
It may look like a mouthful
but I'm telling you

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:20.539
they are the easiest
things to put together

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.957
and the whole thing can
be made the day before.

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:24.542
My kind of party food.

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:25.860
Let me show you how to make

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.654
a signature brunch item at
our house, the quiche cup.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:31.943
Because we are serving
these as a main course,

00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:34.300
I do like to use a jumbo muffin tin

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.535
because I find that you get
a better portion that way

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:38.911
but you could also use a
regular-sized muffin tin

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:40.720
and maybe serve everybody two.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.955
For the base of our cups,
we are going to be working

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:44.374
with phyllo dough.

00:00:44.374 --> 00:00:45.830
If you've never worked with it before,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.045
it is an interesting product.

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:51.783
It basically comes in
sheets, typically 9x14.

00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:53.835
You want to make sure
that it's nice and thawed

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:55.095
before you work with it.

00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:57.248
I like to just pop it
in my fridge overnight

00:00:57.248 --> 00:00:58.703
and then by the time the morning comes,

00:00:58.703 --> 00:00:59.954
it's nice and thawed.

00:01:00.386 --> 00:01:02.856
We're only gonna use
about six to eight sheets,

00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:06.208
then we are going to cut it in half

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:09.866
and then we're gonna take each
half and cut that in half.

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.247
One of the things I love about this recipe

00:01:11.247 --> 00:01:13.563
is there's no waste, you
can use the whole sheet

00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:15.493
so I designed it specifically for that.

00:01:15.493 --> 00:01:16.997
Then we're gonna take some melted butter

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:18.682
and grease each of our muffin wells.

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.092
Then we're gonna take a
stack of our phyllo dough

00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:24.408
and we're going to place
it in our muffin tin

00:01:24.408 --> 00:01:26.785
going one way and then
take the other stack

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.714
and have it going the other way.

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:30.828
Almost like making a little X,

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:33.154
and you'll see it'll create
this really nice, sort of like,

00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:35.502
tulip effect, almost like a little flower.

00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:37.879
This recipe is designed to feed 12 people

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.387
because any time you're having a brunch,

00:01:39.387 --> 00:01:40.964
you usually have a bit of a crowd

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:43.686
but you could easily
cut this recipe in half.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.274
Then you're just gonna
brush your phyllo dough

00:01:45.274 --> 00:01:47.691
with a little bit more melted butter

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.097
and then you can set that aside.

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:52.446
Then we're going to prepare our filling,

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:55.204
so in a large bowl, you're
gonna crack in 12 eggs

00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:57.910
and then to the eggs, you're gonna add

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.073
three-quarters cup of heavy cream.

00:02:01.277 --> 00:02:03.593
You can go ahead and whisk that
all up just beating the eggs

00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:05.698
and making sure you have
a nice, smooth mixture

00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:07.298
and then we're gonna add some seasoning.

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:09.400
We're gonna add a teaspoon of salt

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:12.135
and some freshly cracked pepper.

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:18.072
In the base of our cups,
we are going to add

00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:21.099
a tablespoon of mozzarella cheese

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.391
and a teaspoon of freshly minced chives.

00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:26.779
I like to add the cheese
and the chives this way

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.104
because that assures that
everybody gets a nice amount

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:31.521
of cheese and chives in their quiche cup.

00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:33.618
If you added it all to
the batter, sometimes some

00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:35.609
gets overly poured with
the cheese and the chives

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.368
and other cups get skimped

00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:38.829
so this is the way to avoid that.

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:41.139
Then we're gonna take our egg batter

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.028
and you can pour it into a pitcher,

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:46.543
which is going to make this a
lot easier to fill these cups.

00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:49.574
Then we're gonna fill each
one with the egg batter

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:51.930
about three-quarters of the way full.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.331
Then you're gonna pop these in the oven

00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:57.965
at 375 degrees Fahrenheit
for just about 12 minutes.

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:00.387
You know that they're done
when the edges start to turn

00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:02.926
golden brown and you see
the egg in the center

00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:04.572
starts to puff up.

00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:06.604
If you feel like your phyllo
dough is getting too brown,

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:09.489
you can also just place some
aluminum foil on top of it,

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.274
just to allow those eggs a
chance to actually cook inside.

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:15.298
While it's in the oven, we
can make our lemon dill cream

00:03:15.298 --> 00:03:18.125
that's going to be used as a
garnish on top of our cups.

00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:23.319
In a small bowl, you're going
to add 2/3 cup of sour cream.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.183
I have heard a lot of you
tell me that you can't get

00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.776
sour cream in your country,
so you could swap that out

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:30.722
with either creme fraiche
or you could use plain,

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:33.484
non-fat Greek yogurt that's unflavored.

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.386
And then all we're gonna
do is add a teaspoon

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:37.702
of freshly grated lemon zest

00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:40.524
and tablespoon of freshly minced dill.

00:03:41.443 --> 00:03:44.300
Just whisk that up and
you can set that aside.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.138
Once your quiche cups are fully baked,

00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:47.825
you can take them out of the oven

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:49.979
and allow them to cool and at this stage,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.133
if you were doing this
the day before your party,

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:55.162
you could just place some
aluminum foil gently on top

00:03:55.162 --> 00:03:56.646
and pop it in the fridge.

00:03:56.646 --> 00:03:57.887
Leave them in the muffin tins,

00:03:57.887 --> 00:03:59.544
this is what makes this so easy.

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:03.152
Then the day of the party,
preheat your over to 300 degrees,

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:06.768
take the foil off, pop them
in the oven for 15 minutes

00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:08.597
and they will reheat beautifully.

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:11.389
Don't be alarmed if the
phyllo dough starts to become

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.225
more pliable, it will actually
crisp back up in the oven

00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:15.464
when you go to reheat it.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.964
The way that I like to serve
these is just place them all

00:04:17.964 --> 00:04:20.008
on an elevated cake stand,

00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:23.198
give a little dollop of
the lemon cream on top.

00:04:23.198 --> 00:04:25.351
I know this sounds like
such a strange combination,

00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:27.077
the egg and the sour cream and the salmon,

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:29.861
I'm telling you it is the
most delicious combination,

00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:31.325
you've gotta trust me on this.

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:33.010
In fact, my husband loves this so much,

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.651
I actually double the
recipe for the lemon cream

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:38.252
to serve it on the side, it's that good.

00:04:38.252 --> 00:04:41.177
Then you can take a little
piece of smoked salmon,

00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:42.336
just kind of roll it up

00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:44.591
so that it looks pretty and presentable,

00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:46.886
place that on top of the cream

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.244
and then the finishing
touch is just to take

00:04:48.244 --> 00:04:51.497
a little sprig of fresh
dill and place it on top.

00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.713
You will see, you will have
one darling little quiche cup

00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:56.294
that is so delicious.

00:04:57.295 --> 00:04:59.591
I love the flavor
combinations in this recipe

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.231
because you have that
flakiness of the phyllo dough

00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:05.421
mixed with that warm, velvety
egg custard underneath,

00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:08.481
topped with that lemon cream
sauce and that smoked salmon,

00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:11.528
really such a great recipe for a brunch.

00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:12.829
I hope you guys give this one a try

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.394
and let me know what you think.

00:05:14.394 --> 00:05:16.588
I certainly think it'll
make a big impression

00:05:16.588 --> 00:05:18.132
at your next brunch.

00:05:18.132 --> 00:05:19.798
So, if it's up to you to host Mothers Day,

00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:21.971
a bridal shower or a baby shower,

00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:23.656
I hope you give this recipe a try.

00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:26.051
I will see you back here next week

00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:27.676
for another delicious recipe.

00:05:27.676 --> 00:05:29.056
Until then, bye.

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:33.750
(folksy music)
