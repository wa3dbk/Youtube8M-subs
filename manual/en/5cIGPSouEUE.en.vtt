&gt;&gt; RYAN: Today, I'm going on a tour of London in the most iconic vehilcle on the streets.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.000
A Taxicab

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.360
alright, let's go check out Westminster Abbey

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:27.874
what a perfect time to roll up on Westminster Abbey I love hearing those bells this is incredible

00:00:27.874 --> 00:00:29.144
Let's keep it going!

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.960
What I love most about this tour is you don't just sit in the back of a taxicab the whole time

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.040
you actually get out and my guide slash driver Jerry is showing me all around the secret spots in London

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.580
that I would have no clue about

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.660
as you're walking through this area you walk past all these lamps

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.500
and you think that's just a lamp right, nothing special but these mark royal London

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.600
and they all have some sort of a royal connection

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.496
this is not your typical hat shop this is Lock and Co. this has been here since the sixteen hundreds

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.840
and Queen Elizabeth actually brought the Imperial Crown here to get adjusted

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.154
because it didn't quite fit her head

00:01:06.154 --> 00:01:10.160
you know those choose your own adventure books well that's kind of how the taxi works

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.580
you can choose your own itinerary you can tell the driver I want to go here and here

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.053
and they will take you there and that's what makes this so much fun you get to customize it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.960
wow this is VIP access to the Tower Bridge

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.520
Jerry has just taken me to another gem here in London that I would have no idea this was here

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.740
look at this it's like a totally modern cafe right here and then you turn around

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.120
we have an ancient Roman wall

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.640
now Jerry has taken me to a place that is not a secret at all but it is very beautiful

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.320
this is the Tower of London

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.600
it's so well preserved it looks like it was built yesterday

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
Jerry thank you so much for sharing your expertise with me I had a great time
