00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.690
What is hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and
what does it mean for you and your baby?

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.840
You've just had a baby.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.690
Come join me as I share with you this great
information.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.690
Hi.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.690
I'm Gerry Oginski.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.140
I'm a New York medical malpractice and personal
injury trial attorney practicing law in the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.410
state of New York.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.970
You've just given birth and through testing
the doctors have told you that your baby has

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.090
brain damage.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.210
In fact, there's a medical term that they
told you called hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.150
And you want to know what does that really
mean?

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.079
Well let me break it down for you.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.039
Hypoxic means a lack of decrease of oxygen.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.930
Ischemia means a decreased or diminished amount
of blood flow.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.780
Encephalopathy has to do with the brain and
typically an injury that has occurred to the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
brain.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.289
Now all three words together, hypoxic ischemic
encephalopathy, means that there was a decreased

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.140
amount of blood flow and a decreased amount
of blood flow that got to the baby's brain.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.079
And as a result of that the baby now has some
type of brain damage.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.089
When a baby has been diagnosed with brain
damage at the time of birth, there are many

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.739
things that can occur.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.309
One of which is they can have delayed milestones.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.570
They may not reach certain milestones that
children do as they get older and older.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.570
They might be able to walk.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.890
They may not be able to crawl.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.050
They may not be able to verbalize and speak
when they're supposed to.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.250
And now they may be delayed or it may not
occur for a long time.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.670
They may be confined to a wheelchair.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.070
They may have problems with their motor control.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.450
And now as a result of that, you'll need to
get the baby further care and treatment.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.180
There may be problems with the child's ability
to learn.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.020
And now you'll have to get the child specific
services, whether it's speech therapy, occupational

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.030
therapy or specific things related to his
(or her) inability to learn.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.920
Now why do I share this information with you?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.210
I share it with you because certain things
may have occurred at the time of labor and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.360
delivery that have now got you worried.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.670
Maybe the baby was born with seizures.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.670
Maybe the baby was born blue and was not bleeding,
needed to be resuscitated.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.750
And now you're told later on that the baby
has hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, a form

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.030
of brain damage.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.950
And now you're wondering what does this mean
for me and the baby.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.820
Well as always, if you have legal questions,
what I encourage you to do is pick up the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.820
phone and call.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.310
I can answer your legal questions.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.280
This is something that I do every single day
and I welcome your call.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:17.879
You can reach me at 516-487-8207 or by email

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.909

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.379
I'm Gerry Oginski, here in New York.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.269
