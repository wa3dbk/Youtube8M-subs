Hi my name is Melody Mann and on behalf of
Expert Village we are going to try and make

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.019
some batter today, it is real simple, easy
to do, ingredients you have around your house.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:23.060
First we start of with a 1/2 cup of all purpose
flour. 2 tablespoon of cornstarch, a little

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:32.619
bit of baking soda, some salt, some water.
And as I'm putting them in the bowl I'll tell

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.629
you how much is in there. Right now we have
2 tablespoons of oil just regular salad oil,

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.269
cooking oil, just some oil to make it mix
well. Let's take some of the wet ingredients

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.579
and start them off. Alright here we have a
1/4 of a cup of water, we have 2 tablespoon

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.909
of salad oil, Wesson oil any type of oil you
have around the house that is edible. Mix

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:04.930
those 2 together. Take some of these ingredients,
this is our salt and what did I say we had

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.049
in here a 1/4 of a tablespoon of salt I throw
that in there. Now the whole time we are doing

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.149
this you might want to start mixing just to
be sure that things dissolve without being

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.530
piled on top of each of other and not dissolving.
I try to do this one handed here. Okay here

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:36.630
we have a 1/4 of a tablespoon of baking soda
put that in, make sure that it is mix. Here

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:45.632
we have 2 tablespoon of cornstarch and again
you want to mix this just a little bit. We

00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:57.710
would be mixing it a lot more in a minute
and we have some all purpose flour and this

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:07.320
was 1/4 of a cup. Now if you have a whisk
you could use that but it would take a small

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.781
whisk at this point we are making a small
amount just for demonstration. We want it

00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:26.370
to be the consistency of pancake batter and
this would be great for dipping mushrooms,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.620
fruits, vegetables, anything that you thing
you might want to deep fry. Including cheeses,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:43.510
fish, anything you want to cook up. Now we
are about the right consistency if you want

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.889
some more this how to use this batter look
in the next segment.
