00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.580
Howdy folks on todays mini food if you do
not know what that is it is when I attempt

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.420
to scale food down to the size of a plate
like this, I have already done a pizza, spaghetti

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.890
Bolognese, stuff like that, I am going to
be trying to make a pavlova the size of this

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.100
mini plate right here so without further a
do lets get cracking I think it will work

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.170
we will see how we get on so folks with any
type of pavlova what we generally do is get

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.270
the dish that you are planning on serving
on so in my case this little bear plate whack

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.770
it down on some baking parchment and just
use it as a little bit of a guide so I am

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.110
just going to get this sharpie pen and work
my way around it to make a little template

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.800
that we can use to build our meringue up on
so you see this here, we will make our meringue

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.899
and just stagger it up. Right so we will start
off this is one egg white pretty much the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.820
minimum amount of egg I could easily get you
can get those cartons of egg white I could

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.070
of reduced by half but one egg was simpler
so all I am going to do is whisk it up, it

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.390
may take a little while just going to use
an electric whisk really oh my gosh an electric

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.449
whisk would have been a better choice but
my arm, feel the guns baby it is getting there.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.140
Ok so it is whisked up and nice and stiff
now so will gradually add In my sugar about

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.060
half of it at a time, it is quite amazing
how much one egg white can give you really

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.520
isn�t it. I�ve just added my second part
of the sugar and I am not sure if you can

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600
see this but it is getting nice and glossy
which is exactly what I want and that sugar

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.700
is dissolving in there perfect times. And
just to help it thicken you may have seen

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:33.080
a big splodge there a little cornflour going
in and also a little drop of vanilla extract

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.509
right there, just a very small drop whoosh
of vanilla just for that little bit of cheeky

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.509
flavouring whisk this through and we are ready
to put it on our mould template thing as you

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.870
will see I did make a little bit of a mess
with the cornflour then apologies about that

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.729
but it is ready and we have our template here,
lets stack it up. So my weapon of choice to

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.850
do this is a teaspoon just working it around
the outside edge initially and then trying

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.610
to get some height on it. There we go that
is the most I am going to be able to get out

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.810
of it but we are just going to have to make
a little rim around the edge here just so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.370
my filling the cream and peach I am going
to use will sit perfectly in the middle. Right

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.010
so it is ready to go in the oven hopefully
you will see I have tried to get a little

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.430
crater there now a normal pavlova takes about
10 minutes in the oven my very messy oven

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.980
which I will tidy up right now but we are
going to whack this in there and give it around

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.069
ten minutes initially obviously I do not really
know, but in it goes and we will turn the

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.999
heat off cornflour protest right there, we
will turn the heat off and let it cool down

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:39.549
and dry off naturally. While that is drying
off I have a peach from a tin I think even

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.660
half of it just mushed up with a fork like
that it is going to be plenty so I will have

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.230
to get my tweezers out after I have squished
it like that wow I am really pulverating this

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.150
peach you can see how just that amount on
its own should be perfect for our mini pavlova

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.169
yeah baby. Right folks lets step away from
peach mode for just a moment it has been ten

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.079
minutes and just to show you it has completely
firmed up so what I am going to do rather

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.730
than it being an hour it will only be 10 mins
how cool is that I am just gonna turn my oven

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.560
off and let it cool naturally then we get
to build it with our peach and a little bit

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.909
of cream that I am whipping up. Right then
folks so here is my pavlova as you can see

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:22.169
it is very lightly browned and still stayed
the same size which is what we are after and

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.430
what we said about leaving it in the oven
and turning it off that has completely dried

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.099
it out because of the size of it it only took
about another ten minutes or so we have a

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.849
nice little crater there, so lets fill it
up. This is just some cream that I have whipped

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.870
up with a little bit of icing sugar just to
go in the middle of it oh yeah right then

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.379
folks that is looking amazing I have plonked
the apple down just for scale and I am just

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.060
using my tweezers to add those little bits
of mashed up peach we did earlier on just

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.749
plonking that on I think it just needs a little
dusting of icing sugar just to finish it off,

00:03:54.749 --> 00:04:00.159
here we go oh my gosh that is looking good.
And there we have it folks, our mini peach

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.689
pavlova sat on the mini plate like so it�s
the same size as you will see I have enough

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:10.159
to make another 5 or 6 and just like the mini
pizza or spaghetti Bolognese these would make

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.309
amazing little treats at a party of if you
want to have a mini party and it is kind of

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:18.109
cool being the opposite of giant food I kind
of like doing these videos and you love them

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.780
too so if you have a mini food you want to
see let me know down below but lets have a

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:30.520
taste of this right now hmmm all in one. What
can I say it is tasting just like a pavlova

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.169
because it is a pavlova just shrunk down on
a mini scale so for any of you that are out

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.919
there on a diet maybe you should take the
mini food option rather than the large one

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.420
going forward but check it out guys if you
do have a go send me a picture @myvirginkitchen

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:55.710
and I hope you enjoyed this mini food extravaganza.
