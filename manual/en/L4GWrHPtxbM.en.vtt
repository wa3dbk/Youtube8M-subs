Hi this is Tommy Jacob, Creative Director
of Ghost Recon Future Soldier’s Multiplayer.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.579
I’m here to give you some details on Arctic
Strike DLC, including 3 new multiplayer maps

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.770
and the Stockade game type.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.640
Players wait in the Stockade in the order
they are killed. A player is released each

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.280
time an enemy is eliminated. Every few minutes
an objective appears for each team that, if

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.780
captured, will release your entire team from
the Stockade.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.690
The overall objective in Stockade is simple:
kill without being killed, eliminate the entire

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.060
enemy team before time expires. In the event
of a tie, teamwork points are used to determine

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.030
the winner. Stockade is playable on all 13
multiplayer maps.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.940
Here are some pro tips to get you started.
Use the objective as bait. Ambush your enemy

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.140
when they try and free their teammates. Don’t
use your objective if only one teammate is

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.390
captured. And finally, one data hack almost
guarantees a victory.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.509
There are three new larger multiplayer maps
in Arctic Strike: Riot, Evicted, and Skyline.

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.890
Riot puts players on the streets of downtown
Moscow. The empty streets provide long engagements

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.659
as the enemy darts between burned out vehicles.
The tight corners of the alleys provide excellent

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.149
locations to ambush your enemies with a shotgun
or a well placed piece of equipment.

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.249
Evicted continues the fight on the streets
of Moscow as battle erupts in a sleepy residential

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:28.920
neighborhood. With long alleys between the
large apartment complexes, snipers are a valuable

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.700
resource. Sensors and UAV’s are less effective
in this expansive location. Communication

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.600
is key to track and control enemy movements.
Skyline is a two level CQB nightmare. Connected

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.479
by tunnels and stairwells, the limited access
points provide excellent locations to set

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.310
traps. Snipers exchange fire between towers
and cover their teammates as they advance

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.490
into enemy territory. A skilled UCAV or UAV
pilot can push the enemy out of the open area

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.509
and into the kill zone.
