00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
If the Bible were actually written by God,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.400
it would look very different from the book so many Christians revere.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.500
You would think anything written by or inspired by the most powerful being in the universe,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.700
would be equally as amazing,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.000
but it's not.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.900
The blogger Southern Skeptic did an excellent job of explaining why

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.300
-- you can see the link below --

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.900
and he gave me permission to share and expand upon his ideas.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, how do we know the Bible is not a well-written book?

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.800
It's not well-organized.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.700
The Bible is a huge mess.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.400
I mean, it's written in chronological order,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.100
not thematic order.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.100
And that might be okay if the Bible were a history book,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.100
but not so much when it's a guidebook for life.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.300
And that's especially a huge problem when Christians use the Bible to justify their beliefs and actions.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.900
They have to flip through the book all over the place to find passages that support their views.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.800
You want passages about love? Marriage? Homosexuality? Abortion?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.100
You won't find them in one spot.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.400
There's not even a helpful index.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.100
And this forces Christians to quote verses out of context all the time.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.000
There are no pictures.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.600
I know, not all books need pictures,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.400
but sometimes diagrams and charts can be very helpful.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100
I mean, even Lord of the Rings came with a map.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.500
Where's the diagram of a family tree instead of a long list of begats?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.000
What about a timeline to help you keep track of what all the various characters are doing all the time?

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.400
I'm just saying. It would be helpful.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.300
It's not very specific.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.000
When it comes to things you're not supposed to do,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.800
the list is scattered everywhere.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.300
A more helpful book would just include a check list of things you're supposed to do and things you're not supposed to do.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.100
And maybe that list would include page numbers, just in case you want to go to the actual document for reference.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200
And you know, maybe a sidebar to let you know when killing other people in the name of your faith is okay.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.300
It would be helpful.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.000
It's not easy to understand.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.400
We shouldn't need theologians and pastors to explain all of this material to us if God felt it was that important.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.700
It's not like their doing a good job of it anyway, since all these different Christian pastors interpret the book in so many different ways.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.400
I mean, you show me a hundred Christians, I'll show you a hundred different Christianities.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.700
If all these people think God is saying very different things,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.700
that's partially his fault as a communicator.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.500
I mean, he should've been more explicit in terms of saying what he wants from us.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.800
It's not consistent.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.900
There are so many contradictions throughout the Bible.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.500
And it's not like they're hard to spot. I mean, even Genesis 1 and 2 have difficulties reconciling with each other.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.800
And the Gospels have contradicting accounts of the details of Jesus' life.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.200
I remember J. K Rowling made a mistake somewhere near the end of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.700
and the fans picked up on it right away, and they called her out on it.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.100
And you know what she did?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.000
She apologized. She admitted it was a mistake.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.700
And she said she would correct it for later editions of the book.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.700
That's how you handle a mistake.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.900
But instead of fixing the Bible, where is clearly wrong and clearly contradictory,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.500
people just keep replicating it.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.200
God doesn't need a copy machine.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.900
He needs an editor.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.200
It doesn't make any clear predictions.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.500
The Bible makes this vague prophecies like, "The Messiah will come soon" or

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.300
"We're going to have a war".

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.600
But there are no specific predictions that you would have needed some sort of insider knowledge to figure out.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.200
There's a lot of reverse engineering going on to make sure that our modern reality retroactively fit what the Bible supposedly said.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.500
There are people who think the end of the world is coming soon because of biblical clues.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.600
And people who think Jesus is coming back to earth in their lifetime.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.900
They're never right, but they base their predictions on vague passages in the Bible.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.300
Maybe if the Bible predicted a national disaster

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.700
with, you know, dates and locations, and the number of victims,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.900
then skeptics like myself would have to take that book a little more seriously.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.600
God has the same psychic abilities as Nostradamus.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.000
You can read into it whatever you want,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.000
but the prophecies are vague enough that they will eventually be fulfilled by someone

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.600
if you're willing to look hard enough.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.600
That's just not impressive.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.700
It lacks knowledge that humans of the time could not have had.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.500
The Bible is only as scientifically accurate as the people of the time.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.200
Isn't that a coincidence?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.900
It says nothing about modern astronomy, or mathematics, or medicine.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.600
There are no passages about light bulbs, or vaccines, or the sun being a star with the Earth revolving around it.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.300
And there's no mention of the United States.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.500
It's exactly the sort of book that you would expect people of that time to have written.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.400
In other words, it's just not that special.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.900
The characters make no sense.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.900
If you read really great books,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.400
the main characters are very complex.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.300
You know, the heroes often have flaws and the bad guys sometimes have good intentions.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.800
In that sense, the Bible doesn't even bother with complex characters.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.300
God is always good no matter what.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.100
Even when he kills people with reckless abandon,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.300
it's for the greater good.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.300
Jesus is supposed to be without sin.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.400
And the redemption stories aren't really even that inspirational.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.200
Isaac, who did nothing wrong, is almost a victim of slaughter at the hands of his father.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.400
Job suffers and suffers for the crime of being faithful to God.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.500
It really makes you wonder who you should be rooting for.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.800
It's too repetitive.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.200
The Bible tells the same story multiple times

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.700
and it doesn't even bother to keep all those versions consistent with each other.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.700
A good writer tells the story once, properly, and then moves on.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.100
Or if you're like William Faulkner writing "Absalom, Absalom!" maybe you tell the same story from different perspectives

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.500
and add more to each layer of the story.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.900
The Bible doesn't do that.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.500
Just look at the genealogy sections as an example. I mean, they are a chore to read.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:32.200
Surely you can explain lineage in a more interesting way than, "This person gave birth to that person". And "That person gave birth to somebody else".

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.000
And on and on for pages on end.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.100
It goes too far with the stories.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.100
If you wanted to convince people to take the Bible seriously,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.800
the stories would be a little more plausible.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.000
And yet there are so many miracles

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.100
that deny any semblance of plausibility.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.700
Between talking snakes, and virgin births, and great floods, and people almost living to the age of a thousand,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.100
it's a wonder anyone could take this book seriously.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.100
God should've backed off.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.000
Instead, he jumped the shark in the first chapter.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.800
The Bible isn't a good book. It sure as hell isn't a great book.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.700
It's cut-and-paste mythology thrown together by men thousands of years ago.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.500
All the action takes place in a very small speck of the world.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.400
All the action takes place in a tiny little speck of the world.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.300
If the Bible was a better written book, it'd be more convincing, too.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.500
As it stands, there's a reason a lot of people are leaving the church.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.200
And in part, that's because a lot of them realize that the Bible isn't worth taking all that seriously.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.600
As the saying goes: "The Bible is just fan fiction based on an ancient game of telephone".

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.600
