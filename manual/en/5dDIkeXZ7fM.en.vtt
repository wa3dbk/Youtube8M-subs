00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.120
Método Abellán. Cajón flamenco

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.380
Initiation level. Catalan rumba

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.200
Rhythm and variations 1 and 2

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.420
Let's start with the Catalan rumba

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.160
We are going to start with a basic rhythm

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.080
Which sounds like this

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.560
In the first variation we are going to do

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.940
The last group of four hits

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.960
Accentuates all the high hits

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.820
And looks like this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.400
If we combine the rhythm with this variation

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.620
In the second variation that we are going to see

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.760
The last four hits are low ones

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.180
And sounds like this

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.840
Now we combine rhythm with this variation
