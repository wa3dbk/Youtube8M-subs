00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.669
I want to talk about what the Bible has to
say about dating. You know one of the first

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.870
things that comes to my mind when I hear this,
what the Bible has to say about dating, is

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.770
the Bible is clear, Corinthians, where he
says that we should not fellowship with unbelievers.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.480
That as a believer we should not be - in fact
he uses the word yoke. Yoke together. Let

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.820
not a believer be yoked together with an unbeliever.
So that gives a picture of a yoke of oxen

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:41.219
being contained together with the apparatus
that they use to link the oxen together connected

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.800
to the plow. So as they walk together, they
are connected, leading the plow. See and there

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.620
is such a closeness, such a tightness and
such a level of intimacy there between the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.120
two. They can't get away from one another.
And so the Bible is clear in using this picture

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.310
that an unbeliever and a believer should never
be so closely linked together so intimate

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.850
with one another. He said simply because they
have no fellowship, there is nothing in common

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.391
between light and darkness, between goodness
and evil. He said there is nothing in common,

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:21.840
so you say well what does this mean, I can't
have a friend that's an unbeliever? Well sure

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.930
you can, Christian, sure you can, but what
he's saying is that there is such a level

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.601
of intimacy that one should never attempt
to go in a dating relationship with an unbeliever

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:39.920
if in fact you are a believer. And why? Well
I'll tell you why. In the days of Solomon,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.750
the Bible talks about how Solomon had a number
of wives, many wives, many concubines and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.800
princesses and things of the sort. And one
of the things that they did is that they began

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.410
to pull him away from his relationship with
God. Pull him away from worshiping God. See

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.640
this is one of the reasons why God instituted
in the Old Testament that they were neither

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.289
 - the troops of Israel were not allowed to
give their sons to foreign women in marriage.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.019
Nor were they able to or should they take
foreign women for their own sons and daughters

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.170
in marriage. Simply because of that happening,
what would happen, the unbeliever would begin

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.239
to pull the believer away from those things
that they once held sacred and dear. And so

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.269
that's an important part of dating as believers,
we need to understand that we must - we must

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.260
not come together and be yoked and be so intimate
with someone that simply doesn't believe like

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.579
we believe.
