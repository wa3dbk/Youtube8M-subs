Guys, I found the ideal way to make Vietnamese
Iced coffee. Traditionally, Vietnamese iced

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:14.610
coffee is made with hot coffee then cooled
down with ice. Seems kind of counterintuitive

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.279
to me. So today I’m going to be making it
with the popular cold brew method so we get

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.140
a nice and concentrated jolt!

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.830
I’m going to start by using my quart-sized
mason jar and fill it up with 3 ½ cups of

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.870
water then pour in ½ cup of ground coffee.
I’m using this Cafe du Monde brand, perfect

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.400
for making Vietnamese coffee. It has a distinct
blend of Chicory and coffee that’s used

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.360
in most Vietnamese restaurants. Of course
if you can’t find this brand, you can always

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.290
substitute with a medium to dark blend of
coffee. I’ll let this steep for 8 hours

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.830
to overnight so that it’s ready to make
in the morning.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.300
Growing up, this was my dad’s favorite drink
in the morning. I remember he used to make

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.360
it before taking me to school.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.960
When it’s ready I’ll just strain my coffee
through a nut milk bag to remove the grounds.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.531
Then it’s time to prepare my Vietnamese
Iced Coffee! I’ll take 2 tbsp of condensed

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:19.080
milk and pour it into the bottom of my cup
- this is the sweet and sticky milk, not to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.930
be confused with evaporated milk. Condensed
milk is basically cow’s milk with all the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.680
water removed. It’s delicious! Now I’ll
add in some ice, then fill the cup up with

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.750
my bold and concentrated cold brew. Then I’ll
mix it up and enjoy!

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.891
This drink is sure to wake anybody up in the
morning! Got a big presentation or test? This

00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:45.230
drink is for you!

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:58.670
Thanks for watching and I hope you like this
method. I’ll see you guys at the next coffee

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:16.770
break. Bye!
