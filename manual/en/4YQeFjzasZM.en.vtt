family and friends. [Cheers from his friends]

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.589
Speaking of family

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.199

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:17.849
I love me some babies

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.599
so I thought we'd do a family
recipe for all the new parents out there.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:30.799
[Amidst Cheers] Alright, 

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:33.120

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.640
find good barbecue.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.490
Now you know i'm all for cooking fast
and delicious, but when it comes to

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.800
barbecues; slow is a way to go.  I'd like you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.300
Now once you've pulled your pork

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.160
you gotta check it for the bone.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.140
Go ahead darlin'.  I like...

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.619
BONELESS [she licks her fingers]

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.530
Good Food is Messy. [laughs]

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.520
Now, put your pork in the blender.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.020
Add your applesauce.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.500
Gives a texture.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.360
Plus, babies just love them some applesauce.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.080
Now, if you wanna party Late Night, add
some beer as a sedative.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.320

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.690
Blend it til it's Gerber!

Your baby is gonna thank you.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.760
That's 800 calories a spoonful.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.340
All-American food for an All-American
baby!

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.859
Dig in Y'all. [Rock n' roll kicks back in]

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.739
