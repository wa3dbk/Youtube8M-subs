00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.619
&lt;Music&gt;

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:10.760
Steve Smithrud: What we’re doing here is,
this is the construction of the 2011 Theta

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.030
Tau parade homecoming float.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.830
&lt;Music&gt;

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.689
Steve Smithrud: Anyone whose interested comes
and we just meet on couches and sit around

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.689
and talk about what we want to see and what
we think meets with the theme.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.520
And the theme this year is red, blue, and
bold.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.859
You know, celebrating the bold history of
the University of Arizona.

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:40.660
Parker Barrett Imperl: Our idea of the boldness
is we are going to have a rocket going over

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.410
Old Main, which is our gigantic structure
we are building right now, which is essentially

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.890
our entire float.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.170
So we have a float committee and that’s
comprised of a bunch of members, but it’s

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.470
got three basic heads to it and so they kind
of foresee everything.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.219
They’re like the foremen up here if you
will and then all of our member help when

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.219
they can.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.070
Andreko Lennartz: It’s really just all about
communication and seeing what other people,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.180
um, what their ideas are and being open minded
to new ideas and seeing if you can snowball

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.790
with a simple idea, because its really hard
sometimes to come up with a good idea and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880
something that we haven’t already done in
the past.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.200
Steve Smithrud: Well we have a longstanding
tradition of taking pride in the construction

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.210
of our floats; we’ve won for several years.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.560
But it’s not only that, we see ourselves
as engineers and part of that is doing what

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.240
you can and celebrating the U of A as well
as just building something that people can

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.890
go, “Wow, that’s so cool.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.890
How did they do it?”

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.470
Parker Barrett Imperl: Without this I don’t
know how people would know about us.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.960
We have a lot of involvement on campus and
we’ve really been pushing more recently

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.180
for it, but this is what people know us for.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.340
They go, “Oh, there’s the engineering
float.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.150
They’re going to win.”

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.290
Or “It’s those engineers!” and they
see a gigantic float with some mechanical

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.660
aspect to it that’s just ridiculous.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.550
And that’s why we do it, its just for fun
and pride.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.890
Crowd chanting: U of A. U of A. U of A.
