Hey Cookaholics Chef Kendra here and as promised
here's the results from the poll we took.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.380
First I'd like to thank you guys for taking
the time to vote.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.820
OK, I had two no's.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:26.190
Three people like whatever and I had 102 people
who want us to keep doing the intros before

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.190
the actual cooking.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.170
For the two people who don't want to see my
face.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.170
Lo siento.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.690
What I learned from the video is that you
actually don't mind a little chit chat before

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.540
the actual cooking begins and that's kind
of cool.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.400
Alright, what are we cooking today?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.180
We are cooking gumbo.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.000
If you like seafood gumbo, wait, let me repeat
that.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.140
If you like seafood gumbo you'll going to
like this seafood gumbo and actually the idea

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.940
for the gumbo came to me from this viewer.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.340
We're using shrimp and fish and we're going
to make a nice roux.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.340
It's going to be delicious.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.809
And we're going to serve it all over rice.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.130
So let's do what we do.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.470
Let's head into the kitchen and make it happen.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.590
We have our trusty ingredients waiting for
us.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.000
If only it really worked like that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.030
We're going to get our oil into a large pot
under medium heat.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.880
Then we're going to add some flour, just like
so.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.030
Next in, and it's optional is file powder.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.049
Sometimes it can be hard to find.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.049
Let's stir this up.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.039
We're going to be doing a lot of stirring
here guys; we're going to go from blond, to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.600
caramel color, to milk chocolate.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600
Boom.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.689
We're basically going to be stirring the whole
time.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.549
It's important to get your roux dark but sometimes
people carry it too far and they're gumbo

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.549
taste burnt.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.470
Then in goes our onions and garlic.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.750
And the next thing we're adding in celery
and bell pepper.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.530
It's going to become a little aggressive with
you, but like most bullies it'll back down

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.530
when you stand up to it.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.140
So give it a robust stir.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.340
After we stir this up for a minute of 2 you'll
notice the color change, we'll add the parsley,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:13.560
our oregano, cayenne pepper, some tabasco
sauce, our clam juice goes in, and water.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.870
We're going to stir every once in a while
and let it cook for 5 minutes.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.670
Then it'll change colors again, now this is
when we add our raw seafood.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.069
We're going to add our fish and our shrimp
and mix those boys in well.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.850
After we've done that we're going to pour
ourselves a beverage and wait for the seafood

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.850
to cook.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.180
You want to turn off the heat as soon as the
seafood is done because you don't want to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.849
overcook it, now do you?

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:48.209
Check for seasonings, add salt and pepper
and that's all it is to it.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.590
I'm going to taste this.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.739
Look at that.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.569
This is amazing.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:03.390
I killed this ya'll this is delicious.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.629
It's rich.

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.110
Has that rich deep nutty flavor.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.379
That beautiful shrimp and fish.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.450
Umm.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.900
Hey guys I hope you enjoyed that.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.720

below along with my Pinterest, my Instagram

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.780
