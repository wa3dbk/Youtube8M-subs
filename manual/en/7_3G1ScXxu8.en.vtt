00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.640
Prerequisite techniques
The MFM is a combination of a nollie frontside

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.390
180 and the Tail butter frontside 180.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.910
We have a whole tutorial on the Tail butter
180s so make sure you've watched and learnt

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.710
that first.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.230
Static Board Off
The easiest way to get your head around this

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.860
trick is to start by jumping the movements
with your board off.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.370
Step 1: Nollie frontside 180.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.550
Step 2: Nollie tail butter frontside 180.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.000
Step 3: The basic MFM movement is a combination
of these 2 prerequisite tricks.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.469
Begin by opening up frontside as if your gonna
nollie a frontside 180, at about 90 degrees

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.720
nollie from your front foot landing in a butter
on your back foot, then ollie from your back

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.270
foot completing the frontside 180 to land
switch.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.729
This is the basic movement required for an
MFM butter, so practice this step a several

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.320
times.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.570
When you break it down with your board off
it becomes simple.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.180
Step 4: A more advanced MFM butter uses the
same movements with a shift of your board

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.439
in the middle for style.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.740
This time as you roll up for the nollie, go
past the 90 degree mark, nollie from your

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.600
front foot and shift back slightly in the
opposite direction, landing on your back foot

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.240
then ollie from your tail completing a counter-rotated
front 1 to land switch.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.610
Pay close attention to the difference between
the basic MFM movement happening at around

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.260
90 degrees and a more advanced MFM movement
incorporating a shift back while in the air.
