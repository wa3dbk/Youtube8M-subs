00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.700
Hey folks, Glenn May here with BassResource.com
and I have a question for you.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.860
When was the last time you did any maintenance
on the back of your boat?

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.460
No, I'm not talking about your engine here,
I'm talking about everything else.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.760
Now, if you don't know what I'm talking about
listen up, this is for you.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.859
You see, there are a lot of things back here
that require attention on regular basis and

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.810
if you don't pay attention to them you're
looking at some expensive repair bills or

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.789
perhaps you may even have a dangerous situation
on the water.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.790
Let me explain.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.320
First of all, there's a lot of nuts and bolts
on the back of the boat here and they tend

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.930
to work themselves loose and it's not just
from rough water conditions, being on windy

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.210
water or just a lot boat traffic, it's not
just from that, it's just or trailering up

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.720
and down the road.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.450
You have potholes, you have construction that
you go through, just rough road conditions,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.550
they're going to jostle the boat around quite
a bit, oftentimes much more than what you

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.290
get when you're on the water and nuts and
bolts tend to back themselves out from all

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.290
those vibrations.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.289
So first off, we have Power Poles here and
they're held on by a variety of nuts and bolts.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.740
I check these every couple months just make
sure everything's good and tight.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.479
That's recommended by Power Pole by the way.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.520
So check them every two to three months just
to make sure that everything's were supposed

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.520
to be.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.310
Just a little crank here and there and you're
good to go.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.960
Another thing that you need to look at is
over here.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.799
Look at all the bolts that attach back here
at the motor.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.590
You've got bolts that attach to the transom
and those will come loose.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.340
I kid you not.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.549
I've seen boats come in from rough water conditions
and the engine hanging on by one bolt.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.259
Very dangerous situation and that happened
just because the bolts, they had to have been

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.920
loose to begin with and you get in some real
rough water and things break, they rip themselves

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920
out.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.270
The last thing you want is an engine riding
up the back of your boat into your lap and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.330
that can happen if everything breaks free.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.670
At the very least, it's a very expensive bill.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.840
So make sure that the bolts attaching everything
to the transom are good and tight.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.929
You also have bolts attaching the engine to
the jack plate.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.500
Make sure that those are solid.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Check them every once in a while.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500
I do it about twice a year.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.120
I don't need to check it every single month,
but check it twice a year, just to make sure

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.980
everything's good, firm, and tight and were
they're supposed to be.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.570
That's going to ensure that everything stays
were supposed to be and it doesn't break on

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.700
you.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.580
In addition, over here, take a look.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.000
The trim mechanism right here, that has a
couple things on it.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.050
First of all, there's a filler cap.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.920
This is a Yamaha unit.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.360
I don't know where the filler cap is on your
unit, but take a look.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.770
There's a filler cap right here.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.470
Make sure that's nice and tight.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.780
That can come loose and it doesn't have to
come all the way loose for you to have any

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.780
leakage.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.960
You don't want to have fluid from the lake
or the river get inside that because trust

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.540
me, it doesn't work as well as hydraulic fluid.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.450
So make sure that cap is tight.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.620
Also down here at the bottom, you'll note
that there's couple bolts right here.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.320
There's one on each side.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.580
That holds the whole unit in place.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.040
Make sure these bolts are tight.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.450
They do work themselves loose, trust me, they
do.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.650
I put in some Loctite just to make sure they
don't come loose, because once they do, this

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.760
tilt trim mechanism won't work anymore.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.900
When they come out, you can actually lose
the whole unit.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.900
It's really scary.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.560
So make sure that that is good and tight.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.940
Lastly, these tabs right here, where the engine
hits the trim, these two little prongs that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.590
come out, put a little grease on them.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.320
Just a little marine grease is all it takes,
just general-purpose marine grease, because

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.280
what you've got is two different metals attaching
to each other and they're rubbing against

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280
each other.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.740
When you have that, one's going to be harder
than the other and one's going to give and

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.740
wear out.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.100
So just a little dab of grease every month
or so depending on how often fish is go save

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.180
you a lot of repair bills down the road.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.780
Anyway, I hope that works for you.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.220
I hope you like those tips.
