Today were going to review part number Y04030
Yakima.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.549
This is a LandShark Kayak Carrier.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.510
Were gonna do a review on a 2012 Toyota Forerunner.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.709
One thing with this vehicle is that its already
been equipped with a Yakima Roof Rack system

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:13.709
using the round bars.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.539
Well go ahead and start off with our review.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.390
Well go ahead and take the Mighty Mounts and
attach them to the crossbars.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.060
Were gonna need 8 of these so that will 4
on each crossbars and they just simply snap

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.060
into place.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.390
Now well line this up with the saddles and
install the hardware for that.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.480
There are screws that go down on the center
and into the Mighty Mount.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:58.480
The Mighty Mounts can be used on square or
round bars.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:24.600
In 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:58.829
this application, well be using the Yakimas

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:50.699
