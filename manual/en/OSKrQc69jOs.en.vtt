00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.490
As you reach a higher level, you'll be studying
octaves.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.830
What are octaves?

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:21.680
After you've done your scales, after you've
done thirds and sixths, you have what is called

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.460
octaves.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.320
Octaves are the same note, but eight notes
away.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:40.379
So, if you have an A here, you have the same
A on the G string, but an octave lower.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.670
Same goes for B. Those are octaves.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.929
Now, octaves are played together and they're
difficult because you have to play them so

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.480
in tune.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.850
So, here is an example of how to practice
octaves at home.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.780
What I tell my students is, you practice them
separate, separate and then together.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.800
Separate, separate, together.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:18.870
And you use full bows with a nice big forte
sound.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:36.840
That was separate, separate, together.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:57.330
And you can go up another octave as well.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.280
So, that's how, you're listening to the notes
and then you're playing them together and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.250
that's how you get them perfectly in tune.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:13.659
And 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:14.400
those are octaves.
