00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.360
Welcome to step number three of the kinky
Twists extensions hairstyle in this step I

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.250
going to be teaching you some tips and tricks
on how to keep your hair and scalp healthy

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.850
as well as how to keep your kinky twist style
looking fresh so my very first tip is that

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.920
you have to continue your haircare regimen
while wearing this hairstyle and you have

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.250
to make sure that you using your products
at a diluted consistency for example if you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.390
like to shampoo wash her hair once a week
and you like to moisturize your hair twice

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.890
a week you still have to do so while wearing
these kinky twist braid extensions so to begin

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.030
make sure to take a little bit of each product
that you use in your haircare regimen and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.879
diluted in an applicator bottle with water
so what you are going to do with your shampoo

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.649
is gonna play some of your shampoo on an applicator
bottle then you're going to fill up with water

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.850
until the solution reaches a watery consistency
after that you going to apply the solution

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.549
from the applicator bottle onto your visible
parts of your scalp and you will gently use

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.560
the pads of your fingers to massage your scalp
this is going to release any buildup and any

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.970
grime or dirt that's on your scalp and hair
especially when you're trying to rid of dandruff

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.200
and things of that sort after that you are
going to to use your soapy hands and you want

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.640
to gently rub down the length of your kinky
twist extensions to wash your hair as well

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.659
after that rinse out all of the soap and warm
water to give it thorough cleanse and rinse

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.610
that's why it's very important that you actually
dilute your haircare products that you are

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.079
going to be using with water so when you're
actually rinsing out your product you're not

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.159
leaving behind any residue when you're leaving
behind residue on your hair this greatly causes

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.840
buildup so by doing this you are eliminating
any chances of breakage from happening now

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.159
after that you want to also be doing the same
things with your other haircare products whether

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.329
you're using a rinse conditioner or using
moisturizers to put onto your hair make sure

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.119
that is at a watery consistency so that after
applying them you can rinse them effectively

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.470
without leaving behind buildup, now my very
next tip is making sure that you moisturize

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.040
your scalp every day to do this you have to
be sure the type of was they are using are

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.090
going to be best and make sure that you're
actually moisturizer scalp without causing

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.420
any buildup the oils that you should avoid
using when applying to your scalp or things

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.530
like petroleum any oils that contain silicon
as well as some natural oils that can cause

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.190
buildup such as Shea butter possibly mango
butter and also possibly castor oil so the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.750
best oils to use to daily moisturize your
scalp are coconut oil or and jojoba oil make

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.670
sure that your spraying your scalp with a
little bit of water to actually add moisture

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.640
to your skin because moisture comes from water
and then use either oil to actually apply

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.210
your scalp to lubricate the roots of your
hair and to also protect your hair from dryness

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.200
and dandruff coconut oil is the best oil to
use because it's highly penetratable into

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.230
the layers of your skin but also you can use
jojoba oil if it's better for your situation

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.620
jojoba oil more closely matches the natural
sebum that we all secrete from bodies so when

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.950
your hair is getting a little bit more oilier
than usual or your scalp is getting more oilier

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.780
than usual that's only because you're secreting
more sebum than usual if you need some more

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.981
moisture put back in your hair or to balance
the oiliness is great to use jojoba oil in

00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:27.780
this instance now after that you have to make
sure that your maintaining an appropriate

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.740
moisture and protein balance within your hair
because your hair is contained within extensions

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.230
it's not easy to tell whether your hair is
lacking moisture or protein and that's why

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.140
you have to apply either or every other day
to your hair so for instance if you like to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.370
moisturize your hair twice a week on one of
the instances that you going to be moisturizing

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.640
you have to use a moisture-based product to
spray onto your hair and braids then on the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.370
other day during the week when you like to
moisturize instead you have to use a protein-based

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.470
moisturizer the difference between the two
is that one moisturizer will actually have

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.180
protein ingredients and in the other one while
make sure that the part that you're deciding

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.990
to use can be bought to a watery consistency
so that you can actually spritz onto your

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.160
hair without leaving buildup on the outside
of your kinky twist by following all of the

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.590
steps you are going to keep your hair and
scalp healthy you also going to keep your

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.440
hairstyle looking fresh and new and you're
going to prevent any chances of buildup and

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.600
breakage so be sure to follow all these rules
and of course as always when you are going

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.500
to bed to rest at night make sure you're protecting
your hair with some type of silk or satin

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.320
material this could include a pillowcase or
a head covering such as a scarf or bonnet

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.660
you just have to make sure that the materials
either satin or silk to prevent breakage along

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.560
the hairline and also prevent frizz the next
day so I hope that all of these tips have
