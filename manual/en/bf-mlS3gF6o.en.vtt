00:00:01.036 --> 00:00:02.976
&gt;&gt; Hello, I'm Markell
Williams; number 31.

00:00:03.216 --> 00:00:05.006
I play nickleback for
Sac State Hornets.

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:07.026
Growing up there were
a lot of obstacles.

00:00:07.026 --> 00:00:09.226
I think the biggest thing
was domestic violence

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:10.856
that was taking place
in my family.

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.016
Just kind of overcoming
that adversity was challenge

00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:16.276
but once it was over
and done, I kind of grew

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:18.836
and became very mature and
strong from the situation.

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:21.166
At first I was a huge
basketball player;

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.766
I wanted to be in the NBA.

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:25.436
Then I actually played
football for the first time

00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:27.246
in freshman year of
high school and I kind

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:28.186
of just started loving it,

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:30.876
so I wanted to become
a football player.

00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:31.996
[Inaudible Football
Conversation] The first day

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:34.166
on Sac State campus, it
was very overwhelming.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.606
It was kind of like I was
being pushed into the water

00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:40.506
with no floaties so it
was very overwhelming,

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:41.936
but it was exciting
at the same time.

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:43.966
I would definitely
think of myself

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.646
as strong-willed and driven.

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:49.396
Throughout my life people
have said I was a great leader

00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:51.216
so I've kind of become
more accustomed to that

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:53.376
and have taken control of it,
trying to progress every day

00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:57.296
to become a better leader.

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.166
[Inaudible Football
Conversation] When I step

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.176
on the field and the game-like
atmosphere, I feel like yelling

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:02.136
at the top of my lungs.

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.046
My muscles are tense,
my heart is pounding,

00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:08.566
my mind is in destroy
mode and I'm just amped.

00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:11.916
So the feeling is unbelievable,
but I feel like I've arrived

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:13.466
and I made it to greatness.

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:16.106
It's important to be
well-rounded and not just think

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:17.976
about football because
there's a life after football.

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:19.696
You have to get a job
and you know you have

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:21.456
to excel in the real world.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.996
So to have a great
educational background

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:26.126
and have a great GPA is
going to be huge for you

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:27.486
because you've got to
compete with others.

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:29.196
A piece of advice I would give

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:31.876
to student athletes everywhere
is don't take anything

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:32.416
for granted.

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:35.236
Live each and every moment of
your life like it's your last.

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:38.196
Put everything you
have into 125 percent.

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:39.776
[Inaudible Football
Conversation] You definitely

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.756
have to be focused
in class and listen

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:42.786
to what the teacher is saying.

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:44.176
And I think the biggest thing

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:45.976
that a student athlete
should know is that they need

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:48.826
to understand their professors,
each individual professor,

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:50.656
because they all have
different requirements

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:52.886
in how they want to do things.

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:54.796
[Applause] A little
bit about the program;

00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:58.376
Coach Sperbeck has made a
tremendous, tremendous effort

00:01:58.376 --> 00:02:03.656
to make us mature young
men and he really taught us

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.176
like to be better leaders.

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:08.326
[Whistle Blows] A path
here at Sac State;

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:10.146
I've been helped by many people.

00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:11.106
I've been touched, you know?

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:13.876
Just them helping me get
to where I'm at today,

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:15.976
I've kind of wanted
to help somebody else

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:17.246
and better somebody else's life.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:18.916
Sac State is a welcoming campus.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:21.786
It's beautiful; they have plenty
of trees and it's an atmosphere

00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:24.336
that you want to be a part of.

00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:25.276
[Crowd Noise] We're
playing against Cal Poly

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:27.206
and I got injured; I tore
all my ligaments in my ankles

00:02:27.256 --> 00:02:28.796
so I had surgery 3
weeks ago so I've been

00:02:28.796 --> 00:02:29.706
on crutches since then.

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:33.236
[Crowd Noise] I don't know
all I can do is thank God

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.006
and my family.

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:36.996
Honestly, just...I can't
even explain the feeling;

00:02:36.996 --> 00:02:39.276
it's just a relief.

00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:40.566
&gt;&gt; We did it baby!

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:41.976
&gt;&gt; I'm Markell Williams and
I was made at Sac State.
