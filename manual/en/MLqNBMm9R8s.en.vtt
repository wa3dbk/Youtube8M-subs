Hi, I am Eugenie.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.880
There was a question at Facebook last week.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.000
I asked you to choose one dish between omurice and bibimbap.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and more people preferred omurice, so today I am going to make omurice.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
For this recipe, you will need:

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.710
4 oz chicken breast, diced (110g)

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.210
4 eggs

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.920
½ onion, chopped

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.830
5 tablespoons of carrot, chopped

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.420
½ clove of garlic, minced

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.550
2 bowls short grain rice, cooked

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.920
4 tablespoons ketchup

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.750
vegetable oil for frying

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.960
and salt and

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.960
freshly ground pepper

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:10.000
First, in a bowl crack in the eggs 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.500
and add ¼ teaspoon of salt and pepper. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:28.000
And whisk until homogeneously mixed 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.910
and set aside.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.000
Then, add in vegetable oil in a large frying pan 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.500
and heat over medium heat.  

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:54.910
And add in diced chicken breast and sauté for 3 minutes.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.500
Then add in carrot, 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.800
onion, 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.750
and garlic. 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.370
And lightly season with salt and pepper. 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.370
Sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.200
You can opt for mushrooms instead of carrots if you want.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.210
Add steamed short grain rice and break any lumps. 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.710
If you use warm rice, it’s easier to break. 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.510
And stir fry until combined.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.000
Now out of heat, add ketchup 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.330
and stir until homogeneously combined. 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:54.620
Today I added only 4 tablespoons but you can increase the amount of ketchup as you like.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:03.000
Then taste 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and season with salt 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:22.700
and pepper to your liking.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.330
Now lightly grease a small frying pan with vegetable oil. 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:36.420
I am using a refillable spray oil bottle today. 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.000
Add in half of the egg mixture into the pan and cook the omelet over low heat. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.630
When the egg is almost done, place half of the rice on top of the omelet in the middle. 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:57.250
This is first batch for 1 person.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.660
Then fold top and bottom side of omelet to cover the rice. 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:11.670
Now cover the pan with a serving plate and carefully turn the pan over on the plate. 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.580
Voila!

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.680
Garnish with ketchup.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.180
Today I am using Korean ketchup, not Heinz. 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.080
Do you prefer any brand for ketchup?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:42.000
I love omurice with greens and fresh tomato slices.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:56.500
Bon appetit.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.630
This is easy and simple Japanese comfort food. 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.740
Today it was Omurice and tomorrow it’s apple pie. 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.620
