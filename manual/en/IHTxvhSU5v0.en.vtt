00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.080
What is this?

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.740
Okay, here we are on a huge long roof,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.380
cedar shake roof, and it's full of this lichen and moss.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.031
And we're just taking it off.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.220
Now, because this is very slippery when it's wet,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.840
and even when it's dry, we have to use all kinds of

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.540
safety gear on here. So, we're tied off with safety ropes.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.960
You can see Roland there with his whole outfit on,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.640
and we're using these chairs that,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.160
they are called roof chairs, they sit on the roof.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.920
You can use them to work from.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.900
And basically we're cleaning it with various tools here.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.280
What have we got here?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.840
I'm using a little trowel, and that cleans out the area

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.080
between the shingles really good because it needs,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.020
you need to get the pine needles and stuff out of there,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.260
so the roof can dry out again.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.740
And we're using a real stiff type yacht brush,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.260
that scrubs off the lichen.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.413
It comes off a little easier when it's wet.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.640
But that's what makes it really treacherous.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.660
Roland's up there using that yacht mop now,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.520
and he's going to set a new record on that little piece.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.840
Longest ever spent on two square feet of roof.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.300
Anyway, we're getting it all done.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.744
And the roof itself is not in bad shape.

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.504
If it can be preserved,

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:43.720
probably get another five or ten years out of it,

00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:46.760
whereas if the moss would stay on it,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.487
it would never dry out and it would rot immediately.

00:01:49.487 --> 00:01:51.647
Within the next couple of years,

00:01:51.647 --> 00:01:53.647
there would be nothing left of it.

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:56.447
So, it's sometimes worthwhile

00:01:56.447 --> 00:02:00.200
spending a few bucks on cleaning your roof.

00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:04.920
If it's too mushy, it can't be done,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.564
but we caught this one in the nick of time.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:15.800
So, here's the roof we just cleaned off here.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.400
We put zinc strips up the caps,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.920
and retailed those caps, and anyplace there was an

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.220
issue with the cap, I used a Tremco roofing caulking

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.280
here. It's Tremco 830 clear,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.920
It's really sticky, and sold by the roofing store

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.380
so, it's for all kinds of roofing applications.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.180
It sticks like crazy as long as your substrate is dry,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.500
and here, we put on these extra strips of zinc,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:04.700
down the corners, and sprayed off the stains a bit

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.500
We've scraped this all off, and it's almost gone back

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.340
nice new shake material, the colour of the unwhitened

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.020
cedar is kind of coming through on it.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.380
So, probably those stains will come off in a couple

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.820
of weeks or a month.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.320
And we've, what happens with the zinc,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.480
is that water runs over it and kind of provides a

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.840
metallic atmosphere on the rest of the shingles

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.960
where it goes down, that the moss and the lichen

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.560
doesn't seem to like as much.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.280
It's not the perfect answer, but it's the only one we had

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.267
at the moment, so that's what we're doing with it, and

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:55.700
you can see, we've done the upper floor here too.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.280
Refastened the direction weathervane,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.340
and set it to north, and we've got a bit more to do

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.520
and then we're done this job.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.020
Okay.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.420
So, here's that shake roof,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.880
what we did after, we put, on the front, we put

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.340
one two three strips of zinc along the front there.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.940
and on each tin courses,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.360
put zincs under all the cap courses

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.540
And it's all cleaned off, and a little bit of heat on those

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.180
will take the stains off.

00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:38.961
Gave it a little bit of spray to soften the stains

00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:42.381
and allow the cedar to turn grey again.

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:44.540
Those are cedar shakes.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.180
The reason that we went to such a great extent on them

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.100
was that they weren't all curled up, so there

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.100
should be quite a few years left in this.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.760
It was a big slimy roof

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.460
but it's much better now.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.123
