00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.033
(crowd chatter)

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.033
President Obama:
Hello.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:16.967
(applause)

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:17.700
What is up, champ?

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.300
Player:
How are you doing?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.867
Thank you.

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:21.000
President Obama:
What are you all doing
with this rookie?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.467
Is he carrying
the bags or stuff?

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:23.367
Player:
Everything, everything.

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:25.133
Anthony Davis:
Everything.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:30.734
President Obama:
You know you have
got to earn it.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:31.633
That is a trademark, man.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:33.000
That is big money.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.500
All right. I know you
guys got to concentrate.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.166
We just wanted to come
by and say hello and

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.133
say congratulations.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.133
And you know we couldn't
have better representatives

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.000
for the United States.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.767
So I know you guys are going
to bring back the Gold,

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:49.433
but I also know you guys will be
just a class act over in London.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.266
Any way, you guys are
going to do great.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.900
Group:
USA.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.967
(applause)

00:00:56.967 --> 00:01:00.633
President Obama:
You got some
talent on this squad.

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:01.600
You guys are going to do great.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.066
I am making this
prediction right now.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.900
Joe Biden's grand daughter
who is named Maisy,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.700
Maisy Biden will be a
division one player and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.066
maybe in the WNBA.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.900
She is an athlete,
a really good one.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.233
Here is how you know
she is a -- (inaudible)

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.500
I was doing some
coaching on the team.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.767
So we did a little
practice on Sunday.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:24.367
And I said, you know what,
everybody has to work on their

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:25.934
left hand or their weak hand.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:29.300
So in the game, she just
scores like three quarters

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.200
of the points.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.533
And she is missing some lay-ups.

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.533
And Joe, he goes out,
he is rapping with her.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.400
He is on line with her.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.433
You know, what is up, you
were a little off today?

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.767
She says, grandpa,
you didn't notice.

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:41.834
See, the President told
me to work on my left.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.967
So I was only shooting
left handed that game.

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:44.734
USA Coach:
How about that?

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:46.667
President Obama:
Which you know, that
is that attitude.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:50.000
You know when you are ten, and
you go through a whole game and

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.166
you are just working on.

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.734
You watch.

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:54.433
You are going to be recruited.

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:55.767
USA Coach:
I will remember.

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:57.734
President Obama:
All right. I'm going
to get out of here.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:59.734
Joe, come on. Let's
let these guys go.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.000
See you guys.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:14.000
(applause)
