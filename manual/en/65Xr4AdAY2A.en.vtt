00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.240
Hi, I'm Joel Hurowitz, a scientist with the
surface sampling system team and this is your

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.720
Curiosity rover report.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.460
This week the Curiosity science team released
its initial findings from its first ever drilled

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.210
sample on Mars.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.990
This sample was collected from the “John
Klein” drill site, which is located about

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.869
500 meters east of where we landed about 7
months ago.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.330
Curiosity obtained her first drill sample
and passed that sample on to her onboard analytical

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.950
lab instruments, called CheMin and SAM.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.160
These powerful instruments tell us about what
minerals are present in these rocks and whether

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.520
they contain the ingredients necessary to
sustain life as we know it.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.020
What the Curiosity team has found is incredibly
exciting.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.989
When we combine what we have learned from
our remote sensing and contact science instruments

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.820
with the data that’s coming in from CheMin
and SAM, we get a picture of an ancient watery

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.720
environment, which would have been habitable
had life been present in it.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.260
As an example, the information that we’re
getting from the CheMin instrument, tells

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.030
us that the minerals that are present in this
lakebed sedimentary rock at John Klein are

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.100
very different from just about anything we’ve
ever analyzed before on Mars.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.670
And they tell us that the John Klein rock
was deposited in a fresh water environment.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.380
This is an important contrast with other sedimentary
environments that we‘ve visited on Mars,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.580
like the Meridiani Planum landing site where
the Mars Exploration Rover, Opportunity, has

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.170
been operating since 2004.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.600
At that site, the sedimentary rocks record
evidence of an environment that was only wet

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.520
on a very intermittent basis, and when it
was, the waters that were there were highly

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.990
acidic, very salty, and not favorable for
the survival of organic compounds.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.829
This is in direct contrast to the fresh water
environment we’re seeing here at the John

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.869
Klein Site.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.049
The SAM instrument is telling us that these
rocks contained all of the ingredients necessary

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.740
for a habitable environment.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.210
We found carbon, sulfur and oxygen, all present
and a number of other elements in states that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.259
life could have taken advantage of.

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.259
All in all, these few tablespoons of powder
from a Martian rock have provided the Curiosity

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.040
science team with an exciting new dataset
that tells us that Gale Crater, and perhaps

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.170
all of Mars, contained habitable environments.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.200
This is an incredible success for the Curiosity
mission to Gale, and the science team is looking

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.980
forward to digging deeper into Mars’ ancient
watery past in the weeks, months, and years

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.020
ahead.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.820
This has been your Curiosity rover report.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.750
Please check back for more updates.
