00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.339
OK, a quick field trial with Donde.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
As you can see we have a waypoint added, and we're going to navigate to that waypoint using

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.530
the direction screen without an Internet connection.

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:13.779
[LATER]

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.208
It's off to the left just a little, 77 metres

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:26.960
[WALKS]

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
It's getting closer

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:05.528
Cross a road

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.149
[The colour bar gets wider and wider as we get nearer]

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.640
And here we are

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.640
And here we are

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.459
Like the photo

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:46.459
OK while we're here, lets see if there's any caches nearby, any geocaches.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.090
So on the add tab, web content, I've already logged in.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.150
Should be able to pull up the geocache page.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.150
Yep, it's got a geotag, you can see along the bottom the waypoint location.

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:10.199
Not quite in focus.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:17.199
OK, add that. Now we'll go look for that.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.300
188 metres away, somewhere ahead. Again, if you look closely, you can see the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.880
purple, corresponding to the purple colour on the bar, and it's selected so it's showing

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.229
on the compass. And it's that way.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:39.229
[WIND NOISE]

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.629
Ahead and a little to the right.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.199
Off to the right, straight ahead, we're very close,

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:27.039
We're 41 metres away.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:34.039
You can see the bar getting bigger.

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.950
Somewhere on this bridge here.

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:52.949
It's gotta be here somewhere, so now I have to find it.
