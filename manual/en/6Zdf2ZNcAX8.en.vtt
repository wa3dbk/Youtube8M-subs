00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.866
From time to time you ask
for it and here it

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.096
is, the racing news.

00:00:01.096 --> 00:00:03.486
Today a bit of a random
collection of what's going on

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:05.546
mid-July, 2012.

00:00:05.546 --> 00:00:08.506
But kind of a theme of the
things that racing is doing,

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:11.246
could be doing, should be doing,
to be cooler and more

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:12.836
relevant to today's fans.

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:14.956
So I'll rip through some news
stories, maybe make

00:00:14.956 --> 00:00:15.706
an insight or two.

00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:18.186
But really, I just want to
launch your thoughts and

00:00:18.186 --> 00:00:20.926
discussions in the YouTube
comment section below.

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:23.586
We want to hear what you think
about Global RallyCross.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:25.656
They now race with NASCAR.

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:28.826
In an earlier shakedown after
the X Games debacle, I took

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:32.876
the position that RallyCross
show racing is ruining racing.

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:34.546
But this weekend in New
Hampshire, there

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:35.316
was a better show.

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:38.296
Travis Pastrana and Sam
Hubinette actually did some

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.176
good racing.

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:40.126
No one got hurt.

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:42.956
So what do you think
about RallyCross?

00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:45.376
And by extension, what am I
supposed to make of the DTM

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:47.746
stadium show races this
weekend at the

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.206
Munich Olympics Stadium?

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:51.546
Also MotoGP.

00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:52.846
They always put on a show.

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:55.746
But it was Moto2, the step up
development series that

00:00:55.746 --> 00:00:57.926
delivered the closer
racing in Mugello.

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:00.626
And that begets the question
about spec racing, making the

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.216
racing cooler.

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:03.446
Then there's McLaren.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:06.276
They launched their animation
division, deciding the best

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:10.326
way to market their brand is
with a cartoon called Tooned.

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:13.466
Now besides the jokes I could do
comparing their on track F1

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.526
performance with a cartoon, a
few of you commenters don't

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:18.546
want me to do jokes at all.

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:21.186
So I won't also be making
comparison jokes with our

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:22.486
Tooned show with Matt Farah.

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:24.636
But boy, my mind is
working overtime.

00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:26.916
You know what, maybe I should
ask you to write the jokes.

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:28.296
So go ahead.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:31.106
What do you have for us?

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:39.266
[CAR RACING SOUND]

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.076
Let's go through this past
weekend's news with your eyes

00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:43.906
and minds open to answer
the question.

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:45.626
What makes some racing cool?

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.196
What other things would, should
racing do to make it

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:50.866
cooler to more people,
to younger fans?

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:51.976
Here we go.

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:55.196
Global RallyCross, basically big
horsepower cars jumping,

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:58.596
bumping, sliding,
and the speed.

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:00.416
They were in New Hampshire,
as I mentioned.

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.376
You know, it kind of reminds
me how the Mickey Thompson

00:02:02.376 --> 00:02:06.185
Stadium Truck Series was so
popular a few years ago.

00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:08.476
So what makes Global RallyCross
cool to you?

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:11.286
Is it the cars, the drivers,
the action?

00:02:11.286 --> 00:02:13.966
And why do I think it's
brilliant that GRC is racing

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.156
with NASCAR?

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:16.506
Because I truly believe
that in 10

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.276
years, it will be NASCAR.

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:20.436
I'm determined the France family
will decide to combine

00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:23.396
the jumping with their crashing,
and the driver stars

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:25.526
they have, and we'll be
one step closer to

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:27.356
a real death race.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:29.966
So while I'm on this purity of
the sport pedestal, what do I

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:32.766
think about DTM and their Munich
Olympic Stadium event

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:33.601
this weekend?

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:35.356
It was a no points event.

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:36.026
A show.

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:37.066
All show.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:40.816
Two days of racing, team and
manufacturer competition, and

00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:42.696
driver competitions.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:45.276
On the driver side, Mattias
Ekstrom was the winning driver

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:46.716
in his Audi.

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:50.596
Manufacturer Jamie Green and
Ralf Schumacher won, finally

00:02:50.596 --> 00:02:53.856
won, for Mercedes in the team
and manufacture rounds.

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:55.366
So what do you think
of all this?

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:56.626
It wasn't a points race.

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:58.146
It was just a show.

00:02:58.146 --> 00:02:59.096
Is it good for racing?

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:00.856
Is it good for DTM?

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:02.896
You know MotoGP.

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.756
Those are the bikes that raced
this weekend in Italy.

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:06.996
MotoGP was cool.

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:11.626
Lorenzo stomped to his win and
widened his championship

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:15.331
points gap after the Hondas of
Pedrosa and Stoner struggle.

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:18.416
But it was Moto2, the junior
step up series, that was the

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:19.486
Mugello show.

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:22.496
Andrea Iannone, an Italian in
Italy who was debuting his

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:25.186
firemen red Livery and his
firemen style leathers, that

00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:27.576
took his second win of the year
in his home country by

00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:29.046
hunting down Pol Espargaro.

00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:32.296
He had the 1.2 second lead
going into the last lap.

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:34.286
But he couldn't hold
off Iannone.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:36.726
Through the race, we had five
or six bikes battling at the

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:38.826
front the entire race.

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:41.706
Moto2 are cost cap kind
of spec series.

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:44.556
Everyone races 600 cc Honda
four strokes with

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.186
series-approved electronics.

00:03:46.186 --> 00:03:48.496
But chassis construction
is open.

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:51.116
Dunlap spec tires,
steel brakes.

00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:53.616
In Moto2, I guess it's supposed
to be more of a rider

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:56.686
and team development series,
working on chassis and set up.

00:03:56.686 --> 00:03:58.266
The rider and his skill.

00:03:58.266 --> 00:04:00.356
So cost controls and
spec racing.

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:01.056
Is it good?

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:03.016
Is it cooler for you?

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:05.826
And now the McLaren, and their
animation division, and their

00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:08.876
translation of motor sport
marketing, called Tooned, a

00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:12.586
cartoon, staring the images and
voices of Jenson Button

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.826
and Lewis Hamilton.

00:04:14.826 --> 00:04:17.785
There's a link below if you
haven't seen the cartoon yet.

00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:20.636
There'll be one toon released
for every F1 race.

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:23.186
And I'm curious if they'll
emulate our toon with behind

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:25.836
the wheel giggling, and show
titles like the world's

00:04:25.836 --> 00:04:27.996
fastest, most exclusive,
something or other.

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:30.946
But Matt Farah's doing a great
job, a hell of a job, and

00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:31.806
everyone loves him.

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:34.086
And he doesn't need a cartoon
image to be a--

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:35.406
no, that's not fair.

00:04:35.406 --> 00:04:38.806
Anyway, despite the fact
McLaren's toon

00:04:38.806 --> 00:04:40.266
reminds me of Senninha.

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:41.116
Remember?

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:42.526
Created a generation ago.

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:46.076
But what do you think about
cartoons, animations, movies,

00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:48.706
pushing the attraction
and appeal of racing?

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:50.546
Remember this?

00:04:50.546 --> 00:04:52.456
Or even the Speed Racer movie.

00:04:52.456 --> 00:04:54.906
Or Cars, the movie.

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:57.006
Or Michel Vaillant.

00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:58.796
So what do you think
about this type

00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:00.636
of marketing extension?

00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:03.396
Or is it better for McLaren to
market the more traditional

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:06.786
way, as they're doing with their
simraceway partnership.

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:10.326
On simraceway, July
is McLaren month.

00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:13.296
The promotional introduction of
McLaren cars to simraceway,

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:15.016
with new cars available.

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:18.686
And challenge hot lap events
to run a McLaren and win a

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:22.126
simraceway S1 steering wheel,
or a racy way to win

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:24.396
up to $50 in cash.

00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:26.496
Thanks to a groundbreaking deal
with the world famous

00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:28.916
British racing manufacturers,
simraceway has become the

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:32.576
first sim game in history to
secure the licenses for

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:36.556
McLaren's entire portfolio
of cars, race and road.

00:05:36.556 --> 00:05:40.946
Of course, the current MP4-12C
road car, and the M6GT, a

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:42.616
Bruce McLaren passion.

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:45.026
But it's the race cars
that define McLaren.

00:05:45.026 --> 00:05:48.206
And the deal gives simraceway
users access to every F1 car

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:51.726
McLaren has produced, including
the 1974 and '76

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:55.196
Emerson Fittipaldi and James
Hunt cars, the Button and

00:05:55.196 --> 00:05:57.856
Hamilton 2011 Vodafone
McLaren Mercedes

00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:02.116
MP4-26, all 36 F1 cars.

00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:05.136
In total, the deal brings 60
McLarens to the simraceway

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:09.416
environment, including the
MP4-12C GT3 car that we're

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:12.476
going to see first hand when
we go to the Spa 24, end of

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:15.066
July, for a very special
Shakedown.

00:06:15.066 --> 00:06:17.086
Hey, maybe July is our
McLaren month.

00:06:17.086 --> 00:06:18.826
So stay tuned.

00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:22.446
Now comment away on today's
topic about the news, and what

00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:23.626
would make racing cooler?

00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:26.266
More exciting formats, like
Global RallyCross?

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.756
Closer racing with spec
cars and bikes?

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:31.836
More media attention outside
the race broadcast?

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:35.076
More ops for you to experience
racing yourself, like the sims

00:06:35.076 --> 00:06:36.866
and simsraceway.

00:06:36.866 --> 00:06:38.316
Looking forward to
your comments.
