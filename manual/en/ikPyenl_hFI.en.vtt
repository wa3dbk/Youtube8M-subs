On April 21st, 2015, the Search Engine Google
is showing an animated Doodle for marking

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.190
81st Anniversary of the Loch Ness Monster's
most famous photograph.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.920
This Doodle is getting shown in many countries.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.550
Loch Ness Monster is the world's most famous
cryptid.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.380
A cryptid is a creature whose existence has
been attested to by various "eyewitnesses"

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.110
and yet is not recognized by established science.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.880
The Loch Ness Monster, or otherwise known
as Nessie, was said to be first seen in 565

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.320
AD when followers of the missionary St. Columba
reportedly saw a monster in the Loch.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.680
Loch Ness is located in the Highlands of Scotland
. It is the second largest loch (i-e lake)

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.109
in Scotland with depths reaching over 750
feet.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.330
The "Surgeon's Photograph" is one of the most
iconic Nessie photos.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.240
Supposedly taken by Dr.Robert Kenneth Wilson,
it was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.000
1934.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.860
It was proved to be a fake in 1975 and once
again in 1993.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.960
The size of the ripples revealed that it was
a hoax as it did not match Nessie's presumed

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.920
anatomy.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.780
In 2005, 100 athletes taking part in Scotland's
biggest triathlon were reportedly each insured

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.510
for Â£1 million against bites from the Loch
Ness Monster.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.080
On 19 April 2014 it was reported that Apple
Maps was showing what appeared to be the monster

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.469
close to the surface of the loch.Possible
explanations for the image are that it could

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.400
be the wake of a boat, a seal causing ripples
or a floating log.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.469
Some believe that the image was Photoshopped
using an image of a whale shark.
