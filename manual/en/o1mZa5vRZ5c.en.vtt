00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.120
Children and families come to the Edinburgh Steiner School from birth really.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.560
We have children coming to a baby and parent group and then moving on to our toddler group.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.560
We welcome everyone to the Toddler Hut.  We have grannies, we have mums, we have lots of dads,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.400
we have childminders - everybody's welcome.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.240
[Carolyn Grohmann, Parent] Kindergarten is quite a magical place. 
Part of it is the beautiful setting

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.720
and part of it is the daily routine that the children enjoy, that each day has its activities

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.560
the children can anticipate what's coming.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.200
The children learn together.  
We don't teach through direction or instruction,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.600
we teach through imitation and example.  
If they are coming through imitation,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.800
it means that they are coming through their own free will, through their own internal connection with the activity.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.640
We don't need to instruct and tell them what to do, 
they just follow

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.520
and the environment of the Kindergarten, it enables the children to do that.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.840
And children of this age are absolute doers.  They don't want to sit and hear how to do some thing,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.520
they want to just do it and so we work with that to let whatever is coming towards them flow through them

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.720
and this as a preparation for formal learning is ideal because if the child is strong and capable in their body,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.160
in their motor skills, in the way that they react or respond to different situations,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.320
then they will be ready to take on formal learning.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.560
[Alistair Pugh, Geography Teacher] We follow a model very similar to the Scandinavian model of education,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.320
where learning is delayed until slightly later for the formal, more academic subjects

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.320
like reading and writing and Mathematics. 
What that gives us a chance to do is to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.920
develop some of the other aspects of education.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.560
that are important for younger children.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.440
So we develop their social capacities, their practical capacities, their kinaesthetic learning

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.160
so that they are more comfortable with themselves and their bodies out in the world.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.440
Then we come later to reading, writing and Mathematics, 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.160
when they are more ready for those more abstract, more intellectual subjects

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.440
and we find that they catch up very quickly indeed.
