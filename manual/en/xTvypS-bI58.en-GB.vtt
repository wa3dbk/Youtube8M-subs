00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.640
🎶 Can someone tell me what is going on? Coz I don't understand.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.780
There must be somewhere I belong

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.270
Some days I want to run and hide,
Tell me are you on my side

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.230
Why can't I just be myself?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.630
Why-y-y-y?

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.970
Get me out of here 🎶

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.940
When I look back over my life so far, I realise I probably have always been embarrassed by my family.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.160
Taylor, hunny!

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.280
Don't forget, 4 o'clock - training bra.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.140
(in slo-mo) Training bra.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.059
I know what you're thinking. My life is seriously
bad, eh?

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.299
But it gets worse.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.400
Take my mum, for example.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.140
Mum?

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.059
Taylor, darling.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.499
What are you doing?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.060
Glorifying the female form.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760
Can't you do it with clothes on?

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.320
Spit it out, now!

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.660
That big suck with the perfectly styled hair, is my sister Layla.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm leaving school anyway to follow my artistic path.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.200
And.. that would be?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.700
A nail artist.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.100
Mum says she was born a rebel.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.540
And when you're done with the vacuuming, I'll introduce you to Mr. Feather-duster.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.720
I say she was born an idiot.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.640
You're wondering how a perfectly normal girl, like myself, can be related to weirdos like...

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.100
And finally, there's Dad.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.539
He's always coming up with new business schemes.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.619
The King Di Crete, underpants for all!

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.340
What do you think, Squirt? Tremendous, eh?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.660
Brittany, she's for me,
She loves her school down by the sea.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:12.820
That's Brittany. She's practically perfect.
Perfect teeth. Perfect nose. Perfect eyes.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.300
Do I have a booger?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.080
Urgh, no.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.730
Hector's been my best friend forever.
I don't know what I'd do without him.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.540
See you Small Fry.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.840
Knucklehead.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.400
How do you know when the aliens are coming?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.880
Large, round, flying objects.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.640
We come in peace!

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.620
I don't deserve this!

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.320
I should be seeing the world.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.300
Be happy, all of you. Please, be happy.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.720
La la la la la la la!

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.140
Mwaaaaah!

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.300
Ewwww.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.860
🎶 Some days I want to run and hide.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.880
Tell me are you on my side.
Why can't I just be myself?

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.880
Why-y-y-y?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.160
Get me out of here

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.120
Take me where I can be free
Get me out of here

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.520
Anywhere I can be me 🎶

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.400
Have I ever told you where babies come from?
