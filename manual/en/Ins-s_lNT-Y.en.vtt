00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:16.606
[Music] A bend in a quiet road.

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:19.276
One family's tragic turn.

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:22.876
I woke Dan up, and I
said, something's wrong ,

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:23.786
we've got to go find Heather.

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:28.846
Nineteen-year old Heather Lerch
had never been late coming home

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:30.156
from work.

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:33.896
On February 23rd, Heather
had worked the night shift

00:00:33.956 --> 00:00:36.426
at Subway in nearby Tumwater.

00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:39.466
On that rainy night after
work, Heather buckled

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.116
into the car she had bought
only about a month earlier,

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.456
and eventually drove
south on Little Rock Road.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.966
And she's done that
drive before?

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.366
Oh, hundreds of times.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.426
As Heather approached
the bend in the road,

00:00:52.876 --> 00:00:55.966
the speed limit changed
from 50 to 35.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.086
And we got in the car,
and we found the accident.

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.976
From that moment forward,
life would never be the same

00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:05.246
for Heather's parents.

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:09.746
And we changed forever, that
instant, changed us forever.

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:12.996
Well, the first thing the state
patrol man told us is you don't

00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:14.686
want to go over there.

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:19.476
And then he said, she's dead.

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:23.316
Yeah, that was pretty tough.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.766
The speed of Heather's car
when it hit that guard rail,

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.786
police estimate,
60 miles per hour.

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:32.026
They said she did
a couple fishtails,

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:38.476
t-boned the guard rail, and then
she ended up down in the ditch,

00:01:38.826 --> 00:01:41.126
and they said she
was killed instantly.

00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:44.936
The coroner said that the
driver's door was pushed in two

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.736
and a half feet inside the car.

00:01:48.246 --> 00:01:50.736
She ended up in the
passenger seat,

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:52.726
she got pushed over so far.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.706
Because that's where
she hit the guard rail,

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:55.746
right on the driver's door.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:59.786
Local news reports noted that
Heather Lerch had been speeding

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.006
when she crashed, but there
would be more to this story.

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:06.156
You see, Heather's
parents are now convinced

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:07.866
that she was doing
something else

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:11.666
so unnecessary during those
final minutes of her young life.

00:02:12.226 --> 00:02:15.566
Oh yes. There's not a doubt
in my mind, that it did.

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:18.536
Texting was one hundred
percent involved in this.

00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:21.136
She was texting a friend?

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:23.076
Yes. And this had
been going back

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.926
and forth for a few minutes?

00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:30.476
Yes. She was texting up to 10:27

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:34.236
and the first 911
call came in at 10:30.

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:39.026
Those texts, still
preserved on Heather's phone,

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:42.006
read like countless
others between friends.

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.956
Hey, you and I need
to hang sometime.

00:02:45.496 --> 00:02:46.476
Alright, cool.

00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:47.786
I can't wait.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:48.766
Me neither.

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:52.746
Exactly, what are you doing,
what are you going to do next?

00:02:52.746 --> 00:02:54.876
And hi, LOL.

00:02:54.986 --> 00:03:00.876
Laughing out loud, just stupid
communication, nothing serious,

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:03.786
nothing serious enough that it
took my life from my daughter."

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:06.946
Dan and Wendy Lerch are speaking
out now because they hope

00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:10.346
to prevent someone else
from getting hurt or killed

00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:11.576
by distracted driving.

00:03:11.576 --> 00:03:13.906
Pay attention to the road.

00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:15.496
Pay attention to
your surroundings.

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:19.376
Distractions are everywhere
from reader boards,

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:22.656
and signs that flash in front
of you on the side of the road,

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:24.846
to your cell phones and iPods.

00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:28.406
And is your buddy asking you
what are you gonna do now,

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:29.936
is it worth your life?

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:33.066
I see adults going down
the freeway texting.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.266
And they're weaving
all over the place

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.416
and they don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.476
Sometimes it is more
adults doing it

00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:40.746
than I see children doing it.

00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:44.486
So you're more hyper-aware
than ever, obviously?

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:45.526
Oh, yes. I want to
scream at them,

00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:48.896
I want to hold a big sign
saying 'Do Not Text and Drive,

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.206
My Daughter Lost Her Life.'

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:53.656
A daughter, who just months
earlier, had just graduated

00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:56.956
with honors from high school,
who was attending college,

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:59.766
excited about studying
forensics.

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:04.676
A daughter who had often heard
the familiar words from parents.

00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:06.996
It was a daily occurrence
we told her to drive safe,

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:09.736
be good, be careful, always.

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:13.676
A daughter who died exactly one
month after her 19th birthday.

00:04:14.226 --> 00:04:16.366
Her parents' pain still so raw,

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:19.756
they often find themselves
talking to Heather.

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.176
We have her urn in
the other room.

00:04:22.266 --> 00:04:23.476
We have a little shrine set up.

00:04:23.956 --> 00:04:25.646
And pictures and all
that stuff set up.

00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:28.706
When we go by the wreck,
crash site we say hi, Heather!

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:29.566
We love you.

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:30.126
We miss you.

00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:38.506
Yeah, we always do that.

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:39.386
Talk to her all the time.

00:04:39.576 --> 00:04:43.396
The Lerches have a second
child, a 16-year old son.

00:04:43.806 --> 00:04:45.476
We want to put him in
bubble wrap, but you can't.

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:47.666
The Lerches are encouraged

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:51.056
by a new state law
targeting distracted drivers.

00:04:51.106 --> 00:04:52.806
Scheduled to take
effect in June,

00:04:53.136 --> 00:04:54.556
the new law will make texting

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:58.156
and hand-held calls while
driving, a primary offense,

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:01.026
meaning the police can
pull drivers over for it.

00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:03.926
The fine: $124.

00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:05.146
It's great.

00:05:05.146 --> 00:05:07.176
I uphold that, yes.

00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:09.566
What a fantastic thing
that needs to be done.

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:11.346
I wish it was done sooner.

00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:12.946
Maybe it would have
saved my daughter's life.

00:05:13.056 --> 00:05:16.146
Now the Lerches are
left with memories.

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:19.356
The last one came just
hours before Heather died.

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:21.216
She had just come
home from school.

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:22.976
She was in her bedroom.

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:26.046
I went in there and
gave her a hug.

00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:37.046
I told her to have a
great day, I love her.

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:38.336
And I never saw her again.
