00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.191
Hello everyone, my name is Nilsor and welcome to my vault

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:10.862
Today on Fallout New Vegas 101

00:00:10.862 --> 00:00:12.519
we’re going to have a more indepth look at

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.141
the combat mecanic

00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:16.534
In the game

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:17.807
to fight is fairly easy

00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:19.143
you get yourself a weapon

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.829
you strike

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.927
it deals damage and hopefully it kills your target

00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:24.378
while you remain alive

00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:28.309
But if you take a closer look on how damage is calculated

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:29.517
it becomes more complex 

00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:31.563
even if you don’t really need to know everything

00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:34.185
to understand what weapon you should use

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:35.982
Factors

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:39.238
For combat you need to consider 8 factors

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:41.232
the type of your weapon

00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:43.402
the damage that it deals

00:00:44.103 --> 00:00:45.031
its condition

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:47.043
the ammo that you’re using

00:00:47.043 --> 00:00:49.071
your perks and traits

00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:51.571
the armor resistance of your opponents

00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:53.482
and the use of the VATS

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:55.638
The type of your weapon is going to be

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:58.187
ranged, melee or unarmed

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.033
Ranged alllows to target specific part of the body

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.032
and grant bonus for headshot

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:07.385
Melee and Unarmed can perfom special attack moves

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.288
that can grant bonus to damage

00:01:09.288 --> 00:01:10.700
such as the Uppercut

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:13.794
or the Ranger Takedown

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.863
The damage that your weapon does is indicated on your pipboy

00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:22.993
It is calculated with your skill and the condition of your weapon

00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:25.854
Condition decays when you’re using your weapon

00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:29.194
and can be restored when talking to certain vendors

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:31.330
The more in the Repair skill those vendors have

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.372
the more they will be able to fully repair your weapon

00:01:35.422 --> 00:01:37.815
The ammo that you use can have special attributes

00:01:38.658 --> 00:01:39.242
For example

00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:42.051
the 10mm round with hollow point is doing

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:46.044
1.75 more damage than the normal 10mm round

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:50.359
but it also multiplies the Damage Threshold of the target by 3

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.865
Some perks and traits are going to influence your critical hit chance

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:57.606
or add a bonus to the damage that you inflicts

00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:00.469
like the Better Critical or Ninja Perks

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.034
Armor resistance is composed of Damage Threshold and Damage Resistance

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.047
DT is indicated on the armor you wear

00:02:09.047 --> 00:02:11.080
It is a flat reduction of damage

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.653
meaning that if a shot deals 30 damage

00:02:13.653 --> 00:02:15.188
with a target DT of 10

00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:16.802
it will only do 20

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:20.541
The DT can reduce the damage dealt down to 20%

00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:22.756
If the damage is reduce so low

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:24.726
a red shield will appear

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.280
if you bypassed the DT it will be a broken red shield

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.719
The more damage you will do in a single shot

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.755
the more you will be able to bypass your ennemy’s DT

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:39.323
Which is why when you are opposed to heavy armored ennemy

00:02:39.323 --> 00:02:41.550
you should use a weapon with a heavy DAM

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.321
and on the contrary if you are faced

00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:46.416
with multiple ennemies with no DT you should use a weapon

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.839
with high DPS but not necesseraly high DAM

00:02:52.774 --> 00:02:55.987
Damage Resitance is the percentage that is reduce

00:02:55.987 --> 00:02:57.640
from what’s left of the damage

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.161
With the precedent example

00:02:59.161 --> 00:03:01.531
if the target has a damage resistance of 10

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:04.749
the 20 damage is going to be reduce by 10%

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:09.728
meaning that the shot will ultimately do 18 damage

00:03:09.728 --> 00:03:13.627
DR can reduce up to 85%

00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:19.072
VATS grants an additional 5% chance to do a critical hit

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:23.622
Your initial critical hit chance depends on your luck and some perks

00:03:23.622 --> 00:03:29.112
VATS permits the use of melee and unarmed special power attacks

00:03:29.112 --> 00:03:31.114
It is possible to perform a power attack

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:32.895
when you are not using the VATS

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:36.346
by holding the attack button while charging at your ennemy

00:03:36.346 --> 00:03:39.525
This type of attack doesn’t add any special effect

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:42.905
except of doubling the base damage of the weapon

00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:46.643
Using melee or unarmed weapon in the VATS

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.351
also double its base damage

00:03:50.753 --> 00:03:52.068
Calculation

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:55.780
First, DAM needs to be calculated as follow

00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:02.311
Damage, Skill and Condition are calculated on your weapon’s pipboy page

00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:06.275
Power doubles the damage for melee or unarmed weapon

00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.989
 if you use your VATS or perform a power attack

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:12.289
You then apply the modifier from your Ammo

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:14.670
And you add Bonus points from your strength

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.334
when you’re using a melee weapon

00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:19.351
or from your unarmed skills when using unarmed weapons

00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:23.085
After that the DAM is adjusted like so

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.010
Special is the modifier to apply if

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.326
you are using a special melee or unarmed attack like Uppercut

00:04:31.142 --> 00:04:33.598
Then the game calculates the bonus damage

00:04:33.598 --> 00:04:35.707
in case you perform a critical hit

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:37.261
After that is included

00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:40.739
how much your opponent’s armor is going to affect your attack

00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:43.958
And finally the DR show how much is left

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.214
of your attack after applying the damage resistance

00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:50.380
Finally, other modifiers are included

00:04:51.805 --> 00:04:55.049
SA adds the modifier if you performed a sneak attack

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:57.910
meaning that you’ve remained [Hidden] while attacking

00:04:58.108 --> 00:04:59.792
It is of 2 for ranged

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.749
and 5 for Melee or Unarmed attack

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:13.967
HS check if you did a headshot with a ranged weapon

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:15.444
which multiplies by 2

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:19.423
DM integrates the influence of the difficulty level

00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:23.909
from 2 on very easy to 0.5 on very hard

00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:27.828
And then the impacts of Perks and Chemicals

00:05:28.683 --> 00:05:29.441
After all that

00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:32.458
the final damage are finally applied to your target

00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:34.352
Throughout the game

00:05:34.352 --> 00:05:36.775
don’t hesitate to try different types of weapon

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:38.136
Shooting with a rocket launcher

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:40.823
blasting through your ennemies with a gatling laser

00:05:40.823 --> 00:05:42.442
or smashing your opponent’s head

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.508
procures different feelings and you might want to try them out

00:05:45.508 --> 00:05:47.848
before finding which ones your favorite

00:05:48.978 --> 00:05:52.232
