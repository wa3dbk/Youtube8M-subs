Hey guys welcome back this is Maxine from accessorygeeks.com 

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:13.592
And I have here the Zagg Mate with keyboards, This little device here is actually really nifty

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:18.574
Because not only as a case for your iPad but it’s also a keyboard as well. 

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:22.622
Nonetheless, We already have this unboxed and I’m just going to tell you why.  

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:29.511
Thanks for the packaging on this it was like trying to get keep in minds out and it took a while. 

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:33.546
So we’re just gonna go ahead and just start with the our oem box. 

00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:38.517
As you can see here, This is the charging cable, because this device is actually go to what it would mean..

00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:42.142
It acts independently without the iPad. 

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:45.613
So you never actually have the iPad physically attached. 

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:53.571
So let’s get started. We’re gonna go ahead and set this up to get your iPad stand in the case.  

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:58.055
We need to unfold this tab, and have it stand upright.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.686
And then you can just set your iPad down like that. 

00:01:01.688 --> 00:01:07.523
Now we’re gonna go ahead and turn on the device. Now we’re gonna go ahead and turn on the iPad. 

00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:16.536
Now we’re gonna pair the keyboard with any Bluetooth device, we're gonna go and it's starting and we’re gonna go to Bluetooth. 

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:22.579
And it has found the device so we’re gonna go ahead and hold down the Bluetooth botton here. 

00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:31.510
And there it is. So we’re gonna click the zagg mate and it’s going to find it now. It tells us to enter the pass keys.

00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:39.511
So we’re gonna enter the pass key on the screen 102322 enter and it’s connecting.   

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:42.512
And when it’s connected we’re gonna make sure everything is good. 

00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:45.285
And we don’t wanna forget the device because we’re using it. 

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:50.587
And you should be good to go. We’re gonna go ahead and open up safari and test this bad boy out.   

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:58.589
Here we go.. so we’re gonna go ahead and visit accessorygeeks.com.

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:09.586
Not bad right. It  takes a little a while to load, that you know the browser not the key boards fault

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:11.579
And the keyboard actually pretty responsive.

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:15.179
I'm gonna go ahead and open up notepad and I’m gonna start a new note. 

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:22.579
And I’m gonna show you Hallo geeks now you still can use the quick keys for apple. 

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:29.579
I’m gonna do apple "A" and that selects all and I copy it so apple "C"

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:31.679
I’m gonna go ahead and get rid of that apple "V" 

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:36.579
And there we go it paste it just like it would any other device. 

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:41.579
The only thing that you'll notice is that apple queue to  quit out of application doesn't work..

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:43.579
And that's because it's template..

00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:50.579
And I’m not james so I’m just gonna ahead and ignore that. But I love this.  

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:57.579
I actually love.. opps I can install to elsewhere..  I love this keyboard.  

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:02.541
Oops look at out of fraction for me. We can even take the iPad out   

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.592
And you’ll notice I’m gonna go ahead and type next to it.

00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:16.592
So I’m deleting, and if you notice that the device isn’t attached. So how cool is that. 

00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:23.574
So again this is the Zagg mate keyboard and case. Now to show you a little about the case  

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.522
I’m gonna go ahead and turn of the device. 

00:03:25.528 --> 00:03:30.611
So we don’t need this battery power. We’re gonna turn this onto stand by. 

00:03:30.618 --> 00:03:41.546
And here to fit your casing, just like.. not this way, the other way. Here we go..doo doo doo.    

00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:46.517
You know the port, that’s open. 

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:53.117
That's for charging the iPad as well as the Bluetooth keyboard, now the case it’s self is amazing

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:57.542
It’s got the thin chrome finish as the iPad does.

00:03:57.548 --> 00:04:04.513
And it sticks on there pretty good. I'm only holding the sides of the case. 

00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:11.571
It’s holding up pretty well. So I love it and it’s not too difficult to get it out, there’s suction 

00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:17.574
So I like to open it from here it’s so cool to do it.  

00:04:17.578 --> 00:04:23.522
So that’s the Zagg.. that’s the Zagg Mate case keyboard for the iPad.
