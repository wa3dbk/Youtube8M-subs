00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:23.339
I’ve lamented, time and again, how the Atelier
series kinda lost itself in the PS3 era.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.249
Yes, you could make the cute girls look REALLY
cute with all that processing power, and the

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.669
menu-based alchemic fiddlings were still there,
but the actual RPG mechanics seemed to take

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.340
a nosedive compared to the fine-tuned systems
of the Iris and Mana Khemia offerings.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.780
It was getting to the point where if I heard
one more “DOUSHIOU?”

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.329
I was gonna lose my damn mind, throw the country
A-K rack out on the street and make more High

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.520
Fidelity references.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.910
Throughout Rorona, Totori, Meruru, and Ayesha,
the moe was overwhelming, like a thick layer

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.910
of phlegm.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.910
And then I saw… this.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.300
One of the most striking openings I’ve seen
in a series known for striking openings, and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
a fantastic piece of music in a series known
for awesome soundtracks.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.800
My spirits were lifted a little bit.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.030
And then I saw…

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.080
THIS.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.530
That’s right, in the spirit of Star Ocean:
the Second Story, Mana Khemia 2, and Tales

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.299
of Xillia, you get to choose whether to play
as Escha or Logy, since it’s both of their

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.390
Atelier comma dammit.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.320
They’re both in the employ of a massive
bureaucracy, tasked with exploring the frontier,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.430
providing materials for the development and
sustenance of the outpost, and filling out

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.470
fifteen forms about it, in triplicate.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.909
I know that feeling.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.780
Here’s the thing, though: Whether you’re
playing as the cute girl or the more traditional

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.200
protagonist-with-a-checkered-past, the characters
are actually likeable.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.219
Earnest, driven, not shouting “Doushiou”
and instead actually getting things DONE.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.479
To this end, you’re issued a quarterly bingo
card full of assignments, the center of which

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.720
is your only truly required task.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.950
Everything else is just gravy that offers
permanent stat upgrades for your primary character,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.640
free goods, cash, or rank points that allow
you to show your bosses you’ve synergized

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.440
your core disciplines and paradigmed your
cost-effective actions, and now you should

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.330
be allowed to buy a permanent EXP boost that
they’re withholding from you until you pony

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.330
up the dough.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.209
They do, however, automatically restock all
your consumables between adventures, though,

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.310
so maybe the paperwork isn’t all bad.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.900
That’s right, they’ll reload your synthesized
stuff whenever you get home, so you’re free

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.780
to chuck all the bombs, potions, and other
devices you could ever dream of chucking.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.319
You’ll be creating these through your familiar
system of alchemic combination, though the

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.530
fiddly bits of getting elemental levels tuned
just right are different this time.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.720
Optimizing these thrown items is crucial to
surviving battles, so you’ll need to load

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.580
out your alchemists with the most efficient
combination of gear in addition to the usual

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.860
RPG spiel of weapon and armor building.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.420
Then it’s off to the fields to beat down
key targets, harvest all the resources you

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.379
can carry, and occasionally take special actions
like discovering relic items you can dismantle

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.040
or finding documents from a former era…
which really don’t do much except contribute

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.390
to one end-game task.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.849
Battles pit three members of your team against
a pack of enemies, with three further units

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.170
in reserve.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.910
Managing how to bounce these units in and
out of combat, how to most effectively cover

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.830
other frontline units, and utilizing the reserve
area’s SP-recharging capabilities are crucial.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:34.680
It’s… it’s a real RPG, and truly back
to form relative to the five PS2-era offerings.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.620
Quite thankfully.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.120
But while the gameplay is back up to the quality
set last… well, two generations ago, really…

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.590
the production quality seems to be out to
prove there’s life in the PS3 yet.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.810
From that awesome opening animation to the
highly detailed character models, to a soundtrack

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.680
that - according to the annotations unlocked
after beating the game - seems to revel in

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.909
odd time signatures, like Logy’s Atelier
theme in 13/8 and the 11/4 piece that plays

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.870
during the final storyline battle.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.860
Here I was, about to lose hope in this series
altogether, and then Gust go and make something

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.280
so ultimately playable that I get sucked right
back in.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.660
I blame the cute girl.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.140
Yes, all of them.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.470
Them and their science.
