00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:04.549
Here we want to talk about the take up lever.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.019
The take up lever is a little guy that goes
up and down every time you take a stitch.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.690
Now, he has a proper place at the very top
when the stitch is complete.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.690
No here’s something I want to show you,
if you’re in the habit even with your new

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.150
machine that should stop at the highest position
for you I bet you turn in the hand wheel over

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.779
here but you do have to get out of that habit,
I highly recommend it.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.310
It’s when you turn it and bring your needle
up out of the fabric that you look in here

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.570
and you do not see the take up lever.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.520
When you go and pull this out and go to start
again, what’s going to happen is, that take

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.070
up lever is going to pull the thread out of
your needle.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.519
So if you’re in the habit of always holding
on your threads when you start to stitch,

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:51.149
you can eliminate that by properly returning
the take up lever all the way up to the highest

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.149
position.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.750
Because here is what’s going to happen,
let’s say you’re sowing along and you

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.040
stop with your needle in the fabric.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.410
You should be using the needle upper button
in front of the machine or tapping your foot

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.559
control to do that half a stich.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.479
But let’s say you’re not, you’re over
here turning your hand wheel.

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.250
I’m going to bring the needle up about a
quarter of an inch.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.610
It’s out of the fabric, looks like it’s
ready to go.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.590
I’m going to come over here, you might even
still see three threads coming out.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.600
While the [burbin 01:18] is still being connected
with the needle thread and it kind of hard

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.780
to pull, that should obvious number one something
is not right.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.700
But here is what you can do, you can cut those
threads, you can dig out all those extra ones.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.030
As soon as you put your fabric back in, now
being this is red thread, we’ll see if you

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.030
can see this.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.920
I’m going to hold on to this and as I start
to stitch, that pick up lever is going to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.700
hold the thread out of my fingers and out
of the needle.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.000
Boom, gone and then you’re like “Oh, my
damn machine” but here’s the problem,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.400
it was your fault because you didn’t turn
the take up lever all the way up to the highest

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.400
position.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.789
Then you’re going to be rethreading your
machine every time.

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.890
Look I even have to go all the way back because
I can’t even get a hold of it.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.960
I’ll have to rethread from the beginning
and all you could have done is brought that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.680
up so you could see it and then or like I
said get in the habit of using your needle

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.800
up needle down button and not your hand wheel.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.489
The only time I use my hand wheel is when
I am trying to sink that needle down in to

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.769
an exact hole of a project I need to start
in.

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.770
That’s when I kind of will bring that down
and position it right in place.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.130
And you know what, bringing the take up lever
all the way up to its highest position which

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.001
you need to do on mechanical machines but
not on the computerized machines because the

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:41.810
very first thing my mom ever taught me, and
mom I love you, you have made it so easy.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.430
It was never the machines fault when I did
my sowing because you taught me that to complete

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.629
a stitch that I turn that hand wheel and brought
that all the way up to the highest position.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.850
Problems solved.
