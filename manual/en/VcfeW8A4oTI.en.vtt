00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.020
In one of my previous tutorials, I demonstrated
how to create a moving filmstrip effect in

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.600
Avid Media Composer.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.790
Check out this effect, based on the building
blocks of my earlier tutorial.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.250
Before you start this effect you may want
to review my earlier tutorial, because it

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.039
explains things in a bit more detail when
starting this effect.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.020
Start with 6 three second clips in a sequence.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.050
Drag the 3D PIP effect onto the first clip
in your timeline.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.170
Press the effect mode button.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.200
Move over to the record side of the Composer
window, and drag the playhead indicator to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.360
the first frame.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.559
Press the add keyframe button.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.739
Press the reduce button so you can see outside
the visible picture area.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.650
Move the picture in picture off to the right
edge of the visible area.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.270
Move the playhead indicator to the last frame
of the clip.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.909
Again, press the add keyframe button.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.340
Now move the picture in picture off to the
left side of the visible area.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.369
Store the effect from the effect editor window
by dragging it into a bin.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.479
Click on this timecode track to exit effect
mode.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.149
Then drag a marquee lasso around all your
clips within the timeline.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:45.719
Go ahead and move the position indicator forward
one second.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.989
Hold down the command key and drag the next
clip up and over to V2 so it snaps to the

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.639
playhead indicator.

00:01:54.639 --> 00:02:09.209
Repeat this process until you've got a moving
filmstrip effect.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.760
Park over the middle of one of your clips
on V3 and press the effect mode button.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.090
Move over to the composer window and press
the add keyframe button.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.430
Move your picture in picture down towards
the bottom of the screen.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.000
Click on the Y Rotation button within the
effects editor window.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.319
Go ahead and rotate your picture and picture
effect.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.450
Store your new effect in a bin.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.620
You may want to give it a name.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.200
Select all your clips in the timeline by dragging
a lasso around them and / or shift clicking

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.670
on them.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.020
Double click on your new effect that you saved
in the bin.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.069
Okay, that's it!

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:10.319
Check it out.
