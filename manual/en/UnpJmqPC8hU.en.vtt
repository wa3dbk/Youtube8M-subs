00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:12.160
♫ Intro ♫

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.140
Today we'll learn the common concept of force.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.710
We'll make a very interesting experiment in which the notion of force will be contrasted.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.189
And we'll relate those results with Newton's First Law.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.669
Today I was coming to school by bus almost asleep on my seat and suddenly it stopped

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:36.700
With the impulse I almost end up sitting on the floor.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.150
Were you hurt?

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.320
No, but there were some people standing and they were all cramped against the bus driver.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.270
So, what’s your doubt?

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.090
Do you remember when our teacher talked about Newton in our last lesson?

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.690
I was on my way to school wondering about the first law.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.690
The law of inertia?

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.170
That one!

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.300
“To change the speed of an object it is necessary to apply a force on it”.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.320
We could say that an object which is at rest will remain this way unless a force is applied on it.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.940
If the object was already moving, will it keep on moving unless a force is applied on it?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.620
Exactly! What's the problem?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.700
I was at rest and, according to Newton, to move forward, there had to exist a force.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.080
But you weren’t at rest.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.860
Yes! Didn’t I mention that I was almost asleep?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.460
Ok, it may be, but the bus was moving.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.430
The force doesn't exist by its own, it's a way in which objects interact.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.530
Only if a force is applied to an object you can change its speed.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.260
It means that, if it was standing still, it'll start to move.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.230
And if it was moving, it'll stop.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.720
If the force dissapears and a new one is not applied, speed will remain constant.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.420
But if force is applied constantly, speed will increase or decrease,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.339
according to the direction of the force, progressively.

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:18.979
