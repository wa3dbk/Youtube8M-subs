Hi, I'm Ann Myrick and today we're going to
talk about bedroom painting ideas. I'm in

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.309
the master bedroom and the color that I have
on the wall is kind of a fleshy, peachy color

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:23.210
that I do not like at all. So I am going to
want to decide on a wall color, and then how

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.560
I want to paint the room. In using paint,
there, other than just straight painting your

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.610
walls, there's many different things that
you can do. If I wanted to use, one color

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.090
will keep it from, it will keep it looking
consistent and not chop the room up but a

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.250
lot of times it's fun to accent maybe one
wall. So if I wanted to pick out like a neutral

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.100
color but then come back with a dark brown
color, or come back with a dark green color,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.170
or a color that I really wanted in the room
but I didn't want all four walls. Then I could

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.960
pick a wall out. I might pick out the wall
that my bed is against and put one great color

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.800
on that wall and then the rest of, the other
three walls I would do another color. So there

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:25.120
would just be an accent on that wall and then
it would really show the bed off really well.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.050
Other things you can do. There's many different
techniques with paint that you can do. You

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:38.530
can stripe, you can do top and bottom, one
color on the top, one color on the bottom.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.880
You could take your room neutral but then
paint your trim. A lot of times you'll see

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.390
in New York apartments and, those small little
apartments you'll see where the walls will

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.310
be one solid color but then they'll do some
fun color like turquoise or yellow on the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.140
trim instead of what we would normally do,
is the color on the wall and the trim being

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.510
white. So play with your colors, have fun
with colors, and try to just really experiment.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.899
These are ideas about how to paint your bedroom.
