00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.140
Michelangelo was ordered by Princes of the Church to paint the "Sistine Chapel" and got in some trouble.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.980
Hallelujah - Hallelujah!

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.800
Who benefits from art? Art is EXPENSIVE!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.420
Goethe wrote "Faust" by himself, 
Plato was thinking way too hard

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.880
Before Van Gogh lost his ear, all he heard up until then was:

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.840
"You young wild one sell your pictures!"

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.720
Men of letters, brush swingers, psychopaths, little bringers,...

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.960
...philosophers, mostly drunk. Why are you here?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.680
The art, the art, it is a favour! 
Given by gods - for nothing! (The art!)

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.160
No clue about art, we never studied it and look - it works!

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.000
Never again...! Art!

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.200
I like to listen to Mozart and Wagner, especially when I eat.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.460
But my hamster gets a tinnitus when listening to Mr. Stockhausen.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.420
Weird! Way too weird!

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.500
Art! Never again! Art!

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.560
Andy Warhol? Superstar!
Joseph Beuys? No objection!

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.940
But Albrecht DÃ¼rers hands, those which pray, I think are awesome!

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.380
They still pray in every bedroom!

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.820
Brush swingers, whine singers, someone bring me a beer!

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.180
Everything I do not understand is not art and meant for the toilet!

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.920
The art, the art, it is a favour! 
Given by gods - for nothing! (The art!)

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.320
No clue about art, we never studied it and look - it works!

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.260
Never again! Art!
