Hi, I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about how faucets work. So here's a typical

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.300
kitchen faucet that we have here, now this
particular one actually has a spray that's

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.860
built into it. Some faucets will - you can
have a single handle such as this, a double

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.090
handle. And you may have the sprayer off to
the side here now in this case, in this setup

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.790
we've actually got a filtered water system
that's on this side. You have two main types

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.159
of faucets that you'll find today. There's
a stem and valve type and then a compression

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:40.519
type. Now the compression type will use washers,
and then the stem type basically has all one

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:50.260
unit within the cylinder. Now underneath this
handle this handle is attached, usually with

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.659
a set screw which is an Allen wrench, so if
you have a Allen wrench such as this, you're

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:04.059
able to get in here and to access it, access
it and all you do is just loosen the Allen

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:14.280
wrench and this handle pops off and then you're
exposed to the inside. Now this particular

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.159
faucet here actually has a stem, so if we
have any problems with this faucet, we simply

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.229
unscrew this, remove this whole cylinder,
and you can find those replacement cylinders

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.659
at any hardware store or home improvement
store. Same way with your washers, and to

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:41.039
determine what type you have you simply just
need to remove your handle and to look inside.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.289
How this works with this particular one is
you have your main lines that feed up underneath

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:55.179
the sink, with this valve sided actually mixes
the hot and the cold together depending on

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.500
if you rotate it to this side it'll put more
cold in, if you rotate it to the left it'll

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.799
put more hot in. So you can adjust your temperature
by moving the handle back and forth. And then

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.400
again with a sprayer you can pull this out.
With your sprayer you have two types of spray,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.470
we have your normal faucet, if you press the
button, then it will come out and you can

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:29.640
use this for a vegetable wash or for rinsing
your sink. So with that I'm Tim Gipson and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.849
that's how a faucet works.
