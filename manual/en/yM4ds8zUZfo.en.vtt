00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.509
Welcome to DevFactor!

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.210
and today we're going to talk a little
bit about UML

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.720
and you are now is something that
software engineers use

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.779
you know pretty of into kinda design
their code before they actually start

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:24.279
writing

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.090
to the matter is email our biggest ally
software companies people is years away

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.760
board

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.250
sketches instead the the mall kinda
gives you a structured way

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.680
going about planning at your code before
you actually start reading

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.640
so you know ye in the background this
video you can see that I'm

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.649
using web site called rod I L which

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.550
is a free kinda like alternative to
Microsoft Visio which is very popular

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.450
for

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.530
more diagramming and

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.860
I'd recommend you check it out I don't
think it's a a mandatory part of the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.000
series by felt like it was important
enough

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.120
to some people that I should probably
touch on it and in the back and you can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.140
see them doing what's called a class

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.770
design diagram and the top %uh you have
in the middle class

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.979
next you have the fields and their data
tapes

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.290
and then after that you have the methods
in a class

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.729
and that's the way I modeling what class
looks like and you'll see pretty soon

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.110
and make another class

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.770
and them going to have a diamond on my
first class point to the second class

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.920
thats composition relationship and that
just means the for

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.990
the first class the board has a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.320
second class which I believe is a chair
racer

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.320
object in this particular example so we
can also use these diagrams to model

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.540
inheritance relationships almost
anything else you can think of to play

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.840
your coat so if you think it's useful

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.080
make sure to check out draw I know it's
totally free

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.060
and it's a really nice alternative
Microsoft Visio actually like it more

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.760
and otherwise no I got a couple
questions

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.299
and were interesting address this
tutorial series

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.240
so questioner one has to use a lengthy
the tutorials

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.630
so according to the Google Analytics
panel I'm provided with

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.250
you guys like videos there five minutes
or less

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.520
and actually i've seen my six and seven
minute videos

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.370
most people watch about five minutes
that means they're missing the last one

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.970
percent the videos

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.390
so I'm kinda thinking you now five
minutes is really short for programming

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.640
tutorial video I have to split this into
like

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.010
a hundred 200 upset as crazy by

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.110
and want to do that that's perfectly
fine with me the next video is 10

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.930
minutes long

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.050
that's what i was gonna test next scene
see

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.780
you know if I'm actually writing code
will people staying and learn what there

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.950
is to learn from that video

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.630
so if you have an opinion on this if you
think this refinance 10 minutes

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.380
15 minutes or 20 minutes I love to hear
that in the comments section below the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.840
video

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.340
now homie structure my future tutorial
videos

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.680
in this java game development series

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.980
in my next and final question actually
has to do with the thumbnails

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.480
in the naming convention I'm using for
my videos so I recently went back in and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.780
make custom thumbnails for

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.650
every single video on this channel oh my
god that took a long time

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.720
and I also you know I tried to make more
exciting tales

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.440
who were around I loved how other people
meet exciting tutorial titles

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.780
and I change them so you know I love
your feedback on that you like to do

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.670
something else you like new titles are
the things I should change

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.109
should I make the tutorial titles you
know more streamlined so they're all

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.190
like very similar

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.459
no just put a number after them or
something like that in your feedback on

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:41.819
their

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.620
that would be great otherwise I'm off to
work on some new videos

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.290
thank you for watching if you are
interested in learning more about

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.290
programming for java game development

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.290
make sure to subscribe to my channel get
new updates

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.290
