00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.000
Today we are walking through a rainforest
in Jamaica. Half of our group decided to come

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.469
do the trip up the mountain, and the other
half decided to go to a Maroon community.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.699
It was a lot of fun. It was a lot of hiking.
Something you’re not used to when you’re

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.760
just stepping off of a boat. But it was really
nice to stretch our legs again, and just kind

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.800
of explore in the rainforest.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.219
This is the plant which is called Soursop.
When it is ripe, it becomes soft. When take

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.769
the skin off, there is a white texture inside.
A very good fruit for the nerve. If you have

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.220
a good glass of orange juice and soursop juice,
and tired, then it’s gonna put you to sleep.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.670
Rufus was our tour guide. He is a descendent
of the Maroon community, that when they ran

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.850
away from their slave owners they couldn’t
use any of the traditional doctors otherwise

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.729
they would have to go back and be punished,
so they ended up trying to find traditional

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.180
remedies so the Maroon community is very closely
tied to the medicines of the island. And Rufus

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.320
himself was very forthcoming with all of his
knowledge and all of his information of the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.560
plants we were going over.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.409
-Everybody’s plant, it’s all about practice.
It’s all about—you got to be there with

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.630
it. You got to grow with it—it’s got to
be a part of you.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.049
He was talking about exactly how you make
chocolate from the cacao tree.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.011
-Inside here, this is the cocoa beans.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.000
He seemed to grab plants out of nowhere and
say “Ah—well this one will cure stomachaches;

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.490
this one can close wounds!”

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.630
I wrote my change paper on a topic called
“Authority versus Experience,” in terms

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.250
of medicines and how medicines have been used
throughout the years on the different islands

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.400
in the Caribbean. And I focused on how traditional
remedies used by the natives have been influenced

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.110
by the use of modern medicines in drugstores.
We ended up doing an addendum. At the end

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.220
of this trip, after we have researched our
topics and visited communities on the port

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.329
stop destinations, the information we gather
by actually being immersed in the culture,

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.459
we use to change our opinions of what we’ve
been writing about since we first started

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.339
writing just from documents.

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.260
It was one thing to read the document on a
computer screen. It was another thing to see

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.029
those exact same words in an original copy
of the Sloan book. But now to see the actual

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:58.749
plants that he has perfect beautiful illustrations
of—it’s a different experience entirely.

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.519
It’s one I never thought I’d be having.
It’s fascinating! It’s absolutely amazing

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.989
just to be here, and be able to be in an area
where you can find all of these remedies around

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.389
you. They’re everywhere—we’ve seen them
in the back of peoples’ gardens. We’ve

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.779
sampled them from the back of peoples’ gardens.
It’s fascinating. It’s amazing to be able

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:23.799
to see the plants that Sloan was recording
so many years ago, just sort of being part

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.919
of the society still today.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.019
I feel like people, certainly in the rural
communities in this valley, do use the plants

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.049
around them. I don’t know if the whole island
does, but I ran into a couple people at the

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.540
market yesterday too, who were talking about
how they still go into the forest and pick

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.159
the certain plant that helps cure a certain
ailment and they’ll make a paste, or they’ll

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.799
boil it and they’ll make a remedy for themselves.
But then I ran into some other people who

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.589
solely trust the pharmacy. So, there’s a
mixture. There’s certainly a mixture in

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:56.669
this area.
