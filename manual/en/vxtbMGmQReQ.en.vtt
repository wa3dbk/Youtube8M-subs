00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.580
So another part at home foot care is trimming
the bottom of the feet, the pads of the feet,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:17.120
the hair that is in the foot pad. So you can
see here how the pads of the feet and we've

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.320
got hair growing right through here. In the
winter time, this hair can collect ice balls.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.340
It is very uncomfortable for the dogs and
in the summertime, it can collect dirt. So

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.570
we want to take care of this hair here. Also,
when you are looking at the feet you are going

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.660
through the feet seeing how the hair is matted,
you might find strange things like this. Looks

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.219
like a pine needle is stuck in this dog's
coat so I am going to take my comb and comb

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.539
most of the hair out of here. It is fairly
sticky. I don't want to just cut it out because

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.100
I don't want to lose the coat on the dog.
So I am going to use the comb to get it out

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.160
and I am, even though the dog is pulling his
leg away, I am holding this down here and

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.520
I'm trying not to pull the hair. So I got
this out and it is a wadded up bit of pine

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.280
needle with some sap. So if you are going
over your dog's feet when doing your at home

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.040
maintenance you are going to find things like
this and you can clean them out before they

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.250
become problematic. So I want to trim some
of this hair off. I can either do it with

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:48.120
my scissors or I can do it with my razor.
You take the dog's foot and very carefully

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:57.890
you will trim the hair from around the pads
and very careful not to cut the feet obviously

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.890
and you can trim the hair around here too.
Again, it keeps the foot a lot cleaner. So

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:18.360
I just trimming this hair being very careful
to keep the scissors flat with the foot pad;

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.960
tickles a little bit with the dog but they
can move their foot a little bit as long as

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:35.950
you are holding the foot being very careful
with your scissors. This also gives the dog

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:45.400
better traction on the floor, wooden, tile
or linoleum floor, because they are not walking

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.210
on all that hair. So I am just trimming this
hair right out between the pads and this is

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.820
going to make it more comfortable for the
dog and they will track in less stuff so that

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.900
is a cleaner foot pad.
