00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.800
The Senster was a piece of cybernetic sculpture which responded to movement and sound

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.600
It was based on the design and functionality of a lobster claw

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.850
It looked something like a lightweight crane

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.900
All of the structure was hand built

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.700
Edward put together all of the struts, everything by hand, welded them in place

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.340
I got involved because I’d just left music college

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.140
and he offered me three days a week for ten quid and it was a fascinating time

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.300
it was a new world, completely new world for me

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.040
The computer he had was the size of a fridge

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.640
It was cumbersome; it took half an hour to boot the machine up on punch tape

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.090
You’d get the tape thing rolling and go and have a coffee and wait for it to finish

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.040
One of the things about a thing this big, it had immense power and if things went wrong

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.340
and you were in the way, it could be extremely dangerous

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.760
This thing could take your head off

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.740
He thought of it as a piece of sculpture not as a robot

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.800
The robotic element was almost incidental

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.380
There was a lovely tale that it was at rest when we’d set it up

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.500
and a woman walked past in heels and click clack click clack passed it and it just followed her legs

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.600
as she walked along

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.680
He wanted it to, in a sense, fool you

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.120
that there was something there that wasn’t, an animal nature

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.660
He was interested to think that, well, maybe

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.979
it will make people realise that a lot of things we assume are human and animal like

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:54.819
are just mechanical

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.800
because if a machine can look like animal, is behaving like an animal

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.070
then maybe we have to question, you
know, who we are
