00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.600
Hey, guys, Dr. Axe here.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.990
I'm so excited to share with you a new, cutting-edge
product we have and one of the supplements

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.940
that I personally use the most and its collagen
protein.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.150
And collagen protein is actually the amino
acids that you would find in something like

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.169
bone broth today, which we know to be one
of the top healing foods in the entire world.

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.600
Collagen really has four unique benefits and
as I go through this video, by the way, I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.730
also want to go through who needs to be taking
this and how it can benefit your health.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.690
But really, four main benefits.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.190
One, this really improves leaky gut or it
really supports your digestive tract.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.880
So collagen really supports digestion.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.899
Also, it helps with joint health and even
things like any sort of joint discomfort.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.450
The other thing it can help with is helping
tone and tighten your skin.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.230
So it's used in a lot of skin products, collagen
is.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.970
Last but not least, collagen is also used
to support a healthy metabolism for things

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.250
like fat-burning, weight loss overall, even
building muscle.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.950
But collagen is important for, really, all
of those things.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.300
So what collagen is, again, its amino acids
and amino acids are the building blocks of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.300
protein.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.540
So, number one, if you are trying to increase
your metabolism or get more protein in your

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.630
diet, supplementing with collagen is fantastic
and it works for so many people because collagen

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.070
is dairy-free, it's gluten-free and it's easily
digested.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.510
So even a lot of people in things like the
GAPS diet or people out there who are looking

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.850
to really support and heal their gut, they
use collagen instead of protein powder.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.460
Or a lot of people like myself do protein
powder and collagen, maybe even some green

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.280
super-food powder there in my morning smoothie.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.390
But again, collagen is really for anybody
who are looking for those four distinct ways

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.360
to support their body and benefit their body
and number one is joints.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.840
Collagen works because collagen is the building
blocks of your tissues.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.900
So if you're an athlete or you have any sort
of joint pain or discomfort or you're a runner

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.219
or any sort of stress on your joints or if
you experience joint discomfort on a regular

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:22.310
basis, collagen is the building blocks of
supporting your body and your body creating

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.299
new and healthy tissues.

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.030
That's why it's so great for your joints,
whether it be issues with your knees or hips

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.200
or shoulders or risks or back or any of those
joint areas, it's fantastic.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.239
Collagen is a great thing you want to be supplementing
with on a daily basis.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.849
Also, as I mentioned earlier, it's great for
your skin.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.840
Collagen is made up of two amino acids primarily
called proline and glycine.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.689
Proline is that amino acid that helps tighten
your skin.

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.030
So you're going to find collagen supplements
are found in a lot of skincare products.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.959
It's even used by some people to help reduce
issues like cellulite.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.939
But we know collagen is great because collagen
helps firm, tone and tighten your skin.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.719
One of the things that happens as we start
to age is your own skin and body starts producing

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.269
less collagen.

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.380
So you need to be getting more collagen in
your diet on a regular basis and so doing

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.469
a little bit of collagen powder in your morning
smoothie or throughout the day is a great

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.280
way to really support and tone and tighten
your skin naturally.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.489
Also, collagen is vitally important for helping
heal your gut.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.700
Now, collagen can be used or it's very similar
to gelatin and collagen is what helps make

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.060
up gelatin and those amino acids, proline
and glycine.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.799
But your gut, we know issues like leaky gut.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.500
Your gut kind of works as a net and you can
get holes in your gut.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.180
Gluten can leak through and that's essentially
what leaky gut is or digestive issues.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.689
It's when things like gluten or casein or
toxins leak through your gut, get into your

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.849
bloodstream and cause system-wide inflammation
which can then affect your joints.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:05.099
It can even lead to things like autoimmune
disease over time or skin issues or thyroid

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.390
issues or any sort of inflammatory reaction.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.599
Well, what collagen does is collagen helps
you just like it helps tighten and tone your

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.940
skin, it helps tighten and tone your digestive
tract and it helps repair leaky gut.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.530
So collagen is really great for supporting
the healing repair of leaky gut.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.190
So collagen...when I have patients with digestive
issues, it is one of the number one things

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.220
that I put them on immediately to support
digestive function.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.890
Last but not least, if you're looking at increasing
the amount of protein in your diet which can

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.220
reduce overall cravings, can also support
a healthy metabolism and creating lean muscle

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.490
tissue, this is a great thing to do.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.570
In fact, just one tablespoon of collagen powder
has about 7 grams of protein.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.600
So you can do a couple of tablespoons of collagen
powder in your morning smoothie and get about

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.970
15 grams of easily digestible protein.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.840
So this is something a lot more people who
are looking to get fit and toned and healthy

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.570
are adding into their smoothies as well.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.130
So again, just to break down the benefits
of collagen.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.350
Collagen protein powder is fantastic because
it really supports your joints, your skin,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.540
your gut, as well as your metabolism.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.010
I want to say this, there are a lot of other
companies out there that are putting out collagen

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.380
powder right now.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.930
I would not even come close to consuming those
because the animals aren't grass-fed.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.940
Many of them are injected with hormones and
I'm happy to announce that I found a great

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.970
source of grass-fed collagen that doesn't
use any sort of hormones and chemicals, it's

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.160
completely natural.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.340
It's also grass-fed.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.420
So this is collagen powder that comes from
grass-fed cows from Argentina.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.730
So again, it's a great product there, chemically-free,
completely natural there as well.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.550
So who should take collagen?

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.640
Anybody who wants to benefit in those four
ways I've mentioned in terms of helping support

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.250
your skin, your joints, your gut as well as
your metabolism.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.220
Again, this is a great dairy-free and gluten-free
option for increasing your amino acids and

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.220
protein.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.430
Here's the other unique thing is that it's
not protein, its amino acids which are the

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.650
building blocks of protein.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.660
So it's predigested protein which is why it's
so easy to digest.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.250
Again, I recommend two tablespoons every morning
in your superfoods smoothie.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.040
A lot of times, I'll do this twice a day,
I'll put a couple more tablespoons in after

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.790
my morning workout there as well, as part
of my Dr. Axe superfoods smoothie.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.880
By the way, I believe so much in this product
and that you're going to see results that

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.880
