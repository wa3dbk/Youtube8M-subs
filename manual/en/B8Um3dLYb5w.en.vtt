AROUND THE HEAD, THE MOUTH."&gt;

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.710
A kitten nearly dies after she's

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.180
crushed by wooden pallets.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.810
But, today she's bouncing back

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.880
to health!

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.850
And she's got a new name! Our

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.020
Vanessa Peng is LIVE with a

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.620
remarkable story of survival.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.150
Kevin, Stacey -- the adorable

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.960
kitten's name is Sierra. She is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.560
amazingly gentle and calm,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.790
especially after what she went

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.830
through.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.230
&lt;Purring Nats&gt; Sierra can't seem

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.300
to stop showing

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.900
off how happy she is. &lt;Britt

Animal Control Officer 2:02 "SHE

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.800
LOOKS A 100 PERCENT BETTER."

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.670
2:04&gt; Less than a week ago --

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.740
she might not have made it out

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.500
alive. &lt;Joe Piziali, West Des

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.010
Moines Animal Control Officer

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.740
1:10 "SHE WAS BLEEDING FROM THE

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.470
MOUTH, LOOK LIKE AROUND THE

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.210
EYES." 1:12&gt; It was last

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.110
Thursday when Joe Piziali

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.380
found Sierra inside a Pepsi

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.250
semi-trailer outside the Jordan

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.750
Creek Hy-Vee. He tells us it was

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.980
bitterly cold and Sierra

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.180
probably jumped into the trailer

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.720
to warm up. &lt;Joe Piziali, West

TRUCK THAT IT WAS WITH ALL THE

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.390
PALLETS MORE THAN LIKELY

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.390
SHIFTED." 38&gt; Piziali says

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.960
Sierra was likely crushed.

WORRIED 16&gt; The five month old

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.100
kitty was rushed to the Furry

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.330

A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BLOOD

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.930
AND IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHAT

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.410
EXACTLY WAS GOING ON AT FIRST."

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.310
35&gt; Sierra suffered a broken jaw

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.010
and has a split lip. &lt;Britt

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.580
DON'T YOU." 13:04&gt; Since she's

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.410
arrived -- Sierra's been healing

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.880
...she's eating again. For now,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.280
she's fed through a syringe.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.850
She's still on pain medication

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.390
and antibiotics.. But soon,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.190
she'll be looking for her

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.060
