00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.180
I want to show you the MegaMat, the
MegaMat is the pioneer of a new

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.199
technology, we call it the three
dimensional technology because as you

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.509
see, there is not like in the two
dimensional, the regular two-dimensional

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:32.050
technology with self inflating nets,
there is no edges which slope down, it's

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.440
all one horizontal surface, so it's a
much larger usable surface. Basically

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.260
it's like your home mattress
brought to the outdoors, right. That's it,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.850
so let me show you now how to inflate it.
The first time you pull out the mat,

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:01.270
which I do now, it really might take a
while but that's because it was shipped

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.390
in the, in the, it was shipped for six
weeks, it was laying with distributor,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.159
maybe a week, two weeks at the retailer,
so the initial foam needs quite some

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.260
time to grow, so just let it sit for 24
hours. However, just putting up the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.920
inflation valve there is an inflation, a
deflation valve, as you can see, and the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.810
inflation valve has a tab pretty, easy to
identify. Just pull it and you

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.290
immediately hear the sucking sound of
air, that's the foam in there that grows

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:41.890
now and until it's really completely
full. At the end I'll show you now when

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.620
it's already inflated.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.400
We have integrated a little mini pump so
you are able to almost, totally fully

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.630
inflate, not over inflate, but fully
inflate the mat to be able to adjust it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.390
to your anatomy. Let me show you that.
Just open the inflation valve, there's

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.280
nothing, no air coming out because
there's a one-way flap, which is quite

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:24.680
useful. Just flip it on and now there you
go, and then you can, you might grab it here.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.760
Really inflate it strongly,
put it out, leave it open, lay on it

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:44.400
and now especially as a side sleeper
because of the bumps in your body, you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.700
want to adjust it just right to your
anatomy, which makes it really ergonomic.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.200
So there, that's about what best for me,
however think of it when it's really

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.540
cold it's better to have quite a firm
mat, like if you are sleeping on ice in

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.510
Greenland or something like that. That
goes for the inflation part, I show you

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.530
here, that's an added feature. You can join two

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.989
mats. There is this little strap and it
really hinders the mats to slip apart,

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.030
especially for couples it's really
useful.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.780
We call it the marriage gap so that
there's none of it now. It really is nice.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.130
Okay, so the inflation now, I'll show you
how to deflate the mat. It's a two-step

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.140
process, first you loosely lay up, just
roll the mat together,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.780
like this. And then open the deflation
valve, the inflation you close.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:08.580
Use your body weight, it's really the
most easy, easiest. And now I, I do it the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.870
second time. You can leave this open
because this it is a one-way flap that

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.280
hinders the air to be sucked back and
now you can really go very tight, as tight

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:32.300
as you want. It's useful to use your both
of your knees, or one of your knees like this.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.780
There you go.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:50.060
Okay, the bag is, is quite big. The cut is big because then

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:57.490
it's always quite easy to insert it,
there's no struggle to it, okay.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.080
And now the mini pump, where it goes and the repair kit with instructions, please

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.280
read them. Okay, that's it. Have fun, sleep well.
