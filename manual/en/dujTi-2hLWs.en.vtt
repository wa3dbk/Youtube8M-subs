This is Buddy Mopper from Cosmedent, I'm the
co-founder of Cosmedent, and very proud of

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.719
the products we've produced in the past.

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.870
We are really the leaders in composite polishing
and we are very proud of the fact that we

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.529
have developed products that are so useful
to the practicing dentists.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.060
But today we want to introduce to you a new
product, and that is our All-Ceramic Polishers.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.170
What I mean by All-Ceramic Polishers are polishers
that will polish ANY ceramic that you have,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.400
whether it is zirconia, lithium disilicate,
feldspathic porcelain, or milled CAD/CAM ceramics.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.910
It will bring it to a luster that you won't
believe, making glazing not essential.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.140
It really is a system that is meant to be
used with light touch under low speed.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.360
We are going to give you a demonstration,
and this demonstration will represent just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.800
how easy it is to use.
