Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.640
[pause]

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.920
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.940
Here in New York, the summer is fading and,
unfortunately, so are most

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.160
people’s tans. So, if you want to keep your
tan all year long, it’s really

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.570
important to learn how to use self-tanners
properly. If you can use a self-

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.780
tanner, you want that tan to be as rich and
as even as a real tan. If you

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.000
understand how self-tanners work, you’ll
understand then why it’s so very

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.530
important to exfoliate your skin daily in
order to be able to have a rich,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.879
even tan from a self-tanner. Self-tanners
work only by staining the dead

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.450
surface cells on your skin. Those dead surface
cells are supposed to fall

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.829
off after four weeks, and therefore, the surface
should be smooth but the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.069
cells don’t always do that. They start to
accumulate into clumps and mounds

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:58.620
and, when that happens and then you put a
self-tanner on, the self-tanner

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.909
has more staining on the mounds and clumps
than it does on the areas around

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.720
it, and you get an uneven tan from the self-tanner.
The corrugations on

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.890
this piece of cardboard are like the mounds
of cells on your skin. If you

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.320
apply the self-tanner like the magic marker,
it hits the high points and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.030
stains the high points or the mounds more
deeply and you get a very uneven

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.340
color. However, if you exfoliate daily and
get your skin to a nice even

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.930
smooth base and then put your self-tanner
on, this is what it looks like in

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.310
representation of the black magic marker on
a nice, even-base. The tan

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.570
looks even. So, if you want to keep your tan
all year round and use a self-

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.800
tanner, make sure you exfoliate every day
so you can really enjoy a nice

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.920
even rich deep tan.
