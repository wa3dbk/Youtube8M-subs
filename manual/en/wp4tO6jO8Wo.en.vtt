00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.820
Hi everybody!

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.000
Today, we are going to make godeungeojorim,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.840
mackerel with radish, braised in Korean seasoning.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.000
Geodeungeo is mackerel, so I got these two guys,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.400
and small size, around  750 grams.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.960
First, I'm just going to just cut this way.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.060
This part.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600
I'm not going to use this.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.040
It was frozen, so I thaw it out, this.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.140
Remove fins this way.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.700
So cut this.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.960
Like this.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.360
Two inch length.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.960
And diagonally we just cut this.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.580
Now let's rinse this in cold water.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.640
Okay, drain this.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.960
Wash your cutting board.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200
It's radish let's peel this.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.020
And rinse this quickly.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.080
Throw away.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.320
And we are going to make big chunks.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.860
I'm going to use around one kilo.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.460
So, let's see.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.200
On the scale, 1040 grams, so one kilo.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.180
And next, onion.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.940
I will use one thick, huge onion.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.740
Just slice it.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.020
Then, what is it?

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.220
Mackerel!

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.220
Time for mackerel to come.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520
So, let's make seasoning sauce.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.040
One third cup of garlic.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.760
Okay, one third cup amount minced garlic.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.000
And ginger, one tablespoon amount.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.900
One tablespoon minced ginger.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.960
Soy sauce.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.620
Hot pepper flakes, quarter cup.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.880
If you prefer non-spicy version, just skip the hot pepper flakes.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.340
And sugar, two tablespoons.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.360
And mix this well.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.400
And pour this on top of this.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.580
And we are going to use one cup of water.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.580
And bring to a boil!

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.840
Three stalks green onion.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.500
Slice this.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.180
Red chili pepper and green chili pepper.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.500
Give the really good flavor.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.820
And the red chili pepper.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.020
My house is full of delicious smell.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.020
Especially when you make godeungeojorim,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.020
smells so good.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.020
Let's open this!

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.220
On the bottom lots of liquid.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.260
We are going to turn down the heat.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.500
Really over really low heat.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.080
And make the gap like this.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.780
Scoop this with your spoon, large spoon,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.740
and then pour this over the top.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.520
If you chopped the green onion and chilies, put it over.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.600
And close the lid, and cook over low heat.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.860
Thirty minutes we simmer this.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.800
Let's see what it looks like. :)

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.120
Open!

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.720
Oh my!

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.240
Smells so good.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.940
Radish is well cooked now, brownish and really translucent.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.340
Turn up the heat, over high heat.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.100
All this broth on the bottom is going to be evaporated.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.580
So as much as you can.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.560
And again,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.000
little push these guys like this

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.520
and we need some like well.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.840
Scoop some broth and pour this over the fish.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.020
Just repeat this.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.260
Like this.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.220
A little shake this

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.940
just in case on the bottom it shouldn't be burned.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.160
Okay, done.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.520
Turn off the heat.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.640
There is a little juice on the bottom.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.000
I'm going to show you. So, so delicious.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.380
We made godeungeojorim today, so let's taste it.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.100
And godeungeojorim, usually when we serve Korean meal,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.280
we add a few more side dishes. Of course kimchi and soup,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.620
but I don't need anything else.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.640
It's just I want this, you know, lettuce.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.560
This is going to be my lunch today.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.600
Some people ask, "how can you eat godeungeo?"

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.840
"Your godeungeo, you know, your chunk of godeungeo, included fish bones."

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.360
Some people are freaked out because it's not a filet.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.660
But in Asian cuisine, we use fish bones too

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.800
because when you braise this for a long time,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.220
delicious broth is coming out, all from the bones.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.160
So we eat this way. Very easy way.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.040
With chopsticks or your fork,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.940
because it's cooked for a long time, easily come out.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.200
You can filet fish bones easily.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.980
Delicious.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.820
Sweet, soft texture. Delicious.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.660
Make it and let me know how it goes.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.580
Enjoy my recipe and see you next time. Bye!
