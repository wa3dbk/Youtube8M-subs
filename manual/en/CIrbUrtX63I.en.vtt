00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.840
So, we're just finishing up this side of a good neighbour fence.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.460
A good neighbour means that there is pickets on both sides,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.700
so that everybody experiences the value of the fence,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.500
and nobody gets a preference as to having
all the pickets on their side.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.620
This particular fence, set in, four by four treated set in concrete.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:33.760
I just have to trim the tops of the posts off now, to equal length,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.220
and put new caps on. Or put caps on.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.660
There is one post we left in from before.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.740
A little gate through the side,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.040
and I'll show you how the good neighbour fence works.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.160
You put a row of pickets on one side,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.600
leaving a little bigger gap.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.760
There's one going into the bushes there, now.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.700
And then on this side, you add the other ones to close the gap.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.400
And it makes for a goodâ€¦

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.820
It's also important not to stop the water on the bottoms,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.060
so the water can flow through and the air can flow through.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.780
That's one of the faults of the post, you know, the pre-fab panels

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.800
is they all trap water in the bottom, and that leaves a rotting spot.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.400
This is a very strong fence because it has a T on the top,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.360
which means one two by
four is up, and the other one is across flat.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.140
And you put the crowns up on the two by four, like this,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.920
so that the strength supports the weight of that fence.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.320
Also, the bottom is up and down, with a three and a half inch up and down,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.900
and that is about triple the strength of a flat running board.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.240
So, that's our good neighbour fence.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.560
It makes... Usually done when people are sharing the cost of the fence,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.820
and each want to benefit the most they
can from it without driving the price through the roof.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.570
