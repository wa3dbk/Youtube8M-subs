00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:11.010
The secondary component of the bunny hop after
the compression. So you are compression both

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.430
tires on the bike to give them the basketball
when you are dribbling. The up and scoop is

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.230
getting the back wheel up. Getting the back
wheel off the ground is definitely one of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.590
the hardest things for most people to figure
out when it comes to riding a bike. It is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.330
not a natural maneuver like you yank with
your arms all the time to fix stuff up very

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.610
rarely do we use momentum and settle weight
shifts to lift the back end of our bike off

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.110
the ground. So it is going to look like I'm
cheating here cause I have peddles that clip

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.270
in and that allows me to pretty much pick
up the bike just by lifting up my feet. But

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.340
I get a way to start practicing getting the
back wheel off the ground if you haven't had

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.239
experience with it. If you use a little bit
of front break and go slow to just do a little

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.100
you know just pick your back wheel off the
ground something that people like to call

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.081
a endo. So pump your front brake and I'm practicing
that weight shift that you need to get up

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:23.290
to get the wheel off the ground. So if I combine
the up with forward I have a bit of a bunny

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.130
hop. Obviously if I'm going down hill and
I have my brakes lock it is not the smoothest

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:43.650
thing but I'm up and then forward. So the
best way to really practice the getting the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.320
back wheel of the thing besides using your
front brake at a low speed is to just sort

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.600
of rattle around in normal tennis shoes with
big grippe flat peddles to practice bouncing

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.689
the bike off the ground. So as I go a little
bit quicker you would see I'm more natural

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:11.580
bunny hop and it helps to have a little obstacle
to focus on to try to get over so I'm going

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:20.939
to try to get over that root in the middle
of the trial. So I clip in as I hop over it

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.499
so front end is no thing and to get that back
end up if I lift my front wheel and get a

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:32.019
good enough job flicking my wrist forward,
as long as I move my weight forward the back

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.319
end would come off the ground just a little
bit or enough to get a blow of hitting something.
