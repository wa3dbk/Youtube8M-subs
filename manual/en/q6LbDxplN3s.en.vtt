Hey beardlovers. Today's Wednesday. The middle
of the week. Also known as Hump Day. Hahahaha!

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.140
Grow up!
Listen, I don't like it. Wednesday means it's

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.000
the middle of the work week so you're all
thinky about the two days of work you did

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410
and then the two that you have to do. Thankfully,
I love my job. But not everybody loves their

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.099
job. This guy doesn't love his job. Probably.
Let's figure out a way to make Wednesday awesome.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.180
So let's try something called EXPLOSION Wednesday
in which EXPLOSIONS happen a a lot.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.070
Everyone loves EXPLOSIONS as long as no one
gets hurt and nothing of value is destroyed.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.560
If you don't love EXPLOSIONS then that's really
great. I hear the weather is nice this time

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.140
of year in Prudeville. Partly cloudy with
78 percent chance of [raspberry]. I do this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.260
for a living.
But for the rest of us, we're gonna give Explosion

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.480
Wednesday a try. See if we should make it
a thing or not. And I bet all those EXPLOSIONS

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.100
will make you happy. They make this guy happy.
EXPLOSION! See, look! He turned into a super

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.740
successful businessman with clean teeth who
just doesn't know why he's happy! And that's

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.940
amazing that he's so happy considering his
situation. No cufflinks. Life sucks with no

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.220
cufflinks! Walking around, cuffs unlinked.
Did we do the intro yet? It's been a while.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.619
We should probably do the intro. Let's do
the intro.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.450
So what was I talking about? Oh yeah, no cufflinks.
Augh, I hate no cufflinks! One time I had

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.630
no cufflinks. I almost killed a man. Killed
him dead! But I didn't kill him dead. I...

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.299
I killed him hurt. He just... so he was hurt,
not dead. No murder here. Hehe.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.931
So in the news, Ford recalling 450,000 minivans,
SUVs for risks from FIRE and loss of power.

00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.289
Oh that's just like you, isn't it? Just give
us something we like and then take it away.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.920
- Is everything okay? You seem a bit upset.
- I'm fine. EXPLOSION!

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.209
- You can't explode your way out of this way,
buddy. What's the matter?

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.369
- I just don't like Hump Day. Ahaha! Grow
up!

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.210
- It's never bothered you this much before.
What's really going on?

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.439
- Alright, fine, clone. If you must know,
Craig with a Wig's missing.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.590
- Who?
- You don't know who Craig with a Wig is?

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.799
He's my friend. He sits in the kitchen. Remember?
I hate all things. Yay.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.829
He's Craigity Craig, Craig with a Wig.
- I still don't know what you're talking about.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.090
- Now the chair's empty.
He's Craigity Craig. Craig without a Craig.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.310
- So you're saying he pretty much just looks
like you with a wig?

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.310
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go find him. Sounds like quite

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.210
an adventure.
I can't finish the video today, guys. Too

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.450
upset. So I'll just slap this on here.
And here's some new t-shirt designs for ya.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.890
There's a link in the doobly-doo.
Craig with a Wig used to wear t-shirts. And

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:40.650
a wig. And my friendship.
If you don't love exploosion... Exploosions?

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.090
Exploosions? That sounds gross for some reason.
It's not, though. It doesn't mean anything.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:58.659
Party cloudly with 70... ahh... I am 12 years
old. Partly cloudy with 78... I rarely make

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:17.130
myself laugh. Partly clou... Why is this funny?
This isn't funny. Ohhh. Partly cloudy with

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.049
78 percent chance of [raspberry]. See? That's
not even that funny.
