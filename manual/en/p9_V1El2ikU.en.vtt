00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.090
The recent release of Terra Noctis proved
once more that not only are platformers still

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.910
fun, but with the right tweaks they're perfect
for iDevices.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.320
It seems that Crescent Moon Games and developer
Robots vs Wizards were on the same wavelength

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.260
when coming up with Paper Monsters, but instead
of something akin to Yoshi's Island, this

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.789
game channels simpler games of the era.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.910
This isn't the developer's first rodeo when
it comes to platformers and you can see shades

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.080
of their previous title Doodle Monster smashed
up with aesthetic inspirations from Little

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.480
Big Planet in their latest release.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.120
As befitting a fairly standard platformer,
the storyline is similarly generic and you

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.480
as the cardboard protagonist must fight the
paper-y hordes of Papyrus over 16 stages and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.780
four interesting boss battles.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.470
While the controls are much of what you'd
expect (virtual analogue/digital movement,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.780
tap to double jump), the presentation goes
that step further by setting the game in a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.629
2.5D world.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.820
The cute paper-themed worlds are charming,
but more importantly layered with depth as

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.220
the player constantly finds themselves warping
to areas 'behind' the current stage to collect

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.290
bonus objects and buttons.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.930
These can be traded in for costumes to pimp
out your character, adding a touch of individual

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.380
flair to the game.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.680
Unfortunately the game never really feels
like more than a basic platformer and while

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.069
references to other classics (such as the
mouth-portals from Mario 2) are neat, they

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.820
don't really add to the experience.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.390
Similarly the occasional switch in gameplay
(such as controlling a submarine) breaks up

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.610
the flow, but doesn't provide anything beyond
a temporary sea-change.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.420
Although Paper Monsters fails to take the
opportunity to explore the platforming genre

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.640
outside of a few visual touches, the experience
is none-the-less short, tight and fun enough

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.580
to keep you hooked till the end.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.360
Those after more of a challenge may not find
what they're looking for here, but for fans

00:01:49.360 --> 00:02:00.389
of classic platformers and casual gamers this
is worth checking off your list.
