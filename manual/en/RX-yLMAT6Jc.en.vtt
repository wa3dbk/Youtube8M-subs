00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.239
This tipper truck is in the colours of Jean
Lefebvre which is part of the VINCI group

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.269
and it's a limited edition of only three
hundred models.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.769
So you could be one of only three
hundred people owning it or you could buy

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.210
them all in which case you'd have 300
models.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.559
Except you can't buy them all because I've
got one.   It comes in standard Conrad

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.309
packaging which contains the model

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.000
and a bag of parts to be fitted.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.510
As usual for a Conrad truck we have to fit the mirrors and aerials and firstly we

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.560
have to separate them.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.640
Here we're using the brute force
approach on the mirrors

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.070
but for that altogether more refined
look we are using a modelling knife to separate

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.060
the aerials.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.190
Yes, it's time for another viewer question
and this one comes from Tipp

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.140
Ertruk of the USA.  Tipp says whenever he
watches reviews of

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.520
road-going dump trucks he keeps hearing
people call his name,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.580
and why is this?  Well Tipp I think you
must be completely mistaken - I don't

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.990
think anyone's calling your name

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.020
at all.   Back to the Tipp Ertruk review

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.060
and the mirrors just press into place.
Sometimes they can be a little bit of a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.360
tight fit getting them into the holes
but usually if you just twist them they

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.110
go in.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.370
But if the paint thicknesses are causing a
problem one of the things that can help

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.490
is to widen the hole slightly using a
special tool,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
and this is an ideal job for anyone who
likes putting pointed things into small

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.119
holes.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.000
With the holes widened a little, the aerials go in easily.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.610
Starting underneath the transmission and
rear axles are modelled in plastic.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.209
The functional steering mechanism means
that a little bit of drive shaft is missing

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.150
and the tyres are the same on each wheel.
The wheels look smart with some good

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.120
detailing.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.620
The Actros cab has textured door mirrors
and a plus point of this Conrad

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.079
model is that there is a fleet number on the cab,
and a realistic number plate.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.409
Behind the cap the chromed exhaust and
equipment tower look good

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.959
and the ram for the tipper body is a
multi-stage piston.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.760
The wheel arches behind the cab are
plastic which is just like real trucks.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.629
The tipper body has got a classic half pipe
shape with good graphics,

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.600
although the silver rivet at the pivot
point is a bit large.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.100
Here the Actros is out on the Cranes Etc
Autoroute

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.180
and it rolls smoothly but without
freewheeling.   So let's mount it on the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.459
massive truck hoist to have a look
underneath,

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.180
and as usual for Conrad the wheels all roll
independently

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.340
and there is quite a lot of movement in the
rear axles to simulate suspension.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.379
Also very good features-wise is the
front linked

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.090
steering.  It has got a significant range
of movement which means it poses well

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.790
and it rolls well in a curve too.  The other
feature on the Actros cab is that it tilts

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.220
and as expected it's implemented
well with a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.859
cab that stays tilted and you can put
your head underneath to have a look at

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:49.599
the engine.....

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.709
but you must have a very small head!   As
this is a tipper truck it is time to see if

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.299
the tipper has tip-top tipping.

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.680
The multi-stage cylinder is stiff as it
comes out of that big plastic jacket at the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.290
top,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.440
but the good thing is it holds any pose
that you want to set,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.269
and the overall tipping angle is quite
convincing.  At the back the tailgate

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.599
opens and shuts, but it's not free
swinging.  Overall though the tipping

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.400
mechanism has been implemented well by
Conrad.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.989
One possibility for displaying this
model is to pair it up with the NZG

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.680
Voegele paver in Jean Lefebvre colours,
but it's interesting to see there is a

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.030
slight colour difference between the two
models.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.449
It also allows a genuine imitation
real-life test of the tipper discharging

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.599
into the paver.

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.469
Another interesting pose that you can
have is that this is the modern version

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:37.560
of the truck,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.330
and next to it you can put the heritage
version which was previously released by

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.060
Conrad.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.960
Displayed together you get an
interesting perspective of old and new.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.200
In summary this is a nice tipper truck
model from Conrad.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.760
As usual a strong point is the
functionality and the robust build

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.630
quality,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.849
and the detailing, paintwork and graphics
are all pretty good too.

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.150
It is a nice truck and is highly
recommended.
