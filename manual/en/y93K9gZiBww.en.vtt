00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.020
for this tutorial I will be teaching you how
to color your hair extensions I will be using

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.250
Mrs. Rutterâ€™s virgin hair extensions from
Mrs. Rutters.com the following supplies you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.000
will need to color your hair will be two boxes
of permanent hair dye you will also need a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.910
hair dye brush a bowl to store your dye you
will need hair cutting scissors a plastic

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.670
bag and you will also need a pair of gloves
so once you have all of your materials ready

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.010
I will teach you step-by-step how to color
your hair extensions to begin coloring your

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.579
hair extensions you want to make sure that
your station is prepped make sure that you

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.350
take your plastic bag and you put over the
area you will be working on so that dye won't

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.740
get on your table or floor or anything like
that then you want to make sure that you mix

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.700
your hair dye in your bowl with your dye brush
afterwards you want to unloose your bundle

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.920
of hair all the way until it's one track you
have to fold this three times so that way

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.770
you are not taking up much space with your
station so when you unravel your bundle of

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.920
hair as one long track bring it together and
then do that three times once you do that

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.040
lay your hair down and then to begin dying
you want to work on the ends and go all the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.990
way up until you get to the weft make sure
that you don't saturate the weft because it's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.850
unnecessary when coloring your extensions
and also we rinse it you are going to constantly

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.570
have to rinse the weft over and over again
to get all the dye out its completely unnecessary

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.080
to dye your weft with so to begin grab a little
bit of hair dye and work your way from the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:39.249
tips to the left of your bundle of extensions

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:44.180
after you have completely colored one side
you want to flip it over and repeat the process

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.489
also as you are working along the way use
the bristles of your brush to slightly open

00:02:48.489 --> 00:03:51.099
up the hair so they are covering all of the
hair with hair dye 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.499
as you are working up near the weft make sure
that you get as close as possible to the weft

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:59.390
without actually saturating the weft now if
you accidentally get dye on the weft that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.859
is perfectly fine you just want to open up
one side of the weft at a time and cover up

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:53.610
the hair leading all the way up to the weft
of the actual extension 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.700
after you finish coloring your hair extensions
you want to make sure that it processes for

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.350
the specific amount of time that your box
dye instructed this hair needs to process

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.870
for about 30 minutes to an hour and then it
needs to be shampooed and conditioned and

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.130
air dried to finish the look as you can see
this is a finish result of dying the hair

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.690
extensions the color black after dying you
want to make sure to shampoo wash and then

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.810
allow it to air dry as a result what came
from it was a very consistent hair color and

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.820
also the natural wave pattern of the extensions
so just to mention once again when you're

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.470
dying your hair is very important to only
focus your hair color on the hair itself if

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.080
you dye the weft it's unnecessary because
for one number one will ever see the weft

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.550
of your extensions so they don't have to be
colored and the second reason is because as

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.960
you are missing the dye out you will constantly
have to re-rinse re-wash re-rinse re-wash

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.830
the actual weft when it's unnecessary so also
I am actually wearing Mrs. Rutter's hair extensions

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.650
in my hair and I have had this hair for over
a year and I've dyed it the exact same way

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.750
that I have dyed this bundle it holds a hold
of curl beautifully as well as hold the color

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.870
