00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:05.439
• We're all paranoid about something, but
certain people take it to extremes

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.680
• From phobias of beauty to fear of the
unknown, we count 20 of the most outrageous

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.540
mental conditions ever to inflict the human
race

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.759
20 - A fear of long words
• This one is rather ironic, and a kind

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.710
of cruel
• People who have a fear of long words need

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.089
to deal with the fact that their phobia is
clinically titled Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.320
• Whoever came up with the name is a bit
of a jerk

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.340
19 - Xanthophobia
• This is an irrational fear of the colour

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.520
yellow, which could be the sun, flowers or
buildings covered in yellow paint

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.180
• It comes in varying levels of aggressiveness,
but the worst kind is when you can't even

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.870
hear the word yellow without having a panic
attack

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.870
18 - Aphenphosmphobia
• The fear of touching or being touched,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.989
mostly centred around humans of the opposite
gender

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.020
• It usually develops as a result of sexual
or physical assault, but it's been known to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.110
appear even without a trigger
• If it isn't already obvious, this phobia

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.240
pretty much kills any chance of intimacy
17 - Caligynephobia

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.240
• Likewise, this one is the unwarranted
fear of beautiful women, usually in men young

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.310
and old though more common in those who don't
have a straight orientation

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.420
• It causes panic attacks, uncontrollable
social problems and a lack of attendance at

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.130
beauty contests
16 - Coulrophobia

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.009
• The infamous fear of clowns - predominantly
found in small children, as well as adults

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.349
who may have had a questionable encounter
with them in their youth

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:41.119
• Unlike quite a few other phobias, whoever
had this usually knows their phobia is irrational

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.319
and unwarranted, but they still can't escape
those foreboding facial features, the swollen

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.200
nose, the weird colour scheme, and also IT
by Stephen King.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.990
That doesn't help.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.509
15 - Turophobia
• The fear of cheese, usually stemming from

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.189
a traumatic experience like, you were once
chased down the street by a psycho murderer

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.789
wielding some delicous blue vein
• This one can be diverse, you either fear

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.600
a specific type of cheese or the entire batch
• It's made even worse if you also have

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.200
that yellow colour phobia from earlier
14 - Cacophobia

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.890
• The fear of ugliness - and not just of
people, but anything ugly or imperfect, either

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.330
situation or object, it doesn't matter, either
can set you off

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.200
• Nobody's really sure what causes this
phobia, but it likely stems from a traumatic

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.281
event involving ugliness where you're conditioned
to respond to a certain stimulus, in this

00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:36.440
case, that which you perceive to be flawed
or unattractive

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.830
13 - Ablutophobia
• There's a separate fear of cleaning yourself,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.400
but this one takes it a step further
• It's the inability to engage in personal

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.730
hygiene because of how terrifying the experience
is

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.210
• You'll find this mostly in children or
women, usually stemming from serious mental

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.920
trauma
12 - Deipnophobia

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.540
• The fear of dinner conversation
• This is a byproduct of the larger social

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.350
phobia, but more specifically targeting the
chaotic and unpredictable nature of talking

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.980
to people around a table
• It's been speculated that Howard Hughes

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.260
famous from the Aviator film starring Leonardo
DiCaprio had this, as one scene involves him

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.730
awkwardly trying to compose himself while
having a dinner with a family

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.760
11 - Somniphobia
• The fear of sleeping, it encompasses a

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.480
broad range of types and people usually suffer
from a very mild form at a young age, getting

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.599
used to the cycle of sleep, unconsciousness
then revival

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.350
• Some people don't get over this though,
for those it feels like dying every night,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.760
or it's the lack of control over the situation
that sets them off, or maybe the nightmares

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.420
are keeping them awake, or uncontrollable
insomnia - it could be a vast number of things

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.680
10 - Novercaphobia
• The fear of stepmothers, this one should

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.400
be fairly obvious since foster parents usually
bring negative feelings to children, both

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.990
in real life but moreso in the media
• Stepmothers in films are typically portrayed

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.440
as cruel, or as a witch mistreating the kids
under their care, and it only encourages this

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.350
phobia
9 - Spectrophobia

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.490
• This is a phobia for vampires - the fear
of one's own reflection in the mirror, or

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.880
indeed the dread of mirrors themselves
• It mostly comes from horror movies constantly

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.960
pausing on mirrors, heightening tension, seeing
ghostly forms in the mirror

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.630
• People start seeing the same thing in
real life, and we all get it from time to

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.290
time, usually in the middle of the night,
in an empty house, something just over your

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.290
shoulder...

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.090
8 - Gymnophobia
• This is the fear of nudity, one very common

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.020
these days
• It refers to both the anxiety of someone

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.560
seeing YOU naked, and likewise you seeing
someone else naked, then getting stuck with

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.940
the mental image of their nakedness
• The reason for this fear?

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.820
The feeling of physical inadequacy, that people
will point out your flaws and vulnerability,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.150
and that, like George Costanza, you happened
to be in the pool just before you were caught

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.500
7 - Hylophobia
• The fear of trees, or more specifically,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.240
dark foreboding woods
• Like with a lot of these phobias, it got

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.080
worse once mainstream media started releasing
movies like Friday the 13th set in a cabin

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.020
in the woods
• It usually develops in children, but it

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.960
carries over into adulthood and even the mere
mention of woods can set someone off

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.370
6 - Demonophobia
• The fear of demons, this one should be

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.520
fairly self explanatory
• It extends from the fear of a religious

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.389
hell, to physical demonic beings roaming the
earth, and likewise possessions for fans of

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.740
exorcist movies
• Most who have this phobia are aware demons

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.080
aren't around, but the subconscious terror
persists

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.120
5 - Vestiophobia
• The fear of clothing and of being clothed

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.520
• This one makes it difficult to operate
in society, and sufferers will tend to wear

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.110
the baggiest, minimalistic clothing possible
so that the least possible amount of material

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.960
touches their skin
• Some go to extremes, never leave their

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.550
homes, and stay naked 24/7
• These people aren't very good at strip

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.800
poker
4 - Chorophobia

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.900
• The fear of dancing, whether it be themselves
dancing, being in a room of other people dancing

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.640
- it's all the same unbridled tap-dancing
terror

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.400
• Most of the time it borders more on the
sufferer being uncomfortable or embarrassed

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.310
than scared, since dancing is another social
cue some can't get the hang of

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.990
3 - Neophobia
• The fear of new things or experiences

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.450
• It can be mild, the unwillingness to break
from routine or try new things is usually

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.790
an indicator someone you know might suffer
from this phobia

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.419
• It's also diverse, you can also be angry,
frustrated or anxious about some new technology

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:45.139
or revolution and that'd make you neophobic
2 - Nomophobia

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:50.169
• This one is recent, and also retarded:
the fear of being without mobile phone coverage

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.650
• It's a phobia, about losing bars on your
phone screen, or running out of battery, or

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.650
losing sight of your damn phone like its the
one ring of Mordor

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.210
• According to studies, nearly half of civilised
humans suffer from this phobia

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.639
1 - Phobophobia
• This is when you're afraid of phobias,

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.320
when you're afraid of f ear itself
• Think about when you suspect the lump

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.210
on your neck might be dangerous, how obsessive
and panicky you get - that's phobophobia,

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.449
fear of something you don't know
• It's not caused by an outside source,

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:27.240
it's simply projected from your own internal
sentiment, your own fears projected on to

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.870
an object or thing
