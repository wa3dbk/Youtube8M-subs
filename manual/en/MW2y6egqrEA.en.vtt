00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.660
You get a flutter in your heart and when

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.490
you get it you better buy the piece

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.560
because you're going to dream about it.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.460
Fleur Bressler is a noted collector of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.490
turned wood in particular, she was

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.260
also a noted collector of American

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.220
quilts for a while. She works in the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.410
Renwick Gallery as a docent, that is a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.220
volunteer tour guide. Bresler: Now the theme in

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.220
this room is craft: minimal and expressive.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.580
The exhibition comprises 66 objects of

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.739
turned and carved wood, which were

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.770
aquired through the generosity of Charles and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.489
Fleur Bresler. Blesler: To have the exhibition, I think,

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.470
is to give more validity and as much

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.699
validity to the field as I possibly can.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.540
So as a maker to have the work placed

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.370
in an important collection and then

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.370
in context with the other pieces that

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.040
you've done is real important and gratifying.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.440
I would say that David Ellsworth, I would

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.990
describe, as a purist. I live in Northern

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.510
Bucks County in Pennsylvania. I am in a

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.690
classic eastern woodland forest with 20

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.450
acres of trees. Many of the pieces that I

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.970
do come from wood right off my property.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.780
So when I begin with a half log I'm trimming

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.970
it out with a chainsaw just to give me a

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.190
rough blank that I can then take to the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.820
lathe, which I would then on the lathe

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
shape out, trim it out, rough it down to a

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.820
basic form of a bowl. Then attach it to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.760
the lathe and refine the exterior

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.300
shape and then go down and work on the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.070
interior. I draw with a gouge, as I'm

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.740
working and I let my movements of that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.890
particular day, and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.260
my vicarious instincts at that

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.289
particular time meld with the material

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.480
as I'm developing it on the machine.  It's very spontaneous.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.160
It's quite exciting and I obviously

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.930
don't know what I'm going to come up

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.400
with each time. The last stage is to turn it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.430
backwards, shape the foot and then I have

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.750
my fundamental shell. From that point I let

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.660
it dry out and would sand it up, put coat

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.840
finish on it or two or three or four and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.210
send it to a charity auction somewhere.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.790
She's not just a collector, she's a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.600
researcher. She has a mental draw to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.330
these objects including the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.700
individuals who made the objects, where

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.430
she acquired them, why she acquired them.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.020
You just walk up to a piece and she'll

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.670
come over and tell you a story about it and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.040
I think that that's really neat, it means

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.190
that much to her. This is not a museum

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.390
almost every item that we have can be

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.540
picked up, can be touched, can be moved,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.230
can be rearranged, and it can be felt,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.820
There's not one work in their collection

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.910
that would begin to approach an

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.820
outrageous exorbitant price. The

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.240
work is, it's very not just approachable

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.730
but it is what it is. It's turned wood

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.120
and I think it's easily understood once

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.700
you give into it and become a part of it.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.490
I've run out of space, my husband said he

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.800
feels that we're living in a museum and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.360
that I really ought to cease and desist,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.000
and so what I do is I buy very small pieces.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.580
It takes him a while to find them.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.780
Why am I an artist?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.740
I don't know what else I would be to tell you the truth.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.380
I try to do as much design work as I can

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.390
on the lathe. Mark teaches at Bucks

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.020
Community College.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.920
Though he creates work himself, he also

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.660
is training another generation of

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.480
artists. I do now have two pieces of

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.730
one of his students. First time I saw a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.100
piece of wood art was at the Renwick. It

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.130
was the Edward Jacobson Collection, and I

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.210
went upstairs and I was smitten.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.410
I had never seen wood in that color. I

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.450
had never seen all the different

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.660
patterns and if the guard hadn't been

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.300
there I probably would have taken the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.580
tops off the cases and pick the pieces

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.790
up. What we're actually saying is that a

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.510
work of art has touched a human being to

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.520
the point where it has moved that human

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.970
being to move and become a collector. To

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.490
want to foster that field to become a

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.320
part of it.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.840
That's a beautiful thing to behold.
