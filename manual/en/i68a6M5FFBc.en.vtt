00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.700
Powerful Presentations: Simply Stated...

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.250
Around the world every day,
thousands if not millions of people give presentations.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.809
Some are great, and have a powerful impact
on their audiences. Others...well, let's

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.370
just say they're works in progress. This
is Powerful Presentations: Simply Stated.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.960
Meet Jim, an aspiring professional trying
to make it in the world. Jim used to give

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.570
presentations like just about everyone else he knew. PowerPoint was his tool of choice.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.300
He'd use it like an outline, with a header
followed by bullet after bullet, and sometimes

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.319
even sub-bullets! When he wanted to be fancy, he'd add what usually turned out to be

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:44.170
an ineffective chart or sometimes a table.
And when Jim wanted to really spice things

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.929
up, he'd add...yep...clip art. Unfortunately,
Jim's approach would often confuse and

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.749
bore people. This was a problem because he had important things to say. And because it

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.909
was dimming his prospects for success. Fortunately, Jim learned a better way and didn't stay

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.489
in the dark for long.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.020
Perhaps most importantly, he now
focuses on the story he wants to tell. In

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.509
doing so, he tries to follow a simple structure, with a clear beginning, middle, and end that

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.229
links together his various points and builds to his conclusion. When formulating his story,

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.399
Jim uses a simple pad of paper or sicky notes.
Staying low tech at this stage helps him think

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.170
more creatively and stay outside the box.
He then considers what tools will help him

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.329
best tell his story. Jim sometimes opts to
use a whiteboard, flip charts, handouts, or

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.840
even no props at all. When it makes sense
for him to use PowerPoint, he tries to remember

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.929
the adage that sometimes "less is more."
He doesn't dumb down his presentations,

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.859
but he does try to limit each slide to one
key idea. Or, depending on the content, he

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.170
sometimes builds an idea incrementally so
it's easy to follow. He looks for visual

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.850
ways to tell his story, with minimal text,
photos, and clear charts and graphs. Sometimes

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.670
he'll use quotes, but he tries to remember
that people can't read his slides and truly

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.720
listen at the same time. Jim still uses
plenty of text to help him remember what he

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.120
wants to say, but he hides it in his notes
that only he sees.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.860
Jim's new approach takes more time, energy,
and rehearsal, but it's been well worth

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.000
the effort. His audiences are now much more
engaged and better understand and remember

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.990
his presentations. And, as if that weren't
enough,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.990
his pocketbook doesn't mind either. This has
been Powerful Presentations: Simply Stated.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.580
