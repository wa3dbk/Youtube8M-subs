Hi everyone and welcome to Nicko's Kitchens fast food Friday.

00:00:04.143 --> 00:00:11.415
Today were gonna be making Taco Bells double decker tacos, so lets get started!

00:00:11.932 --> 00:00:15.735

00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:34.314
So guys,the first thing that were gonna do to get started 
 on our tacos is just into a large pan 

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:40.380
I'm gonna add in some vegetable oil, and the heat that I've 
 got here is just a medium to high heat 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.639
and to the oil I'm gonna be adding in 
 some onions and I've just roughly chopped up

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:52.249
and to the onion I'm gonna be adding in some Taco seasoning.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:57.567
And you get Taco seasoning in the spice section 
 of your supermarket you'll find it there.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:00.366
And the reason why I'm adding it to the onions is 

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:05.392
I want that Taco seasoning to become really fragrant and quite powerful. 

00:01:05.392 --> 00:01:12.091
So you just want to do this for about 2-3 minutes, 
 just until the onion has started to soften. 

00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:16.721
So I'm gonna be adding in our beef now, 
 I've just got some ground beef. 

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:23.354
And its a 80/20 split, so its 80% beef and 
 20% fat because we don't want our 

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:27.940
beef mixture to be really dry, we want some moisture to it. 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.044
Now we just wanna break down that beef until it becomes small 

00:01:32.044 --> 00:01:37.001
and we obviously want to cook this for about 6-7 minutes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.120
So this is what were after OK, this 
 is what were after, just like that

00:01:41.122 --> 00:01:46.100
so I'm gonna turn the heat off, and were 
 gonna leave this here for about 5 minutes

00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:48.710
and we'll get assembling on our Tacos.

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:52.630
Now were gonna assemble em and for this your gonna need two parts

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:59.470
First one is the hard taco shell, and the 
 other one is the flour tortilla. 

00:01:59.468 --> 00:02:07.040
Now well just put the flour tortilla aside just for 
 the meantime and we'll assemble our taco shells.

00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:11.410
Now firstly were gonna be putting in the beef mixture, 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:16.940
then I've got some cheddar cheese that I'm 
 gonna be sprinkling over the top. 

00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:20.990
Next I've got some sour cream that I'm just gonna add over the top.

00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:25.770
Next up is some iceberg lettuce, that I've just roughly chopped up. 

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:30.540
And I've also got some chopped up fresh 
 tomatoes just on the top there. 

00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:35.860
Now just keep repeating that process with all 
 the hard taco shells that you have.

00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:39.890
So you might remember the other day we made some re-fried beans? 

00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.460
Now if you didn't see it or you want the recipe again, 

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:47.140
I have popped it below in the description along with this recipe.  

00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:52.150
Now, on to the flour tortilla I'm gonna 
 be getting some of our re-fried beans

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:55.290
and I'm just gonna place them in the middle just like this 

00:02:55.287 --> 00:03:00.070
and just using the back of the spoon I'm gonna spread 
 it out, not all the way to the edge

00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:03.360
just leaving about 1/2 an inch.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.740
And then were gonna grab our taco hard 
 shell taco that we made before 

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:13.840
and were gonna just press it up in 
 the middle, and there you have it.

00:03:13.842 --> 00:03:20.130
And just keep repeating that process, with your soft and hard shell tacos. 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.790
So Guys there you have it, there's my double 
 decker tacos and it just reminds me 

00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:28.030
of my trip to the US when we had these at a Taco Bell.

00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:34.800
and I tell you what, it smells wonderful. So lets 
 get stuck into this bad boy, shall we

00:03:34.803 --> 00:03:39.370
Lets just rip into this......

00:03:39.368 --> 00:03:41.770
...(CRUNCH)..

00:03:41.773 --> 00:03:44.140
