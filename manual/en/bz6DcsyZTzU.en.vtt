00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.510
We are constantly seeking new places to ride.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.720
This time, our passion for the mountains lead
us to an alpine path above Grindelwald in Switzerland

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.290
We were expecting a trail which is somewhere
in between impossible to ride and just doable.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.460
But before we could tackle this challenging
downhill ride, we had to hike up to the glacier

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.680
that once occupied a much larger area.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.199
After a short night in the hut, we got up
with the first sunlight to do what we came for.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.020
Yesterday we hiked up the 1500m in altitude.
sections.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.690
Partially over ladders and climbing sections

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.640
That was quite interesting.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.500
I think the downhill ride will be great!

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.479
And then we got reminded that we must not
be unconcentrated at any time.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.649
The unicycle fell down the cliff and disappeared
somewhere on the glacier 50m below.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.549
We were lucky to find a way down and to actually
find the unicycle 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.920
just a few footsteps away from a large gap in the ice

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.820
it rolls!

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.780
Look! It fell down from up there, where the stream comes down!

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.960
That's rad!
