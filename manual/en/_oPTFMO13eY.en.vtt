00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.454
- Hi, I'm Jerry James Stone,

00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:10.358
and you're watching "Cooking Stoned."

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:13.646
On today's show, I'm going
to show you how to make

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:16.456
the classic dish egg-in-a-basket,
or egg-in-a-hole,

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:17.721
whatever you want to call it.

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:18.919
I'm going to show you how to make it.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.591
So today we're going to
make egg-in-a-basket,

00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:24.767
or egg-in-a-basket, egg-in-a-hole,
whatever you call it.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:26.312
There's many, many words for this,

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:28.026
but essentially it's an egg cooked inside

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:29.233
this slice of bread.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.670
So the key component to this,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.883
I've heard some people complain that

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:34.066
that it can be a difficult recipe,

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.313
which is baffling to me
'cause it's so simple.

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:39.193
It's a piece of bread and an egg,

00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:40.589
but I think the reason is

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.679
is just understanding,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.633
well, you have to have a big enough hole.

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:45.840
That's what it really comes down to.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.954
So you can use a biscuit cutter,

00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:49.579
or a pint glass or whatever.

00:00:51.132 --> 00:00:52.715
It's a matter of just
getting the right size.

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:57.070
That's a rather large hole,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.994
so that's a little too
big for what I want to do.

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:02.207
I think that the next size
down is a little bit better.

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:05.382
The egg is going to fit nicely
in there as you can see,

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:08.354
and it's going to fill up that hole

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:10.572
without overflowing everywhere.

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:11.909
So I'm just gonna go ahead and cut

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.462
the hole with this biscuit cutter.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.391
And the next thing I'm going to do

00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:22.308
is fry an egg inside there.

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:24.268
I'll probably toast this
and put some jam on it.

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:27.530
So the first thing I like to
do with making this dish is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.135
toast the bread a little
bit on both sides.

00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:32.133
Just to kind of firm it up a little bit.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.792
So I'm gonna fry it in this butter here.

00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:37.916
Now that it's been
toasted I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:39.903
and add my egg.
