00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
acoustic guitar plays softly

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Ivy Loughborough)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
My department is responsible

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
for all of the hair

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in every production

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
here at the Guthrie.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So whether it's an

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
actor's own hair or not,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we're in charge

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of how that looks.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
My name is Ivy Loughborough,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I'm the wigmaster

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
here at the Guthrie Theater.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I have worked in the wig

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
department

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
at the Guthrie for 17 years.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In order to make a wig, you

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
have to be very detail oriented,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and you have to be really good

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
with your hands.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If you're going to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
do wigs for the stage,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you have to be able to

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
make wigs and style them,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and those are 2 quite

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
different skill sets.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And you also have to be able to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
do a huge range of hairstyling.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And then there's the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
ability to look at something

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in 2 dimensions,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
like a piece of research

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or a photograph or a drawing,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and translate that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
into 3 dimensions,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is the same thing

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that any sculptor has to do,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
anybody that's making

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
something 3-dimensional.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We're just using

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
hair as our medium

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
instead of something like clay.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
sharp tapping

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm making this wig for the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
character of Blanche DuBois

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in A Streetcar Named Desire,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and it's partially done,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and this is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the foundation of the wig.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
You can sort of see

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a little bit of that here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I have 2 full-time assistants.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Laura Adams, behind me,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
is one of them.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Emily Hall is the other one.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Then I have 3 full-time wig

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
crew people.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm going to take this piece of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
wig lace and stretch it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so that it's molded

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to the shape of her forehead.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Making a wig

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
can take anywhere from

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
3 to 4 days to a week

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
for something that's--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the hair is longer, the wig is

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
thicker, the head is bigger.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Well, there are 2

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
sort of basic kinds of hair,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Asian and European, and they

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
really just refer to a texture.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I rarely use synthetic hair.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If we're doing a fantasy show,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
if something

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
needs to be painted,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
sometimes human hair is

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
actually a little too soft.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Making the foundation

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
of a wig is sewing.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
A lot of the techniques

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that we use

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
are similar to the techniques

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a draper who makes a pattern

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
for a costume might make.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The actual tying the hair

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
into the wig

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
is probably most like

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
latch-hooking a rug.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The tool is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
a little bit different,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but the technique of tying the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
knot is essentially the same.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
When a wig is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
finished being built,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the next step is to style it,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and we can do that in

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
a lot of different ways.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We can style it with a curling

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
iron, sometimes a haircut,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and sometimes it needs

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to be set on rollers.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Okay, so now I'm ready

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to brush through this.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This wig is

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
supposed to look messy,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
like she's put it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
up very quickly,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and she's not in her right mind.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So I'm pretty much

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
done with this one.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Until I try it on Gretchen,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I think we'll be doing

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
a lot of tweaking on her.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is Gretchen Egolf,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
she's playing Blanche DuBois.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We're going to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
be trying 2 wigs on her

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
as well as some hats.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Before I try the wigs on her,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I have to prep her hair

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
the way it's going

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to be for the show.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So this lace is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.000
going to be really long.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Maybe we should start by just

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
cutting a little off the length.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
This is a very strange feeling

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
because it's like,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
not your hair. laughter

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Looks great.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Once we

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
get the fittings complete

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
we'll have

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
our first dress rehearsal,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and we'll

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
see all of the wigs on stage.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Now we're having a wig fitting

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
with Brian Keane,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
who plays Mitch in Streetcar.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Hold the very front of this.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We'll probably start with it

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
just a little further forward

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
than we think, then we'll slide

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
it back.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I left sideburns on here.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I think we could end up just

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
cutting them off completely.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I think that means that we shave

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
yours a little higher too.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Emily will just need

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to give this a haircut.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
She may need to take

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
a little bit off the top.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
street vendors calling

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Today is the second day of tech

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of A Streetcar Named Desire.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
They're working through

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the show from the top

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and adding all the elements

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that they haven't been using

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in rehearsal-- costumes, lights,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
sound, scenery, and it takes

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
a long time, it can be slow.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And also for us,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
it's when we see the wigs

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
with the makeup and the costumes

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
on the set under the lighting,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
which, of course, looks very

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
different than in the fitting

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and in every other

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
situation that we've had.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
door slams Stella?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Stella? Oh, my baby,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
my baby sister.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Blanche...

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I really like the wigs for

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
A Streetcar Named Desire.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I'm really happy with

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
what we've all done.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It's more typical of the kind

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
of show that we do here often,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
a realistic show, where

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
the wigs sort of disappear,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
where you don't

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
really notice them.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Some shows, it's very

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
obvious that there are wigs,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
but in this one, I hope that

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
people don't really realize

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that anybody is wearing a wig.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I hope people are

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
engrossed in the play.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So much confusion

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in the world.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Thank you

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
for being so kind.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I need kindness now.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
sax &amp; piano play

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:47.000
slow blues
