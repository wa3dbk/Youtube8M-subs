00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.220
Snap-on Training Solutions helps you get the
most out of your SOLUS Edge diagnostic tool.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.539
This training module covers the use of scanner
data in graphing view.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
Live data parameters are some of the most
valuable clues to help track down a vehicle

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.460
fault. Live data is one form of back door
information or data that is output from the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.650
Electronic Control Module, or ECM.
A numeric view of Parameter ID, or PID data,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.690
will not always reveal problems and/or show
relationships between PIDs.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.340
Graphing relationships between data parameters
gives you a view of performance over time.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.640
Data graphing can show momentary failures,
and data trends over time.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.910
The View icon switches the live data viewing
mode between a numeric view and a graphing

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.789
display. From one to four graphs can be displayed
on the screen.

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.729
The graph provides a large number of data
points plotted so you can compare events over

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.920
time. Multiple graphs allow you to view relationships
between components.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.009
Scroll down for more data, using the scroll
bar on the right. All data is continuously

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.899
being recorded for all available parameters
for the selected ECM.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.869
Values to the left of each graph show the
current, maximum and minimum value of captured

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.869
data. Minimum and maximum values are stored
even after the data has scrolled off screen.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.020
The PID Trigger is a valuable tool to automatically
capture data when a parameter value is outside

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.119
of normal range.
The Set Trigger command sets upper and lower

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.080
values to start recording a data movie when
the signal crosses the set value. This is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.620
similar to an OBD-II freeze-frame. To set
a trigger, select the data parameter you want

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.620
to use. Then tap the Trigger button and select
Set Trigger from the dropdown menu.

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.510
Tap the plus and minus buttons on the toolbar,
or use the up and down arrow buttons to position

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.370
the upper trigger line to the desired level.
Tap the checkmark on the toolbar or press

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.609
the Yes button to accept the value.
The lower trigger level line will appear on

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:51.609
the graph. Position the line to the desired
level. Tap the checkmark on the toolbar to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.519
accept the lower trigger value.
The trigger points will appear as horizontal

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.519
lines across the designated parameter graph.
Triggers can be set on up to three parameters

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.370
at once.
To arm the triggers, tap the PID Trigger button

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.870
on the toolbar and select Arm Triggers from
the dropdown menu.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.150
The trigger lines on the data graphs change
color to indicate an armed condition, and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.150
any data point outside of your set conditions
will pause data collection and save a recording.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.930
Once triggering is armed, it remains on until
you clear or disarm.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.439
The recorded data movie is automatically saved.
Tap the Previous Vehicles &amp; Data icon on the

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:47.170
home screen and select View Saved Data to
review the movie.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.579
Select the movie file you wish to view.
Change to Graph View.

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.040
Use the scroll buttons to scroll forward or
back through the collected data.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.459
Scroll down to view more data parameters.
The Zoom icon incrementally increases and

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.269
decreases the scale of the data being displayed.
Tap the zoom icon and select a plus level

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.780
to zoom in for more detail. Select a minus
level to zoom out and see more data.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.780
The Save Icon saves any current screen information,
along with all data stored in the buffer.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.350
Simply tap the Save icon. Then select View
Saved Data to recall and view the data movie.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.090
