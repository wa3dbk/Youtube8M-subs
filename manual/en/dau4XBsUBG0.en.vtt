00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.560
Welcome to Hobby Wild, today we are going
to take a look at how you can grow your own

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.270
chilli peppers.
Growing chillies is easy, cheap and at the

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.789
end of the season you are rewarded with fresh
chillies to eat.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.550
Here are a few of my seedlings, just ignore
the baby roma tomato plants at the front.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.239
Let's take you through a few things that you
will need to know.

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.940
Here we have a few mini birdseye chillies.
These small chillies grow in large numbers

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.420
on the bush and are good for salads, however
you will usually need to use more than one.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.690
Even though these are from the same plant
the textures can vary, with this one having

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.360
more of a dehydrated look, similar to a thai
or cayenne chilli.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.320
The big wrinkly one at the back is known as
a Ghost pepper, the Ghost at one point of

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.439
time was classified as the hottest chilli
in the world, however has since been beaten.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:58.759
To get started the first thing that you are
going to need are some seeds.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:03.140
You can buy seeds from your local nursery,
eBay, chilli seed website or swap them on

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.430
internet forums with other hobbyists. Seeds
are cheap, usually ranging from around 1 to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.369
10 dollars for 20 seeds depending on rarity.
It is easy to start building a collection

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.760
of seed varieties, especially once you get
a few plants going and you can harvest your

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.460
own seeds at no cost.
The heat of a chilli is measured on the scoville

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.130
scale. At the low end of the scale you have
varieties such as the Jalapeno at about 2000

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.229
scoville units, right through to the habanero
around the 200-400,000 mark and then at the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.900
top end what are known as the super hots,
such as the ghost pepper, the Butch T and

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.100
Carolina Reaper. Ranging from around 1 to
2 million scoville units.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.990
As well as heat, different chillies have different
flavours and purposes. Some are good for salads

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.760
and some you may only use in a hot sauce.
You can see that these seeds are very dry

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.260
at the moment. When yours arrive you will
want to soak them in water for 1-2 days prior

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.700
to planting, or put them between moist paper
towel to soften them up which will help them

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.930
to germinate.
Once you are harvesting your own seeds you

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.700
may only get 5 or 10 seeds from some chillies.
Whereas others such as these Red Cherry Pepper

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.349
seeds will give you 20 or more seeds from
each chilli, so you can really see how you

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.330
quickly your chilli seed stock can grow.
The best time of year to start your planting

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.280
is just after winter, or more precisely after
the last frost. As frost will kill off your

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.590
plant very quickly.
You will also need to get yourself a bag of

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.980
potting mix. A big cheap bag such as this
one will start from about $5. Each mix is

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.720
different and some people swear by the more
expensive mixes. Try a few and see what works

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.610
best for you.
You want to try to find a mix that drains

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.840
well, as this will help prevent the roots
of your plants from rotting.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.730
There are a tonne of different pots that you
can choose from. Here we have one of the smallest

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.180
pots available, which cost around $10 for
20. I like these pots as they drain exceptionally

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.380
well and due to their small size you can pot-up
many seeds in only a small space.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.209
These will get your seedlings through their
first month or two of growth, after which

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.900
you will notice the roots starting to appear
which means you need to move to something

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.000
bigger.
I like to use tumbler cups for the next stage

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.069
as they are dead cheap.
You can pick up a 50 pack for only a dollar

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.830
or two.
You will need to drill or cut some holes in

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.800
the bottom so that they can drain. If you
don't do this then your soil will be overly

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.209
damp and your plant will die.
This particular cup is a bad example, as it

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.120
has clear sides. This allow light in and also
allows heat to easily escape.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.959
Look for the red tumbler cups instead.
Another option I like to use for plants are

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.690
these long trays. Here we have some baby roma
tomatoes. I simply put in about 30 seeds and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.300
sprinkle a fine layer of potting mix on top.
This technique allows you to then wait and

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.260
see what grows and then transplant only the
good ones to their own pots.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.989
You just need to be careful when cutting them
out with a knife that you don't accidentally

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.190
cut the roots.
The longer they stay in this tray the higher

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.810
the chance that the roots will tangle with
each other. So don't leave them in here for

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.989
too long.
A good spray bottle will make your life much

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.709
easier, and they are cheap. This one cost
about $5. You fill it with water, pump the

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.580
top about 10 or 20 times and then hold down
the trigger.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.819
The adjustable nozzle at the end will allow
you to lightly mist your smallest seedlings.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.340
Watering plants can really be a bit hit and
miss. I spray mine whenever they start to

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.720
look dehydrated.
When you first plant your seeds ensure that

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.070
there is only a fine layer of potting mix
on top. You want the mix to stop them from

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.180
drying out, however once they start to grow
they don't have much energy, so they need

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.910
to break through that layer of potting mix.
The first sign of life will be a small green

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.850
hook that breaks through the surface. This
green hook will often have the seed still

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.510
attached to the end. Don't worry about it
too much as the seed should eventually fall

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.550
off, however you may want to give it a very
careful helping hand.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.940
Once the seed falls off the hook you will
be left with 2 small leaves. This aji limon

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.130
is about 1 to 2 months old, but seems to be
a bit of a slow grower.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.960
Remember to always label your plants, especially
if you have several varieties as it is very

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.280
easy to mix them up.
I like to make my own labels and they are

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.090
as good as free.
Simply cut up a milk bottle and write the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.660
name on with a permanent marker and away you
go. When you need 20 labels at a time for

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.250
seedlings and don't know how many are going
to survive, this is a good money saver.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.770
Just be sure to keep the labels off to the
side so you don't spear any roots.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.889
This jalapeno was planted at the same time
as the aji limon, however has grown much more

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.699
quickly. You can still see the original 2
small leaves at the base of stem. We should

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.270
be able to leave this plant in the cup until
it has doubled or even tripled in size before

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.500
needing to move up a pot size or two.
I like to keep my seedlings indoors next to

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.910
the window, as they can then benefit from
the sun throughout the day, however are protected

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.930
from the wind and any temperature changes.
The 2 original small leaves on the bottom

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.930
probably won't grow much more than this.
I keep all of the cups in seedling trays.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.870
The big benefit is that I can move all of
them at once and also reduce the risk of accidentally

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.509
knocking over a cup. This makes it easy for
putting them in the sun or watering. The trays

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.430
only cost a dollar or two from the nursery.
Finally we have the mature red Christmas bell

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.970
plant, this is where all of your hard work
pays off from about 5 months after planting.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.600
These chillies progress in colour from green,
down to a yellowy/orange and finally into

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.509
the red colour which means that they are ripe
and ready to eat, remember to save the seeds.

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.199
I hope that this video has kicked off your
interest in growing chillies.
