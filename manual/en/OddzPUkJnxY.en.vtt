This is Joe Bruzek from cars.com we're at the  2008 Chicago Auto Show and we're gonna

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.860
be looking at the hot rods and muscle
cars home show

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.210
how we start off with the Dodge
Challenger how this is the actual

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.779
production version this isn't the
content that we've been seen and other

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.360
shows

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.970
this is what will be hitting the streets
out this spring

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.010
its the srt8 model 425 horsepower

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.260
and there's any question in the car's
performance capability

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.309
down to show on this video Lupin and
tire smoking

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.540
jumping hill sliding sideways all that
good stuff that we love the same

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.360
ok

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.340
this is the most powerful production
Corvette ever made

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.360
highly spire that but 620 horsepower

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.390
and top speed of almost to higher miles
an hour

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.280
this is one most powerful fastest guys
had the Chicago Auto Show

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.390
I we talk about the ultimate Corvette
zr1

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.620
where's the ultimate Mustang so far the
gt500kr

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.680
I was planning a Mustang edition special
visions out there right now but this one

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.030
tops over 540 horsepower

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.190
com K are also all the new Knight Rider
series coming out with can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.770
and then gt500kr as well they were here
at the Camaro concept which is one many

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.110
Camaro concept that we've seen over the
past couple years

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.619
this is probably the third or fourth
America concept that we've seen I

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.940
the Auto Show circuits are you still can
buy wine it's not going to come out till

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.130
2009

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.340
live this example is from the
transformer movie where to start as

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.000
bumblebee

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.160
the 2009 Nissan GTR

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.000
he'll be hidden streets in June by be
able to take up one last look at the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.590
outer shell before Thomas Street said
this year

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.850
of 480 horsepower 21 charge

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.570
v6 and six-speed dual-clutch
transmission not know

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.530
true manual at but this is gonna ship a
lot faster than any manual driver ever

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.540
cut

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.910
wherewithal Hyundai Genesis Coupe
Concept this is on a sports car itself

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.040
fun engine where will drive manual
transmission other estimating about 300

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.040
horsepower when this goes into
production

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.750
I can look like this though this is a
pretty wild concept of what the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.900
aftermarket we do

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.640
to the can assess how once it is
officially released by

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.000
the overall shape is going to be a lot
like this constant

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.330
for additional information on this car
or any other

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.150
