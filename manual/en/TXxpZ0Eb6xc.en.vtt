[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.290
INTERVIEWER: Why did you
want to become a firefighter?

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.790
SUBJECT: I wanted to become
a firefighter because I

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.500
saw these guys as superheroes.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.070
I saw these guys as
bigger than life.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.860
And it wasn't until
I got into the job

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.310
that I realized that
we are just human.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.560
I've seen more in one
day than probably someone

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.197
has seen in their whole life.

00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:35.030
INTERVIEWER: What kind
of things do you see?

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.180
SUBJECT: I see faces of death.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.340
I see old people,
young people, kids.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.400
There are images that
are hard to erase.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.471
And it doesn't hit
me until I get home

00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:56.700
that I can't fix
someone's death.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.590
I can't fix someone
who is broken.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.349
I can't fix these
things in my head that

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.810
make me feel like I'm crazy.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.840
Who talks about that?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.360
The only time you see
a firefighter crying

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.910
is when one of
their coworkers die.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.287
OK.

00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:23.870
INTERVIEWER: Can you
tell me about one

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.380
of those times when you
weren't able to save someone?

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.050
SUBJECT: I went on a call where
the young girl in her early 20s

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.870
was partying on top of
an apartment building.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.350
And she fell and tumbled and
hit the sides of the walls

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.760
and was killed.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.210
But she still had signs of
a little bit of life in her.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.890
And I was the person
doing compressions on her,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.250
but I didn't realize later
on that this event was going

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.340
to send me into a tailspin.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.150
Some of these calls
just mess you up.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.240
And this call messed me up.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.747
I wanted to start
drinking so I'd

00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:12.371
mask these feelings
and these emotions.

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:15.840
And it didn't help.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.300
I would use prescription
pills only because I just

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.010
wanted to get numb.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.770
INTERVIEWER: You were diagnosed
with post traumatic stress

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.190
injury-- PTSI.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.520
Can you tell me about that?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.780
SUBJECT: I'm healing
from my injuries.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.410
I'm not going to be
completely healed,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.280
because I just went on a call
last week that messed me up.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.510
But I get through them quicker
because I'm not drinking.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.090
I'm eating cleaner
and stair-climbing.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.970
INTERVIEWER: Tell me how
you go from using alcohol

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.820
as a means of escape to
climbing stairs as a new ritual.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.260
SUBJECT: Using drugs and
alcohol you get high.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.150
Doing stairs I get high.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.350
I try to get in
10,000 steps a day.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.930
And mentally, it's
a great escape,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.189
because you're able to
really get out of yourself.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.480
I've begun to realize that
I'm trying to control things

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.890
that I have no control over.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.606
I'm trying to control death.

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:19.310
You can't control death.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.160
So I focus on
trying not to think.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.300
I focus on just trying to get
myself upstairs the stairs.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.900
And I just focus on
just being positive.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.910
I started organizing
my coworkers

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.640
to join in and do this
climb as a tribute

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.560
to the guys that
were killed in 9/11.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.960
So now we start wearing gear.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.560
We start wearing our bunker
pants and our firefighting

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.500
boots, and we wear our helmets.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.430
And you get to a point
where you just want to quit.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.189
And then I think about the
people who cannot do this--

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.910
the people who aren't
here anymore, you know.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.490
The stairs are a
metaphor to life.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.082
Just one step at a time.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:14.690
All that excitement,
energy, sweat,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.149
tears is contained until you
get all the way up to the top

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:24.760
where you just like explode
and just feel like the sky

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.380
open up to a feeling that
everyone should experience.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.850
And I think that a
lot of people think

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.050
that they can find
that in a pill

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.254
or at the bottom of a glass.

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:36.295
They don't have go there.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.690
And then when you're
able to really get

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.980
that big breath of fresh air,
you're breathing in life.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.590
It's amazing.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.570
INTERVIEWER: Next
on Seeker Stories,

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.770
the ritual I developed while
captive in North Korea.

Click now to watch.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.960
It was the scariest
time of my life.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.560
I was isolated in
what is perhaps

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.710
the most isolated
country in the world.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.420
But there was
something that I began

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.440
to do that helped me
get through each day.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.330
And it was a very simple act.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.390
Rituals is a part
