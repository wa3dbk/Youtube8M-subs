00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.527
Yup. I'm in the woods.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.320
Why am I in the woods exactly?

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:32.032
I was searching for the perfect birthday gift for someone special.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.534
I was at Next Level Videogames with Jobocop shopping.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.078
I've gotten a lot of great stuff here.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.998
All I need now is a painting but I don't know where to get it.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:41.583
Well, why don't you ask him?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.713
John from Gamester81.com!

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:49.466
Hey guys. How's it going. It's John from Gamester81.com.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.926
I know. I just said that.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.011
It appears you're in a pickle.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.721
Indeed he is. He was wondering if...

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.681
I can take it from here.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:57.974
But I want to be involved.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:58.683
Yeah, buh!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.726
Yah!

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:04.814
So I needed a painting. A very special one.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.692
On top of all this other great stuff I already got from here.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.318
Right, Nick?

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:09.944
That's right, Ponter.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.196
So friendly.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.614
So you need a painting, huh?

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.824
I hear Squarepainter makes great paintings.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.118
He'll even give you a free back massage with every purchase.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.036
Wow.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.997
I could really use a back massage. Where can I find him? 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.334
It's buried underneath the tree out in the forest. You may need some fire and bombs.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:25.335
Just burn it down.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.711
Do I need a permit for that?

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.464
Pft! Permits? Who needs permits?

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.092
But it's dangerous to go alone. Here, take this.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.593
Thanks. I think.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.469
You're welcome.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.554
Most people need permits for burning things.

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.224
Hi, how's it going. I'm John from Gamester81.com.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.683
Uh, who?

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.435
John from Gamester81.com.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.229
So that's why I'm in the woods.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:48.066
The location of the shop was pretty vague and I wasn't sure of the exact spot.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.401
So I had to start torching random trees.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.571
All righty. Let's see.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.825
That's not it.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.122
Really?

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:09.712
*Frustrated Grunt*

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:14.968
Third time's a charm.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.764
*Coughing*

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.433
Hey man. I'm surprised you found it.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:23.643
It's a secret to everyone, you know.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:24.686
Apparently.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.812
So what can I do for ya?

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.147
I needed a painting.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.940
It's awfully dark in here.

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.734
And ominous with the two unenclosed flames.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.114
I like the ambience.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.907
*Fire Siren*

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.993
Is something going on outside over there?

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:44.622
Oh, I may have inadvertently caused an massive uncontrollable forest fire trying to find your store.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.667
It happens. At least you didn't chop down a tree with an axe.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.626
Very true.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.171
That's it! That's the painting I've been looking for!

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.882
Ah! It's one of my personal favorites!

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.384
Damnit!

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.428
Maybe you should invest in some lightbulbs.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.597
Lightbulbs. Yeah.

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:02.807
Do you have any other copies by any chance?

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.392
You know what. I do.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:05.393
It's in the back room.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.603
That looks like a wall.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.771
Well yeah. It's a secret room.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.690
Oh my God! I'm gonna die!

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:12.192
*Explosion*

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.826
It looks exactly the same as the last room.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.581
Well, yeah, it's still a store. It's the same shape, layout, and dimension as the last one.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.791
Can we just get to the picture?

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.170
Here it is. Just as I promised.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.633
Son of a bitch! Ugh!

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.427
They make LEDs now, you know.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.637
Yeah, I know.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.890
No heat. L-E-D.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it!

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.437
Can I still get that back rub?

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.574
I guess.
