00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.500
Today we're talking about pros and cons of
micro-braiding.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.110
Pros of micro-braiding, we all know what those
are.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.950
You never have to touch your hair.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.820
Once it's done, it's done.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.109
You could just go on about your life, and
your hair is not a concern.

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.390
That's a great pro.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.100
The other thing is, depending on the size
of them, you could kind of manipulate them

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.539
to do different styles with them, and put
them up.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.539
Put them down.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.539
You could curl them.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.539
You could braid them.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:32.539
Make them wavy.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.090
So those are good pros for micro-braiding.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.210
One of the biggest cons that everyone has
with micro-braiding is it takes forever.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.020
Also, the bigger your head is, the longer
it takes.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.320
So that's a big con.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.620
Also, the thicker your hair is, the longer
it takes.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.340
That's a big con.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.940
The other con that I have with it, the micro-braiding,
is that they can also be done very, very tightly

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.510
by some stylist.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.970
That causes tension on the follicles, which
can cause you to lose hair.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.610
And you see a lot of women that have hair
missing around the edges, because they get

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.240
their hair braided, and then they take it
and pull it back into a ponytail.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.580
So it's already tight to begin with, and then
you pull it back even tighter when you put

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.680
it into a ponytail.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.530
And it causes stress on your hair follicles,
which then causes the hair to fall out.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.390
And sometimes it does not grow back, because
you permanently damaged that follicle.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.800
The other con that I have with micro-braiding,
because it takes such a long time, people

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.850
leave it in a long time.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.710
The longer you leave it in, the harder it
is to get out.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.190
I recommend like around four months at the
most.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.310
But after that, your hair is too tangled underneath
where the braids are going in.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.479
So it takes longer to get it out.

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.920
And if you're not someone that's going to
take a lot of time, you're going to rush through

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.830
it, and pull on the braids, and pull on the
hair that is mat at the bottom.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.170
And you're going to lose a lot of hair.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.600
That's my view on micro-braiding.
