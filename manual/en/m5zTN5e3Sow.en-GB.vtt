How to write news articles - In a nutshell

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:19.609
Today I want to talk to you about writing
better news articles, blogs and press releases:

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.789
I want you to remember three basic principles:
Be relevant, Write powerful headlines, Be original

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.509
 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.259
What do I mean by relevance?
Get attention by building your articles around

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.040
the interests, ambitions and challenges of
your target audience. And always ask one basic

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.470
question: 'why would anybody read this?'.
Think too about the business results you want

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.770
to achieve - how does each article help you
get there?

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.090
Headline?
As David Ogilvy said: 'when you've written

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.050
your headline you've spent eighty cents out
of your dollar' that should tell you just

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.100
how important they are. If you find good headlines
hard to write, be pleased with yourself -- it

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.500
shows that you understand just how important
they are.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.710
Your headline has one purpose -- to grab the
attention of the specific people you really

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.550
want to read your content.
It has to tell them: 'this article is for

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.430
you', 'you're going to discover something
of value'. And 'this will be a productive

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.729
use of your time'. See now why headlines are
more than just an afterthought?

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.040
And finally, be original.
If all your articles offer is the same information

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.470
that people can see elsewhere, why would they
want to read more of your content? What's

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.240
your unique point of view?
Understand your target audience, and interpret

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.340
the news in a way that's relevant to them.
Yes, it's a bit more work, but that's what

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.080
will bring them back to your content time
and again.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.479
So remember those three basic principles :
Be relevant, Write powerful headlines, Be

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.180
original
You should then get a better return on the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.180
time you invest in your articles.
