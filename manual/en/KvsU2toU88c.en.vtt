Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.260
[pause]

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.660
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.630
Patients often complain to me that their favorite
wine turns their cheeks

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.400
and nose red, so what’s going on here? It
is actually very simple: anything

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.000
that increases the amount of blood in your
skin is going to make your skin

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.950
redder.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.070
We have normal blood vessels in the middle
layer of the skin called the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.381
dermis and alcohol acts as a drug vasodilate
to expand those blood vessels

00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:42.750
putting more blood into them and making your
skin redder. As to how red

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.640
your skin will get from drinking wine depends
on three different things.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.940
First, how red your skin is to start with,
meaning how large are the blood

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.820
vessels. Do you have a rosy complexion or
do you have a pale sallow

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.050
complexion?

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.200
Second, how sensitive are your blood vessels
to the effects of the drug

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.920
alcohol? How much do they respond, how much
do they enlarge from the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.100
alcohol?

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.360
Third, it’s strictly a matter of dose: how
much alcohol are you drinking?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.560
Is it 12 – 14% alcohol like in wine, 4 – 5%
alcohol like in beer or 40% or

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.560
more like in hard spirits?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.061
So as to how red your face will get from drinking
wine depends on all of

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:25.430
those factors, but the good news is by the
next morning the red is gone,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.729
the tired is gone, and you are ready to start
a new day.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.370
On a more personal level, wine is most near
and dear to my heart as I am

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.430
sure it is to Gary Vaynerchuk the host of
the daily internet wine show

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:58.409
WinelibraryTV which was part of the inspiration
for DermTV. So Gary, here’s to you!
