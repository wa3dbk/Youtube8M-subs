Good! How are you? I am good! Welcome back to US. Thank you!

00:00:17.382 --> 00:00:22.885
Well, first of all.. what are you doing November 13 and 
 14? Will you be cool for a photo shoot?

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:30.663
in Las Vegas of the magazines? Yeah! With who? Because... 
 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition wanted to use you.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:36.984
on the 2013 issue. Really? Yeah, that's excited! hahaha! 

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:43.909
You're going to be in the MOST viewed magazine in 
 this planet. Yeah, that's zig! That's so exciting!

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:51.159
That's huge! Let's go in Vegas! Let's go! Hahaha!

00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:09.277
(Phong ringing) Hi! Hey! How are you? Good! 
 So, how's the bikinis coming in? 

00:01:09.612 --> 00:01:15.659
Raquel, got to make me special bikinis for the shoot. 
 And everyone, the whole team was just so happy.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.063
And it was just such an exciting thing. It's 
 so cute, right?! Yeah, I love it!

00:01:21.063 --> 00:01:26.912
To have a request in the Swimsuit edition,is just amazing and 
 I can't wait for it to come out. 

00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:33.259
'Coz it's so cute. Thank you so much Raq! Bye! Haha!

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.190
Going to Vegas for the shoot was pretty nerve rockin' actually. Just because 
 I always like "Oh, I don't know if they're gonna like me."

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.820
Or I don't know, just stuff like that going through my head. 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.820
For the shoot  they ended up sending me to 
 Las Vegas which I was really excited about.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.750
Just because  I've never been to Las Vegas. 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.760
Being in the swimsuit issue is pretty crazy because it's  kind a 
 of just a childhood dream that I've always thought about. 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.060
And, I never really actually I was going to be in it. 

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:33.230
Working with all the assigned people, it was just amazing 
 all together and 'coz though over the moon about.

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.290
Being about being part of it. 

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:51.300
After the said shoot, I pretty much went 
 straight to the North shore of Oahu

00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:58.850
That's kind a where everyone goes in the surfing industry just 
 because the waves are good, it's sunny, it's beautiful! 

00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:02.810
And I always just so lucky to ... have as 
 a house right on the sunset beach 

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.010
And all my friends are there 

00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:14.850
Every winter, we come to the North shore of Oahu til like 
 surf and photos and hang out with the sponsors. 

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:21.240
to some of the contests so we're really excited to all 
 being  in a house together. To be in Oahu.

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:24.150
And there's a lot of fun things going on right now. Yeah!

00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:28.640
This is a pretty much a prime spot. 
 We're so so tired right now. 

00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:53.470
We're gonna surf ... right now, it's not the best weather, I think somewhat...

00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:01.970
The skies like it's always so intimidating for some reason. Everyone's out and watching.

00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:04.950
Where's the ... room? There's expecting something.

00:04:17.852 --> 00:04:21.730
When you first get to Oahu, it's definetely a little nerve racking

00:04:22.548 --> 00:04:26.800
It's because everyone is just here, especially during 
 the sign of November and December. 

00:04:26.797 --> 00:04:32.520
The triple counts going on and on...There's literally 20 photographers 
  on the beach at all time. 

00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:32.900
It's crazy!

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:44.600
Even just going out today, in the back of mind, "Oh 
 my God! I wanna get like a big flip.

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:49.380
 And then I kind as a littler bit 
 a stressed and someone's gets a little intimidating.

00:04:49.384 --> 00:04:51.280
I guess you just kind of block that up, 
 you know ave fun with it.
