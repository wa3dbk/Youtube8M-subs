Hi I'm Rokosz, your Digital Lifestyle Expert
and I'm going to show you how to repair some

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.110
of the scratches if they get on to your DVDs.
Nothing is more frustrating, you're watching

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.379
your favorite movie show that you've dubbed
over the DVD and it's freezing. Or, it says

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.660
disk error on the machine. And it goes or
skipping over bad area in disk. It kills me.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.990
You think you may never be able to get it
into again, but you can. Take a deep breath

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.749
and I'm going to give you some pointers on
how to take care of it. It's real simple.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.699
First, you may consider, if you've got a lot
of DVDs and CDs like most people, is to go

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.160
and invest in a professional CD or DVD cleaning
machine. Okay. And what that will consist

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.390
of is it'll clean and that will repair if
it doesn't work. It's a little thing that

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.039
almost looks like a little portable CD player
and you put it in there and you know, it still

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.530
have little pads in there. Usually two sets
of pads, a buffing pad and a cleaning pad.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.269
And then you'll put the, you put the juice
around the buffing pad and the you put it

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.010
in, you push play and it'll look like it's
playing the disk. Except it'll make a grinding

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.940
noise, it'll sound like it's eating it. But
that's cool, it's alright. When it comes out,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.830
you can test it; if the cleaning isn't enough
and you put it back in and then it actually

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.030
will try to go repair. You can also get a
cheaper version, around about twenty or thirty

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.800
dollars where you can get the liquid that
goes in there 'cause what happens is, is that

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.410
you got the scratch; scratch is very analogous
to the scratch on a, on a phono record. Alright.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.600
The laser needs to read in a spiral out and
there's a scratch in front of it. The laser

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.820
doesn't know where to go, it refracts the
light. When you can get a little bit of that

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.000
dupe and sort of put it on and using the cloth
that they provide or either a lintless cloth,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.170
moving in through and kind of filling in the
scratches and that's kind of like dragging

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.070
your finger in the dirt and then just sort
of filling it in again, trying to create that

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.980
groove. Again, cleaning is always a good first
step, a good way to clean; again, lint free

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.550
rug and you want to always push away. You
never want to do little circles. Again, you

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.660
could create, you could create secondary scratching
in there and looping is not very good. Get

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.670
it nice and clean there, if not, they do have
some professional services out on the web

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.220
that use, that use, that you can send a discount
and do some professional repairing to the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.489
disk, some local places have that outbound
service. You'll pay a couple of bucks for

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.290
it, more than replacing the movie. But if
it's your precious memories, your wedding

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.049
discs, this is something you want to invest
in, like me, Rokosz, your Digital Lifestyle
