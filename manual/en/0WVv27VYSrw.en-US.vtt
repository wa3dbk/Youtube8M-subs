00:00:00.134 --> 00:00:04.114
HervÃ© Cuisine answers your questions

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.414
So for the first question

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.389
what is your favorite desert?

00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:17.194
I had to buy it to show you

00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:18.813
it's really not because I WANTED to eat it....

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:20.934
I'm not a sweet tooth you know... :)

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700
It's the famous tiramisu, that I love to make

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.360
and eat too :)

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.235
and another one...

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:29.880
the carrot cake !

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.700
woups, there's some missing....

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900
that's strange....

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:37.049
there are so many deserts I like actually

00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:39.714
oh the Parisian Flan Patissier is also one of my favorites !

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.660
What's the difference and use between

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.500
Baking soda and baking powder?

00:00:46.114 --> 00:00:48.114
So the difference is

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.460
baking power is like yeast, it will help your dough rise

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.075
baking soda helps keep your bakes moist

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.880
you can also use it to clean you house :) your fridge and so on

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.880
I personally add like a tsp in my cakes 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.420
it keeps them moist longer

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360
When you were a kid, what did you use to bake?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
Well, Marion asks what was the recipe I used to do most

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.614
when I was a kid

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:34.578
Without hesitation : crepes !

00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:36.514
I started real soon

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.080
my tradition each year was that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.600
the first crepe I cooked

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.580
i usually decorated it with coins and other "magic" stuffs

00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:49.014
and would let it dry out on top of my parents's kitchen

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700
That was supposed to bring wealth and good luck for the year !!

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:55.633
Once I was cleaning the kitchen maybe around 16 or 17

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:57.140
and there were like 10 dried crepes

00:01:59.754 --> 00:02:01.754
they were like crepes mummies !

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.489
so crepes is the answer

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:07.840
and so if you have kids, 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.595
let them cook crepes,

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.067
you never know, it can give them a taste for cooking later :)

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300
How did you fall in love with cooking?

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.980
I was asked this question by many fans

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.020
how did it all start?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.400
I think we need to go back to my childhood

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.720
my parents would let me cook, experiment

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.040
the only condition was that I cleaned the mess afterwards...

00:02:34.793 --> 00:02:36.793
and then as a student

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:38.160
I left my parents' house at 17 for my studies

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.220
and had no choice, I was on my own :)

00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:45.053
I started with simple things like pastas

00:02:45.954 --> 00:02:47.954
but i would prepare my own tomatoe sauce

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I remember I didn't have an oven

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.640
so I would bake my cakes in the microwave !

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960
Like my 5 minutes brownies recipe

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:01.174
it dates back from when I was a student

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.660
and trust me, this particular chocolate brownie

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.134
help me make a lot of friends at the time :)

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.980
What is your favorite drink?

00:03:18.614 --> 00:03:20.614
Well that's easy

00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:24.188
I really enjoy latte

00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:24.934
with vanilla....

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:26.593
and also green tea !

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.874
Here we go, this first round of Q&amp;A is over

00:03:30.134 --> 00:03:32.134
