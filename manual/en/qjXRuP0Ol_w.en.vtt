[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.950
FREYA: Beautiful.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.470
MAN: My thoughts exactly.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.950
FREYA: Who are you?

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.080
MAN: I was known as Olav
Kyrre, Priestess.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.830
FREYA: Olav Kyrre is dead.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.480
OLAV KYRRE: So I am, as I would
have my people continue

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.840
to believe.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.880
What brings you to my land?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.590
FREYA: There is no House of
Night in Scandinavia.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.470
OLAV KYRRE: And you wish
to establish one here.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.920
FREYA: Our goddess wishes it.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.590
OLAV KYRRE: The churches here
still believe vampyres to be

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.760
minions of Satan.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.430
FREYA: Yet there are many
fledglings in this land with

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.620
nowhere to learn how to become
what they must become.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.940
OLAV KYRRE: I keep them safe.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.595
FREYA: How?

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:02.940
FLEDGLING VAMPYRE: Who is she?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.890
FLEDGLING VAMPYRE: Have
the humans found us?

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.209
FLEDGLING VAMPYRE:
No need to fear.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.550
She is the same as us.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.330
FREYA: This is how you
keep them safe?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.500
By hiding them away
like animals?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.980
OLAV KYRRE: Would you rather
they be hunted like animals?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.170
Because that's exactly what the
humans will do to them.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.647
FREYA: And that is thanks
to you, King Olav.

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.080
FLEDGLING VAMPYRE: What
does she mean, Olav?

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.560
OLAV KYRRE: I was marked
a year before I

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.580
was to become king.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.990
So I hid the truth away
by never removing

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.920
my helmet in public.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.350
During my reign, I worked long
and hard to establish peace

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.465
between the pagans
and Christians.

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:47.410
The Christian bishops would
agree to that peace, if the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.050
blood drinkers were expelled
from Norway.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.970
I chased them out myself before
the church soldiers

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.530
could burn them alive
or worse.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.904
After years of guilt,
King Olav finally

00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:01.610
"died" of a grave illness.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.620
And I set off to protect the
scattered fledglings.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.000
I never meant for things
to end up so--

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.150
FREYA: You had a heavy burden
to bear, and we all wish we

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.400
could change the past.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.880
But it's in the here and now
that you have a chance to make

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.830
things right.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.830
Do you not trust your
goddess, Nyx?

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.910
OLAV KYRRE: It's humans
I don't trust.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.520
If I allow you to expose those
fledglings, it will be at the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.300
expense of their lives.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.510
FREYA: But you can
expose yourself.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.920
These people still cherish
their memory of you.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.800
You could exp--

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.260
FREYA: You are a high priestess
and therefore my

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
superior, but I will
stop you if you--

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.530
FREYA: I will establish a safe
haven for these fledglings,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.140
with or without you.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.320
OLAV KYRRE: Then I would request
that you speak to Nyx

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.582
and explain the hazards
of this madness.

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.980
FREYA: Earth, my element.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.950
I summon you to stand with me
as I beseech my goddess.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.115
Nyx, I request the favor
of your eternal wisdom.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.551
NYX: I hear you, daughter.

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:07.910
But it is your own wisdom
you will need.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.580
What is it you would
ask of me?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.100
FREYA: Some believe that by
trying to help the fledglings

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.379
here, I may be endangering
them.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.193
NYX: Is this what you believe?

00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:21.266
FREYA: No, but I need
your assistance.

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:24.145
NYX: Then you shall have
it in the form

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:26.093
of my forest children.

00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:31.620
They will show you your path if
you survive their guidance.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.530
[GROWLING]

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.955
OLAV KYRRE: Those cats will
kill you soon enough.

00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:39.390
FREYA: What are they,
these cats?

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.188
OLAV KYRRE: Norsk Skogkatts,
sacred to my people.

00:03:44.188 --> 00:03:47.625
FREYA: If these sacred cats
accept me, then so too will

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.098
the people of Bergen.

00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:51.062
OLAV KYRRE: And if they
flay you alive?

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:53.026
FREYA: You mean, us?

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:54.276
No!

00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:58.427
Earth, I summon thee.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.380
You're bleeding.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.052
OLAV KYRRE: Can't imagine why.

00:04:07.052 --> 00:04:08.994
FREYA: It would be
a shame to waste.

00:04:08.994 --> 00:04:11.464
May I taste?

00:04:11.464 --> 00:04:12.714
OLAV KYRRE: Be my guest.

00:04:19.368 --> 00:04:20.850
OGMUND: Is it a witch?

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.990
HUMAN: She's a vampyre.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.390
See the mark?

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.190
OGMUND: That's far enough.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.420
HUMAN: How is it that
a Satan-spawned

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.180
vampyre exists in Norway?

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.980
HUMAN: How'd she get them
cats so friendly?

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.330
OGMUND: Shut your mouth,
boy, and get.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.910
HUMAN: I don't know what's
demonic power you have over

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.530
the sacred Skogkatts, but--

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.380
FREYA: I have no power
over them.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.920
These cats accepted me,
as I am hoping you

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.260
and your city will.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.430
OGMUND: We've had no blood
drinkers in this land for over

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.350
20 years, thanks
to Olav Kyrre.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.755
OLAV KYRRE: That's a mistake I
will forever regret, Ogmund,

00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:51.665
old friend.

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:52.350
OGMUND: King Olav?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.445
HUMAN: You will leave this land,
demon, and return to--

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:56.950
OGMUND: I will hear what
he has to say.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.040
OLAV KYRRE: Please forgive my
deception all these years.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.530
I'm ashamed to admit that I
doubted my faith in the Norse

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.620
capacity for acceptance.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.020
I hope you will prove
that I was wrong.
