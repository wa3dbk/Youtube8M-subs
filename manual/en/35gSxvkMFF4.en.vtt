00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000 position:97%
In 2000, Shell started to explore for oil and gas in a new area off the coast of Brazil,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000 position:98%
in partnership with Petrobras and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000 position:97%
Originally called BC-10 block, the exploration area has now been named “Parque das Conchas” or “Park of Shells”.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000 position:97%
It is located in the Campos Basin, more than 100 kilometres off the coast of Espírito Santo state.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000 position:97%
Shell and partners discovered four fields in the area: Ostra, Abalone, Argonauta and Nautilus.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000 position:98%
The reservoirs are up to 2,500 metres beneath the seabed, and the fields are up to 20 kilometres apart.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000 position:97%
The oil in the reservoirs is mostly heavy. API gravity ranges from 16º to 42º.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000 position:69%
The Ostra field is the first to produce oil.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000 position:97%
All the wells in this field are horizontal and can stretch for 1 kilometre into the reservoir.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000 position:98%
Drilling activities have been carried out in parallel to the installation of the subsea equipment

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000 position:89%
needed for the start of production in Parque das Conchas.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000 position:86%
This equipment is connected to the floating production,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000 position:95%
storage and offloading platform called “FPSO Espírito Santo”.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000 position:98%
Once production starts, the oil and the gas will flow from the wells to installations on the seabed known in the industry as Christmas trees.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000 position:98%
From these installations, the oil and the gas flow to what are known as jumpers and plets until they reach the separation manifold.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000 position:97%
A piece of equipment called MOBO, connected to the manifold, separates the oil from the gas.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000 position:89%
Using this technology in deep water is an industry first.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000 position:98%
From this point onwards, the oil and the gas are piped separately to the FPSO Espírito Santo.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000 position:97%
The floating platform can process up to 100,000 barrels of oil and 50 million cubic feet of natural gas a day,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000 position:98%
and store nearly 1.5 million barrels of oil for shipment to shore by transport tankers.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000 position:97%
Parque das Conchas is a project that posed many technical challenges

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000 position:97%
for example, its location in ultra-deep water and its geologically complex, low-pressure reservoirs.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000 position:97%
Challenges that Shell and partners have been able to overcome through ingenuity and the application of new technologies.
