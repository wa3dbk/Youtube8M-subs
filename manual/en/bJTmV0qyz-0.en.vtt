Here we are, fucking fan favourite: Trials HD.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.340
I know it's a good game,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.540
I'm not saying it's not a good game.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.780
At most, everyone will agree it's a great game.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.840
WHY AM I SO TERRIBLE AT IT?

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.280
All it is, is the left trigger, the right trigger,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.080
and fucking, the directionals!

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.000
That's it!

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.240
Okay, I've a thousand hard games,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.100
I have a thousand games like Batman Arkham Asylum.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.560
Some of those combat challenges were hard as shit.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.600
Okay, I have a thousand prototypes,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.220
more hard as shit challenges.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.540
I've got plenty of achievements for hard shit.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.360
Oh, I'm fucking Batman?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.820
I got fucking, you know,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.560
fucking thirty guys beating the shit out of me?

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.160
And they got guns, and they're throwing shit at me,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.180
and I'm timed, and the floor's gonna electrocute me?

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.300
No fucking problem.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.920
Can I drive a motorcycle up a hill?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.760
Beep, beep, beep.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760
No, I can't fucking can't.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.560
I die OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.780
And this ASSHOLE IneptStatue, SON OF A BITCH,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.220
on my friends list, who's also in this party RIGHT NOW,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.280
is a fucking asshole.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880
I- I fucking kick the SHIT out of him in gamer score,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.380
he constantly talks shit about gamer score,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.740
I've got WAY more than him,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.660
and he SUCKS at practically everything he does,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.860
he's like an idiot savant in this game!

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.520
HE'S GOT THE GOD DAMN MARATHON!

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.860
HOW THE FUCK DID HE COMPLETE THE ULTIMATE ENDURANCE

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.700
WITHOUT ANY FAULTS?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.220
I mean I'm gonna play a hard,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.140
a- a fucking hard level right here,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.260
because if I'd play expert,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.520
I'd be stuck on the first, fucking, checkpoint. The entire video.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.320
(sigh)

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.080
I cannot- I cannot play this fucking game!

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.500
I don't know why I lack the necessary skill to GO FORWARD!

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.020
And I don't know why.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.000
This asshole always seems to do fucking flips.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.780
He goes forward or backward when I don't want him to.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.720
Like right there.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.060
(sigh)

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.800
(sigh)

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.860
(sigh)

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.020
Yay! Ev- Every time I hit a checkpoint it's like,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.680
it's like, a fucking gift from God.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.720
Ya know, like oh thank fucking Christ.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.120
Thank God I hit a fucking checkpoint.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.140
I- I've freaked out so many times playing this game.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.740
And I- I keep coming back to it,

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.460
again, 'cause it's a good game, it's a solid game.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.960
But I- I just can't learn the fucking, the physics of it!

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.860
I just can't wrap my fucking brain around it.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.380
I get the shit, like with backflips and stuff like that.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.980
And look I- I landed that, I have no idea how I fucking landed  that.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.840
He just always fucking does a flip when I don't want him to.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.580
Or I just hold the right trigger like an asshole,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.360
and I just fucking punch it too much.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.620
Like this. Go. Yes. NOOOO!

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.280
Damn it! That's the closest I've gotten to getting up that fucking thing.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.600
(sigh)

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.340
It's like they taunt you.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.640
The fact that you can hit the B button whenever you want.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.420
Knows.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.160
They KNOW you're gonna fuck up.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.300
Like you don't even have to wait for yourself to die.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.960
Just hit the fucking B button.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.460
That's-  this is the first time I've actually ever even gotten up here.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.840
(sigh)

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.480
And then I fall over a fucking pipe!

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.900
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? WHAT AM I DOING?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.520
I gotta hump the fucking thing.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.800
Get down!

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.200
And he just bounces all over the place like the god damn

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.700
asshole's wearing moonshoes.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.940
Moonshoes!

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.300
MOONSHOES!

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.480
THE FUCKING ANTI-GRAVITY SHOES!

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.780
(sigh)

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.260
It- I- Nothing pisses me off like a good game of fucking Trials.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.640
I fucking, I can't believe it I- I passed it.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.820
But look at my fucking time!

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.260
Even in that, that's actually a pretty good fucking time for me.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.920
Let's try another one 'cause I did SO WELL on that one.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.640
These are of course the new maps- And that's how much of an asshole I am.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.920
Fucking-

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.940
Really?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.640
I suck so hard at this game so what did I do?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.180
I- I bought the fucking maps.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.720
I bought the uh, the first map pack that came out.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.520
Look, I just quit. Just- just quit.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.360
I just quit. I just- I just know I'm not gonna make it

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.820
and it's just like, just hit the B button you fucking idiot!

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.720
It's- it's mostly the fucking straight up jumps,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.960
where you have to, like, fuck the analog stick back and forth

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.740
and rev the asshole up.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.520
I just fucking de-headed myself.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.300
Or like time and time again I'll KNOW I gotta slow up,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.300
and I- I don't fucking slow up, I just mash the fucking button.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.060
SOMEBODY TEACH ME HOW TO PLAY THIS FUCKING GAME!

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100
I'M BETTER AT SUPER MEAT BOY THAN THIS!

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.040
At least Super Meat Boy like, fucking gets ridiculously hard!

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.320
I- I can't do the simple shit in this game!

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.440
Not without freaking the fuck out and my head exploding over it.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.200
Oh no no NO NOOO!

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.460
And then it just goes backwards!

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.000
Oh, see I got lucky there it's a half-pipe and I freaked out.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.240
It's cool.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.020
Ughh.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.380
(sigh)

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.480
And then the backwards shit kills me.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.900
It fucking kills me. I don't know-

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.720
I can never fucking just, I can never plan out what the fuck I have to do.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.520
NOOO!

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.720
I end up just fucking,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.660
DRY HUMPING THE GOD DAMN BIKE

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.480
until he flips over on his asshole.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.000
FONZIE JUMPED THE FUCKING SHARK!

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.700
I should be able to do this!

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.180
I probably have a better shot at this in real life!

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.500
For me anyway!

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.400
I- He just ends up doing backflips again and again

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.160
and I can't get him to stop.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.980
Or like- NO GO YEA YES! YES I GOT IT!

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.380
That was a gift.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.800
That was a gift right there, HIT THE B BUTTON!

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.920
I cannot even attempt those fucking expert levels.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.740
I- I somehow did like two of them,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.360
and the third or fourth one I got to,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.900
I- I got like right to the fucking end

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.300
and ran out of time.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.680
Which by the way is like a half an hour.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.240
If you fucking, if you fail that shit for a half an hour,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.320
They just automatically reset you.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.600
And- AND INEPT DOES THE ULTIMATE ENDURANCE WITH NO FUCKING FAULTS!

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.240
THAT'S ONE THING HE'S GOT OVER ME.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.480
THANK GOD I FINISHED, AT LEAST ENDED.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.080
I completed two tracks.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.580
CONGRATULATIONS! WHERE'S MY FUCKING COOKIE?

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.500
SON OF A BITCH!
