00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:09.616
We've got an audio-visual
conundrum for you.

00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:13.307
If you had to choose from
any of these two cars...

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.691
...which one would it be?

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.506
The Aston Martin V12 Vantage...

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:20.677
...or the CLK 63 Black Series?

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:24.555
And why choose between these two cars?

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:27.089
Why not?
Simply because it's possible.

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:31.881
And also because we'll give these cars away
to respondents.

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:34.776
Just kidding.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.691
The AMG's brakes are made out of
old-fashioned steel.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.354
They are a composite with aluminum
to make them lighter though.

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:40.225
The Aston Martin has
state of the art carbon disks.

00:02:03.604 --> 00:02:08.205
6-liter V12, 510 hp.
Quite nice in such a small car.

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:13.542
This one has a 6.2 liter V8,
it lacks 4 cylinders.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.707
It has 507 hp.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.430
The Aston also has an interior,
and quite a nice one at that.

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:28.704
Leather, alcantara, stitching.

00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:31.442
It's all nicely done.

00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:37.612
Let's skip the CLK 'cause that's quite
an anticlimax compared to this one.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.115
I'm all out of tread for today.

00:03:10.348 --> 00:03:14.596
And they're both very nice cars.

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:16.719
So pick one.
