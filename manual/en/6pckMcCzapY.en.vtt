Right Total Knee Replacement Surgery Patient

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.800
Story, Jamie - BoneSmart

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.800
Q What is your name and what procedure did
you have?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.250
JC My name is Jamie. About three years ago
I had a right total knee replacement at the

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.340
Kansas City Orthopaedic Institute.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.660
Q Why did you decide to have surgery?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:24.079
JC Before I had my surgery I had had orthoscopic
surgery on my right knee and it accelerated

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:32.180
my arthritis to the point that my knee went
bad in about three months. I lost all my cartilage.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.010
It was really difficult to get around. I had
trouble walking. I had to walk with a cane

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.573
and I couldn't do most of the things that
I needed or wanted to do.

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:43.800
Q How did you decide it was time to get surgery,
and how did this make you feel?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.980
JC I decided it was time to have surgery one
day when my husband and I were at an art festival

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.949
and we were boarding a bus to go back to our
car, I had my cane and I was getting around

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.510
okay I thought, but as we started to get on
the bus when the bus pulled up, the entire

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.640
crowd that was waiting for the bus stopped
and parted and let me get on first.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.890
While that was very nice, I was only fifty-nine
years old and I wasn't ready to be an old

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.620
person so that was my moment of truth where
I decided I needed to have a new knee.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.200
Q How did you do research for the surgery?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.860
JC I researched different doctors in Kansas
City after I had had my orthoscopic surgery

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.561
and I chose based on a recommendation from
a friend of mine who is a nurse. I had an

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:41.590
excellent surgeon and a really great facility
and I couldn't be happier with my knee.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.130
About three weeks into my recovery I was surfing
on the Internet and found BoneSmart just by

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.070
accident. I started corresponding and got
some questions answered quickly and found

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.220
that it was just a really great community
of good folks who were there to keep you positive

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.660
and keep you focused on a good recovery.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:12.310
That was very important to me and having BoneSmart
really helped me. I was able to go online

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.170
anytime day or night. That was a real plus.
We had members all over the world and there

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.700
was almost always somebody to talk to if you
needed help or you were awake in the middle

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
of the night.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.470
Q What has having this surgery done for your
life, what are you able to do again?

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.750
JC Having surgery has made a big difference
in my life. I didn't spend very long disabled

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.890
but I could clearly see that if that would
have gone on my life would have become so

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.280
small and miserable. Once my recovery was
over, my knee is fine and I do great. I can

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.520
do anything that I want to do. I don't have
any limits.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.160
I can needle. I can go up and down stairs.
I can climb a ladder. I paint. We have a lakehouse

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.670
and I go up and down hills. There just really
isn't anything that I can't do and I'm so

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.020
glad that I took the time to research and
find a good surgeon, have a great replacement,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.560
and now I look forward to a great life.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.349
I'm a "BoneSmartie" and I'm enjoying life
again.
