00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.430
Congratulations to NASA! NASA
scored a gold medal on Mars, a ten. It was

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.810
a perfect launch, perfect execution, and the
dismount was a perfect ten on the Red Planet.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.289
But that's just the first step of many steps
to come. Next we want to go to perhaps the

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.899
polar icecaps or perhaps even drill underground.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.400
If you were a Martian on Mars three billion

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.319
years ago when Mars was practically a\'97probably
a lush environment with liquid water oceans\'97and

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:36.620
you realized that the water was escaping to
the icecaps, escaping into outer space or

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.010
going into the permafrost, where would you
go? Journalists say follow the money. Astronomers

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.050
say follow the water. And if the water is
going to go into outer space, underground

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.219
or the polar icecaps, you would also probably
go either into outer space to leave Mars or

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.620
drill into the permafrost or go into the polar
icecaps. So I think that's what NASA is going

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.579
to do next. Of course, it's more difficult
to land on the polar icecaps because the terrain

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.030
is quite rocky. 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.290
Also, rock retrieval; we need to actually
take rocks from Mars and bring them back to

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.290
earth because we have tantalizing evidence
that possibly microbial life existed on Mars.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.509
We have Mars rocks right here on the planet
earth, and when you slice them open you see

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.030
little tiny, squiggly things that look like
multi-celled organisms. Well, we're not sure.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.310
It's a raging debate. Some people say bah-humbug,
it's nothing but a crystalline structure that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.250
seems to look like a multi-cell organism.
The result of the question is we have to have

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.570
rock retrieval and after that I think perhaps
we should put a blimp or a helicopter on Mars.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.829
Now the atmosphere of Mars is quite thin,
only one percent the atmospheric pressure

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.969
here on the planet earth, so the wings of
the helicopter or the size of a blimp would

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.939
have to be different to compensate for that.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.920
And then of course we should try for a manned

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.410
mission to Mars. But let's be real. It's going
to be expensive and it will take time. It

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.440
costs $10,000 to put a pound of anything into
near earth orbit. Imagine your body made out

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.300
of solid gold and that's the cost to put you
into orbit around the planet earth. To put

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.300
you on the moon costs about $100,000 a pound.
To put you on Mars costs about a million dollars

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.330
a pound. So think twice before you think that
we're going to go to Mars with astronauts

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.680
in the next few years. It's going to take
decades to prepare for a manned mission to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.930
Mars.
