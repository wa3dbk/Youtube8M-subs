Android Tutorial
When I first got my Android Phone, I was a

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.840
bit overwhelmed with all the options that the
phone offered me, so I went online and I looked

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.269
around for some training help. And you know
what? I was a bit disappointed in all the

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.480
nerdyness of what I saw out there for help
for my Droid phone. And because I'm a trainer

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.560
that does training for computer software stuff,
I have spent many years learning how to take

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.240
complex stuff and make it easy to understand
to the average person.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.869
So I decided that as I learn things on my
phone, I'd just make some training materials

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.889
and make them available for 
people online like you.

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:40.239
If your phone is using the Android operating
system by Google, then you have a Droid Phone

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.319
and you want to know "How do I Use My Droid"?
It doesn't really matter if you have an original

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:53.319
Droid by Motorola, or a DroidX, or a Droid2,
or an HTC Incredible, HTC Aria, another HTC

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.629
phone or one made by ATT or Samsung or Sprint
or a score of other phone makers. They are

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.140
all making phones now that use the 
Android Operating System.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.460
You have a Droid Phone and you now have a
place to come and watch crisp, clean, easy

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.460
