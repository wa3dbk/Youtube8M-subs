00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.370

anything in a long time now that

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.320
in

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.100
holy Shi'ite so the guy singing is

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.340
Harry C brown yes it's from columbia
records

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.569
in 1916 which is unbelievable the
Columbia Records

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.280
was involved with that kinda stuff but I
mean like that said the time in nineteen

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.340
sixteen hours like

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.680
people the iPod of course that's that's
the song we sing at our favorite song

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.860
so the melody came from the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.150
early 19th century song turkey in the
straw law

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.680
which dates back to even older and a
traditional British song

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.930
called the older rose tree that song was
used in minstrel shows

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.700
along with other casually racist songs

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.019
and I don't know if you could hear the
lyrics this is what they said I'm gonna

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:48.910
read them to you

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.640
warning it a post-race issued you've
ever heard

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.829
the guy says you niggas quit throwing
them bones

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.209
in come down and get your ice cream they
say

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.489
ice cream he says yes ice cream

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.970
color man colour demands ice cream
watermelon

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.350
are and then you are you probably heard
a little bit the chorus

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.889
it goes nigger loves a watermelon
harharhar

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.630
nigger loves a watermelon hahaha

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.380
for here they're made with a half a
pound of

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.470
cool there's nothing like a watermelon
for a hungry

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.480
koon it

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.310
ep now would appear to be the most
racist thing ever n

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.709
look the reason why I'd I think it's
important to share this story with you

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.720
to talk about it

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.799
is that oftentimes will you find today

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.569
and it's so widespread it's unfortunate
to is that virtually

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.290
all old white conservative men

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.220
okay they all have this this feeling
about racism that were there just like

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.139
get over it my good stuff shut the fuck
up

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.069
likes stop like he'd pull yourself up by
your bootstraps stop complaining black

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.849
people

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.549
in there is no racism yr you know where
they talking about it yada yada

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:19.130
right but what day shows you among many
other things to look again this is 1916

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.650
and you compare that to you like in the
nineteen sixties early nineteen sixties

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.050
we still had open segregation okay

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.260
we need the Civil Rights Act you know
mid-nineteen sixties was when I came

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.820
around

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.130
and then what like overnight that all
got better let me go if we pass the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.719
Civil Rights Act

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.760
and everything is perfect now you still
had like really old racist white dudes

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.930
in Alabama Mississippi Louisiana mean
you name another pic on those dates

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.510
they're all over the fuckin place but
it's the idea that get over there isn't

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.900
you know there's no who cares it the
racism is dead

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.580
no not dead and you really don't
comprehend how deeply rooted it is in

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.450
the culture

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.590
it till you hear the fuckin ice cream
song and you realize

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.240
while the original lyrics were nigger
loves a watermelon hahaha of

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.570
mean the idea of a minstrel show why
people but Mb black people in the act

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.409
like they're stupid

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.409
no your this stupid ones

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.890
you guys are the stupid ones do you see
what you're doing you're marking an

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.409
entire race of people

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.010
like 10 they didn't view but people as
individuals they viewed him as like

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.219
know what your skin color ok I know how
you are what's your gender what's your

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:31.300
arm religion all I know how you are with
these gross generalizations

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.729
that they had and look this thing is

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.240
you see it today

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.889
obviously not to this extent but that
mindset continues you know and just give

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.550
you one example but I could go on and on
I mean I give you

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.360
it too many statistical for you guys
probably shut the fuck up already we get

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.880
it black people why people use drugs at
the same rate

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.240
but black people arrested four times
more often gee I wonder what the cause

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.820
of that as well the causes

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.969
there and their skin color clearly law
enforcement

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.889
cracks down harder on them but just
another example is

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.550
whenever you know a black guy

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.270
tries really hard work his way up the
economic ladder

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.849
really make something of himself what do
I'll

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.150
order why people always say
conservatives I E I at Birmingham action

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.169
a.m. lucky doesn't deserve to be there
but then

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.380
okay so what are the same guy had
decided is a you know what fuck it

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.110
you know this is the sisters are geared
to help me anyway are to do

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.300
you know they're gonna look down on me
no matter what so fuck it gonna quit my

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.530
job managers go

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.970
you ever thought I wanna do all day and
night and it is what it is that what

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.729
they say are moocher parasite

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.280
year low you know how they are so

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.139
the wat if they try hard you say fuck
them their inferior

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.050
if they don't write all you say fuck
them their inferior so you set up so

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.360
it's a lose-lose

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.740
and that's the prism of society that you
know

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.039
that they've had to live through for
such a long fuckin time and then you got

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.470
eighty it's coming along like our racism
it doesn't exist

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.110
and I'm gonna keep going on on your ex I
can't help myself

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.139
but so many studies at the eBay study
put a white hand sewing in

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:13.379
iPod in a black and selling an iPod the
widening its all the hits

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:16.889
that's the only difference is the caller
the handling it all in its

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.509
you know the resume study perot black
numerous members is a white name

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:25.050
lightning gets all the hits I me just so
many examples of shit this is clearly a

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.190
racist abuse not

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.210
racism doesn't exist even the fuckin ice
cream truck song is driving down the

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.680
street

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.750
dats it was an incredibly races or

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.610
so the idea that that it's dead or you
know just get over it or whatever

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.800
no no no no we still have a lot of work
to do there still a lotta remnants of it

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.250
when you see is stuff in history like
this kinda remind you

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.979
and slap you have your complacency
