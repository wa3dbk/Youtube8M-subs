00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.341
(lively big band music)

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:10.236
(wine uncorking)

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.803
(glasses clinking)

00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:18.370
- In this episode of the Wine Oh wine club

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.227
we're getting to the bottom of Brad Pitt

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:23.780
and Angelina Jolie's red carpet rosé.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.697
We're trying Brangelina's 2012 rosé

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:29.580
from Province, France.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.859
I have the Wine Oh wine
club official members here.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.963
You told me off-camera that this may

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:37.027
be your first glass of wine you've had.

00:00:37.027 --> 00:00:38.502
So Gianna just had a baby so

00:00:38.502 --> 00:00:39.752
- You outed me!

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.932
- I can edit this.

00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:43.118
Was this seriously,

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:45.823
you went to the red carpet wine first?

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:47.750
- I did, I love the
way you put that, Moni!

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.562
I did, I went straight
for the red carpet wine.

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:50.757
Why not, right?

00:00:50.757 --> 00:00:51.907
My first night out as a mommy

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:52.766
to enjoy a glass of wine,

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.867
and it totally is a good thing

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.352
when you're a mom to have a glass of wine

00:00:57.352 --> 00:00:59.272
and kind of let yourself go
a little bit and enjoy it.

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:01.152
And Gianni, you said that you typically

00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:02.267
maybe like a little sweeter.

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:03.823
I remember before we tried the moscato.

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:05.796
What do you think of a drier rosé?

00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:07.456
- It tastes fresh to me.

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:08.361
Again, I'm not a wine expert

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:09.383
so I'm not sure if that comes across.

00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:12.708
But it does, it tastes fresh,
it tastes cool, I like it.

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:14.670
I wouldn't say it's probably
the most favorite wine

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.750
I've ever had.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.271
It's beautiful, though.

00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.163
And as a mom, looking at the bottle

00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:20.893
if I was walking down the aisle

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:22.379
and had a rough day with the kids

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:23.807
and was kinda hoping for a good night out,

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:24.806
this would catch my eye.

00:01:24.806 --> 00:01:26.942
- So this wine actually sold out

00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:30.146
in about five hours when
it first went on sale.

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:32.444
I bought it, had to get in
a waiting list, wait online

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:34.369
I paid, I don't know,

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.667
it ended up being about
I think $27 a bottle.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:37.735
I paid a little bit more because I had

00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:39.175
to have it shipped and all that stuff.

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.421
So we're looking at
around $25-ish a bottle.

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:43.663
So Deb, you are a budget wino

00:01:43.663 --> 00:01:44.603
so I have to turn to you.

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:45.463
You tried the wine.

00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:46.937
First of all, what are your impressions?

00:01:46.937 --> 00:01:49.259
- So, I really like this wine.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.279
I have a little problem stomaching

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:53.279
over $20 bottle of rosé.

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:56.340
I don't know about anyone else there,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.265
but I'm like, come on, this thing's gonna

00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.341
be gone in five minutes.

00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:00.174
(laughter)

00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:02.029
- Well that's the thing I think Laura

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:03.677
and I once off-camera
called the "porch pounder."

00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:05.744
You can just knock this
thing back so you can--

00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:07.409
- It's too easy to drink.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.115
It's not like a
complicated, big-bodied red

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:11.148
that you're gonna savor.

00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:12.704
You can sit down with your friends

00:02:12.704 --> 00:02:14.666
and be done with it in 10 minutes.

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.639
- A pro tip I know at the Costcos

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.334
in the San Francisco Bay Area,

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.204
these are now selling for $20

00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:21.899
which is pretty exciting.

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.838
On the upper end of that
price point for a rosé

00:02:23.838 --> 00:02:25.358
but still quite exciting.

00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:26.961
- Super exciting to find it at Costco

00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:29.190
after I waited in the
freaking waiting list,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.732
paying premium shipping prices.

00:02:31.732 --> 00:02:34.144
Where was Budget Wine
Oh when I needed her?

00:02:34.144 --> 00:02:35.572
Do you think if we hang onto one

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.720
of these now I paid $25

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.485
this will be a collectors item?

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:41.482
- Why would you not drink
this wine right away?

00:02:41.482 --> 00:02:42.968
- Because if you want to make money.

00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:45.197
So my question, if you put
this in the time capsule

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:48.099
for example if Vivien Leigh

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.557
or one of these old celebrities,

00:02:49.557 --> 00:02:51.059
give me another one.

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.092
- [Wine Ohs] Grace Kelly.

00:02:52.092 --> 00:02:54.806
- If Grace Kelly made
a rosé and we had it,

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:55.955
do you think it would be worth more money

00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:57.105
or it's like no?

00:02:57.105 --> 00:02:58.013
- No.

00:02:58.013 --> 00:02:59.386
- Foodie Wine Oh, initial thoughts

00:02:59.386 --> 00:03:01.220
on the rosé and then
talk to me a little bit

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.811
about what you might pair with it.

00:03:02.811 --> 00:03:04.216
- Yeah, I think it's delicious.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:07.503
It's not a really sweet, overpowering sort

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:08.613
of white Zinfandel that a lot

00:03:08.613 --> 00:03:11.396
of people may have tried
with previous rosés.

00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:13.486
It's definitely in a French style

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:15.148
so a little more subtle, a little drier.

00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:16.344
When you think about Province,

00:03:16.344 --> 00:03:17.533
it's by the ocean.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.463
You have a lot of seafood and vegetables.

00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:23.284
So, definitely lighter foods with fish.

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:24.967
Bouillabaisse would be great.

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:26.570
But definitely I would stay away

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.833
from anything heavy and really focus

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.713
on light, seasonal, French.

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:32.781
So sort of the big flavors

00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:36.031
are olives, and olive oil, and lavender

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.833
and any kind of fresh seafood
if you're lucky enough

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.238
to live by the ocean it would be great.

00:03:41.238 --> 00:03:43.467
- If the wine wasn't celebrity enough,

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:44.872
we have even a more rock
and roll connection.

00:03:44.872 --> 00:03:46.383
- I will be really honest.

00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:48.800
Jolie, she is my woman crush,

00:03:51.222 --> 00:03:52.055
like I am in love with her, so--

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:54.009
- The truth comes out!

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.270
Nothing she says counts from here on out.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.652
Your opinion is null and void.

00:03:58.652 --> 00:04:00.695
- Angie, as I call her, is my girl.

00:04:00.695 --> 00:04:01.856
So when I found out she was coming out

00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:04.009
with a wine I was obviously interested.

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.961
It was very curious.

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.585
When I found out it was
Miraval it was interesting

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:10.645
because as a rock girl Pink Floyd recorded

00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:12.677
their 1979 The Wall, part of it,

00:04:12.677 --> 00:04:16.241
The Wall album at the Miraval Château.

00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.923
So in the rock industry
it's a very cool story.

00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.932
It's one of those legendary
stories that you hear,

00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:23.451
like, "Oh, Pink Floyd,
they recorded there."

00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:24.589
So that's what they're known for.

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:27.503
So it's just a rock and
roll whole connection.

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:30.243
Plus Angelina Jolie, you know, forget

00:04:30.243 --> 00:04:31.427
about Brad Pitt, who needs him?

00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:35.995
She's got this elegance
and rocker chic edge to her

00:04:35.995 --> 00:04:38.004
even though she's a mom
of like 15,000 kids.

00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:39.548
When you look at this bottle,

00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:41.893
it looks elegant and it grabs you.

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:45.155
It doesn't look like every
single thing on the shelf.

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:48.186
It's different and it reminds me of Angie.

00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:49.463
When I took a swig of this I thought,

00:04:49.463 --> 00:04:51.634
Wow, that's really, really nice.

00:04:51.634 --> 00:04:52.539
I really like it.

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.919
- So overall then, do we
give it a yum or a yuck?

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.115
- I give it a yum for sure.

00:04:56.115 --> 00:04:57.137
- [Wine Ohs] Yum.

00:04:57.137 --> 00:04:59.726
- Even though it's not the
sweeter sort of Moscato-y kind

00:04:59.726 --> 00:05:00.794
of wine that mama likes?

00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:01.851
- No, here's also too why

00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:04.033
because it's a fun conversation starter.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:05.345
So if I went to my mommy group

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:06.541
and we were having our wine night

00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:07.447
our cupcake and wine night,

00:05:07.447 --> 00:05:08.479
because we do it occasionally now

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.721
that we're all starting to
get a glass of wine going.

00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:12.722
It would be fun.

00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:14.951
Hey, Brad and Angie,
look how pretty it is.

00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:16.901
There's more information
that I just learned about,

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:18.608
and all the food you could attach to it.

00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:20.828
This is a total winner in that aspect.

00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:22.848
$20 at Costco? Sold. Done.

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:26.649
- Done, raising our glass
to the red carpet rosé.

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:28.316
- [Wine Ohs] Cheers!

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.276
Rockin' Wine Oh Mat
Kearney, he's a musician

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:38.812
he teamed up with Ian White who

00:05:38.812 --> 00:05:41.621
is the Wine Director for
San Francisco magazine,

00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:43.351
he used to be over at 7x7.

00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:45.441
The two of them teamed up to produce

00:05:45.441 --> 00:05:47.531
this wine called Verse &amp; Chorus

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.143
which I think is really cool
that I wanted to show you

00:05:50.143 --> 00:05:52.070
because you are the rock and roll

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.846
and this is the rock and roll wine.

00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:55.123
- Yeah, clearly, and look how cute

00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:57.202
this label is if you can see it.

00:05:57.202 --> 00:06:00.290
It's a vinyl record, Mat
Kearney High Fidelity.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.171
I mean it's adorable for a rock person,

00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:04.794
especially you come
across this on the shelf.

00:06:04.794 --> 00:06:05.781
I'm gonna go right to it.

00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:06.699
So we're gonna do this next time?

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.976
- I don't know, are you
guys up for the challenge

00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:08.809
to do it again?

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:09.642
- Do it!

00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:10.654
- We'll do the rock and roll.

00:06:10.654 --> 00:06:11.815
Oh wait, look at her!

00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:13.254
Maybe I'll call Ian and see

00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:15.300
if we can get you your own bottle.
