00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.680
Hi.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Joshua from Greater than Gatsby.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.350
Today, I’m highlighting our Clean Workflow
Set.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.130
Now, this set is designed to give your images
that clean, crisp, natural polished look.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.370
This set contains mostly Workflow Tools, but
there is some really innovative tools in here

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.830
that can help you out.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.370
Now one of the biggest problems for those
of us who shoot natural light, in between

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.520
1.2 and 2.8 Aperture, if you zoom in you can
see that this image contains chromatic aberrations

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.480
or this purple line around the pillow.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.000
Normally, you get a magenta cast or you get
a green cast.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.960
So I’ve designed an Action to help correct
this problem.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.270
So let’s zoom back out and we’ll select
the Chromatic Aberration Remover.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.010
Now as you can see on here, there is a lot
of really bright greens and bright magentas.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.579
But what we’re concerned with are the ones
that are out of place.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.500
You can see along this ridge right here.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.590
I’ll zoom back in.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.360
You see that spot we were just looking, it
highlights where they are.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.720
So I’ll zoom back out and we want to select
this Black Layer Mask.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.960
Make sure a foreground color is set to White.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.100
Select our brush tool.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.880
Make sure it’s at 100% and I’m just going
to go through and I’m going to wipe these

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.040
off everywhere that there is the green or
the magenta that’s out of place.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.310
I’m just going to wipe it off.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.720
There’s some in her hair, along the sleeves
there is some greens.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.759
Wipe it off the blanket.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.500
All right.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.111
So once you’re done wiping it off, you want
to uncheck the layer that says ‘Turn This

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:56.079
Layer Off’ and we can go ahead and flatten
our image.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:04.500
Now if you zoom back in, those chromatic aberrations
are gone.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.509
So next let’s move on to a foundation Action.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.249
I will come up here and I will run Subtle
Edit Color Base.

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:15.559
You can see that it cleaned the image up a
little bit without overdoing it.

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.059
We’ve got a few Workflow enhancements.

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:24.019
I’ll select ‘Clean Soft Color’ and once
this plays, I’ll reduce the opacity because

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.040
it’s set to 80%.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.180
We’ll probably want to use it closer to
18.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.989
Now that brought out the reds in her hair
because it will bring out the truer color

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.269
and so now I’m going to come down and I’m
going to wipe the red off.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.069
So let’s select ‘Shed the Red’ and this
has got a Black Layer Mask.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.730
So I want to set my brush color to White.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.169
We’ll bring the brush itself down to about
50% and I’m just going to brush some of

00:02:52.169 --> 00:03:01.980
the reds out of her hair.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.560
Now that was just a few Actions.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:14.419
This set contains 65 Actions, but we’ll
go ahead and show you the Before and After.

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.700
Now the Before and After is not as drastic
as some of the other images that you might

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.239
see on our website, but like I said, this
is for someone who really wants that clean,

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.010
natural look.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.849
Thanks for checking out our tutorial video.
