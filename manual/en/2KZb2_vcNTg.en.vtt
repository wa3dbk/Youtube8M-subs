00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.400
Trees are some of the 
biggest organisms on the planet,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.360
but where do they get that matter to grow?

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.440
Man: Rich nutrients out the ground.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.800
Man: Start with soil or in the air.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.669
Man: Goodness out of the soil, I suppose.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.900
Derek Muller: Comes out of the soil?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.060
Man: Yeah...

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.340
Derek Muller: Yeah...

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.460
Derek Muller: Goodness.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.070
Man: Goodness.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.850
Derek Muller: Why isn't there a big hole 
around the tree where it's taking out all the soil?

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.850
Man (right): 'Cause it does it so 
gradually that the soil is time to recover.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.660
Derek Muller: Now, I think it's intuitive to believe

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.099
that the tree gets most of its mass from the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.120
soil because you can see those roots
digging into the soil and they must be

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.219
taking something out of there and I mean
a tree looks like dirt and it feels

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.420
solid like dirt

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.180
but it's not.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.340
In the early 1600 a scientist 
named Johann Baptist Van Helmholt

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.340
tried to figure out where the mass
of a tree was coming from

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.320
so he got a pot of soil and very carefully 
measured the amount of soil in there.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.120
Then he planted the tree and  
took care of it for five years

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.040
making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot .

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.860
At the end of this experiment

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.800
he was weighted the tree 
to find that it was 72 kilograms

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.860
but the massive soil had
only decreased by about 60 grams.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.760
This was pretty strong evidence that the
mass of the tree does not come from the soil.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.560
I've never thought about that actually
because they don't really eat anything, trees.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.940
They don't eat anything?
--No.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.820
They don't eat anything?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.120
Water, it's all basically absorbed.
--That's all they eat?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.740
Yeah.
--They don't eat anything else?

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.720
No.
--That's all they eat.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.600
Well presumably from the water 
and the nutrients from the soil.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.760
Is there anything else that you need 
besides the soil and the water?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.480
I suppose that's all you need, isn't it?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.100
To make--
--Other than the original seed

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.880
for that particular tree, I suppose.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.720
The seed, the soil, and the water and
that makes this big tree.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.540
Derek Muller: Of course Johann Baptist Van Helmholt
did conclude that the tree was made entirely of water.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.220
Now while that's not correct 
at least he was on the right track

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.500
realizing that the matter of a tree 
doesn't  come out of the soil.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500
The sun energy, yeah.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.100
The sun energy?
--Yeah.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.300
Are they converting energy into mass or--?

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.180
Do you know what I mean?
--Yeah.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.420
Like that there wasn't stuff and then  there was.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.860
Where did that stuff come from?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.380
Magic.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.960
[laughing]
I have no idea.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.440
My question is where do they 
get that mass to grow big?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.580
Sun.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.460
Get it from the rain and the sun presuably.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.960
Light.
--Sunlight.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.320
The sunshine.
The sunshine?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440
Does the sunshine add mass to the tree?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.440
It would need sunshine to grow.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.160
Yes, they wouldn't grow without it.
I don't know whether it adds mass,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.760
but they wouldn't go without it.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.459
Of course the sun's energy is needed for
the tree to build the matter into its

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.440
branches and leaves but the Sun itself
the energy is not matter.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.560
Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.820
There's got to be something, you know.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.120
What is it about the air?
--A gas in the air that it needs as well.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.020
Oxygen.
The trees need the oxygen?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.020
And I guess oxygen.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.860
The oxygen, of course.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.940
The oxygen?

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.940
Are there any ingredients that we're missing?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.100
Carbon dioxide.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.040
Would it surprise you to find out that 95% 
of a tree is actually from carbon dioxide.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.020
Trees are largely made up of air.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.160
Yeah.
--Surprising.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.380
I need this reaction like, "Oh holy sh--

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.200
[laughing]

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.020
So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.300
out of the carbon dioxide that they take in.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.740
What's interesting is that we breathe
out carbon dioxide and water

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.760
that's how we lose mass

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.680
but it's the exact same substances
 that trees breathe in to gain mass.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.240
So if you can imagine a closed system 
where it's just you and a tree.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.440
You would breathe out that carbon
dioxide and water the tree would take it in.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.180
So you would get smaller 
while the tree is getting bigger

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.800
and in a sense you're becoming the tree.
