00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.520
Hello, I’m Jonah with Magnanimous Media, and today I’m going to be talking about the C300

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.210
setup with the Redrock Shoulder and Matte Box Bundle. As with any light camera

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.930
system, the C300 can benefit from added weight

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.130
and support provided by the Redrock Shoulder Rig. While the C300 was designed to be light and maneuverable,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.430
direct pans on the lens controls can create unwanted jitter,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.250
which follow focus systems eliminate. In addition to that,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.239
it can certainly benefit from peripheral support provided by the Redrock

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.379
system. While the C300’s built-in ND

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.019
is a great benefit, it comes in 2, 4, and 6-stop intervals,

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.559
which does not lend itself to fine-tuning. A matte box is a great addition if you’re

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.460
looking to fine-tune your image control,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.809
and if you want to use specialized filters, such as graduated ND,

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.570
IR filters, and circular polarizers. Redrock does make

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.040
a C300-dedicated cage and support system.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.909
However, one of the benefits of adapting an existing system to this camera

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.900
is that you’ll be more versatile and be able to use more cameras with one system.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.100
With the C300, a lot of times

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.359
the F3 and the SCARLET is brought in to either work alongside

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.810
or in replacement of the C300, depending on the conditions of the shoot. And

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
having one support system that can fit all of those cameras can save you a lot of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.259
time and money on set. The primary reason why we need to adapt

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.939
this system from its typical system is that, because of the way the C300 is designed,

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.039
the lens—the center of the lens will not line up with

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.679
the center of the matte box. If you’re only using the shoulder support system,

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.099
this will work with the typical setup and the lens will be right at the right point

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.440
for your follow focus to hit it. In addition to the included items with the Redrock

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.799
Shoulder bundle or Matte Box bundle, the C300 adaptation

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.450
will include: a quick-release micro riser and/or micro-clamp shim kit,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.880
and 4”, 6”, or 9” 15mm iris rods.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.039
So the first thing we’re going to do is determine what kind of setup we want with the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.550
camera. There are essentially three different setups,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.610
and each have their own benefits and drawbacks. The central camera setup is ideal

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.780
for situations that are almost entirely

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.400
handheld. It allows for better weight distribution and less modification

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.659
when operating handheld. You can still attach a system to a tripod, but the camera will

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.620
sit much higher than a typical setup,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.049
which will require a more substantial head, and affects the look of tilts.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.739
The camera forward setup is great for situations that require quick transitions

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.080
from tripod the handheld

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.580
while retaining a system with typical functionality when tripod-borne.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.200
he drawback of this setup is it puts more weight on the front of the system,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.049
requiring greater counterweight to balance the handheld system. The camera

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.599
back setup is ideal for using long glass,

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.080
and provides a setup with centralized distribution and minimal weight.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.880
This setup is best for long shoots that are primarily handheld with long glass, such as sporting events.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.990
We’ll start with the central camera setup; for that setup, we’ll be attaching the 15mm low-riser

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.239
to the shoulder unit. Start by aligning the 15mm low-riser base plate

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.470
with the shoulder unit. First, thread in the 1/4” bolt

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.930
and allow it to go through the first set of threads, but do not begin threading into

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.670
the second. Thread in but do not tighten the 3/8” bolt.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.470
Thread the 1/4” bolt into the second set of threads, and then tighten.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.110
Tighten the 3/8” bolt next. Insert the 15mm rods into the shoulder

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.819
support, and attach the hand grips.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.950
Once the camera and lens are attached, you can adjust the hand grips to the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.189
desired position. Depending on how much space you have for the counterweight, you may

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.840
need to change the position of the micro clamp on the cheese block

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.040
so that the weight can be attached. Use an Allen key to remove the weights from the

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.379
cheese block. Remove the micro clamp from the adjustment bracket,

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.390
and use shorter bolts to attach the micro clamp to the cheese block.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.050
You can then attach the weight. The other benefit to reconfiguring your weights in this manner

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.250
is that it allows you to utilize less rod space for the weights,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.650
so you have more rod space to the front. It also allows you to kick more weight towards

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.819
the back, which allows you to better compensate for more weight on

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.109
the front. You’re now ready to attach the matte box and follow focus.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.669
Attach the quick release riser to the lower set of rods, and insert the desired 15mm rods,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.050
and place them so that they sit just behind the end of the lens.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.790
The length of the desired rods should be no longer than the length of the lens.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.690
Attach the follow focus to the riser. With the riser in place, you can now

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.810
attach the matte box

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.890
and align it to the lens. With this setup,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.250
the lower rods allow for perfect positioning of the matte box and the follow focus.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.320
If you’re using a lens that has quite a bit more space

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.080
between the front of the lens and your focus ring,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.560
you could utilize the rods coming from the high-riser.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.110
However, if you put the riser on the rods

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.910
coming from the low-riser, your matte box will be too high to be well-positioned

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.480
for the center of the lens,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.800
and your follow focus won’t actually have any room to attach.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.880
Both the camera forward and camera back setups will start with similar construction.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.060
Use the Allen wrench to remove the spacer from the 15mm low-riser.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.690
Insert the shims, and replace the spacer and base plate.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.490
Once the shims are in place, assemble the system using the longest set of rods

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.090
and the 15mm low-riser. Attach the shoulder unit and hand grips.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.200
Attach the quick-release riser with the desired length rods, and attach the follow focus and

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.080
matte box. The camera back setup is accomplished by simply placing the 15mm

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.680
low-riser behind the shoulder unit on the rods through the 15mm low-riser.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.930
Now, if you’re only using the matte box and you’re not using the shoulder rig,

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.630
what you can do is use these shims to actually raise the level of the clamp.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.010
Now, if you raise the level of the clamp, you’re going to have to have a variety of rod lengths

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.330
to accommodate the different length of lens that you are using,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.640
because the rods will actually bottom out on the camera, so you won’t have that room to

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.100
adjust the positioning of the matte box, which is going to make

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.220
lens changes a lot more complicated.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.680
So those are some of the setups we suggest for the C300 on the Redrock

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.020
rig with the Redrock matte box.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.530
Knowing how to set this system up right for your uses

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.680
is going to give you more versatility on the set, quicker lens changes,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.940
and a mother production overall. For more videos and news, follow us on magnanimous.biz.
