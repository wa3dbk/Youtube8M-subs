Hi, this Alise McMahon for Expert Village.com
and in this video series we are talking about

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.160
dog toys. If you would like to find out more
about my services, you can visit my website

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.551
at www.canineheadstart.com. So we are talking
about different types of toys here and in

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:31.410
this short video clip we are going to be talking
about flying toys. Toys that you can fling

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.340
out in the air and the dogs can go and chase.
People love playing Frisbee, we love chucking

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.989
things, picking them up and throwing them
back and forth. Dogs enjoy it too. So I just

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.340
want to give you an example of different types
of toys that are great for flying, having

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.300
your dog chase them. Here is a rather small
one and it comes in various sizes and various

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.830
colors. It is a fairly sturdy plastic, its
soft enough that it is not going to hurt your

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.170
dog. It is fairly flexible and it is a great
thing to just fly across the lawn. It’s

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.390
a nice shape, nice size and the dog can pick
it up fairly easily. This is another type

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.549
of flying toy. It’s a soft plush toy. It’s
stuffed on the outside and its got cloth on

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.580
the inside and it also has a squeaker on the
inside so it is an added benefit for the dog.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.130
Dog again, dogs love things that squeak. Another
kind of plush flying toy is chuckamonkey.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.429
You can find Chuckamonkey or Chuckaduck. This
has a plush monkey on the inside, a squeaker,

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.159
a rattle and then the rope toy. This toy is
great for the dogs to hold onto to retrieve

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.219
for you and a lot of fun to be playing with
the dog in the backyard with the Chuckamonkey.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:55.219
Another type of flying toy is a soft, softer
than this hard rubber, is a soft latex rubber.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:02.289
It’s got a fairly significant squeaker in
it and you can throw that for the dog and

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.429
again, it is soft enough, it’s viable enough,
the dogs really enjoy chewing on it when they

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.149
are bringing it back, they can throw it up
in the air by themselves, they can catch it

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.220
and it’s not going to hurt them. This is
a great toy for dogs to play with and this

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.120
toy comes in different sizes and different
colors as well.
