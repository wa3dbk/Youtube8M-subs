Downtown Knoxville's streets and economy may be getting a boost thanks to a free iPhone application developed by University of Tennessee researcher Eric Ogle

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and Associate Professor of Art Sarah Lowe in collaboration with three local nonprofits. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Called the Beck Tour app, the mobile phone application features 14 historically and culturally significant sites in and around downtown Knoxville. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Via a map of downtown, users can read narratives, view photos and even watch short videos 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
created by actors at the Carpetbag Theater. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's the first of its kind. Looking at the App Store, there is nothing like it anywhere. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.333
It's a novel idea from that regard 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:01.000
being able to take community-generated content and present that in a tourism point of view

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it is definitely a new concept.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The app traces the history of African-American culture in Knoxville. It is called the Beck Tour after one of the app's partners,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the Beck Cultural Exchange Center, which preserves and exhibits African-American culture. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
African-Americans played an important part of the development of Knoxville from slavery 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
all the way to civil rights. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Some of the pivotal moments of the civil rights story happened in Knoxville. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
For instance, the Tennessee Theatre had segregated entrances and was the site of peaceful protests.  

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
A story that is in the Beck app tells the story of how black entertainers could go and entertain at the Tennessee Theatre but had they been a guest, they couldn't go and see themselves. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
While the Beck Tour may be the first of its kind, it won't be the last. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The developers plan for the Beck Tour to serve as a framework 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
for other tours such as the Cradle of Country music tour 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We also hope it's an economic development tool that businesses can really benefit from 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because the goal is to get people to come to downtown and stay as long as possible

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Another hope for this technology and tourism crossroad is a boost to community pride.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.133
of some of the sites and a lot of the good things that have happened in Knoxville's history.
