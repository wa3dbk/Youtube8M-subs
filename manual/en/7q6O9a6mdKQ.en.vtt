00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.699
OK everyone, here we are with

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:11.849
Bombshells.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.920
Absolutely stunning looking 3D game.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.890
Basically you are a female pilot of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.979
a really kickass plane.

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:25.330
You have missiles,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.999
you have guns and you have to 
complete the missions.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.599
So because  I'm

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.570
heading for that target.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.270
It reminds me an awful lot of the 
Wing Commander series.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.390
I don't know if you ever played this.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.290
The Wing Commander game's very similar.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.080
The way that you speed your plane up

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.960
and they can go into very tight 
steep banks

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.310
kind of position myself behind the
target etcetera.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.450
Get a kill.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.440
Lot's of really cool dogfighting
kind of stuff going on

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.030
That I really really love.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.090
This is one of those titles where you're
kind of going to go, 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.860
hello friends, check out what 
my Samsung Galaxy S3 can do.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.830
The frame rate does dip and drop
every so often but 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.210
I think it really just needs a bit of
optimisation really, a bit of extra

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.100
optimisation.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.170
You can see, most of the time the frame 
rate is really solid.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.979
It does have it's odd moments

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.500
where it  will judder out a little bit

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.500
especially when there's a lot of action
going on on the screen.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.430
Free to play game,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.720
so it's not going to cost you anything to
download but it uses the standard in app

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.720
purchase stuff that's become so 
popular these days.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.770
A really really

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.100
fun game and quite compelling as well.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.570
You can upgrade your ship.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.250
your plane, should I say,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.189
get better guns, missiles power-ups
etcetera all of the cool things that

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.929
people want from a free to play
game I suppose.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.919
But more importantly, the graphics
are just gorgeous.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.919
Speed up.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.589
Think you are going to be hard pressed
to find a better

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:25.239
action flight game on the android
platform, or on any platform.

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.819
If you're looking for something
to do this weekend

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.819
you can do far worse than
grabbing this game.

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:49.919
You can see the frame rate's really

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.439
dipped out a little bit there

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.699
because there's a lot of action
going on on the screen. I've noticed that
a few times unfortunately.

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:04.699
Like I say, a bit of optimisation 
for the S3 and we'll be talking about a
very solid bit of game play.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:22.189
It would be nice to have a 
proper damage model but...

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.369
And that is Bombshells,

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:29.469
well worth downloading now on
Google Play Store.
