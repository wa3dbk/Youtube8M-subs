00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.279
Fishermen off the coast of Japan hauled in
a rare megamouth shark recently, marking the

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.680
58th time in history one of its kind were
seen or caught by man, Japanese news outlets

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.240
reported. The Japan Daily Press reported Thursday
that scientists performed an autopsy on the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.200
1,500-pound female shark in front of onlookers
at the Marine Science Museum in Shizuoka City.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.870
The shark was reportedly caught from a depth
of about 2,600 feet. It's unclear precisely

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.500
when it was nabbed, according to the report.
The first megamouth was discovered in Hawaii

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.350
in 1976, prompting scientists to create an
entirely new family and genus of sharks. The

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.129
megamouths are docile filter-feeders with
wide, blubbery mouths. Others megamouths â€” considered

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.859
one of the rarest fish in the world â€” have
been encountered in California, Japan, Taiwan,

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:03.981
Indonesia, Brazil, Ecuador, Senegal, South
Africa, Mexico and Australia. It's known to

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:10.040
inhabit the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans,
according to the Florida Museum of Natural

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.880
History. "As with the two other filter-feeding
sharks, the basking and whale sharks, this

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.790
species is wide-ranging," according to a profile
of the animal on the museum's website. "However,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.280
the megamouth is considered to be less active
and a poorer swimmer than the basking or whale

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.860
sharks." The megamouth primarily feeds on
large quantities of krill and its maximum

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:41.630
size is at least 17 feet long. The sperm whale
is its only known predator, researchers say.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.170
In 2009, fishermen in the Philippines accidentally
caught and later ate a megamouth shark. The

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.360
1,100-pound, 13-foot megamouth died while
struggling in the fishermen's net off Burias

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.850
island in the central Philippines. It was
taken to nearby Donsol in Sorsogon province,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.420
where it was butchered and eaten.
