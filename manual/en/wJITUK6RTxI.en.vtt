00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:07.859
[Music]

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.500
Americans enjoy hunting both of their hog
varieties.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.960
There are the wild boar, known as the ridgeback,
and the wild pigs, domesticated breeds, gone

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960
feral.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.840
The wild boar grow to around 300lb and have
a reputation for being aggressive.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.960
The feral pigs are much, much bigger.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.140
Later on we will be going out for some feral
hogs, we’ve got some property on Bayou Portage

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.480
been rife with them lately and we’ll see
if we can see a few of those and try and call

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.800
in a couple of coyotes.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.290
We need to walk through the swamp to a high
seat next to a wallow.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.040
First, I'm given my cowboy-style rifle.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.680
It's a lever-action Marlin 30-30, one of the
guns that won the West.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.960
Pretty standard American lever action, loads
in here, lever here so, just cowboy style,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.829
to load it lever out, lever in it’s loaded.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.800
Hammer’s back ok.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.950
It’s ready to go, pop that back it’s the
safety.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.860
John's is less cowboy, more militia.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.570
It's a modern version of the SKS, a forerunner
to Mikhail Kalashnikov's AK47: ideal for pigs,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.960
especially decadent American capitalist running-dog
scum pigs.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.250
Semi auto absolutely, fully autos, I don’t
like Swiss pigs.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.210
With a slightly sicky feeling that keilers
are hiding behind every tree, we head off.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.360
John says that the pigs are not scared by
the torch beam - they can even be attracted

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.910
by it - though their senses of smell and hearing
are excellent.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.810
You’ll find a lot of times tracks along
side these sluice where they have come into

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.000
wallow, or water and often times if you check
the clarity of the water you can tell how

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.720
lately they have been in.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.689
If it is very, very cloudy they have been
in wallowing cooling down from the hot sun

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.720
recently.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.509
This water looks fairly clear.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.409
So that’s why we are whispering?

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.590
Yes, so I’m imagining they haven’t been
through here for a bit so we’ll check another

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.200
couple of wallows and try and spot some tracks
off them.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.830
A few hundred yards in and if we get the unmistakable
whiff of pig pee.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.550
John has been putting some old burger buns
down and we can see they have been to this

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.230
boggy Burger King.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.270
Suddenly, there's a lot of noise and something
is coming towards us, fast.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.640
It’s moving really fast to be an armadillo.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.560
Both of us chamber around and raise our rifles.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.230
I feel a wave of immense relief tinged with
disappointment when an armadillo breaks cover.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.220
So we just gave up on the hamburger stall
for the pigs that are out here and then John

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.800
slammed off the light and we could hear rustling
in the bushes and your heart starts racing

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.819
and thank goodness it’s an armadillo.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.050
I really thought we would be in touch with
a pig there but quite relieved we’re not.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.760
Pah - armadillo shmarmadillo - good job there
isn't anything really terrifying out there.....?

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.750
America has big pigs.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.310
Really big pigs.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.590
And not all of them are called Bubba.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.190
Here is one shot with a handgun by an 11-year-old
lad in Alabama.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.690
A US record, it weighed more than 1,000lb.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.569
I am six feet four inches and can be easily
impressed by a 5lb armadillo.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.930
Imagine how the kid felt.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.440
John and I stalk through the swamp, which
has a gumbo-like consistency.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.130
Gumbo is a local stew that tastes exactly
like it sounds.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.650
Soon we reach an old duck hide, or 'blind'
in American.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.010
So we’ve got a good 150 yards of visibility
to take a shot on them and as soon as we see

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.489
them break those bushes we’ll hold off,
give them a little time to get as close in

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.769
front of us as we can, just stay trained on
them the whole time, keep our scopes on them

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.640
and as soon as they get close enough and we’re
comfortable taking that shot we’ll put lights

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.550
on them and fire away and see what we’ve
got.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.359
We sit and wait, and we wait, then John reckons
its time to go and see the boar face to face

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.189
After the little scare earlier on, the approaching
armadillo, John thinks it’s a good idea

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:31.210
that we go after them on foot.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.210
Brilliant.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.219
Another wild pig hamburger joint, but this
one looks undisturbed.

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.569
John reckons we will have to put tonight down
as unlucky.

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.879
So we got to the end point, feeling a bit
defeated by duck, bit beaten by boar, they

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.389
haven’t touched the bate, but you cannot
beat the excitement of stalking up on something

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.550
that could easily be stalking up on you.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.759
It’s not a lion or a tiger, it’s a pig,
but it’s a great big thing in a very dark

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.379
wood and it’s absolutely brilliant.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.189
Above all, this part of the United States
is truly gorgeous.

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:14.740
