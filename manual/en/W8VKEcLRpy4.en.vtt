00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.210
he lives here in Louisville and I want to give a big warm welcome to

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.459
mister James Ferguson

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.500
by a round of applause, we have any campers in the building?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.500
look at the black people trying to raise their hands.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.789
No, I mean like real camping, like with your white friends.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.430
because when white people and black people go camping

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.760
they go camping totally different. White people only bring a tent.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.420
black people take generators, stereo systems,
movie projectors

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.329
man when I went camping with my black friends, we was

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.720
eating chicken and watching movies, like we was at a drive in.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.690
wasn't like that when I went camping with my white friends.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.909
when I went camping with my white friends, I felt like I was on that show naked and afraid

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.239
ever see that show?

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.970
they got white people running around butt naked.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.200
never going to see a brother on that show.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.590
But, when I went camping with my white friends,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.960
they didn't even pack no food.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.009
I asked my friend trevor, "What are we going to eat?"

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.990
Trevor looked at me and said, "Welp, I got my riffle with me."

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.130
So whatever we kill, that's what we're going to eat.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.920
Kill? You ain't got no KFC around the corner or nothin?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.190
You won't find no brothers who know how to hunt.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.830
We may do a little fishing, but you won't catch us hunting no dear.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.370
Now my freind trevor was a pro. He had fatigue gear, face paint.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.030
I didn't know what it was for, I just put mine on like Ray Lewis

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.010
Now, when it came time to hunt

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.950
It was me, trevor, and trevor's dad.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.490
trevor and his dad, they both had hunting rifles. I thought

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.850
we was going to stop at KFC on the way.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.000
So I didn't bring no gun.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.940
Now, don't own a hunting rifle or anything,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.319
but I could have at least brought my .22 for protection

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.920
They wanna give me a pocket knife.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.560
I didn't feel safe, I'm not going to lie

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.859
Me and trevor were cool, but I didn't know his dad like that.

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.980
So, I did the only thing I could do at the time that was safe.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.930
I posted a facebook status.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.499
And it read, going hunting with trevor and his dad. They both have guns.

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:48.889
I don't

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:55.889
If you don't hear back from me in 20 minutes, call the authorities. Post.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.139
But the more I hunted the safer I felt.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.719
20 minutes into the hunt, and trevors dad already saved my life.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.930
scared me first, but he saved my life.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.879
All I heard was him say "don't you take one more step.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.340
I panicked, I was like Oh Lord.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.059
They really do eat black man soup.

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:32.849
I yelled back at him, I'm like, Hey! I got over 1500 facebook friends.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.359
And they all know where I'm at, You'll never get away with this!

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.129
Get away with what? You almost got bitten by that snake.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:48.129
J. Ferg, that's my time.

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:55.470
happy birthday momma!
