00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
[Intro]

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.560
Michael: Get off the fucking car jerkoff! MOVE!

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.920
Am I- Who am I? Am I Will Smith, or am I Tommy Lee Jones?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.020
Like, you can take cover, but you can only strafe from left to right.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.880
You can't fucking move forward or backwards.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.180
That... fucking sucks wee-wees.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.820
Also this game looks like shit.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.500
[Imitating gun sounds]

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.480
You want to not have my character take up 97% of the screen when I zoom in?

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.880
How many fucking things are there?!

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.600
I fucking wiped out an entire race so far!

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.360
There were not this many aliens in all three Men In Black movies combined.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.200
Is it over yet?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.240
Is it over yet?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.560
Is it fucking over yet?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.220
This is fucking wonderful.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.580
Now I'm flying in this car.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.400
You control the fucking car with the right analog stick,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.140
BUT you also control the fucking crosshair with the right analog stick!

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.480
What the fuck is the left analog stick for?!

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.240
It doesn't do anything! It literally does nothing!

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.680
So no one notices the fucking flying cars and all the 8 million aliens

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.080
flying over the fucking city shooting each other,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.820
but HOLY SHIT, if you shoot a street light, they are gonna be on you like fucking Columbo.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.180
Fuck me.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.540
YES! Start over!

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.400
If I die, why would you fucking start the default on 'no'?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.580
Yes I want to fucking replay the part I just died!

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.680
No, I died, fucking turn my game off and light my XBox on fire.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.780
I never want to play it again.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.080
Ah, fuck, I missed the notoriety thing!

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.800
They're gonna see all the broken street lights.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.580
FUCK THEY'RE ONTO ME!!

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.820
FUCKING cheese it!! The cops are on their way!!

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.300
That was a diner, apparently, we just passed.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.140
That huge office-like complex, that was a fucking diner.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.900
There's another one! That's the exact same diner!

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.480
And I'm pretty sure that's been the se- oh, there's more

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.840
There's two- three!

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.580
FOUR!

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.660
There's four buildings that teach dance on the same street?!

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.300
I thought McDonalds and Burger King was some competition.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.980
Look at all these diners!

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.720
There's just nothing but dancing and diners!

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.440
That's the whole god damn city!

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.640
Where do I go if I want to buy food? Where the fuck is the grocery store?!

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.400
Men In Black: Alien Crisis

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.480
The crisis is this game, and the fact that it fucking EXISTS!

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.360
Please stand by for the worst fucking dialogue ever!

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.000
There's a guy, and then there's a fucking dog.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.080
And then there's a fucking guy and a lady, and there's a question, and there's a guy.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.500
Back to the dog, back to the guy.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.540
Back to the dog!

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.060
Back to the guy and lady. Another question.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.560
Guy!

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.200
Lady!

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.900
Guy!

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.400
Dog!

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.040
Guy and lady!

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.080
Guy in handcuffs!

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.580
Dog!

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.660
Lady! Guy! Dog! Dog! Lady! Guy!

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.560
More fucking loading screens!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560
I know what the fucking planet looks like!

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.880
I've gone through every tip in the game a hundred times!

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880
Now it's like Splinter Cell, I'm being sneaky.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.200
No, NOT SNEAKY ENOUGH!!

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.680
No, no, no! Shoot it you fucking prick!

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.120
What are you doing?!

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.960
I don't-- I don't fucking give a shit.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.780
[Outro music]
