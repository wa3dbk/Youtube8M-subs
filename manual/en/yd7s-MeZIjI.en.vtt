Hey Youtube World! It's me - Evelyn's Napps.
And as you can tell, I'm in dire need of a

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.400
color touch up. Back in April, I dyed my hair
with the Shea Moisture Hair Color System in

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.510
Bright Auburn, and my roots have in fact grown
out. I like the system because it didn't dry

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.949
my hair out or change my hair texture, no
porosity issues at all. I will say that my

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.269
hair is more of a true brown than a bright
auburn. That was the first time dyeing my

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.230
natural hair - dyeing my hair period, whether
by myself or by a salon. But I thought I'd

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.640
give it another try and share the results
with you. In my experience this hair color

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.690
doesn't bleed too much. It took about three
washes for me to stop seeing color in the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.690
water -- even after I rinse clear when I initially
dyed my hair, it did bleed for a couple washes

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.180
after that. And I do use sulfate free shampoos.
As you can see, I'm trying to get it on my

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.489
roots. People talked about "hot roots" but
my roots just don't lift, so I'm putting it

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.310
on my scalp and we'll see how it goes. So
that's what the color looks like when the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.740
dye's still in my hair. It's really bright
red. And I really should have put some sort

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.189
of Vaseline concoction on my forehead but
I forgot. And in 30 minutes the color does

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.340
oxidize and become useless and I find it really
hard to actually do my hair properly in 30

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.810
minutes. I didn't shampoo my hair, I just
deep conditioned with Soultanicals. Hit my

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.090
beauty guru pose!! In case you don't know
what it looks like to have a towel on your

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.610
head, let me show you five different angles
**sarcasm** And then I assess the situation!

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.610
Again, my hair is soft, bouncy, not dry, not
crispity. The color seems vibrant inside,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.790
but outside, right after I could tell that
I didn't get my roots!!! Dude, I didn't get

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.350
them roots. I don't know what I gotta do -- leave
it in for 75 hours?? But that's the next day,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.070
and my hair is a bright red -- it's actually
red not brown which is what I was going for.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.750
As you can see my roots are still dark. They're
still like a dark burgundy. I don't know what

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.280
do to about that. And my roots (baby hairs)
is hot -- that's my scalp that's red because

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.140
I put it directly on my scalp. Next time I
want all-over color, I'll definitely go to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.330
a professional. Thirty minutes just isn't
long enough for me, a novice, to make sure

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.030
this mixture gets on every crevice and coil
of my natural hair texture. Our hair isn't

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.030
flat, so to put this mixture on properly in
my opinion takes way longer than thirty minutes.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.600
So overall, I would recommend the SheaMoisture
Hair Color System just because it doesn't

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.620
leave your hair feeling like straw and I didn't
have any issues with dryness or changes in

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.230
porosity. What color should I go next? Let
me know in the comments. I'll see you on the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.250
Internet somewhere - bye!
