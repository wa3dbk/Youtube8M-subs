The E-Teacher Scholarship Program

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.809
The E-Teacher Professional  development
workshop

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.390
is actually a part of a larger program
called the E-Teacher Scholarship

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.329
Program. Actually the E-Teacher Scholarship Program began 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.600
In September 1, 2009

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.280
and UMBC

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.200
has been working in consortium  with the
University of Oregon to provide

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.600
seven different online professional
development workshops.  Five hundred

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.440
teachers within this past academic year

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.659
were able to take courses 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.519
in order to improve

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.590
the teaching practices of English
around the world.
English is a global language now

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.090
and it is used internationally not just
for people from other countries to

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.719
speak to Americans

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.090
but also for people from other countries to
speak to each other.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.729
It is really also the language of 
Science,  technology, and diplomacy and so 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.489
countries around the world

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.970
are really emphasizing English-language
instruction in their education system.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.080
Through the US Department of State’s
Office of English Language Programs 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.970
UMBC and University of Oregon  are really
proud to be able to give scholarships to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.560
deserving English teaching professionals
around the world to be able to improve

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.390
their teaching skills and also to be
able to improve their ability

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.810
to act as teacher leaders in their
countries.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.820
When these twenty six teacher leaders
come to UMBC’s campus they

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.159
actually develop projects in order to
provide effective teacher training to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.580
other teachers so for example a teacher
in El Salvador developed a program to be

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.650
able to train high school English
teachers how to give the most innovative

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.390
and communicative English teaching
practices

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.130
to hundreds of teachers in El Salvador.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.040
These are the types of things that can
help this one teacher spread the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.579
information

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:13.829
to hundreds of teachers. The US Department
of State is providing a wonderful way to

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.790
share information and if we can help these 
teacher leaders share that information

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.140
with many others

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.459
then we really have a chance to improve
English language teaching

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.849
around the world.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.210
These twenty six teachers I think
came to UMBC,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.729
they learned a lot, they actually had a
lot of fun,

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:35.620
and they went back to their home
countries

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.749
at the end of the summer and were able
to take the projects that they developed

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.659
and be able to work with other teachers
in their countries to improve English

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.189
language teaching around the world.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.450
In the E-teacher Professional Development
Workshop

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.840
we have an academic program as well as a
cultural program.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.540
In the academic program we have set up a
series of workshops with some of the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.699
top leading scholars in the field of
TESOL in the United States. We're trying

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.969
to give them some of the most innovative
best practices that there are in the

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.060
field of TESOL right now, things that
are research based, things that are known

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.859
to work in teaching English as an
international language.

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.480
And the second part

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.450
is that we're trying to provide
excellent models for them. The US

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.069
Department of State

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.359
likes to not only provide best teaching
practices in their programs but also

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.269
provide a cultural component. One of the
ways is that we provide field trips to

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.580
some of the most historic cities in the
United States. Our participants 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.470
went to Baltimore, took a tour of
Washington DC and also Annapolis and 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.749
Philadelphia and New York City.

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:52.199
We actually had a homestay and they
got to see a little bit about

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.219
what lifestyle is like in the United States.

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.729
And finally we provided a Culture
Night experience on their last night here

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:04.729
where all of them had a chance to show
parts about their cultures.

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.619
So in Culture Night they were able to
share songs,

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:12.280
some of them danced, some of them showed
artwork from their country,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.410
and we were able to get a taste of
what we are all like around the world.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.169
So …

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.620
it's an experience that I think no one
will forget,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.759
and I think that's all of the twenty-six
people went back to their countries and

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.860
were able to share a little bit about
 the American culture

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.159
and the cultures from their colleagues 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.100
My stay at UMBC during 
these three weeks 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.199
have been  very
productive, very profitable.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.889
If you look at the program from
the very beginning it has three perspectives

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:42.869
for me:

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:44.090
social,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.639
cultural, educational.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.330
Social perspective, it brought twenty-six
people from twenty-six

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.740
different countries together.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.789
That I could never even think of.

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.139
And twenty six different contexts, all
sitting

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.940
around the same table 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.110
sharing and learning from each other.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.960
I would like to express my deep

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.830
… 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.919
gratitude and to say thank
you to UMBC  people because this

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.490
is a team of enthusiasts. They
are ready to support us, they are

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.789
so flexible, so  professional, they so skillfully 
organize and make us work

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.919
hard.

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.129
Thank you so much!

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.310
It's a great opportunity

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.199
for all of these teaching professionals
to come together and to work together

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.280
and to communicate interculturally in 
order to develop new ways and the most

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.669
innovative ways

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.990
to teach English around the world.
