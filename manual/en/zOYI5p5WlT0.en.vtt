00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:11.586
&gt;&gt; Hey everyone, it's Julianna
from RU Student Life here

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:13.366
with our first ever
awards ceremony.

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:15.506
We're going to award
our favourite eateries

00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:17.226
with our own personal
award the Eggy.

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:19.426
So let's take a tour
across Toronto and stop

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:21.436
at our favourite places
to eat around campus.

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:25.166
Warning to those of you
who are new to Ryerson,

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.616
it can be impossible to
find a place to study inside

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.196
of Ryerson's library and FLC.

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:31.636
But just across the
street is Panera Bread.

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:34.576
For their amazing interior
and delicious food,

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:37.196
the Eggy for study
space goes to Panera Bread.

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:40.346
Nando's Peri-Peri
chicken is a must.

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:43.026
Plus the decor in
here is incredible.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.766
Being just a two second
walk from Ted Rogers,

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.226
we're happy to present Nando's

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:49.776
with the Eggy 
for best take-out.

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.946
Right on the edge of the
village lies Hair of the Dog

00:00:51.986 --> 00:00:53.586
with the best patio
on Church Street.

00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:56.046
Even though they make better
known for their beer selection,

00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:58.126
we've got to give them the Eggy for best nachos.

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.246
Seriously, come try them.

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:03.226
It's always packed in here.

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:06.306
With a big menu full of tasty
Thai cuisine, you're guaranteed

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:07.236
to leave with a stuffed stomach.

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:08.576
But here's a quick tip.

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:13.126
Ask for the Islamic noodles, its
part Salad King's secret menu.

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:15.326
And for the amazing hidden
Pad Thai, the Eggy

00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:18.516
for best hidden menu goes to
Salad King.

00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:21.066
Okay so it's a bit
of a trek compared

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.136
to other campus eateries,

00:01:22.346 --> 00:01:24.366
but W Burger Bar's got a
menu that's worth it.

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:27.266
With over eight different type
of burgers, oozy milkshakes

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:30.426
and enormous onion rings W
Burger Bar gets the Eggy

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:32.236
for best bar by a campus.

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:36.666
Tucked away on Victoria Street,
most Ryerson students don't know

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.846
about the Senator,
but they should.

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:40.806
With freshly squeezed orange
juice, homemade sausage

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.296
and pure maple syrup,

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:46.926
The Senator takes home the Eggy for best hidden gem.

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:48.806
During the school year
there is no better breakfast

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:50.696
than The Ferguson at RU Eats.

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:52.856
