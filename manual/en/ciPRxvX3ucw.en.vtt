00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.700
This video is to instruct end users and
operators on the proper procedure for

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.800
setting face clearance on both the Super
T and the classic T10 pumps.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.600
Once you hydraulically isolate and electrically isolate the pump, you can then begin the procedure.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.500
As you'll see in this video, it
doesn't take a lot of tools to actually

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.600
set face clearance in any of the pumps,
including the T10.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.000
First of all, you must have a feeler gauge or use the existing shims inside the pump.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.200
Second of all, you should have three
additional half-inch by approximately

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.100
inch and a half to two-inch long bolts
for jacking the rotating assembly out of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.000
the volute casing, a ratchet and socket
(three quarter inch socket), and sometimes

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.800
you may need two pry bars to actually pry
the rotating assembly out of the volute.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.100
Now let's get started.  First of all, you
have to loosen the half-inch bolts on

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.800
the rotating assembly on the outside of
the retaining ring.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.400
Once you have the six half-inch bolts loosened on the ring, do not take them out; simply leave them

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.500
loose and then use your three half-inch
bolts and insert them in the jacking

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.000
bolt holes around the ring.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.600
With the six mounting bolts loosened in the ring,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:02.400
you can then begin tightening the jacking
screws, which pushes the rotating

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.200
assembly out away from the casing.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.000
Once each mounting bolt is loosened and
each jacking bolt is inserted, pulling

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.800
the drive ring mounted to the rotating
assembly off of the volute, you can then

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.000
one at a time, and save each shim set on
each bolt as each bolt is removed.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.800
After removing the mounting hardware from the drive ring, remove each one of the three

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.100
jacking bolts and insert that into the
mounting hole in the drive ring adjacent

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.600
to where the mounting hardware was
removed.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.600
Once you've inserted each of the jacking bolts equally spaced in the drive ring,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.600
begin tightening each one of the jacking bolts

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.900
while you rotate the shaft.  At the same time that you tighten

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.600
the jacking bolts, you'll weight the
impeller to touch the wear plate.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.000
Once the impeller touches the wear plate, the clearance

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
between the impeller and the wear plate is zero.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Once you've tightened
the mounting hardware to achieve zero

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
clearance between the impeller and wear
plate, measure the gap between the volute

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.700
and the mounting ring and add the
required face clearance and shims to

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.900
that gap to achieve the proper face
clearance of twenty to twenty-five

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.100
thousandths for the T10.  Once you've
determined the amount of shims required

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.000
to shim the pump, remove the jacking
bolts from the mounting hole position,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.460
returning them back to the jacking hole
in the mounting ring.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.200
Once we've inserted  the jacking bolt into the mounting ring, we can begin tightening the jacking bolt,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.900
pulling the rotating assembly away from
the volute.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.700
Once you've determined the amount of
shims required to fill the space, plus

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.600
the distance between the impeller and
the wear ring, insert them between the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.800
mounting ring and the volute, tightening
the mounting bolt.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.800
Each of the mounting locations will have the same thickness of shims at each mounting location.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.200
After installing each of the mounting hardware, and as a safety precaution, rotate the shim set inward.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.000
Once you tighten each of the mounting locations, rotate the impeller shaft

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.200
to ensure that the
impeller is not contacting the wear plate.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.700
Thanks for watching.  This concludes
the video on setting the face clearance

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.000
for both the classic and the Super T10
trash pump.
