Compilations of old arcade games serve many
purposes. One, they reintroduce the classics

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.750
to a new audience. Two...they illustrate just
how bad I am at video games.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.910
How many times can Derek die in five seconds?
Starting...NOW.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:01:00.519
You know, the whole concept of dying in video
games is just stupid. Listen, if I paid for

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.420
the game, I should be allowed to experience
it. Can you imagine buying a loaf of bread,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.119
only to be told, �Dinner Over?� Before
you even got to eat the damn thing? This whole

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.990
notion is just preposterous.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.690
So is this game�s name. It�s Konami Collector�s
Series: Arcade Advanced.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.470
There�s almost as many words in the name
as titles in the game!

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:35.789
So this game was sent to us by our good friend
Marc from Brooklyn. I was excited to see this

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.830
come in, too. I�m a huge fan of old-school
everything. My general approach to life is...the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.289
older, the better. Games, movies, cartoons,
women�the principle always stands. The only

00:01:48.289 --> 00:02:01.080
problem when it�s applied to video games
is...old games are f*cking hard, as balls.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.560
As you might�ve gathered from the title,
this is a collection for the Game Boy Advance.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.430
Konami released this back in 2002, which was
already 11 years ago. That�s pretty crazy.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.650
Anyway, it comes with six classic Konami arcade
games. Frogger, Scramble, Gyruss, Time Pilot,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.020
some kung fu game I can�t pronounce...and
Rush�n Attack.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.740
And I really like that lineup. You get the
big names like Frogger and Rush�n Attack,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.890
as well as some lesser-known classics. Games
I�d never even heard of, to be honest, like

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.780
Scramble and Gyruss. And Kung Fu McGee. These
are very faithful recreations of the arcade

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.530
originals, too, built from the ground up for
the GBA hardware.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:56.580
Of course, Frogger is probably the headliner.
It�s one of my least favorites in the batch,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.670
but a classic nonetheless. The kung fu game,
on the other hand, is my least favorite. It�s

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.140
just a really weird game. I guess, ostensibly,
it�s about timing. But honestly, I�m not

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.500
even sure. You have an arrow that follows
you around�no idea what it means. Nonetheless,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.880
this was a very early fighting game, and it
shows. This one is more of a novelty than

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.490
a still-playable classic, like the others
in the collection.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.650
Rush�n Attack is as awesome as it ever was.
It�s basically a side-scrolling stabbing

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.110
game, with the Cold War aesthetics so characteristic
of gaming in the 80s. Time Pilot is interesting,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.420
too...it�s a shooter, but it�s not side
scrolling. In fact, it�s everywhere scrolling.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.220
You can fly your plane in 360 degrees and
take down enemy fighters...and it�s freaking

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.630
hard as hell. But my favorite game in this
collection is easily Gyruss. It�s, like...if

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:08.620
you took the classic eighties space shooter,
but gave it a Tempest perspective.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.560
Like most compilations, this one only goes
as far as its included titles. And frankly,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.440
a decade later, having only six games on a
portable compilation feels very dated. But

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.009
in 2002, this was a sweet collection. It doesn�t
save high scores, which sucks, but the games

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.790
are faithfully recreated, there�s some new
content and hidden extras...

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.960
And this time...no quarters required. Or I�d
go broke.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.750
It�s Konami Collector�s Series: Arcade
Advanced.
