00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.660
Good morning, everybody. I just want to take
a few minutes to update the American people

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.410
on the attempted terrorist attack that occurred
on Christmas Day and the steps we're taking

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.469
to ensure the safety and security of the country.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.550
The investigation is ongoing and I spoke again
this morning with Attorney General Eric Holder,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.560
the Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano,
and my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.570
Advisor John Brennan. I asked them to keep
 -- continue monitoring the situation, to

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.829
keep the American people and members of Congress
informed.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:43.690
Here's what we know so far. On Christmas Day,
Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was en route

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.820
from Amsterdam, Netherlands to Detroit. As
the plane made its final approach to Detroit

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.120
Metropolitan Airport, a passenger allegedly
tried to ignite an explosive device on his

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.629
body, setting off a fire.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.859
Thanks to the quick and heroic actions of
passengers and crew, the suspect was immediately

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:09.260
subdued, the fire was put out, and the plane
landed safely. The suspect is now in custody

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.720
and had been charged with attempting to destroy
an aircraft. And a full investigation has

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.390
been launched into this attempted act of terrorism
and we will not rest until we find all who

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.240
were involved and hold them accountable.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.810
This was a serious reminder of the dangers
that we face and the nature of those who threaten

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.110
our homeland. Had the suspect succeeded in
bringing down that plane it could have killed

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.970
nearly 300 passengers and crew, innocent civilians
preparing to celebrate the holidays with their

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.490
families and friends.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.040
The American people should be assured that
we are doing everything in our power to keep

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.530
you and your families safe and secure during
this busy holiday season. Since I was first

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.410
notified of this incident I've ordered the
following actions to be taken to protect the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.610
American people and to secure air travel.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.700
First, I directed that we take immediate steps
to ensure the safety of the traveling public.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.810
We made sure that all flights still in the
air were secure and could land safely. We

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.250
immediately enhanced screening and security
procedures for all flights, domestic and international.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.080
We added federal air marshals to flights entering
and leaving the United States. And we're working

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.340
closely in this country -- federal, state
and local law enforcement -- with our international

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.340
partners.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.420
Second, I've ordered two important reviews
because it's absolutely critical that we learn

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.180
from this incident and take the necessary
measures to prevent future acts of terrorism.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.790
The first review involves our watch list system,
which our government has had in place for

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.810
many years to identify known and suspected
terrorists so that we can prevent their entry

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.920
into the United States.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.400
Apparently the suspect in the Christmas incident
was in the system, but not on a watch list

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.950
such as the so-called no-fly list. So I've
ordered a thorough review not only of how

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.060
information related to the subject was handled,
but of the overall watch list system and how

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.670
it can be strengthened.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.860
The second review will examine all screening
policies, technologies and procedures related

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.880
to air travel. We need to determine just how
the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.030
aboard an aircraft and what additional steps
we can take to thwart future attacks.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.990
Third, I've directed my national security
team to keep up the pressure on those who

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.370
would attack our country. We do not yet have
all the answers about this latest attempt,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.959
but those who would slaughter innocent men,
women and children must know that the United

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.030
States will do more than simply strengthen
our defenses -- we will continue to use every

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.700
element of our national power to disrupt,
to dismantle, and defeat the violent extremists

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:04.120
who threaten us -- whether they are from Afghanistan
or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywhere

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.459
where they are plotting attacks against the
U.S. homeland.

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.130
Finally, the American people should remain
vigilant, but also be confident. Those plotting

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.270
against us seek not only to undermine our
security, but also the open society and the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.450
values that we cherish as Americans. This
incident, like several that have preceded

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.530
it demonstrates that an alert and courageous
citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:38.169
extremist. As a nation we will do everything
in our power to protect our country, as Americans

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.600
we will never give in to fear or division,
we will be guided by our hopes, our unity,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.490
and our deeply held values. That's who we
are as Americans. And that's what our brave

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.240
men and women in uniform are standing up for
as they spend the holidays in harm's way,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.990
and we will continue to do everything that
we can to keep America safe in the New Year

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.750
and beyond.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.250
Before I leave let me also briefly address
the events that have taken place over the

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.250
last few days in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.530
The United States joins with the international
community in strongly condemning the violent

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.060
and unjust suppression of innocent Iranian
citizens, which has apparently resulted in

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.699
detentions, injuries and even death.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.660
For months the Iranian people have sought
nothing more than to exercise their universal

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.320
rights. Each time they have done so they have
been met with the iron fist of brutality,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.160
even on solemn occasions and holy days. And
each time that has happened the world has

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.020
watched with deep admiration for the courage
and the conviction of the Iranian people,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.740
who are a part of Iran's great and enduring
civilization.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.340
What's taking place within Iran is not about
the United States or any other country -- it's

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.680
about the Iranian people and their aspirations
for justice and a better life for themselves.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.370
And the decision of Iran's leaders to govern
through fear and tyranny will not succeed

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.330
in making those aspirations go away. As I
said in Oslo, it's telling when governments

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.130
fear the aspirations of their own people more
than the power of any other nation.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.540
Along with all free nations the United States
stands with those who seek their universal

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.610
rights. We call upon the Iranian government
to abide by the international obligations

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.660
that it has to respect the rights of its own
people. We call for the immediate release

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.250
of all who have been unjustly detained within
Iran. We will continue to bear witness to

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.389
the extraordinary events that are taking place
there. And I'm confident that history will

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.400
be on the side of those who seek justice.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.620
Thank you very much, everybody, and Happy
New Year.
