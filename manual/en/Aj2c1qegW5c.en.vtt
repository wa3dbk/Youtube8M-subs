00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.920
Today on our 2011 Jeep Wrangler, we&amp;#39;re
going to install part number C55124 from Curt.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.580
This is a Curt T-Connector Vehicle Wiring
Harness.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.889
To start off our install, we&amp;#39;re going
to have to get behind the driver&amp;#39;s side

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:14.969
tail light.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.420
We need to remove the tail light from the
vehicle.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.310
There are four screws that we have to remove.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:01:22.189
Once we 
have the guard off the light, we can remove

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.719
the light itself from the body.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:42.920
Pull it away and you 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:02:31.250
can see where the wire harness connects into
the back of 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.280
the 
tail light.
