00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.500
Raj Kapoor is sort of an icon of what
I like to call Indian commerical

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:08.626
cinema. Bollywood is a term that's
just sort of happened in the last

00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:14.501
15 years. In fact, it's interesting..
many actors take offense to it

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:17.975
because it seems to be something
that's latched on to Hollywood

00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:22.100
as opposed to an entity by itself and
off course it's an entity by itself.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.558
I mean Indian commercial cinema is the
largest in the world and you know they

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.100
make about more than 800 films a year.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:33.406
The icon for all of them
is Raj Kapoor.

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:39.490
You know he came into prominence
I think in the 50s and the way he

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:46.031
approached cinema was very different
from what had been happening in Indian

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:52.298
commercial cinema till then. There was
a darkness. He understood that life

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:56.631
or the portrayal of life wasn't
just about glamour.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.048
And he sort of embraced the dark side.

00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:05.563
He was young and he was beautiful and
he had this amazing actress who became

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.646
his muse - Nargis - and together they
created magic. He broke rules and he..

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:16.856
He embraced.. He embraced difference

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.953
and yet managed to be what's called
what he's known in India as

00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:27.828
and perhaps all over the world as: The
Great Showman because as he grew older

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:32.121
his films became bigger and bigger
and bigger and not only in

00:01:32.288 --> 00:01:36.553
how much they cost but in their
scope - in their emotional scope.

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:38.105
That's why I love Raj Kapoor.

00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:42.386
Because he's larger than life and
because he has.. even being larger

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:46.886
than life he has an incredible
sensitivity to the small details

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.553
and embracing those.

00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:52.943
It's wonderful that TIFF is giving
this opportunity - North America,

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.901
Torontonians, all over to see
something we've never seen in years

00:01:58.068 --> 00:02:03.735
and years and years. I'm so proud of
TIFF for making this possible. I mean

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:07.958
what a feast for all of us. Anybody
who can just walk into those doors

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:13.833
and walk into a world which is
gone but yet is the foundation

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:15.793
for whatever is today.

00:02:15.973 --> 00:02:19.083
The cinema - Indian commercial
cinema is what it is today

00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:20.376
because of Raj Kapoor.
