Melissa: Hi.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.790
I'm Melissa Silver, the Official Rockettes
Makeup Artist.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.160
I'm here with Dani to talk about Halloween
makeup.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.920
One great dance theme, and dance inspired
makeup, is from Black Swan, and I love it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.130
because it is beautiful and it is very dramatic,
but it's great for Halloween because it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.259
mysterious, almost like you're wearing a mask.

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.110
And the best part, is it's easier to do, than
it looks.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.110
Should we try it?

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.110
Dani: Yes, please.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.160
Melissa: Let's go for it.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.160
Dani is all set in her beautiful, dramatic,
and mysterious black swan makeup.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
Before we get to the eyes, let's talk about
the rest of the face.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.550
It's fairly simple.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.579
Dani is wearing a very pale foundation, with
white highlight throughout the center of her

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.670
face and on her cheek bones.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.550
A little bit of a dark blush just in the contour,
and a very dark plum lip.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.730
To add to the drama, added a little bit of
black liner just in the center.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.800
It gives it that depth that I like.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.269
For the eyes, we only used 2 products: a black
liquid liner and a silver cream shadow.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.160
Dani: I noticed you used the black liquid
liner on my eyes.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.090
If I were to use it, I feel like I would just
be erasing and blotting and it would just

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.090
be a big mess.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.259
Do you have any tips or any easier way to
do that?

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.259
Melissa: Definitely.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.240
It is less challenging if you first trace
the structure of your design with a light

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.670
colored pencil and then just go over it with
a liquid liner.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.670
Dani: Ah.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.130
Melissa: What I did first was I did the upper
lash line and the lower lash line, extended

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.850
both on the inside and on the outside and
then I connected them.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.010
Then I did a line throughout the entire crease,
a line over the brow, and a line to connect

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.140
the brow to the bottom tip.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.240
Then I just started to do a couple of wings,
and then I connected them.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.860
You can always go back and add more of the
black line, but once you've put on too much,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.539
it's hard to take away.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.310
After I did the black lines, I did some silver
cream shadow, and I applied that in between

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.679
the black lines.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.289
I really like to just stipple it because I
feel like you'll get a more vibrant payoff

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.939
that way.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.960
Then after I added the silver, in between
the black lines, I went over the black lines

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.280
again to make them really, really strong.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.640
You want that delineation between the black
and silver to be super clean and then a little

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.769
bit of the silver just on the inner rim, a
light coating of mascara and she is ready.

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.110
So take your time.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.769
Start with a light colored pencil as an outline
for the design, do a little bit of dark blush

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.970
under your cheek, a plum lip, and a beautiful
black swan eye.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.000
Remember that no black swan is complete without
the tiara.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.100
Beautiful.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.860
Dani, you make a great blonde black swan.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.860
Dani: Thank you.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.330
Melissa: Have a great Halloween.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.180
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next
time.
