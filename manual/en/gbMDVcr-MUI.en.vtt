Hi summoners!

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.900
You guys find a way to be super creative every week

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
whether it's artistic or crafty

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.000
or something entirely different.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.900
This week we have submissions that got Rioters talking

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.600
And we're lucky to show off 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.900
some of the most inventive fan creations we've seen yet.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.900
So we're going to start off with Renekton

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.900
I know, we're coming on strong 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.900
but HamexD pulls no punches with this new painting.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.900
I should stop being so surprised

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.900
when we get amazing entries, but I admit

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.900
I said "WOW!" when I opened this one.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.900
Have you checked out those makeup tutorials they have on YouTube?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.900
Or, have you woken up and thought man, I really wanna look like Ryze today?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.900
Eclat makes that possible.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.900
A step by step guide from the glamorous to the grotesque,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.900
in case you think Urgot has a good 'look' going for him.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.500
The 'dead' thing. It's flattering!

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.900
I saw this next submission at PAX Prime, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900
I held it in my hands and I'm still in awe.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600
Fiendle has proven to be a grandmaster toymaker 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.900
who can make a doll out of anything, including Aristocrat Vayne

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.900
which, by the way, is my favorite.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.900
Everything from the little boots

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.900
to the tiny goggles is an ornate piece of art

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.900
and I got to see it for myself!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.900
The pictures do it no justice, it's fantastic!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.900
They say you can tell anything about a person from their eyes

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.900
But what about a yordle? Or a monster, what about their eyes?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.900
Infernalzxz made some cartoony champion avatars

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.900
which capture just enough about the character to tell who is who!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.900
Though I suppose if you have more than four eyes, it's kind of a giveaway.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Ever been bogged down and thought

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.900
Man, I have all these Riot Point cards.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.900
I don't even know where to put them!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.900
SodaReaper has a solution!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900
Duct tape can fix anything, except a budget

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.900
But here it's put to use as a League of Legends wallet.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.900
Also enlightening! I didn't know digital camo duct tape even existed.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.900
Wow. HondaFoo has earned massive upvotes on the forums

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.900
for this Caitlyn art and it's truly a stunning piece.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.900
It's only natural that she's on a rooftop

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.900
raining down headshots like any self-respecting sniper.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.900
Can't argue with a sniper. They always take the high ground. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.900
Headshot!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.900
Saranae, I blame you for the loss of my next paycheck

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.900
Because there's a good chance that I'm going to a sign maker

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.900
and making them make these for me.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.500
If we had any purpose for a neon sign for Kog'Maw, or Lux or Annie

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.900
then this would be here immediately.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.900
Okay I have an idea

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.900
We're going to open up a nightclub

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.900
and play KDH's album, and give away Xerath-shaped glowsticks.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.900
Imagination is the best thing! 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.900
But it's also torture!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.800
I'm sorry, that's it for this week

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.900
and dreams of a nightclub die with it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.900
If you've dreamt up some League of Legends awesomeness

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.500
send a link to the Showcase email.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.900
I know,it's only rock and roll. But I like it. Yes I do.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.900
Until next time, camp the rooftops!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.900
If puns could kill...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.900
and, we'll see you next week!
