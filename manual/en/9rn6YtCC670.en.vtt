00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.259
Hello everyone. I wanted to welcome you to
my winter wonderland. A couple days ago, we

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.550
received about 2’ of snow. Here it is, I’m
standing in it at about knee height. Here’s

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:26.562
a show of the greenhouse and the garden.
One of my exciting things that I’ve been

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:33.030
working on is to build a new greenhouse. This
area down in here, which is off of one of

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:43.260
my main fields, is going to have a 900 square
foot geodesic dome, along with an out-building

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.739
attached to it for heating and storage. It’s
pretty exciting that I’m going to be able

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.670
to build this. It’s going the be a big improvement
over my 120 square foot greenhouse. This wooded

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.899
site here is where it’s going to be. All
the old farm equipment and trees will be moved

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.640
and the ground will get leveled off.
It’s going to take me about a year to build

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.291
it. I’m going to do everything from scratch
 – no kits at all. This is the location

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:22.510
again – it’s just off of one of my fields
we use for growing corn.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:32.410
At the end of my video, I’ll also show you
some of the plans for the building and some

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.990
of the ideas for how the aquaponics will work
too. I also wanted to thank everyone for reaching

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.430
a 1000 subscriber mile mark. It’s pretty
good for the aquaponics folks. Not quite like

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.820
some of the millions or so that some of the
other guys get on YouTube, but it’s nice

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.189
to see a good group of people following along
with what we do in the aquaponics world. Thanks

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.549
again.
This is the site plan that was needed to obtain

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.409
the wetlands permit. It shows the existing
land and outlines what type of grading and

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.250
the types of erosion control that will be
installed to protect the wetlands that are

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.670
near the site.
This particular location was picked because

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.969
it was near one of the fields and needed minimal
amount of excavation work.

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:23.439
This is the side profile of the geodesic dome.
It sits on a required 4’ frost wall and

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.659
will have a shed on the north side that will
house a wood furnace. This also shows roughly

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.449
how the grow beds will be set up.
The foundation plan shows the 33’ dome,

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:38.180
the shed area, and post footings for an open-air
shed roof which will be used for wood storage.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.359
This plan displays the grow bed locations
and how they drain into a central sump tank.

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.359
The sump will pump water to the larger fish
tank. This tank will have a siphon that will

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.260
drain through a swirl filter and into a second
tank. The second tank will be used for extra

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.439
water storage as a thermal mass. The water
will then be pumped from this tank back into

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.389
the grow beds.
Buried under the floor will be 4” perforated

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.900
pipe. During the summer months, air will be
blown through these to get cooler air from

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.439
the ground. Over the winter, warm air during
the day will be pumped underground into the

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.970
thermal mass, which will radiate back up into
the dome during the nights. Hopefully the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.430
wood furnace will only be needed on extremely
cold,cloudy days.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.999
That’s all for now. I hope you subscribe
to this channel for future updates. I will

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.859
be showing detailed plans on how the entire
dome will be built. We’re hoping to get

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.340
started this spring once the frost is gone.
Oh, and this is our skating ring that we love

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.459
to use during the winter!
