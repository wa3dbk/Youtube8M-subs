00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.800
Me and my brother are the first-generation
college students in our family.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.460
My mom is an immigrant from Puerto Rico, and
my dad is just a hard working man, a blue

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.620
collared man, and they work hard for everything
they attain and they work hard for everything

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.620
they get.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.990
Well, having a job that you love is one of
the most important lessons I’ve learned

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.990
from my father.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.249
He didn’t have the opportunity to attend
college, but he always knew the value of education

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.189
and instilled those values in me.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.030
I’m here now because of him and because
of the hard work that he’s instilled in

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.030
me.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.150
IUP was the perfect atmosphere for me.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.300
IUP’s a small school with a big school vibe
that I wanted and needed coming from a small

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.300
town.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.230
I feel like when I pursue my degree in cardiac
rehabilitation it’s going to be the perfect

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.400
degree for me because I’ll be able to help
people, but I’m also able to just help them

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.960
help themselves in a way.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.280
This is going to be my calling, this is what
I want to do, and this is going to make me

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.630
happy because being happy is the most important
aspect in finding a job in school.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.350
IUP has given me many opportunities to expand
my knowledge and expand my network, and it’s

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.320
due to things like the Robert E. McNair program
and the other programs offered at IUP that

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.360
really brought me here and made me feel comfortable
as an IUP student.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.010
The Robert E. McNair program is a program
that introduces high levels of academia to

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.670
underrepresented youths.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.540
So it will take a kid that has no aspirations
in achieving anything higher than an undergrad

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.150
and introducing to them that there’s doctoral
programs and master’s degrees that they

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.700
might have not even known about before.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.010
I’m currently doing research on something
called heavy rope training, which is popular

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.920
amongst MMA boxers and football players right
now.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.770
I’m going to be studying college-aged individuals
and how and what the actual rope does during

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.820
an eight-week period.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.229
Hopefully, the results will be in a journal
sometime next year.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.399
IUP definitely has given me the education
to attack the job market with relentless force

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.500
and not to be worried about what’s going
to happen.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.590
I’m confident in my abilities because IUP
has prepared me like no other program has.
