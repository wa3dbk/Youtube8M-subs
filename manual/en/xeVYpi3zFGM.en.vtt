00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.210
all right well I just bought one of the
new auto darkening helmets 60 bucks

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.820
tractor supplies was on sale yeah most
y'all guessed right this is gonna be a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:21.330
mace Super Goku one made one and I asked
him if he would mind if I copied it with

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.619
just a minor twist and he said sure go
ahead

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.529
so here's what I'm gonna do he used the
trailer hitch ball and a piece of pie

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.590
and chain and the only difference I'm
gonna do as i'm gonna will the half a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:52.100
link to the bottom of the ball like that
and a half a link to the pipe like that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.289
so yeah this is gonna be a mace and I'm
not gonna put spikes or anything like

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:07.200
that on it just because you could just
this is heavy enough you know it's it's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.080
a weapon you know I've made a couple of
guns y'all y'all know that I've made two

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.100
shotguns and I kind of have an interest
in weapons that you could make yourself

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.570
on it just junk you got laying around
and all this is just scrap that I pulled

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.920
out of my scrap bin that's below the
bench here and that's kind of me just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.150
being able to dig through your garbage
and make something you know kind of font

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:43.020
and he called it his zombie skull
crusher and I was gonna do a video of me

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.030
busting up a watermelon with this but I
only got one ripe watermelon and I I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.119

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.890
with it

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.830
