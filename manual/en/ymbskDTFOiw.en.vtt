00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.300
Working for Vacansoleil means giving all our guests the time of their lives

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.440
The Campingtainment animation program plays an important role

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.680
And our entertainers as well!

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.400
They are active, creative and speak several languages

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.160
Every season we are looking for new entertainers

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.960
But what are your tasks as an entertainer?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.540
I am chief entertainer, I am responsible for the program from the beginning till the end..

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.660
... the activities, staff, interns, everything

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.620
In this animation team I am mainly responsible for the adult activities

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.320
Together with my colleague I organise the waterpolo tournaments, soccer tournaments, it is a really diverse job...

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.620
... I also help in the Kids Club and with the Kids Musicals.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.000
I work with teenagers from 13 to 18 years old

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.340
We are playing casino games, we are now playing poker.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
Kenneth and his colleague are busy with the preparations for today...

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.900
But what are they doing exactly?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.500
I am finishing my face-paint for Tipy, our favorite Indian.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.320
Tipy and Flora are two caracters from the Kids Club...

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.420
... they have a different theme every week

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.380
It's always fun!

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.300
Monday, at the beginning of the week we see that the kids are like 'ohh, Tipy and Flora'...

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.020
But at Tuesday they are allready screaming your name all over the campsite.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.020
Bonjour Ã  tous! Goedemorgen allemaal!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.880
We are working all together as a team, with younger people, between 16 and 26/27 years old...

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.920
... they are your family abroad.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920
We're going to play different kinds of music...

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.920
... electro, techno, a lot of variation!

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.820
They always dance in the water!

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.120
This evening is really exciting for the kids...

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.660
They are going to play the musical they have been practicing for during the entire day

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.760
Together with the entertainers of course!

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.720
Whom are pleased by the joy of the campsite guests

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.700
It's important that the guests will enjoy theirselves, that we make them have a good time...

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.640
... that they laugh, discover new things.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.280
You get up early in the morning and work until very late in the evening

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.280
but when 10 kids are screaming your name after the show, want to take pictures with you...

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.920
want to get a hugh, a goodnight kiss. The joy of these kids, you are their hero during their holiday,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.480
that's absolutely great to see.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.720
"I don't want to go home, I want to stay here with you"

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.560
Their appreciation gives you an adrenaline boost for the next day

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.480
