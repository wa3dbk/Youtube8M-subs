Some of the most interesting scenes are seascapes
or landscapes that are tack sharp from right

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.369
at your feet to the distant horizon.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.559
Here's how you can do it every time.

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:43.879
First of all you have to scout the scene when
you have lots of time.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.890
Try to pick a convenient location so you can
come back when the light is perfect.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.610
You don't want to leave anything to chance
so avoid autofocus, which may concentrate

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.149
on the centre of the image and leave the foreground
and background blurry.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.089
To get perfect focus from foreground to the
horizon you will need to know the hyperfocal

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.530
focus distance for the lens that you are using.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:26.329
The best way to find out is to search on the
internet for "hyperfocal" or click here: http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:46.230
For my Canon 5D I have entered my 17mm lens
at f11 and the result is that if I focus the

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:54.990
lens at 1m (3 feet) the scene will be in focus
from .5m (1.5 feet) to infinity.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.860
All we need to do is use these settings for
perfect focus every time.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:28.600
Show up at the time for the best light.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:40.160
Put your camera on a tripod using f11 focused
at 1 meter.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.780
Frame the scene and simply adjust the shutter
speed for the correct exposure.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.290
Try for scenes that are interesting from front
to back.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.220
Super-wide photos work especially well if
you have lots of foreground and the horizon

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.060
very near the top of the frame.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.750
With hyperfocal focusing the results are tack
sharp every time.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.469
