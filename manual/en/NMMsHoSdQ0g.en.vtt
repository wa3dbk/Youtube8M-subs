with the fact after somebody gets a good
job of getting older

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.809
by the way to run the story

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.589
find me a poker

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:16.669

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:30.059

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:34.829
housing activists which samplers
abortion's been

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.549
now

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.410
equine

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.909
copia

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.949
that's in the book i guess the hit like

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.269
so in

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.359
i'll see what the mustard on this
program is so that it doesn't give you

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.089
abortion

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.639
if it's on the phone book it's planned
parenthood where they go to our tibet on

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.969
the cover as you know what i'm saying so
and that's my best guess is that why you

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.809
don't get abortion renew your planned
parenthood
