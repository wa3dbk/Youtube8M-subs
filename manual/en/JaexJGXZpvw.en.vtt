Subtitle: www.pchq.fr

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.571
Joe!

00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.116
You've been in there for 55 minutes!

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.612
Masturbation is fun, I get it.

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:22.998
It's not very green to do
with the shower running.

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:27.210
Do you remember when dad quits

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.962
because you wouldn't trade him B&amp;O?

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.758
Oh, Do I remember when my own father
called me a fear mongering Chinaman.

00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:37.053
That's something my great grand father
would say. He's a racist.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.556
This bullshit ends today.

00:00:42.573 --> 00:00:44.394
So you wear the blue shirt today,

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.521
not the one with the pocket?

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:50.400
Dropping the attitude, mister,
this is your mother you're speaking to.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.117
- Who is he doing a show for, uh?
- Girl check.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:55.113
Checking for a girl in a bikini.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.326
This is the side
of our new house, man.

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:01.203
What, like a tree house?

00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:02.621
No, like a real house.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.374
We're really doing this, huh?

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:10.045
Yes, we are.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.966
This is our rite of passage,
goddammit.

00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:27.938
Do you think that Joe
would run away to prove a point?

00:01:28.748 --> 00:01:30.649
Are you familiar
with the boy who cried wolf?

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.234
The boy who cried what?

00:01:32.484 --> 00:01:33.567
- Wolf.
- Fuck you.

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:36.488
I experienced a childhood
on the planet Earth, so...

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.924
yes, I've heard of that one.

00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:02.722
Bitch.

00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:07.018
Dude, food attracts mice.
And you know what mice attract?

00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:08.562
Stupid fucking questions?

00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:10.856
No, they attract snakes.

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.442
In Italian, the word for "snake"
means "the demon's cock".

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:15.652
No, it doesn't.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.571
There's a chance that it doesn't.

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:22.242
- What's your name?
- My American name is Gary.

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:24.231
Have you ever had one
of those days, Gary?

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:26.090
I don't know
what kind of day you're having.

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:29.183
When you feel like somebody's
pissing in your face all day long.

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:30.584
Is that good or bad?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.239
Bad.
