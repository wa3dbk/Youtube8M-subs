00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.520
Trains running mile after mile put
high demands on their wheels.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.000
Meeting their requirements

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.200
on dimensional tolerances and
surface quality is essential,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.760
both as a matter of safety

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.400
but also in terms of comfort for
the passenger.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.760
Producing finished wheels involves
a manufacturing chain

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.200
including different forming
processes,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.200
metal cutting and testing.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.680
Blanks are heated in a rotary kiln
before compression forged.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.200
The centre is then punched out and
the profile is rollformed.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.760
A bending process gives the wheel its
final shape,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.640
and then the wheel rim is chilled in
water,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.840
thus hardening it.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.680
Finally, the wheel's mechanical
properties are tested

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.040
to ensure the wheel is ready for
further machining.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.160
To achieve required dimensions and
surface quality,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.560
the hub, web and rim on the wheel are
machined.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.840
Round inserts are combined with over
and under coolant

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.560
for best performance and chip
evacuation.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.880
Non-destructive testing ensures the
wheel surface meets the requirements

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.120
on quality and tolerances.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.840
Then it's mounted on the axis,
installed on the train

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.800
and ready for use.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.560
After a period on the tracks,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.800
wheels need re-turning.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.280
The train rolls into the machine
shop,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.720
where every flat spot,
flange deformation

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640
and crack is removed.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.240
Until the wheels are reset to their
former standard,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.680
ready for another cycle.
