00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:21.300
Now I have already started to tell you about
how I was losing hair in large amounts and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:33.170
if you haven't watched my last video, please
click this link and let me know what you think

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.030
Part 2 of this video, it was the beginning
of 2014 I had mercury amalgam fillings and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.960
I wanted to remove it was contributing to
a lot of health issues I was dealing with

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:58.120
at that time such as candida, irritable bowel
syndrome(IBS), and the thing I believe is

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:06.970
your hair gives you an indication as to what
is happening to you health wise, with you

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.590
body changes, hormones.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:17.060
You hair gives so many signals and sometimes
we ignore it.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.670
So I had a mercury filling in my mouth and
it was time to remove it.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.150
I used to be really angry that I had them
put into my mouth they are so dangerous.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.840
Mercury is the most poisonous element and
substance in this world but yet we put it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.820
into our mouths.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:49.170
When I am eating, the mercury gases are getting
released into my bloodstream.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.649
I wish I had never gotten them in the first
place.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.140
I got it removed safely.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.009
There is an entire process that you need to
go through.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.170
The dentist that removes your mercury needs
to be a safe natural dentist, giving you an

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.840
oxygen mask.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.829
The dentist and their assistant are also supposed
to be wearing safety industrial gas masks,

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.500
that's how dangerous removal of mercury is.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.459
When it is being removed, it releases even
more gases.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:43.310
Perhaps I will do a video on removing my mercury
filling.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:03:00.610
Once you remove your amalgam fillings, you
are supposed to detox with specific supplements

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.470
and when you detox, you are removing other
minerals in your body and for me, I removed

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.520
some really important ones specifically zinc
and I wasn't replacing the zinc that I was

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.930
losing.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.890
So while your body is detoxing, any mercury
that escaped while your filling was being

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.890
removed, it gets into your blood stream.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.180
It gets stored in the fatty body tissues,
and accumulates within your organs.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:53.030
The mercury gases get stored in your body.As
I was detoxing over a 6 month period, at the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.010
6 month mark I realized my hair was falling
out again, I was still taking lugol's iodine,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:07.420
which displaces mercury from your body also
magnesium, selenium from brazil nuts and vitamin

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:17.510
C. So what's important for hair growth is
zinc and that was being lost while detoxing

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.110
and mercury chelation.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:32.130
I had to get a zinc supplement which took
a long time about 6 months to see results,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:42.060
Transmix with Calcium also magnesium, manganese,
chromium and potassium.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.000
All of these work together to make sure that
your body is functioning well.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.960
The other symptoms that showed a lack in zinc
my joints started to hurt, I wasn't exercising

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.900
but my joints, my elbows, my knees, wrists
and fingers and were in pain however once

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:11.889
I supplemented with zinc a lot of those slowly
went away.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:22.240
Fast forward to early 2015, there was hair
fall again.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.270
This one is very much personal but I will
share it with you.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:37.850

reason why my was falling out.
