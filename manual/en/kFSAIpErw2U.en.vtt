00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:06.078
I'm just a human,
so I also have to take out the glass.

00:00:06.154 --> 00:00:09.281
We got a couple of questions asking
if we could go and drive a Maybach...

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.016
...so I'm going to do so, for you.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.016
Great! That was the review.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.429
Although, it is a 57 S...

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:33.523
...the S stands for Self-driving.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:34.907
So that's what we're going to do.

00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:37.513
See? An S!

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.474
What's the first thing you notice?

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.048
Ruben said its quietness.

00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:54.001
But the first thing I noticed
was the Maybach-logo. The two Ms.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.056
They're were you'd usually find
the Mercedes-star.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.463
So you can still aim it at pedestrians. Good.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:04.313
And the second thing I noticed was
indeed that it is very quiet.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:05.962
Really bizarrely quiet.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.700
Especially when you drive it
like it's supposed to be...

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.480
...calmly, anticipating on the other traffic...

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:14.060
...don't go full throttle
and don't go through corners very quickly.

00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:17.029
Like a well taught chauffeur would.

00:01:17.088 --> 00:01:19.696
Then it's a really relaxing car.

00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:27.707
But it's an S, so it's got more hp
and it's kinda sporty.

00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:31.197
You can also see that in the exterior...

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:36.507
...this is also a special S.
Normally they're black, silver or white...

00:01:36.578 --> 00:01:37.614
...this one is two-tone.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.821
And despite it being a chauffeur-driven car,
it's quite fast.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.384
0-62 in 5 seconds,
612 hp out of a 6-liter V12.

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:49.877
That's six cartons of milk.

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:50.997
And two turbos.

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:55.917
I'm now next to a Honda CBR,
let's see who's fastest. Me, I guess.

00:01:58.296 --> 00:01:59.544
Whimp!

00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:00.913
He won't make it!

00:02:02.183 --> 00:02:04.788
Okay, he's a bit faster. Although...

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:09.535
1000 Nm of torque
between 2000 and 4000 rpm.

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.338
That's about the whole spectrum.

00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:14.515
This is the kind of engine that's always there.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.944
No problems, always at your service.

00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:23.716
Great! That's how I imagine being very rich,
when everyone does everything for me.

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.695
One small point; it's quite thirsty.

00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:28.343
We're not even on the Autoblog test track...

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:31.797
...but it uses 41,4 liter per 100 miles...

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:35.494
...that's about 9,2 mpg, not very economical.

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:41.628
Not that you could be bothered
if you can afford a car like this. So who cares?

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.392
You can make up for it
by making all your staff drive a hybrid.

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.926
CO2 neutral.

00:02:56.472 --> 00:03:01.714
People regularly ask why you should buy
a Maybach instead of an S-Class.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.459
When you're making the choice, you think
the Maybach is based on the previous S-Class.

00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:14.675
I'll tell you something; this car is
much and much bigger than an S-Class.

00:03:14.983 --> 00:03:18.391
You can house six horses in the rear.

00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:21.629
The only thing that gives it away
is the satnav...

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:24.946
...it's the best money could buy in 2002.

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:27.283
But that's 7 years ago.

00:03:27.547 --> 00:03:30.223
So there's no touchscreen,
less beautiful graphics.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:34.903
But the buttons are very nice,
it's got all the options you need...

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:38.474
...pure indulgence, a car like this.

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:42.204
Only the driver isn't standard,
but I don't mind at all.
