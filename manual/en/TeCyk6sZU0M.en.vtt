00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:07.358
[Music]

00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:11.644
♪oh ♪oh oooh♫ the Lord, the lord♪

00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:20.345
[music continues]

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.391
It's a little bit like 'Karate Kid'.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.145
[laughs]

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.227
making painting is such an enterprise in solitude.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:43.948
One of these things really struggle about whether I could actually do this for my life

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:46.043
it's like I don't know if I can be alone that much.

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:58.737
It was really rough for me when I left school and started painting alone and full time

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:04.180
I was living home and working at home. So I had no reason to ever leave the house

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:09.749
Like going buy milk,and I would chat with the person selling milk, for [Laughs]

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:11.795
like, way to long.

00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:17.197
"Can we see inside?"

00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:19.379
"Oh yeah!"

00:01:19.877 --> 00:01:21.840
[Laughs]

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.925
I mean, I think this is how they paint cars.

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:29.012
But they don't use oil paint, they use enamel.

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:39.140
I think there is a little bit of guilt to be an artist in this time.

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:46.177
when you could be doing something more proactively positive directly in the world.

00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:50.196
It's hard to do something that is not justified by anything.

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:53.847
I don't know if I actually succeed in that, but that's the goal.

00:02:01.794 --> 00:02:05.613
[Spray sound]

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.306
There is something indulging about painting.

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:32.563
My individual creativity sploodged over the surface for you to admire how unique my mark

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:36.210
making shit smearing process is.

00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:44.329
I struggle with that not all the time but i occasionally do struggle with that about what I do with my life.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.558
{scoffs]

00:02:46.243 --> 00:02:46.977
It is such an ugly, ugly stage in the painting. [laughs]

00:02:46.977 --> 00:02:54.806
Oh my God I can't believe I am showing this to you guys.

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:56.998
It's horrible.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.893
[sighs] I don't know.

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:05.392
I think I am going to have to put more purple down. I don't like how it looks like a squid in front of a building.

00:03:07.731 --> 00:03:11.129
I've had a lot of people say that my paintings remind them of graffiti walls,

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.880
or seed maps and grids in a sort of literal sense.

00:03:22.092 --> 00:03:28.894
At first when people said you seem to be inspired by the city, I was like: "No, it's so corny..." and "...that's not true..."

00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:35.912
Then I realized, I have like a view of Manhattan from my studio.

00:03:37.527 --> 00:03:42.759
You know, that's the main thing I look at when I'm not looking at my paintings, as I look out the window.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.863
My paintings are about, I think, seeing through the other world,

00:03:50.863 --> 00:04:01.439
like maybe hiding and exposing a road system on top of the subway system, under an air traffic control system.

00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:08.956
That's what an abstraction is, it's not about things that are nameable,

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:11.679
it's sort of like undo the nameable things in life.

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:30.243
This is what I'm looking at, Bernard, Albert Allen, I just looked at..., I just found... re-found these yellow ones, yellow Albert's paintings...

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:34.125
...like yellow and grey, whites.

00:04:34.332 --> 00:04:37.277
[exhales]
"God!"

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.311
Slay me, you know!

00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:41.757
[laughs]

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:49.249
The color is so good. What? It's like puke of orange and yellow.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.196
Yeah, painting is one of the oldest thing in the world.

00:04:58.253 --> 00:05:04.448
I mean, hands down. Not only it is of the oldest things in the world, like, when you make a painting

00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:08.311
you have no idea how long it's gonna last.

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:16.509
It could last a very, very long time. It might not, it might be put into a dumpster tomorrow.

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:19.938
Cause maybe in hundreds of years people'd be looking at my paintings.

00:05:19.938 --> 00:05:26.382
Maybe even as just as artifacts, of what idiotic people do in New York at some point.

00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:33.314
I think the beauty of painting is just that you feel a kinship for a moment at least, of the world.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.818
You feel a little less alone in the world, which is great.

00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:44.180
