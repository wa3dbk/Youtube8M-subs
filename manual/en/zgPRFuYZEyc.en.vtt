00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.430
In this video we are going to be talking about
Pain Management while you are in the hospital.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.480
Pain is a very unique experience, one that
only you as a patient can truly understand.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.579
We believe in a team approach to your pain
management and that team includes yourself,

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.290
your family members and your health care providers.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.320
If at any time you are experiencing pain,
make sure you let someone know.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.210
Nurse: So, while you are in hospital, if you
do experience any pain, make sure you let

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.210
someone know.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.210
Patient: Ok.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.210
So what do you want me to do?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.780
Nurse: So what will happen is you just need
to let someone know.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.670
So, if you’re working with your nurse, or
you’re working with your physician, or a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.040
physiotherapist and you start to have pain
it is important that you call and let someone

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.040
know.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.970
You can use your call bell that is on your
bedside.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.280
Patient: Ok.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
And what should I tell them?

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.789
Nurse: When your nurse comes in, they will
assess where you are having pain.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.790
Patient: Should I point to that area?

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.440
Nurse: Whatever way you want to describe it.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.370
They are going to want you to put your pain
into words.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.290
Like I said before, pain is a very unique
experience.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.049
So, whatever way you feel comfortable explaining
it, that’s the way that we want you to let

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.540
us know.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.079
Patient: Ok.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.259
There is no special way I should explain it
to them?

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.320
Nurse: No.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.960
Next thing they are going to ask you to rate
your pain on the 0 to 10 scale.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.520
If you take a look at the scale, zero (0)
is no pain, while ten (10) is the worst pain

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.520
possible.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.520
Patient: Ok.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.130
Oh, so I guess five (5) is in the middle?

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.130
Nurse: Moderate.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.510
So, what we aim for, we want you to be as
comfortable as possible.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.140
But, comfort is whatever it means to you.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.980
Keep in mind you want to be able to do the
things you need to do while in hospital.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.850
So, if that means doing your physiotherapy
exercises, or just getting up out of bed and

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.730
sitting in a chair, or going out for a walk,
we want you to be comfortable doing those

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.730
things.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.730
Patient: Ok.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.500
So, by comfortable, you mean if my pain goes
above a four (4), then I should tell somebody?

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.020
Nurse: If you are finding that four (4) is
uncomfortable.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.550
We say, in terms of numbers, we want people
to aim for a four (4) or lower.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.000
We consider that the mild range.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.220
If you are comfortable at a higher number
and you are still able to do everything…

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.640
then it is at whatever comfort means to you.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640
Patient: Ok.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640
Sounds good.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.400
Nurse: If you are finding that the pain is
getting worse and you let someone know, there

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.820
are different things we can do to help you
get comfortable.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.510
Patient: What do you mean by that?

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.700
Nurse: Well the first thing that we can try
is different medications.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.730
So we might use something like Tylenol, or
we might use an anti-inflammatory such as

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.730
Ibuprofen.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.449
Or we might need something a little bit stronger.

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.360
We might use opioid, like morphine.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.630
Patient: Excuse me, but can't those drugs
be addictive?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.199
Nurse: There is always a possibility but for
the amount of time that you would need it

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.640
while you are in hospital, it’s very unlikely.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.480
Patient: That's good to know.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.760
I've used Tylenol and Ibuprofen before.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.540
Nurse: Ok.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.060
We will start off with those medications,
but if you do need something stronger there

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.940
are those options we can try.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.680
One thing to keep in mind - if you do need
something stronger, so if you do need an opioid,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.420
those medications can cause side effects.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.710
They might make you a little sick to your
stomach, the might make itchy, they might

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.040
make you feel drowsy or they might make you
constipated.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.570
If at any time you do experience any of those
side effects it is really important you let

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.570
someone know.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.140
Patient: Will I for sure get some side effects?

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.680
Nurse: Not definitely.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.320
But sometimes it does happen and it’s important
that if you do, that you let us know.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.320
Patient.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.320
Ok.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320
I’ll do that.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.620
Nurse: Now, we don't just use medications.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.730
There are other things we can try - and your
health care proviers will tell you about that

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.180
- but other things you can try such as watching
TV, or reading a book, just spending time

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.200
with a friend or family member, even changing
your position in bed.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.889
Things that will help you get conformable
to help you minimize the pain.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.370
Patient: I see, I guess like distractions?

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.010
Nurse: Yes, so you’re not just focusing
on the pain.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.229
Patient: Ok.

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.260
That sounds really good.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.850
Nurse: The other treatment options that I
talked about: The first one is a Patient Controlled

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.790
Analgesia or a (PCA) is the way that people
refer to it.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.630
It might be something you might have started
if you had an operation, you might have it

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.450
even if you didn't have an operation.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:15.930
So, the way the pump works is… this is a
computer and it allows you to push a button,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.070
and when you push a button, that is when you’ll
get the medication.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.320
One of the safety features with the pump,
though, is that it only lets you get the medication

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.620
once every five (5) minutes.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.070
So, when you push it, you’ll get a small
amount of medication and you can push the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.010
button, every 5 minutes, or whenever you feel
the pain is starting to get worse

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.720
So when you do push the button and it beeps,
that means you’re getting the medication.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.610
If you push the button and it doesn’t beep,
it hasn’t been that five (5) minutes yet.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.780
So, you’re technically locked out of the
pump.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.780
Patient: Right.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.780
Nurse: Ok.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.780
So try giving it a push, and listen to the
sound that the machine makes.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.780
(beeps)

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.770
Patient: Ok.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.580
Nurse: So that means that now you are getting
the medication.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.100
So, you could use it before you go for a walk,
say if walking is uncomfortable for you.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.780
Give it a push before you go.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.780
Patient: Ok.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.680
Nurse: So, now if the pain is quite bad and
you want to push the button again.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680
Try pushing it now.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.980
Patient: Yeah, I didn’t hear anything.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.310
Nurse: It didn’t beep.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.780
So that means it hasn’t been five (5) minutes
yet.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.040
Now, while you’re on the PCA, you’ll be
visited every day by the Acute Pain Service.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.990
The Acute Pain Service is a group of physicians
and nurse practitioners that work with you

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.590
to help manage the pain.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.840
They’ll come and see you everyday, they
will make sure that the pump is working.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.580
Do we need to be trying something different?

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.990
Are you having any side effects?

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.380
We want to make sure that using this medication
is helping your pain.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.960
Patient: OK.
