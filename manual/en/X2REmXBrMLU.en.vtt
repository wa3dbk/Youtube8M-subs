Hello there!
Looking for steps to troubleshoot the error

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.760
"The User Profile Service failed the logon.
User profile cannot be loaded" on your Windows

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.340
7 based PC?
Let me give you the steps for it, just follow

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.060
me:

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.279
Start the computer and press F8 key immediately.
In the "Advanced Boot Options" window, select

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.329
"Safe Mode" and then press "Enter"
Login to your account.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.600
Click Start
In Start Search box, type "regedit", and press

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:48.600
"Enter". In Registry Editor window, navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:55.250
NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
In the left pane, look for the folder name

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.250
starting with S-1-5 (SID key) followed by
a long number, then click the folder and locate

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.310
ProfileImagePath from the right pane to verify
that this is the user account profile that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.790
has the error.
If you have two folders starting with S-1-5

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.710
followed by same long numbers and one of them
ends in .bak

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.800
Change the .bak folder to normal one. To do
this:

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.800
Right click the folder without .bak and choose
"Rename". Then add .ba at the end of the folder

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.210
name.
Right click the folder with .bak and choose

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.390
"Rename". Then remove ".bak" at the end of
the folder name.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.390
Right click the folder with .ba and choose
"Rename". Then change the .ba to .bak at the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.310
end of the folder name.
Choose the folder without .bak

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.460
In the right pane, right click on RefCount
and then select "Modify"

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.850
Under "Value Data", type 0 and then click
OK.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.010
Right click on State and then select "Modify"
Under "Value Data", type 0 and then click

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.879
OK.
Close Registry Editor window.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.020
Restart the computer in normal mode.
Log on to your account again.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.920
See how simple it was! Go ahead, have fun
with your PC. At any point in time, if you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.250
face issues with your PC, just call iYogi.
Good Karma!
