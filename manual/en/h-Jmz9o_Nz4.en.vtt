00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.500
The Large Magellanic Cloud, or LMC, is a small companion galaxy of our own Milky Way. 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.300
It can be seen with the naked eye, as a faint grey blotch in the constellation of Dorado.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.500
It’s a favourite hunting ground for astronomers and it has been studied by many telescopes. 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.000
Its most dramatic feature is the Tarantula Nebula, 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.000
a bright region of glowing gas and energetic star formation.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.500
Hubble has produced a close-up view of this nebula, 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.300
which reveals this dynamic region of our Universe in unprecedented detail.

Hubblecast Episode 44: Hubble spies on the Tarantula Nebula

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Presented by Dr J, aka Dr Joe Liske

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This part of the Tarantula Nebula is one of the most dynamic, 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.000
showing the area around the supernova remnant NGC 2060.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
These wispy tendrils of gas and dust are the only visible remnant of a star which has exploded.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
After puffing out these smoky remains, 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.300
the core of the star that formed NGC 2060 collapsed into a pulsar, which is a type of neutron star.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.500
The Tarantula nebula glows brightly because the atoms in its hydrogen gas are excited by the bright, 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.500
newborn stars that have recently formed here.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.500
These toddler-stars shine forth with intense ultraviolet radiation that ionises the gas,  

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.500
making it light up red and green.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.300
The light is so intense that although around 170 000 light-years distant, 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
and outside the Milky Way, 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.500
the Tarantula Nebula is nevertheless visible without a telescope 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.700
on a dark night to Earth-bound observers.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.000
But the biggest and brightest stars in the Tarantula are actually just outside Hubble’s field of view.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.000
This wider, but less detailed view of the Tarantula Nebula was taken

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.000
 with the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope, at La Silla Observatory in Chile. 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.500
It shows us the source of much of the Tarantula’s light:

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.000
the super star cluster RMC 136.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.200
So it wasn’t in fact that long ago that astronomers were still debating whether 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.500
this intense light came from a compact star cluster, or perhaps from an unknown kind of super-star. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.000
It’s only been in the past 20 years that we have been able to prove that it is in fact a star cluster — 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.700
albeit one that hosts some of the most massive stars that have ever been observed. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
The Tarantula Nebula also hosts the supernova 1987a. 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.500
Now, of all the supernovae that we have observed since the invention of the telescope, 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.000
this one is by far the closest to us.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.500
Pulling further back, the size of the Tarantula Nebula relative to its host galaxy becomes clear. 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.500
It is the brightest known star forming region in the local Universe 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.000
and one of the most attractive spots in the night sky.
