00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
Today I'm going to share with you one of
my favorite side dishes growing up...

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.500
Harvard beets. They are so delicious!

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.389
Welcome to Tess's kitchen.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.660
So let's get started! In a saucepan on
low-medium I'm adding a half a cup of

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.230
sugar and here I'm using palm sugar. I'm
adding a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.590
of cornstarch, a quarter cup of water and
a quarter cup of cider vinegar. You can

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.020
also use white vinegar but I prefer the
cider vinegar. Cook over medium heat

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.010
stirring frequently for about three to
four minutes. The mixture will thicken

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.280
quickly after three or four minutes.
Remove it from the heat.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.900
While growing up, I remember this Harvard
beet recipe as a side dish for meatloaf

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.180
or at the Holiday table with turkey.
Actually you can eat these beets hot or cold.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.080
 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.520
The sauce has a sweet and sour note with
the sugar and vinegar. The beets are

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.140
covered with this creamy beautiful sauce
that is a great addition to any meal.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.780
Now I'm adding two 15 ounce cans of sliced beets.  One with the juice and the other one drained.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.890
 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.390
You can also use fresh beets for this
recipe that have been cleaned, peeled and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.640
boiled until almost tender. Give the
beets a gentle stir making sure all the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.880
beets are coated and everything is well
combined.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
We are going to cover this and let it set
for 30 minutes.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.870
Time is up and it's actually been a
couple hours. I'm putting the beets back

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.190
on the stove and bringing them up to
heat. Also at this time I'm adding 2

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.840
tablespoons of butter.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.220
I'm going to let that butter melt and
combined into that fabulous sauce making

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.350
it creamy and rich! It will take about
five to seven minutes to heat the beets

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.600
through and bring up the heat.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.490
You will see the butter melt and the
sauce will thicken.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.610
You can find this recipe and the list of ingredients in the
description box below.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.780
 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.100
The beets look like they're heating and
thickening well, and OH!, and they smell delicious!

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.920
One way that I can tell they
are done is run my finger over the back

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.819
of the spoon and if the sauce does not
run together, it's done.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.600
And they are ready and you can see where
the sauce is already starting to thicken.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.210
I have seen some add a hint of clove or
some orange juice or zest.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.740
I like the traditional version. You can
store these Harvard beets in the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.780
refrigerator up to a week. Just add a
little bit of water and reheat over

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.220
medium heat.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.170
I hope you give this Harvard beet recipe
a try. Being that the beets are so rich

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.520
and creamy, sweet and good, it is a good
way to get the kids to eat their vegetables.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.150
Until next time, enjoy.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.200
