my be the best that works best for your hair

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.400
or that works for mine so there is no universal
shampoo or product that applies to every single

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.160
person with American hair use simply want
to make sure that the shampoo feels best and

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.100

this video I will be addressing a couple of

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.729
things they you really want to make sure is
inside of your hair shampoo so you have the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:51.350
possible shampoo that best for you are hair
my forst tip for using the best shampoo for

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.659
your hair will be to aim for ingredients in
your shampoo that are natural so try your

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.889
best to find shampoos that contains as much
for as many natural ingredients as possible

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:09.480
sometimes you may only need a couple of ingredients
to really give you the clean that you like

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.000
or you may like to shampoo product to have
more ingredients in them or even specific

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.820
kinds ingredients so the favorite to use that
I like to use when I'm washing my hair is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.680
to use Dr. Bronner's castile soap so the description
box below I have a link to my website that

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.860
addresses all of the possible shampoos that
you can use that are natural g I give a lot

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.250
of great suggestions as to what you can try
or experiment with when choosing your best

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.430
shampoo so the thing is to make sure that
it has as many natural ingredients as possible

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.940
make sure you can pronounce the name such
as water protein aloe vera juice or even Shea

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.250
butter or oil such as olive oil or jojoba
oil make it your goal that the ingredients

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.190
in your shampoo are as natural as possible
because this best for your hair so my second

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.069
tip is to make sure that the cleansing agents
shampoo are curl friendly for your hair so

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.440
even if you may not have curls your hair may
be chemically relaxed you may have a straighter

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.939
hair texture you still want to make sure that
you are using cleansing agents in your shampoo

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:28.739
that is so stripping on your hair African-American
hair in general does not require very heavy

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.340
cleansing agents to clean our hair simply
because number one the pure nature of our

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.049
hair and number two because we produce generally
lower sebum production than others which means

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.780
that you produce less natural oils on your
scalp to keep in moisture by using really

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.370
strong cleansing agent such as sulfate is
really stripped your hair and make the dry

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.370
sometimes unmanageable because of the very
nature of this ingredient so there's a couple

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.599
of things that you do want to make sure that
you have as cleansing agents in your shampoo

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.159
