            &lt;Matt&gt;              
WAIT A SECOND! WE MAY NOT KNOW  
  EXACTLY HOW MUCH WE NEED -    

00:00:04.758 --> 00:00:07.593
      BUT SOMEBODY DOES!        
         JAX, IT'S ME!          

00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:10.395
        &lt;Jackie&gt;                
             MATT!              
  HAVE YOU GOT THE CRYOXIDE?    

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.565
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
  NOT YET. HOW'S MOTHERBOARD    
          HOLDING UP?           

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.368
        &lt;Jackie&gt;                
HER LASER PRINTER'S ACTING UP - 
BUT WE'VE GOT IT COVERED,       

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:17.669
        FOR NOW.                

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:20.372
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
 HER TANK'S STILL FILLED WITH   
THE CONTAMINATED STUFF, RIGHT?  

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:22.808
        &lt;Jackie&gt;                
      TO THE BRIM, MATT.        

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:25.477
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
OKAY. WE NEED TO DO SOME        
          MEASURING.            

00:00:25.512 --> 00:00:28.180
  FOR EVERY SCOOP OF GLOP YOU   
    TAKE OUT OF HER TANK -      

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:31.116
  WE'LL POUR THE SAME AMOUNT    
        INTO THE COUPE.         

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:32.751
            &lt;Digit&gt;             
        INTO THE COUPE?         

00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:33.952
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
      I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.       

00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:37.322
            &lt;Inez&gt;              
  ONLY ONE PROBLEM. WHATEVER    
WE USE TO MEASURE WITH -        

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:39.892
  HAS TO HOLD THE SAME AMOUNT   
          OF CRYOXIDE           

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:44.096
     AS JACKIE'S MEASURE,       
 OR IT WON'T MEASURE THE SAME!  

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.598
 OH, MATT, THIS'LL NEVER WORK!  

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:51.870
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
 INEZ! THAT'S IT! LET ME HAVE   
         THAT HELMET.           

00:00:52.372 --> 00:00:55.007
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
  JACKIE! YOU STILL HAVE THAT   
  BATTING HELMET I GAVE YOU?    

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.141
         I HAVE MINE!           

00:00:56.443 --> 00:00:59.812
        &lt;Jackie&gt;                
 GOT IT! ARE YOU THINKING WHAT  
         I'M THINKING?          

00:00:59.846 --> 00:01:03.348
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
TWO IDENTICAL BATTING HELMETS!  
BOTH WITH THE SAME DIMENSIONS.  

00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:06.919
            &lt;Inez&gt;              
  WHICH MEANS THEY BOTH HOLD    
    THE SAME VOLUME!            

00:01:06.953 --> 00:01:12.224
        &lt;Jackie&gt;                
 BATTING HELMETS FOR MEASURING  
     CUPS! TOTALLY COOOOL!      

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.595
        &lt;Jackie&gt;                
    START MEASURING, DIDGE!     

00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.865
            &lt;Digit&gt;             
          THAT'S ONE!           

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.567
            &lt;Inez&gt;              
         FILL 'ER UP!           

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.870
            &lt;Gnome&gt;             
THIS IS GOIN' ON MOTHERBOARD'S  
        BILL, YOU KNOW.         

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:26.004
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
             ONE!               

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:28.740
            &lt;Digit&gt;             
          THAT'S TWO!           

00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:30.442
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
             TWO!               

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:31.977
            &lt;Buzz&gt;              
    WE GOTTA STOP 'EM           
        OR THE HACKER'S         

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.480
 GONNA BE REALLY, REALLY MAD!   

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:38.584
WE GOTTA DISCONNECT THAT HOSE.  
              GO!               

00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:41.353
        &lt;Delete&gt;                
    ALL THE WAY UP THERE??!     

00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:43.355
            &lt;Buzz&gt;              
        START CLIMBING!         

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:46.658
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
    THAT'S FOURTEEN!            

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:49.261
        &lt;Jackie&gt;                
 HERE'S THE LAST ONE: FIFTEEN!  

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:52.431
 FIFTEEN HELMETS HOLD THE SAME  
 AMOUNT AS MOTHERBOARD'S TANK.  

00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:55.534
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
  WE GOT IT! FIFTEEN HELMETS    
             FULL!              

00:01:55.568 --> 00:01:57.803
        &lt;Delete&gt;                
AHHH, I DON'T LIKE THIS, BUZZY. 

00:01:57.837 --> 00:01:59.505

      HANG ONTO MY FEET!        

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.950

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:13.252
        &lt;Delete&gt;                
             HUH?               

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:15.687
    (SCREAMING WALLA)           

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:34.139
        &lt;Delete&gt;                
         OWWWWWWWWW...          

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:43.115
         &lt;Motherboard&gt;          
AHHHHHH...THAT'S SO MUCH        
            COOLER.             

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:45.150
         &lt;Motherboard&gt;          
     THANKS FOR THE REFILL      

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.820
            &lt;Inez&gt;              
GOOD THING WE FIGURED OUT THAT  
     DIFFERENT CONTAINERS       

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:50.789
CAN HOLD AS MUCH CRYOXIDE       
         AS YOUR TANK.          

00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:54.493
            &lt;Matt&gt;              
    YEAH! DIFFERENT SHAPES,     
 BUT THE SAME VOLUME. AMAZING!  

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:58.030
        &lt;Jackie&gt;                
  I'M AMAZED THAT WE MEASURED   
    THE VOLUME OF YOUR TANK     

00:02:58.064 --> 00:02:59.364
    WITH BASEBALL HELMETS!      

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.034
         &lt;Motherboard&gt;          
 YOU CERTAINLY HIT A HOME RUN   
            TODAY.              

00:03:02.068 --> 00:03:05.237
  THAT REMINDS ME - I'VE GOT    
          TO GET BACK           

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:07.639
     TO BATTING PRACTICE!       
     IT'S MY TURN TO HIT!       

00:03:07.674 --> 00:03:11.243
 OH, MATT. BEFORE YOU GO BACK,  
 I HAVE A LITTLE TIP FOR YOU.   

00:03:11.277 --> 00:03:15.314
 CHOKE UP ON THE BAT - AND HIT  
 THE BALL WHERE IT'S PITCHED!   

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:17.282
GEE, YOU REALLY THINK SO?       

00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:21.787
  I KNOW SO. MY TEAM WON THE    
 CYBERWORLD SERIES LAST YEAR.   

00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:23.355

    THANKS MOTHERB, SEE YA!     

00:03:27.827 --> 00:03:32.831

  STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE -    
IT'S CYBERCHASE FOR REAL.       

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:36.468
            &lt;Girl&gt;              
  HI, YOU'RE EXACTLY ON TIME.   
        COME IN.                

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.537

 SO HOW'S ANTHONY AND MATHEW?   

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:39.505
            &lt;Girl&gt;              
 THEY'RE WONDERFUL. THEY JUST   
         FELL ASLEEP.           

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:40.606
    THEY SHOULD BE SLEEPING     
     FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS      

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.274
AND I'LL BE BACK BY THEN.       

00:03:42.308 --> 00:03:44.209
  I LEFT SOME SNACKS FOR YOU.   
  MAKE ALL THE NOISE YOU WANT   

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:46.645
THEY'RE REALLY SOUND SLEEPERS,  
BUT WHEN THEY DO WAKE UP        

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.647
  I LEFT YOU A DETAILED NOTE    
        IN THE KITCHEN.         

00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:50.516
 BUT I SHOULD BE BACK BY THEN.

00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:05.697
 SHE'S HAD FOR A YEAR. IN THIS  
SHOW SHE HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN  

00:04:05.732 --> 00:04:08.434
HER OLD BOYFRIEND OR THE DOCTOR 
WHO IS TAKING CARE OF HER       

00:04:08.468 --> 00:04:11.770
 EVER SINCE THAT JAR OF PASTA

     IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

        THE NOTE.               

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:54.580
OKAY. BIANCA, IF THE TWINS WAKE 
    UP, MAKE SOME FORMULA.      

00:04:54.614 --> 00:05:26.745
 PLEASE MAKE A FEW NINE OUNCE   
        BOTTLES.                

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.784
MAKETHIS ONE LOOKS SHORTER      
BUT LET ME GIVE IT A TRY.       

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.221
  WOW, I THOUGHT BECAUSE THIS   
      BOTTLE WAS SHORTER        

00:05:36.256 --> 00:05:40.292
THAT IT HOLDS LESS. BUT REALLY  
IT HOLDS MORE THAN NINE OUNCES. 

00:05:40.326 --> 00:05:41.360
  LET ME JUST FILL THIS TALL    
            BOTTLE.             

00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:44.229
I'M SURE IT'LL HOLD NINE        
            OUNCES.             

00:05:45.298 --> 00:05:48.801
THIS BOTTLE IS TALLER BUT HOLDS 
    LESS THAN NINE OUNCES.      

00:05:48.835 --> 00:05:50.035
         I'M CONFUSED.          

00:05:51.237 --> 00:05:53.272
    OKAY, OKAY, I'M COMING.     

00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:59.411
HEY! THIS BOTTLE HAS A SMALLER  
    BASE THAN THIS BOTTLE.      

00:06:00.847 --> 00:06:04.917
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LARGE ENOUGH, 
      BUT LET ME TRY IT.        

00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:07.719
  IT'S A DIFFERENT SHAPE BUT    
HOLDS EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT.  

00:06:07.754 --> 00:06:10.055
  I WONDER ABOUT THE OTHERS.    

00:06:12.192 --> 00:06:14.393
OKAY BOYS, HERE'S DINNER.       

00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:17.830
 P.S. EVEN THOUGH THE BOTTLES   
  LOOK DIFFERENT ALL OF THEM    

00:06:17.864 --> 00:06:21.233
 ARE NINE OUNCE BOTTLES EXCEPT  
FOR TWO I PUT ON THE SIDE       

00:06:21.267 --> 00:06:23.735
 SO YOU WOULDN'T BE CONFUSED.   

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.406
 ME CONFUSED? EVERYBODY KNOWS   
THAT CONTAINERS CAN HAVE        

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.444
DIFFERENT SHAPES AND STILL HOLD 
  THE SAME AMOUNT OF LIQUID.    

00:06:32.946 --> 00:06:34.313
        THEY'RE ASLEEP.
