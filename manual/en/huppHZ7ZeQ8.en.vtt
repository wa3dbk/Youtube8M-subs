00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:04.041
The HTC Wildfire is one of our friendliest smart phones.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.825
It's a phone full of HTC ideas

00:00:07.417 --> 00:00:08.825
Ideas like Friend Stream,

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:13.135
which makes it easier than ever to share updates, photos and links with friends.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.636
And which puts you at the very centre of your circle of friends.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.887
But before we dive deep into Friend Stream

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:22.449
and all the other new additions to the HTC Wildfire,

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:24.012
let's take a quick tour.

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:28.512
The HTC Wildfire is one of our most compact smart phones.

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:31.292
We've given it curved, softer edges

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:34.604
and made it smooth to touch as well as super tough.

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:37.449
There's an FM radio built-in.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.979
You can also load it up with lots of MP3 music files.

00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:45.669
And thanks to the standard audio jack, you can listen to them using your own headphones.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.669
We've added a five-megapixel video camera on the back.

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:52.980
And so you can browse through your photos once you've taken them,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.793
we've given the HTC Wildfire a big screen.

00:00:56.674 --> 00:00:58.300
It's an advanced touch screen, too.

00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:00.230
If you pinch your home screen,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.763
your home panels turn into mini thumbnails.

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:04.738
You can see them all at a glance.

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:07.200
And when you've found the one you want, just tap.

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:12.450
We've added one of our newest pieces of innovation to the HTC Wildfire.

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:14.419
Now when someone calls,

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:18.450
your phone automatically turns your ring-tone down the moment you lift it up.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.326
And when you don't want to be interrupted,

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:26.327
just flip your phone over to make it go silent.

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:31.919
Friend stream lets you keep up with who you want, when you want.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:33.793
It works like this:

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:38.667
All your friends' posts, messages, tweets and updates pop up on the same screen.

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:42.324
They update automatically, so there's no need to click anything.

00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:44.168
They update instantly, too.

00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:46.981
You can slide through updates, photos and shared links

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.075
and keep completely up to speed.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:52.794
You can also post an update on all your own profiles in one go.

00:01:54.763 --> 00:01:59.232
With the HTC Wildfire, you can pick from thousands of apps at Android Market.

00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:01.982
But we've also included application sharing.

00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:05.420
It's a super fast way to recommend apps to your friends.

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:09.107
Say a friend of yours was going on a long trip tomorrow.

00:02:09.357 --> 00:02:12.357
If you found the perfect game to help them kill some time;

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:13.888
you could send it straight to them

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.575
You could email or text the link to it.

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:19.012
You could even post it to your Friend Stream.

00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:22.450
That way, you could share apps with all your friends at the same time.

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:27.638
When someone calls you, their name and face flash up on screen.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.076
But we thought, why stop at names and faces?

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:35.575
So we've designed a way for you to get more information about your friends when they call.

00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:36.857
Like their birthday.

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:38.513
And Facebook status

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.951
Now there's no need to remember someone's big day.

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:44.044
Your phone will do it for you.

00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:48.295
The simple stuff is better on The HTC Wildfire, too.

00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.483
Like getting in touch with your friends.

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:54.608
With our new People widget, you can sort your contacts into groups.

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:56.733
And choose the best way to get in touch.

00:02:57.075 --> 00:03:00.890
So calling, emailing or texting is just a tap away.

00:03:02.388 --> 00:03:03.826
Browsing's better, too.

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.888
We've added text auto reflow.

00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:12.327
It means, when you zoom in to a web page, the text automatically adjusts to fit properly onto your screen.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.546
You can access Wikipedia and Google translate with a couple of taps.

00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:21.014
And with the HTC Wildfire flash enabled,

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:24.359
you can now view more sites on your mobile than ever before.

00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:29.391
Wildfire comes with our brand new News app, too.

00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:34.639
Just pick the news sites you want to read, and you'll get customized news pinged straight to your phone,

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.546
whenever and wherever you want it.

00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:42.141
Thanks to HTC Sense, making your phone your own has never been easier.

00:03:42.607 --> 00:03:43.545
So what can you do?

00:03:44.047 --> 00:03:47.703
Well, for a start, your home screen contains seven separate panels.

00:03:48.054 --> 00:03:50.639
You can pick and choose what you'd like on each of them.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.296
So if that was your photo album, just select it.

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:57.265
Then whenever you want to view your photos, just tap once and you're in.

00:03:57.827 --> 00:04:00.296
You can arrange everything just how you want it.

00:04:00.296 --> 00:04:02.795
And with more widgets available than ever before,

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:05.297
you'll definitely find all the shortcuts you'll need.

00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:07.639
So there you have it.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.422
The HTC Wildfire.

00:04:09.422 --> 00:04:12.421
A phone packed full of little HTC ideas

00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:15.358
A phone created for people who love to share.

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:18.390
A phone that brings your friends to you.
