00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.842
(Bronte Tilbrook) Hi,
I’m Bronte Tilbrook.

00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:07.958
I’m an oceanographer
and I work for CSIRO.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:09.970
I go out on this ship,
the Southern Surveyor,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.557
to measure how much carbon
dioxide’s in the ocean.

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:16.109
The level of carbon dioxide in the
ocean is really important because

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.508
it affects our Earth’s
climate and it also affects

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:22.470
how a lot of important organisms in
the ocean grow including corals.

00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:25.675
The thing I like about being
a research scientist is that

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.951
I get to work on really
interesting problems

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.981
and I also get to work
out on the ocean.

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:32.886
The Southern Surveyor is the
Marine National Facility

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:36.345
and any scientist in Australia can
ask to use the ship for research,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.065
so let’s go on board and
I’ll show you around.

00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:44.045
[Music plays]

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.426
Watch your step here.

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.556
This is a storm step
and it’s what keeps

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:50.085
the water out of the
ship in rough weather.

00:00:51.754 --> 00:00:53.243
Even though the ship’s really big

00:00:53.244 --> 00:00:55.773
it only handles 14 research
crew at any one time,

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:59.840
and the walkways are really narrow
and the doors are very heavy.

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:03.723
At the front of the
ship which is called

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:05.616
the bow there are
cabins for sleeping,

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:07.615
so let’s go and have a look.

00:01:11.096 --> 00:01:13.480
Most cabins on the
ship have two bunks

00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:16.176
and see this piece
of material up here,

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:19.177
this is what stops us
rolling out in rough seas,

00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:22.644
and over here we
have the bathroom

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:24.922
and it’s just like a
bathroom you’d have at home

00:01:24.923 --> 00:01:26.969
so you’ve got a shower,
a toilet and a sink.

00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:29.994
We get our fresh water from
a reverse osmosis machine

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.897
which turns salt
water into fresh

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:34.302
and we also have hot water
just like you would at home.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.426
(Dave) G’day, Bronte.
(Bronte) Oh, g’day, Dave.

00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:38.007
(Dave) I’ve got top bunk this trip.

00:01:38.062 --> 00:01:39.498
(Bronte) Yep, that’s right.

00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:41.204
The worst thing about
the top bunk is

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.621
that it’s a long way to the
toilet if you get seasick,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.690
and I once spent a
whole week in the bunk

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:50.862
being seasick between Hobart
and Fremantle, it was awful.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.007
So let’s go for a quick tour
of the ship before breakfast.

00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:56.326
I don’t know about you
but I’m starving.

00:01:57.713 --> 00:02:00.076
Down the hallway from the
cabins is the laundry

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:02.736
and we have to do all our
own cleaning of our cabins

00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:04.859
and we have to do
our own laundry.

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:08.320
So if you’re on the ship for a long
time it’s hard to get exercise

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:11.369
so we have a gym where we
can do little workouts.

00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:14.651
So when we have some free time
there’s a recreation room

00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:18.224
where we can read books and
watch videos and play darts.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:24.279
This is a fridge on the ship, it has
to be really big to hold a lot of food

00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:27.984
for long sea voyages and it contains
things like milk and vegetables.

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.064
This is the ship’s pantry. It’s where
a lot of the other food’s held

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:35.924
and it has really
big, sturdy shelves

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.366
so when the ship rolls
the food won’t fall out.

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:47.769
[Music plays]

00:02:47.832 --> 00:02:49.371
Hi, Eric.
(Eric) Hey, Bronte.

00:02:51.893 --> 00:02:55.210
(Bronte)This is the mess room.
This is where we have our meals.

00:02:55.223 --> 00:02:57.951
We have three meals a day, so
for breakfast we might have

00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:00.654
bacon and eggs and French toast,

00:03:00.698 --> 00:03:05.230
and for lunch and dinner we have
things like steak and pasta,

00:03:05.328 --> 00:03:09.994
and the food’s really good, and
the desserts are also excellent.

00:03:12.577 --> 00:03:14.001
Hi, Dave.

00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:15.166
(Dave) Hi, Bronte.

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:17.189
(Bronte) Hi, Lee
(Lee) Hi, Bronte.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:20.447
(Bronte) Life on board the Southern
Surveyor’s really comfortable

00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:22.489
and I’m just going to
eat my breakfast now,

00:03:22.522 --> 00:03:24.368
so thanks for coming
on board with me.
