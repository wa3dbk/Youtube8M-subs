Hi, I am Sim Smith and welcome to keep calm
and bake series.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:13.430
In this episode, we are going to make a bakewell
tart.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.690
A bakewell tart is a real British classic.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.000
It is a basic pastry cake filled with sticky
raspberry jam, and on top of that we are going

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.240
to put a buttery french pan almond topping.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.670
We are going to start with making the pastry.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.880
To do this, sift the flower into a large bowl.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.510
Then you are going to add the butter and make
it into a bread crumb consistency.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.079
After that, you just need to add the water
in, mix it all together until the pastry comes

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.719
out clean.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.710
Then you need to lightly flour the surface,
put the pastry on top and roll out.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.630
You will probably find it quite useful if
you put the tin on top of the pastry and you

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.750
should have an inch all the way around the
tin.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.463
Then tear off a piece of the pastry and use
it to push the sides of the pastry into the

00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:02.463
tin.

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:03.463
Cut off the excess with a sharp knife.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.370
Put in the fridge for 30 minutes.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.630
While the pastry is in the fridge, we are
going to make the filling.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.010
The first thing you need to do is put the
butter in the pan.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000
Over medium heat, add the butter and melt
it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.010
For any details about this recipe, just look
at the description box and you can find anything

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.230
you need there.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.690
Once the butter is melted, you need to take
it off the heat.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.460
And then to that, you are going to add the
castor sugar, which goes in first.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.810
You stir that around until it mixes up.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.070
You need to mix it until it gets to a syrupy
consistency.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.560
Then it is time to add the ground almonds
and mix those in.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.690
This will thicken the mixture up quite a bit,
and it will start to smell amazing.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.860
Now that you have your paste, it is time to
add the egg in, which will loosen it up a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.860
little bit.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.530
You also need half a teaspoon of almond extract,
just to give it that extra almondy kick.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.450
Then you mix it all together.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.180
The mixes come together very well, and it
is smelling amazing.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.329
If you like almonds, this is really for you.

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.930
Our pastry cake is out of the fridge now,
perfectly chilled, and what we need to do

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:28.680
now is pop some jam in here, which is going
to form the base of the tart.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.629
Once that is in, all you need to do is add
the mix in.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.069
It should just pour in, but I like to use
a spatula to make sure I get every last bit

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.069
in there.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.010
And you want to pour it over the whole dish,
so it makes spreading easy.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.680
You will need to cover all the jam.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:04.939
You want to spread the mixture over the jam,
rather than let the jam seep in from underneath.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:10.299
Once you finish spreading, the last touch
is the flaked almonds on top.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.790
Just sprinkle those lightly, giving it an
even coverage.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.939
Then it is ready to bake in a oven for about
25 minutes.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.959
The bakewell tart is out of the oven and it
smells amazing.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.569
The whole kitchen literally smells like almonds.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.269
Now what I am going to do is pop some icing
on the top to make it look a little prettier.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:37.019
I am just going to ice very carefully like
a criss cross effect across the tart.

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.819
This is great serving with tea at tea time
or even after dinner.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.889
It is also a really recipe to do, and a great
one to take around to a friends house.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:48.889
That is it.

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:49.889
That is my country bakewell tart.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.680
I hope to see you soon in another episode
and we are going to go enjoy this now!
