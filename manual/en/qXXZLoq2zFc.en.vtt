00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.839
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Do you want to be infected with Ebola

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.370
without having to leave your own home or
deal with other people?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.670
Well, you might be in luck. You can
already download an Ebola virus

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.380
genome.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.770
Right here on the Internet, right now.
And if you're willing to wait

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.949
a few years for 3D bioprinting
technology to progress

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.720
a little bit, you can just acquire one
then, submit the genome to it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.250
and ta da! All you can print Ebola.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.940
Or anthrax or whatever it is you wish to
mass-produce at home

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.380
to wipe out humanity.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.520
Are humans going to go extinct

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.530
soon? Will human extinction be

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.989
anthropogenic? That is the result of human

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.550
action. Or will it be one of the good old-fashioned kinds

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.449
of extinction Earth's history knows pretty well?

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.359
The Global Catastrophic Risks Survey,
issued by Oxford University's

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.470
Future of Humanity Institute placed our risk of extinction

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.950
before the year 2100 at 19%.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.970
Now, you might be thinking "whatever, blah
blah blah armageddon".

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.400
"It'll be okay, humans are too smart

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.860
to go extinct." Maybe you're right.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.570
But it's difficult to predict the distant future

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.010
with a lot of certainty. What's really cool though

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.990
is that if you embrace that uncertainty,
a simple argument

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.330
can show that human extinction soon is actually

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.360
more probable. It's called the Doomsday

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.380
argument. Imagine a giant

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.540
urn that contains either 10 balls

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.259
numbered 1 to 10, or a million balls

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.399
numbered 1 to a million. Now, you don't know

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.000
which is the case, but you are allowed to pull out

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.289
one ball. You go ahead and do that

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.770
and it is ball number 4.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.000
That's pretty strong evidence in favour
of the 10 ball condition

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.750
because drawing a four from a set of 1 through 10

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.370
is a one in 10 chance. But drawing four
from a million different numbers

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.650
is a one in a million chance.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.100
By analogy you are also a numbered

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.470
ball. You are a human who knows

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.790
approximately what your birth number is.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.049
It's probably somewhere around 100

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.120
billion. That's how many other humans

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.540
were most likely born before you were.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.040
Importantly, you didn't get to decide which birth number

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.170
you would have. So, just like the number for a ball,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.420
you are a random sample from the set of all humans

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.549
who will ever live. The Doomsday argument points out

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.519
that from 200 billion people there's a
50 percent chance that a randomly chosen

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.540
person,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.810
like you, would be born in the first one hundred billion.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.870
Whereas if there will be 10 trillion humans,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.950
there's only a one percent chance that any given human,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.209
say you, would happen to be born within the first

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.440
100 billion. Either you are special

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.050
and lucky to be born so improbably
early in the story of humanity

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.390
or your birth number is to be expected

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.840
because there will not be tens of trillions of humans.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.390
Human extinction will be sooner

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.730
rather than later. But before you become

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.440
too convinced that the end is nigh, keep
in mind that the Doomsday argument is

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.240
not

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.730
uncontroversial. One problem it might have

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.560
is a reference class problem. Are you really a

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.920
random sample from the set of all humans who will ever

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.020
be born? Well, if you believe that in the
not so distant future

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.420
humans will be quite different than they are today.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.460
For instance, there'll be full of more 3D printed

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.800
organs. The mere fact that right now
there aren't very many humans

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.660
with that trait could be evidence that
you aren't a random sample from the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.920
set of all humans,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.150
just from the set of all humans like

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.960
you, like does around you. Those born

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.650
earlier in human history. Also

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.910
the Doomsday argument
doesn't consider the likelihoods

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.060
of actual threats or human advantages

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.630
over those threats in the future. It just assumes that

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.180
we don't know which way the balance will lie; that

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.610
human extinction soon and human extinction

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.530
later are equally likely.
But maybe you don't believe that.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.540
Maybe you are convinced that human ingenuity will

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.960
always stay one step ahead of any extinction event

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.150
thrown at it. You could be right,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.700
but there's reason to doubt that optimism.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.900
For example, the Fermi paradox.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.900
If it is likely that intelligent
life forms in our universe are capable

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.530
of living for billions

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.199
and billions of years, where are they?

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.250
Why are the skies so silent? Perhaps

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.250
it is because extinction level threat events are just

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.860
too common for intelligent life anywhere

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.680
to ever catch up.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.400
So,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.930
does this mean we should just give up?

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.030
The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement think so.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.440
Founded in 1991, its supporters believe that

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.440
humans are a negative influence

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.360
on Earth and always will be. Thus

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.260
we have a moral obligation to just stop reproducing

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.770
right now and fade away. But what would

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.110
a computer do? In a way, that's

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.050
kind what Tom 7 did. He created a
program that plays video games.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.210
The program came up with novel
techniques and strategies for playing

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.510
games and even exploited glitches

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.699
humans didn't know about, or at least

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.240
hadn't told it about. He also had the
program play other games,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.720
like Tetris, which I think is relevant

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.560
to our question. The computer struggled to
figure out what to do.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.919
You see, the computer wasn't programmed
to consider future repercussions far

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:37.880
enough ahead

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.820
to notice that stacking Tetriminos in
certain ways

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.770
made a big difference. On one run, when faced with

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.750
imminent demise, the computer did something

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.820
eerie. Rather than

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.970
lose, and receive a 'game over',

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.340
it just paused the game. For

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.280
ever. Tom 7 describes the computer's reasoning

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.450
like this: "The only winning move

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.870
is to not play." And that's right.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.990
If you pause a game for ever

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:22.240
you will never lose that game. But you'll also never

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.470
win that game or achieve a high score.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.430
Now, we might not know what achieving a

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.490
sentient life high score in this universe

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.750
means or whether or not we're capable of
achieving one.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.090
We might also sometimes panic

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.840
when the future looks bleak. But if we keep playing

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.510
and keep learning, chances are we could eventually

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.750
figure it out and start playing

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.870
really well.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.500
So, thanks for continuing to play, for being here.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.880
And as always,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.880
thanks for watching.
