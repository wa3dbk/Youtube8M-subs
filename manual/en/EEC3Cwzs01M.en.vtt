All Things Are Ready
A Bride’s Complete Christian Wedding Planner

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.630
Amy Hayes, author of All Things Are Ready

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.880
I wrote this planner as a help to Christian
brides out there who are looking for something

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.160
that is both efficient and organized for planning
your wedding, but also addresses a desire

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.450
to please God in every aspect of your wedding,
and to honor him in both the preparations,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.450
and in the day itself.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.150
I got the idea for "All Things Are Ready"
with my only daughter in mind.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.430
I thought that it would be nice to pull together
my different experiences from planning and

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.770
helping with several different weddings, and
give her a tool for planning her own wedding

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.940
when the time comes.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.320
In writing a Christian wedding planner, I
tried to address three main issues.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.260
The first of which was the length of your
engagement.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.410
I tried to write this planner based with tools
that could fit any timeline, but also that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.110
a wedding doesn't necessarily need to take
longer than twelve weeks to plan.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.370
So I provide open schedules, but also guidelines
for planning on a somewhat shorter timeline

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.070
than is commonly assumed in today's engagements.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.330
Secondly, that a wedding should be planned
on a budget that a family can afford, without

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.380
having to go into debt for years to come.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.450
And lastly, that a wedding day is about rejoicing
in what the Lord has done in bringing two

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.290
people together, and helping the bride to
focus on that rejoicing aspect.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.030
"All Things Are Ready" is a little bit different
kind of wedding planner.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.090
I remember when I was choosing out my own
planner, it seemed like shelves were full

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.670
of different kinds of binders, but none of
them had a Christian bride in mind.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.789
And they also seemed to all assume that I
was going to be engaged for two or three years.

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.889
It's very easy to get caught up in the midst
of many wedding plans, and forget that you

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:47.640
are planning on becoming a wife at the end
of this plan.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.840
So, I tried to write in devotionals for the
bride in every chapter, and thoughts throughout

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.350
the planner on how to not get stressed out,
to keep your focus on Christ, and to keep

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.540
your focus on what kind of Christian you want
to be while you're a bride.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.540
Included in the book:
A one-page master checklist of essential wedding

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.540
preparations
Key checklists in each chapter to help you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.540
stay organized
Flexible planning and timeline tools that

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.540
work with any length engagement
Chapters address each step of wedding planning

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.540
Lots of creative wedding tips and ideas
A chapter on biblical wedding themes and imagery

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.540
Devotional readings for the bride-to-be
Pockets for organizing receipts, notes, etc.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.540
“This book will help the bride get down
the aisle beautifully and calmly.”

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.540
