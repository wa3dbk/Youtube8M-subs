Hello Everybody

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.001
Shahab Tolouie Here,

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.502
Here's a short update about the progress and changes we're making to this channel,

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:21.603
and to ask you to get involved and to try it...

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:26.504
we're incorporating some of the latest technologies to be in contact with you constantly,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.905
and to give you information about the band,

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:32.106
our rehearsals and the production process from this place.

00:00:32.107 --> 00:00:37.307
actually, this is the place where everything gets started by putting down the ideas and...

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:38.608
arranging the songs

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.309
to the other room, where we can grab guitars, and vocals... and drums &amp; percussions...

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.110
from here, we go to another studio where everything gets mixed down,

00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:50.411
and from there to another studio, where everything gets mastered.

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:55.112
so you get a taste of what's going to be on the next album, prior to everyone else...

00:00:55.113 --> 00:00:59.613
and at the same time you can compare the pre-mix and post-mix sound and

00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:02.314
give us your feedback and bomb us with your opinions,

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:05.415
so we can give you a better final product.

00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:08.316
we'd also love to ask you to join us on the road

00:01:08.317 --> 00:01:10.317
so you get to see how do we travel,

00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:11.818
where do we sleep...

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.819
what do we eat... who do we meet and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.320
how do we get ready for the concert and doing the sound-check...

00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:19.621
lovely people, beautiful cities... and adventures.

00:01:32.123 --> 00:01:34.023
so please subscribe to this channel

00:01:34.024 --> 00:01:37.724
and if you want to receive further information about the tour dates and other releases

00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:41.725
you can also subscribe to mailing list through the official website

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:45.626
and encourage your friends who are interested in such a style of music to join as well.

00:01:45.627 --> 00:01:50.027
to make a big community of people, bombing each other and helping each other to...

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:51.928
make a better music...

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.029
so just a final thing and I stress on that:

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.630
all your comments, whatever you write definitely is read by me and the band

00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:01.431
and while we're away, somewhere out of the range of internet in some country

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:05.532
definitely it's read by the team and most important questions are handed over to us

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.133
to be answered personally.

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:11.234
and please keep your questions relative to the subject we're talking about

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:14.935
and believe me, we receive really unrelated question about, I don't know...

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:18.236
is it OK for me to get married if I wanna be a musician?

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:21.337
I don't know if it's good for you to get married... lol

00:02:21.338 --> 00:02:22.838
I'm not the right person to answer that. so...

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.939
please keep your questions related to the subject

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.640
and I'm happy to answer all the questions

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.441
and looking forward to seeing you all guys...

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:32.442
Cheers!!!

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:34.043
bye for now
