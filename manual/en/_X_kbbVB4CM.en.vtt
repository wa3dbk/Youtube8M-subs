00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:11.617
- And these are not just
sort of abstract concepts.

00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:13.758
It's a very exciting time
in cognitive science.

00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:14.878
I'm not a cognitive scientist but

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:15.798
I'm gonna walk you though something

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:17.739
that I think is really interesting.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:20.518
In terms of studying
automaticity and fluency.

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:22.518
The wonderful graphic that you're looking

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:24.263
at right now, it's a little
bit faint but don't worry,

00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:25.502
it's gonna get better in a second.

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:26.615
This is a FMRI.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.729
Okay, Functional Magnetic
Residence Imaging.

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.910
And it's basically cross
sections of your brain

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.750
and they're looking at brain activity.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.093
And this is one of the pioneering studies

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:36.972
from 2005 where they were using FMRIs

00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:39.711
to look at how does the
brain chang over time

00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:42.990
as a result of developing
automaticity with math facts?

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.270
'Cause we have these
things like working memory

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.992
and all these ideas but, like,
what's actually happening

00:00:45.992 --> 00:00:48.713
in terms of functional
specialization of your brain?

00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:50.490
Turns out quite a bit, mm-kay?

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.040
Now, this is the original graphic

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.769
that they had in that journal article

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.767
where they're labeling all
the brain regions and you'll,

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:59.826
if you can sort of see some
of the regions are blue

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.847
and some of them are color
coated more like an orange-y red.

00:01:02.847 --> 00:01:04.426
Okay, that's a very salient difference.

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:07.266
What they were looking
at were kids who had,

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.307
over time, had developed
a certain level of fluency

00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:11.407
and those that did not.

00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:13.785
They were using conscious
effortful methods

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:14.688
for getting math facts,

00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:17.884
and they give them tasks
involving math facts,

00:01:17.884 --> 00:01:19.225
and then they scan their brains.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:20.286
And what they're trying to go is look

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:22.766
at the average of brain
activations and figure out

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.406
what's different between a kid who's

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:27.745
using an effortful method and
a kid who has that fluency.

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.506
So, what I did to make
it a little bit easier

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.265
for us non-cognitive scientists

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:33.505
is I pulled out some of the colors, okay?

00:01:33.505 --> 00:01:36.425
So, now all you're
seeing is the blue, okay?

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:40.046
These are the kids who are
using effortful methods

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:42.465
and the takeaway here is that
in all the cross sections

00:01:42.465 --> 00:01:44.665
there's a lot of the brain that's lit up,

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:45.985
especially in the prefrontal cortex.

00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:48.505
So, what, they're using a lot of the kinds

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:49.865
of parts of the brain that we'd actually

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:51.906
want them using for the more advanced

00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:53.565
procedure that you're trying to teach them

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:56.545
like adding fractions
with unlike denominators.

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:58.146
Mm-kay?

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:02.421
Once a kid has developed
automaticity that's the part

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.654
They're using more of
the back of the brain

00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:05.793
because they're just
retrieving facts from memory.

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:07.192
Now, we, of course, are educators.

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:08.635
We want kids using their brains.

00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:10.235
Ah, we want them using their brains

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:12.254
on the right things in
our classroom at the time.

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:14.853
At a certain point, sure,
they're learning the math facts

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:17.734
but very soon thereafter
that we want them to utilize

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:19.941
the math facts when
they're adding fractions

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:21.861
with unlike denominators
or something like that.

00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:23.042
So, you can see how when you've got

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.542
this very precious finite resource

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:27.522
and your brain is sort of
lit up like a Christmas tree

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.323
just with the math fact part of it,

00:02:30.323 --> 00:02:33.929
what's left for the thing that
you're trying to teach, okay?

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.569
And so, Menon in 2010, he was
actually one of the people

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.978
who was part of that 2005 study.

00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:43.712
To summarize the text up there
what it's basically saying is

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:46.943
if the prefrontal cortex
is loaded with just

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:49.041
the process of coming
up with the math facts

00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:51.343
there's a problem, there's
a computational load there.

00:02:51.343 --> 00:02:52.842
So, what we have to do is figure out

00:02:52.842 --> 00:02:55.161
teaching strategies that
as quickly as possible

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:57.482
through efficient repeatedly
practice get it back

00:02:57.482 --> 00:02:59.223
so that it's being retrieved
from long-term memory.

00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:00.463
Because they basically look at the brain.

00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:01.820
Now, this is gonna be a simplification.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.081
It's a couple of boxes and
functional parts, right?

00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:05.502
Where you have fact retrieval.

00:03:05.502 --> 00:03:06.582
You have executive control.

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:09.342
And you have computation and
working memory over here.

00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:12.802
And if these, the executive
control and the computation

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:14.919
are consumed with your math fact process,

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.961
you don't have that finite resource left

00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:19.051
for the things that you really care about.
