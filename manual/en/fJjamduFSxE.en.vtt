00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.290
Hey guys, what is up!
Gameloft just released a new game called Dungeon

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.760
Gems, so I have downloaded it and let's go
take a look, shall we?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.760
As you can see the game is in portrait mode
and it is a puzzle style game.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.680
Let's start the game. Okay, let's just skip
it!

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:35.060
This is some kind of tutorial as usual with
these kind of game.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.760
Okay, so I just choose my target and use the
spells or something. Also, the thingies there

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.399
actually move as you can see.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.760
Some animation, let's skip it again! Oh, and
the boss is already there! A Dragon!

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.250
Apparently, these are called runes. What the
hell is going on, I have no idea but OK!

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.869
I think I just lost... 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.450
Prepare for war!
Alright, so there are 3 elements - water,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.790
fire and wood. Choose fire hero, fire is stronger
against wood. Of course, yeah!

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:36.190
Let's choose fire. Here I have to enter my
name. Let's just go with AppBros. Apparently,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.700
I just misswrote it.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.000
It seems like there will be a lot of levels
in this game. Let's just choose the first one.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.280
It looks like there are some kind of cards in this game.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.400
Okay, so apparently I own 3 members and the
opponent is only one.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.340
Oh, I am starting to get it! So I have 3 heroes,
one is fire, water and the other one is wood.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.439
And the runes over there represent them.
So if I choose the fire runes, the fire one

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.440
will attack the opponent.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.780
Oh, so this is pretty much like Pokemons used
to be! I mean, it looks like the opponents

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.189
have some kind of artifacts like this one
is water, this is fire, this

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:45.229
one is wood. So if I use water on wood, it
should do little damage.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.920
And the boss is there, let's heal up!

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.120
Okay, and now I can attack with 2 of my heroes
simultaneously!?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.420
What? 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.240
That's interesting, I just got combos out of nowhere! 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.180
And after each level you gain experience 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.080
and money, so I guess there will
be a shop in this game

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.140
where you can then spend your money on new
items etc. 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.940
A new hero! 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.340
No, I do not want to send 
an invitation to my friends!

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:19.029
Alright, and here's my team, which I can edit
and add new members and probably also delete them.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.200
Here's the dungeon. And here's the second
level.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:33.210
As I told you before there are multiple levels
in this game, probably over 50. ,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.520
Yeah guys, that's about it, this is the new game!
