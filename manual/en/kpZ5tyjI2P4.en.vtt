00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.490
You may have noticed that when you deposit
money into a bank, sometimes you have access

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.710
to that money right away while at other times
it might take a few days before it becomes

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.360
available for you to use.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.650
Why the difference?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.690
Well, it often has to do with the way banks
process different types of deposits.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.679
If you make a cash deposit with the teller
at your bank, the money will often be available

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.169
in your account immediately, or the next business
day, depending on your bank's policy.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.650
Your teller will be able to let you know.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.140
If you deposit cash using your bank's ATM,
it might be available right away, or it could

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.190
take a few days.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.260
This is because some ATMs automatically count
the bills as you deposit them, but others

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.670
require you to put your cash in an envelope
which a bank teller will verify later.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.650
Scheduled direct deposits from a payer�like
your employer�are usually available in your

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.080
account on your regular payday � or the
following business day.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.280
That�s because the bank that the deposit
is coming from will schedule a credit to your

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.920
account through your bank in advance.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.079
That means that the processing�making sure
the account that the deposit is coming from

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.530
has enough money to cover the transaction--can
also happen in advance.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.870
When you deposit a check at a bank or ATM,
it can take a little more time because your

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.570
bank needs to collect the funds from the payer,
whose account might be at a different bank.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.090
It works like this:

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.190
When you deposit the check at your bank, they
will send the check or an electronic image

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.280
of the check to the payer's bank .

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.610
Some large banks work directly with each other
to clear checks.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.290
But many others will send a check through
an intermediary called a clearing house in

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.020
order to process it.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.340
The clearinghouse will sort all the transactions
coming from one bank to another and send the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.590
correct amount of money to each.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.640
Then the individual check amounts will be
posted to each account.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.490
Now, another thing to keep in mind is that
even if some or all of your deposit is available

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.700
in your account, it doesn�t necessarily
mean that the check has cleared.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.640
If there isn't enough money in the payer's
account, or if the check is fraudulent or

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.049
counterfeit, the check will be returned unpaid.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.900
And this can happen after your bank has made
the money available to you.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.010
So if you've already withdrawn the money,
you'll be held responsible for paying it back,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.149
and sometimes there can be fees associated
with this.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.130
Now, the amount of your check deposit can
also affect how quickly the money is available.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.060
Generally, if your deposit is $200 or less,
you�ll have access to the money by the next

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.990
business day.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.750
But larger amounts can take longer to become
available.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.170
Your bank may make a portion of your check
available within the next business day or

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.310
two, but some banks may hold a portion of
a check over $5000 for multiple business days.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.201
There are also a few reasons a bank might
delay portions of certain deposits�and most

00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:40.260
of them have to do with managing risk.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.800
A bank can lose money if a check is fraudulent
or counterfeit.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.870
So, if the deposit is being made into a recently
opened checking account, or if the deposit

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.630
is unusual based on the account�s history�

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.180
or if the account has a history of frequent
overdrafts, the bank might take more time

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.440
before it makes the money available .
There are other factors that can delay the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.080
availability of a check deposit as well, so
if you need to know when your money will become

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.680
available, talk to a bank representative when
you make your deposit.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.660
Mobile deposits � where you snap a picture
of your check that gets sent electronically

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.970
to your bank � are generally processed the
same way regular check deposits are.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.940
They can save you a trip to the bank, but
how long it takes to process them can vary

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.459
from bank to bank.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.940
You can check your bank�s mobile deposit
policy to know when you can expect your money

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.069
to be available.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.150
One more thing that can affect when your deposit
becomes available is how your bank defines

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.739
the end of a �business day.� Most people
think of a business day as being a regular

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.390
weekday from nine to five.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.641
But, depending on the bank and the type of
deposit, the end of day- that is, the cutoff

00:03:46.641 --> 00:03:50.280
time, can actually be any time from noon until
midnight.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.500
So, if your bank has a 3pm cutoff time and
you deposit a check at 3.30, the bank won�t

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.080
consider your check deposited until the following
day.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.459
Which means it could take an extra day before
you have access to your money.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.989
Some banks have later cut off times for ATM
and mobile deposits� so if you miss the

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.239
cut-off time to deposit a check in person,
you may have other options to deposit your

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.120
check within the same business day.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.970
Different banks have different policies regarding
when money from deposits is made available.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.630
So if you need to know when your money will
be available, you can review your bank's deposit

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.080
availability policy, or talk to a bank representative
to make sure you have access to your money

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.910
when you need it.
