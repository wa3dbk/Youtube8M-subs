Wassap ballas? This week we have no idea what the
fu** is going on with Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.309
Vonnegut.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.039
Now let’s get somethin straight,
playboy. The first chapter of this book ain’t

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.300
exactly like the rest. Here, we chillin with
a narrator who sounds A LOT like Kurt Vonnegut.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.460
This fool been tryin to write about livin’
through the bombing of Dresden back in Dub-Dub

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.650
Deuce. But since nothing in war makes a damn
bit of sense, the story he gonna tell us is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.000
just a big ol mind-fu**.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.190
Billy Pilgrim musta smoked too much
o dat chronic cuz this fool is “unstuck

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.579
in time”- meanin he always jumpin through
random moments in his life and he can’t

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.129
do nuthin bout it.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.539
As he crawling through the sh**
rollin 4 deep, Billy wanders away, gets unstuck

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.780
in time, and WACK he time-trips to his future
as a creased-up optometrist. And after trippin

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.060
through other life events, BAM Billy slides
on back to the war and gets GOT by the Germans.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.320
Our boy gets his ass tossed on a
train when ZOW, back to the future, B. And

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.790
now- here comes some MUTHAfu**IN ALIENS IN
A MUTHAfu**IN FLYING SAUCER.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.260
Billy takes one look at these green
hustlas called Tralfamadorians and be like

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.640
“yo. Why me??” And they all like “Why
anything? sh** just is. Cuz."

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.960
ZIPPITY ZAP, playa. Back on the train,
and now peeps be dyin left and right. They

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.890
reach the camp and ZOOP- Billy trips to the
alien crib where they got him locked up like

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.810
a zoo animal. Ain’t all bad though, cuz
he gets locked up with a bangin movie star

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.610
named Montana Wildhack.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.430
ZEFF! Billy wakes up right
before it’s lights out. B-pill gets capped

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.420
and dies. That it? NOPE. HADOUKEN! Back to
1945 where the Germans put him and da other

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.120
homies on lockdown in a slaughterhouse.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.240
When Dresden gets WRECKED by a
firebombing, Billy survives cuz he got put

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.730
in a meatlocker.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.319
WANG! 25 years later, Billy gets on
a plane with some otha optometrist homies

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.290
when the damn thing crashes! One head-whack
later, Billy’s runnin his mouth on the radio

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.659
bout Tralfamadore and flying saucers.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.599
ZAM. Back in Dresden, the
bombings’s over and errythings quiet. cept

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.519
for a lil’ bird say “POO-TEE-WEET.”

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.969
What the hell?! If you think POO-
TEE-WEET don’t make a lick of sense, then

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.359
well done playboy. Where’d you get that
P.H.D from?

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.900
All that birds jibber-jabbering is
a symbol for how the narrator feels about

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.939
war. Senseless.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.180
That’s one of this book’s main
beefs: that there ain’t nothing smart to

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.640
say about war. And when you talkin bout the  
death of 135,000 people, logic just don’t

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.220
apply.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.260
No matter how fly your writing game
be, you can’t describe what’s indescribable.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.670
And any time you try to do it justice, you
gonna end up with a story just like our narrator’s.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.540
So instead of a rap with a beginning, middle,
and end, we get a version that’s all screwed

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.290
and chopped. The structure of dis book is,
in itself, a massacre.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.430
When you’re in a world that’s so
damn broke that you cant even pick up the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.569
pieces, the only choice you got is to look
at it differently. Some playas think that’s

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.569
why the narrator made Billy P an optometrist-
he corrects our vision of the world and helps

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.020
us see that bad stuff happens for no reason.
So it goes...

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.880
But good stuff happens to all those
that press subscribe. Catch you next week, padna.
