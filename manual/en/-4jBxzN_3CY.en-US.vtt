00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.100
 IFA 2014, held at the beginning of this month, in Berlin. Xperia Z3 Compact was announced.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.224
And also announced, out of Japan.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.700
So I bought it at 1shopmobile.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.680
about the dress box, design was modified as compared global version or national version Xperia.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.358
There are some attachments. user guide, overseas standard AC adopter, microUSB, and earphone.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.140
Unfortunately, magnet desk holder was not.

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.989
the color I got is orange. but the orange is the mostly nearest red.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.233
the side of the phone looks like an transparent amber, so to speak, like a fossil of the sap

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:48.534
about the battery button, design was a little altered.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.700
I felt easy to push, Xperia Z3 rather than Z1f.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.800
the speaker, moved from the bottom to the front  panel. as well as the Z2.  As well as Z2, the strap hole is on the left side,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.240
But, frankly speaking, I felt the strap hole is too narrow to lace through,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.933
Probably we need a thing such as threader.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.559
I felt the size almost unchanged Z1f.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.320
 very handy

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.684
Unchanged size, and the bezel became smaller.

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.881
The screen area became larger. from 4.3" to 4.6"

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.413
HD resolution was unchanged.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.620
Z3 Compact is more handier than  iPhone 6

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.021
but about the thinness, iPhone 6 fought back

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.000
and the weight is well matched.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.081
about the color,the side aside, the back panel is red.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.640
I thought that when I used Xperia P, after all I love red Xperia!

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.900
Tempered glass is adopted at the front and back

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:10.300
The position of both microUSB terminal and microSDcardSlot is not changed. and the SIMcard is altered for nano SIM.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.860
Delax, Satisfying, Compact. Coloring is also Supreme

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.054
Next time, I will review such as a software or the sense of use, continuously.
