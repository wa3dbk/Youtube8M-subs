00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:07.259
Today on our 2003 Dodge Ram Pickup 2500 Series
Heavy Duty, we&amp;#39;ll be installing the Bully

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.769
Black Bull Side Steps in Aluminum, in the
Matte Black Finish with a 7 Inch Step, Part

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.340
Number BBS-1103.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.010
Now our particular vehicle has the Group B
body style, so we&amp;#39;ll be going off of the

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.410
Figure B in the instructions.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.490
That&amp;#39;s the hardware we&amp;#39;ll be using.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.050
Now we&amp;#39;ll start out by installing the
Bully Step here on the driver&amp;#39;s side.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.939
Now that we&amp;#39;ve got the door opened and
the center of our step figured out, now we&amp;#39;ll

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.340
go ahead and take some measurements.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.620
From the center location we need to measure
4 and 1/16 inch out on either side.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.120
So our total distance between our 2 outside
lines, or where we are going to be drilling

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.910
our holes, should be 8 and 1/8 inch.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:01:13.679
Now that we have these locations marked, next

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:25.929
we need 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:46.799
to go ahead 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:58.450
and 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:32.590
center 
up 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:03:09.150
on 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:23.950
the 
pinch weld flange.
