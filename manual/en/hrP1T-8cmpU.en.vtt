00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.930
Hello guys and welcome, we're right now in Poland, in Katowice.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.200
Behind me is a massive stadium, beautiful one, where we have the IEM - Intel Extreme Masters.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.940
World of Tanks is in here now, and pro teams from all of Europe are fighting for a lot of money.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.900
Outside, it's freezing cold man!

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.490
But inside it's burning hot! So let's go inside and check out what's happening.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.720
We're inside now, it's -10 degrees outside, +50 inside.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:01.380
The crowd's getting in, over 22 thousand people will sit here, cheer for the games, we're looking for a massive weekend to come.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.460
Intel Extreme Masters with Wargaming and World of Tanks, here in Katowice.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.680
Welcome to Day 2, the Finals day!

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.920
The day is nearly over guys. It was, as you can see, an exhausting day.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.220
So many crazy things happened, but now finally, we have our grand final knocking at the door.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.520
We have two great teams that made it - the Evil Panda Squad - EPS, and Odem Mortis fighting for the big big money.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.620
Oliver "Laughter": If you're going to do that, you need to be in a position where you can spot them.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.380
Steven "Sne": Because he was spotted, they knew that he was here.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.120
Oliver "Laughter": Tomasz is getting focused down, an absolute treat!

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.410
Steven "Sne": he took a big shell, 700 damage and then no, finished off by the AMX 13 90

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.160
Oliver "Laughter": he does get a miss, but Dr_Tuer's spotted, and he takes one shot, two shots and now he's down.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.920
And god_runze is going to come around the corner, and onto Potomako

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.610
will he go down, 199 down...

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.610
Steven "Sne": Maybe too aggressive there, 24hp left...

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.610
Oliver "Laughter": NewMultiShow trying to save the day, and...

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.040
Steven "Sne": ...he will!
