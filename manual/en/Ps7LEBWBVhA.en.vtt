Hi, I'm Lenee with Lenee Alexander Designs.com.
And I'm here today with expertvillage.com,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.150
and what we're going to be making a small
reversible hand-bag just like this. And this

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.280
is something that I made a while back, and
it's really easy to make. I decided that I

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.860
would show you guys how to make this one.
I've already got my fabric picked out. I'm

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.870
going to put this on one side; I'm going to
put this fabric on the other side. I'm going

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.231
to use this as a strap instead of this kind
of strap, just because I want a long one and

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:33.870
it's easier. I'm going to use this as a clasp,
and these are the buttons I've picked out,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.059
because I think this one will look good on
the black and this one's, this one's going

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.590
to look really good on this, this shiny green
fabric that I, that I have. I actually found

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.109
this at a resale shop. And it's, it's nice
to find fabric or old curtains and recycle

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.020
them into something fun and unique like a
handbag. So let's get started. Okay so now

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.329
we're ready to start cutting this purse out.
This is the black that I want to use so I'm

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.570
just going to eye how much I need. I'm not
really going to measure it. Cause I want it

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.010
to be small anyways, I don't need a big piece.
I think I want something about this big, something

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:17.600
for someone who's small. I'll just start cutting,
there we go. And this purse, you can make

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.600
this purse any size you want. If you want
to make it really big you can, but you might

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.570
want to use a, a sturdier strap than the one
that you, we have picked out for this one.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.570
Now this fabric, with the, idea is, is to
make the same exact size of this cut out in

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.062
this. And that way we can reverse it and it'll
fit. Well I already have this piece and it

00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:49.210
looks like it might be exactly the size that
I need, let me see. Oh look, it's perfect.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.810
I think I'll just use this. I'm going to lay
it down, I'm going to lay the black right

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.540
on top, make sure they're exactly the same
size, and trim off this little extra piece

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.140
right here. Okay well I have my two pieces
ready to go. And I think I'm going to go ahead

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.939
and sit down and start making this purse.
