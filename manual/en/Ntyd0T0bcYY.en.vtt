- This may be a stupid question,

00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:40.607
but who is your Favorite
Star Wars character?

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:41.516

- Han Solo.

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:48.598
- Am I a bad girl if i say Han Solo?

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:51.858
(light piano melody)

00:00:51.858 --> 00:00:53.930
- Any Star Wars location, any planet.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.893
- I know where I wouldn't pick,

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:55.694
it would be Alderaan.

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:56.431
- Alderaan.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.412
- Not Alderaan.

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:58.470
- Not Alderaan?

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.319
(laughing)

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.258
Maybe pre "the incident."

00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:02.375
- Right, right.
(laughing)

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:03.573
Maybe Naboo, Naboo seems nice.

00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:04.314
- There you go.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:04.976
- Naboo.

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:05.889
- Naboo.

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:06.786
- It's so beautiful.

00:01:06.786 --> 00:01:07.652
- Yes it is.

00:01:07.652 --> 00:01:09.033
- The Wookie planet.

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:09.858
- Ok Kashyyyk.

00:01:09.858 --> 00:01:10.496
- Kashyyyk.

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:11.994
- You know, Kashyyk is
actually a really good

00:01:11.994 --> 00:01:12.900
Planet.
- [Host] It's gorgeous.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.362
- With all the trees and everything.

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:16.382
- If you could live on any location

00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:18.518
in the Star Wars universe,
where would it be?

00:01:18.518 --> 00:01:19.160
- Hoth.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.732
- Hoth.

00:01:19.732 --> 00:01:20.817
- I'd want to be at Hoth.

00:01:20.817 --> 00:01:22.050
- Not Hoth.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.770
- Right?

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.827
- Probably Endor.

00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:24.569
- [Host] Endor?

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:25.535
- Endor.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:26.781
Ewoks, they're awesome.

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.083
- I'd have to go Endor.

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:31.758
- As weird as this sounds,
probably on Dagobah.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.441
- Dagobah.

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:35.484
- Let's see, Tatooine's
a little too dry for me.

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:36.900
Dagobah's a little too wet.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.822
I'm sure we could find the ideal planet,

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:41.007
because there are tens
of millions of them.

00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:45.257
(light piano melody)

00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:48.571
- Any Star Wars technology
available today.

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.454
- Oh my God, you said
these were easy questions.

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:51.962
- Super easy, they're just preference.

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:53.496
Alright, if you could have one technology

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:54.760
from the Star Wars universe in your

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.294
day to day life, what would it be?

00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:57.896
- C'mon. Lightsabers.

00:01:57.896 --> 00:01:59.081
- Uh, saber.

00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:00.160
- Definitely Lightsabers.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.983
- Lightsaber.

00:02:00.983 --> 00:02:02.017
- Lightsabers.

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:02.719
- Lightsabers.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:03.480
- A Lightsaber.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.039
- Lightsabers.

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.623
- Yeah.

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:05.434
- Lightsabers are cool.

00:02:05.434 --> 00:02:07.130
- A lot of Lightsaber popularity.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.732
- All the guys love a Lightsaber.

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:09.812
(laughing)

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:11.391
If you could have any Star Wars technology

00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:14.026
available to you right this
minute, what would you pick?

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:15.327
- A BB-8.

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:16.186
- Fusion generator.

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:17.034
- Speeder bike.

00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:18.067
- A Sail Barge.

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:19.494
- I've always been very fond of the

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:20.969
A-Wing, so hyperdrive.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:21.968
- Warp speed.

00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:23.592
- What piece of Star Wars technology

00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:26.003
do you wish you had at
your disposal today?

00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:27.181
- What do you think I'm gonna say?

00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.653
- Probably the Death Star.

00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:29.525
- Death Star.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:30.645
(laughing)
Death Star, yeah.

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:34.171
(light piano melody)

00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:36.757
- Force powers, first
thing I'd do with them.

00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:41.427
- Wow.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.321
- Stumper.

00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:45.967
- I don't know, probably VIP pass

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:47.221
(laughing)
somewhere, you know?

00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.266
- I think I would use them to part the

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:50.239
line so I could get ahead of a few people.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.629
- Blastmax onto the line?

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.790
- Jump very high.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.626
- Fly.

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:54.566
- Force push.

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:55.308
- Invisibility.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.237
- I'd manipulate the Power Ball numbers.

00:02:57.237 --> 00:02:58.733
- Kill people.

00:02:58.733 --> 00:02:59.743
- Honest.

00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:00.742
And a little startling.

00:03:00.742 --> 00:03:02.484
- Ok, you magically have force powers,

00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:04.535
what's the first thing you do with them?

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:06.407
- I really wouldn't want to tell you that.

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:07.661
(laughing)

00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.960
(light piano melody)

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.421
- Alright, the really
important question is

00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.196
why is Star Wars special to you?

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.112
- Oh.

00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:20.535
- That's a deep question.

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.180
(laughing)

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.120
(sigh)

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.110
- It's all about the community really.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.650
I wouldn't be here if it
wasn't for the community.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.951
- You know what?

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:30.018
I grew up with it.

00:03:30.018 --> 00:03:32.316
I grew up in Sri Lanka, but
I grew up with Star Wars.

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:34.209
- Everything from my childhood.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.755
- Yeah.

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:37.274
- And it's part who all of us are.

00:03:37.274 --> 00:03:39.377
- Probably that magical experience you get

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:40.990
when you watch it when
you're a little kid.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.894
- God, Star Wars has been a part

00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:44.915
of my life since I was five years old.

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:46.473
- It's one of the first things I remember

00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:48.413
seeing in the movie
theater with my parents.

00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:49.654
- It's just a great story.

00:03:49.654 --> 00:03:50.640
It's a great story.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.979
Good vs. evil, some humor,
it's just a great story.

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.105
- I love the story.

00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:58.735
The passion, coming of age
and discovering yourself.

00:03:58.735 --> 00:04:00.719
And everyone has a place in the universe.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.473
- And then this one's a big one.

00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:04.273
What makes Star Wars special to you?

00:04:05.383 --> 00:04:09.309
- I think Star Wars is
special to me because of

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:13.440
the time and the place
that I originally saw it.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.995
You have to remember the times.

00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:16.738
This was the era, the Vietnam War,

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:18.594
and Richard Nixon and impeachment,

00:04:18.594 --> 00:04:20.475
and the movies themselves were dark.

00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:24.807
And here comes this joyous, escapes movie

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:27.489
that had these characters that were funny

00:04:27.489 --> 00:04:30.088
and silly and wise-cracking and heroic,

00:04:30.088 --> 00:04:33.468
and gave themselves up for someone else.

00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:35.545
And I was hooked at the age of 31.

00:04:35.545 --> 00:04:37.975
It brought me back to childhood.

00:04:37.975 --> 00:04:39.726
- It's a very tough question to answer,

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:42.408
because I've never known
a world without it.

00:04:42.408 --> 00:04:43.451
- There's nothing else that had an

00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:45.540
impact, on the planet, ever.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.872
- It's a magical experience
- Awesome.

00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:48.087
- Watching those movies.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:53.087
(light piano melody)

00:05:00.078 --> 00:05:02.208
- [Host] I love all the
variations in Clone armor.

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:05.005
Kind of allows for a little more variation

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:07.611
than the classic Stormtrooper.

00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:08.920
We're about to get to my very

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.653
favorite type of trooper, the Biker Scout.

00:05:12.653 --> 00:05:15.800
I love this armor, I
love the shaded helmet,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.970
I love everything about it.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.976
(piano key)
