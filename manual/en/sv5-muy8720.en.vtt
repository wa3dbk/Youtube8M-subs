00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.010
What's up, this is Matt Steffanina, and today
I'm going to teach you guys how to do the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.920
running man in your shuffle.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.080
To start, we're going to turn sideways.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.180
We're going to pick one leg up.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.000
As you put this leg down you're going to take
your bottom leg and push it back so that you

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.130
get into a lunge.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.419
From here we're going to take the back leg
and pick it up hopping our front leg to the

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.560
center, and then take the top leg stepping
it down pushing our back leg back.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.650
You're going to repeat this motion, and each
time you hop you want to make sure that you

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.900
don't hop up, but rather you hop just enough
so that you can slide your foot back.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.900
It's really more of a slide than it is a jump.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.940
You want to think of staying low to the ground.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.430
It also helps if you have a bounce in your
body.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.870
You don't want to be too stiff, so remember
to keep relaxed.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.460
Let's try it a little bit faster.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:06.860
You're going to start with your leg up, and
go back, up, back, up, back, up.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.820
It's also important that when you push your
leg back you straighten your leg out so that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.560
you get a nice line here.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.530
You don't want to have your legs like jello
and sloppy.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.040
You do want to really push through that back
heel so that this is a really strong move.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.940
When we go to speed it up you're going to
need to be fast on your feet, so remember

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.640
to stay on your toes and stay really light.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.890
Let's try it with the music.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.290
We're going to start slow, half time.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.240
By going on the beat you want to go down,
down, down, down, down, down.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.730
Remember, when our feet go down we want our
body to accent up.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.729
So, you're going to start by taking this leg
down and rocking back.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:02:03.090
We go back, back, back.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.910
And that's how you do the running man.
