00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.900
Welcome to Bachelors Cooking

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.055
Today we will learn to prepare Veg Manchow Soup.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.740
We have to first fry noodles and keep it aside

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.760
Its used as garnish and to add to the taste of the soup

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.475
We have already prepared and kept the fried noodles ready

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.060
We have already preheated the pan

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.540
As we need a very hot pan for making the soup

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:39.235
The pan is now ready and we can start making the soup

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.580
First put one tablespoon of oil in the pan

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.280
Now spread the oil around the pan

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.960
Increase the flame as you spread the oil all over the pan

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.855
As the oil spreads increase the flame 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.220
Add finely chopped ginger (around 1/2 inch)

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.480
After ginger, add 3 pods of  julienned garlic

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.980
Now add some cabbage

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.900
A small amount, not too much

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.680
Toss the mixture well in the pan

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.140
Now add a few slices of capsicum 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.060
Let it cook for a while

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.300
Now we will add some green garlic 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.200
You can avoid if it is not available

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.860
Add chopped spring onions to the pan

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.740
Add ground black pepper 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.080
Around 1 pinch should be enough

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080
Add salt to taste

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.220
keep the amount of salt less as the sauces also contain salt

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.520
Toss it again

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.560
Now add 1 tablespoon soya sauce

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.400
Toss it again

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.820
Now add a tablespoon of chilly sauce

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.680
Next, add some vinegar

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.220
Just a little bit 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.760
Now add garlic chilly sauce

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.340
You can also use red chilly sauce instead of garlic chilly sauce

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:24.160
Now add some water to the pan

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.020
Now wait till the water boils

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.420
It is better to use vegetable stock instead of water to enhance taste

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.180
We can also use vegetable stock cubes to improve the flavour

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.920
As the water starts boiling add the mixture of cornflour water to the pan

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.740
Cornflour is used to thicken the soup

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.020
6 to 8 spoons of cornflour water mixture should be enough

00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:06.915
Now let the soup cook

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.980
The soup has come to a boil and has thickened as well

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.080
Now add some chopped spring onions

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.100
Now that your soup is ready to serve, so put off the flame 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.655
And garnish the soup with the fried crisp noodles that we have kept ready 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.080
Stir the soup before serving

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.300
Now Put off the Gas

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.420
Our hot and delicious veg manchow soup is ready to serve
