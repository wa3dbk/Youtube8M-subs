00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.100
(music starts)

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.400
(music)

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.733
Hi, I'm Todd Stukenberg

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.700
Today we're at the Midtronics booth

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.500
at the 2007 AAPEX show.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.267
Midtronics has been a world leader

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.200
in battery and electrical system diagnostics

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:21.400
for more that 20 years

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.333
Today we're going to demonstrate for you

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:24.600
an innovative new product,

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.667
the inGEN diagnostic data recorder.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:29.433
STEVE MAREK: This is the inGEN Diagnostic Data Recorder

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.433
What it allows the technician to do

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:34.467
is mount this on a customer's vehicle

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.500
and we can measure

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.567
overall current and voltage of the vehicle.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:40.167
We also have

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.567
secondary input voltages that can be

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.700
tied to difference can busses on the vehicle

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.333
so we can see other items

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:48.600
that are happening on the vehicle

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.700
And we also have a secondary input current range

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.167
that's available

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:53.700
so if they have an idea where they have

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.800
a current problem

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.533
we can check that.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.667
All this data is saved on a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.133
on an SD card that goes in this slot right here.

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:02.833
And we then take that data

00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.300
and we move it to the PC.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.300
Once we plug into the PC

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:09.133
we can see overall battery voltage

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.767
overall battery current

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.100
we have our auxiliary current channel

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:14.733
that's actually tied on

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:15.933
we see amp hours

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:18.800
os how much current is going into or out of the battery

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.400
and then we also have an event

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:21.533
that we can set up

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:23.867
so we can actually see how long the drive cycles are

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:25.367
that the customer has

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.567
we see a total of 35 hours

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.233
worth of data on the screen right now.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.833
And we can actually tie a cursor to this information

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:36.467
so we can see the exact time

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.300
that certain events actually happen.

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.167
As I move the cursor on the screen

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.833
the clock will adjust

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.333
as well as all of the readings

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:45.600
that are happening.

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:47.167
This customer had a problem

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.467
where they actually started the vehicle

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.033
you can see where the vehicle started

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.500
and then stopped

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.667
But when the vehicle was turned off

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.567
the secondary current stayed on

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.600
And we can see that by the cursor

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:01.800
that they were pulling 900 milliamps

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:02.833
worth of current

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.767
So if a customer would have kept this

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.133
had this problem for an entire night

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.633
they would have woke up the next morning

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:10.767
to a no-start situation.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:15.800
This happened after 1, 2, 3, ...6 different starts

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:18.800
so it's intermittent

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:20.933
that they wouldn't have been able to catch at a dealership.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:22.467
The only way they were able to catch it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.767
was by having

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.767
the inGEN Diagnostic Data Recorder

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.900
go home with the customer

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:27.933
to collect that data.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.733
(music)

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:41.600
(music ends)
