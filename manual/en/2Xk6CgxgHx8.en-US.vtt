00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We are here at the basement of a school in Switzerland.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.000
And in this storage room, there is an installation

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.000
that I call "hillclimbing track".

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500
It is inspired by bike hillclimbing contests.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.000
Like here in Rachau, Austria, for example.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The contest task is to climb furthest uphill.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
At the bottom, there is carpet,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.000
while up here it gets tricky with a piece of bent cardboard.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We are doing this in a project called "Roberta",

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.900
"Learning with robots".

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
These NXT sets by Lego are our starting point.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.000
They have a programmable brick,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.500
where servo motors can be attached with different kind of construction material.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:27.000
Stage 2: Contest with 5 vehicles

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.000
1. El Compacto: Homeward bound with elegance!

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.000
2. Last Minute Prototype: Changed his mindâ€¦

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.500
3. The Spider: Only the edge of the cardboard could stop it.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.500
4. The fabulous caterpillar: Winner of our contest!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
5. The flexi-caperpillar: 2nd place was all he got!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Thanks for watching!
