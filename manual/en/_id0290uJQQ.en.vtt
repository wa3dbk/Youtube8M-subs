Hello and welcome to the SmartBuyGlasses youtube channel

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.140
today with Matt and Ayla

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.920
Today we'll be talking to you
about the Ray-Ban RB2140 Original Wayfarer

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.280
in four different colors right?
Yeah that's right

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.800
All of these sunglasses have a full-rim type frame and a square shape

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.800
It's specially good if your face shape is
round, oval or heart-shaped.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.480
The frames are made in acetate and the colors are matte military green for the ones I'm wearing,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.860
the 606285 and black for these ones: the 901

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.620
Whereas I'm wearing blue azure which
is nice black on the outside and really

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.460
bright blue on the inside. And I also
have another pair there is Havana color

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.440
and this is a very popular frame color
that suits most people's hair colors and skin tones.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.500
When it comes to lenses they
are all made of glass.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.540
Lens sizes of 47mm, 50mm and 54mm

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.780
Dark brown gradient is the color 
of the lenses for the 606285

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.420
and gray green of the 901

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.400
However, it's blue gradient for the 10013F  
-which I'm wearing

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.200
and B15XLT Brown for this Havana
shaded which is the 954

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.840
The color of the frame should match the
frame, but consider also color features of these frames

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.020
Brown color reduces glare and is good for all seasons

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.660
Grey is light enough not to impair vision yet dark enough to provide overall protection from glare

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.620
Excellent for bright sunny days, blue is a contrast lens and reduces glare from visible white light

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.320
Specifically, these are good for a casual street style

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.020
So be open to new color ideas

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.580
There are lots of color options to choose from

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.780
