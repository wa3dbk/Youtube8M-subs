In this lesson, we will tell you how to talk about your favourite food.

00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:20.686
You know what, Jake?! My aunt asked me to 
 set the menu for my cousin’s marriage.

00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:26.649
Oh! That’s nice. You’re perfect for this job. You’re such a foodie!

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.528
Yaa.... Well, I’m going to add my favorite dishes to the menu. 

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:35.009
Really? Which ones?

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:38.723
I’m very fond of spaghetti with barbeque sauce.

00:00:39.447 --> 00:00:44.083
Hmmm... I like it too. People would love that.

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:52.207
Yeah, I think I’ll ask the caterer to serve 7 different 
 styles of Spaghetti to our guests. What do you think?

00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:59.533
7 Styles? I think that’s overdoing it Katy! Don’t you think so?

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:06.997
Overdoing it? Of course not! I could eat spaghetti all day! Everyone loves spaghetti.

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:11.045
I’m going to talk to your aunt about the menu Katy.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:20.763
Hey, Jamie! I hope you like the arrangements. The caterers have everything ready.

00:01:21.558 --> 00:01:25.879
Oh Yeah Katy. Don’t worry. Everything looks perfect. You did well!

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:29.114
Thank you Jamie. Have you tried the spaghetti yet?

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:34.628
Not yet. I was too busy stuffing myself with 
 Pizzas. I don’t like spaghetti so much.

00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:40.440
You don’t like spaghetti? I can’t believe it. I absolutely love spaghetti!

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:45.150
Well, I prefer pizzas. I’m crazy about the double cheese pizza in fact.

00:01:45.903 --> 00:01:50.500
Hmm... Well... you’re the first guy I’ve seen who doesn’t like spaghetti.

00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:53.230
Yes Katy, some of us are weird.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.070
Hey Jake. How have you been?

00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:03.880
I’m good Katy. But I’m hungry. What have you got for lunch?

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:06.910
I have pizza today. Would you like some?

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:11.880
Sure. I love pizzas. Let me have some.

00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:16.880
Of course Jake, you can eat all of 
 my pizza. I am not hungry today.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:22.110
Really Katy? That’s awesome! Which pizza is this?

00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:24.180
 It’s a pepperoni pizza.

00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:29.180
Pepperoni? That’s my favorite. Thank you, Katy!

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:31.140
You’re welcome Jake.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:39.100
This is a great restaurant. They serve authentic Chinese food.

00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:41.640
You like Chinese food, don’t you?

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:46.850
Yes, I do. The manchow soup here is really special.

00:02:47.618 --> 00:02:50.430
Is it? What’s so special about it?

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:56.760
They serve it with crunchy noodles on top, and 
 the vegetables are really fresh. It’s yummy!

00:02:57.367 --> 00:03:01.710
Wow! Sounds delicious. I think I’ll have that.

00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:04.360
You’ll really enjoy it Jake!

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.320
I have pizza today. Would you like some?

00:03:13.605 --> 00:03:16.850
I’m very fond of spaghetti with barbeque sauce.

00:03:20.446 --> 00:03:24.130
I’m going to add my favorite dishes to the menu. 

00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:32.320
This is a great restaurant. They serve authentic Chinese food.

00:03:37.537 --> 00:03:42.510
I was too busy stuffing myself with Pizzas. I don’t like spaghetti so much.
