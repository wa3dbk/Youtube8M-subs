Hi, this is Andrew on behalf of Expert Village.com
and today I am going to be talking about how

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:16.200
to select the right button to sew onto a pair
of polyester pants. Now typically with pants

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.550
of this particular type of material you want
the button to be quite a bit sturdy. You want

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.460
it to also be able to move quite a bit because
the pants move around your waist. So the different

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.390
types of buttons that you can choose would
be something along the lines of this type

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.789
of button which are going to be more stationary.
I typically would not choose this for a pair

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.950
of pants just because I would prefer to use
something more along the lines of this type

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.649
of button which secures in the back rather
than sewing through it. This method of sewing

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.870
allows the button more mobility to move around
the cloth but still anchors it quite firmly

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.290
because it has a larger hole. So I would choose
this type of button to sew onto the polyester

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.300
pants which would allow me to extend the flap
over tightening them up a bit. Some other

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:18.280
buttons that you can use would be eyelet clasps.
These are typically more for button up shirts

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.030
and definitely for more of a smaller grain
of fiber like for instance; cotton shirts

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.270
or silk blouses and things of that nature
that donâ€™t have as thick of a weaving as

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.799
polyester or wool or leather materials that
would be thicker. I would choose to use thicker

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.790
buttons. Another option that people tends
to go with not so much for pants but with

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.320
blouses and shirts are these clasps similar
to ones in the back of bra straps. So these

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.530
are just different methods of fastening various
materials and it is really up to you. You

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.079
have to judge both how you want the garment
to look in the end and reliability, whether

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.390
or not you think that particular button can
hold up under various stresses.
