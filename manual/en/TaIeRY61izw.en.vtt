[Kiki Smith: The Fabric Workshop]

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:21.518
I made this blanket...

00:00:23.537 --> 00:00:26.083
I guess about two years ago now,

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:27.793
at The Fabric Workshop.

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:30.244
This one's backwards, also, but...

00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:31.883
It's just the way it goes.

00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:34.547
But, it was a big...

00:00:35.307 --> 00:00:36.836
Theyâ€™re on a Jacquard--

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.036
made on a Jacquard loom.

00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:41.191
And then fulled,

00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:43.743
which means they rip the surface like that,

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.998
so it's fuzzy like a Canadian blanket, kind of.

00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:49.053
I'm making a show at The Fabric Workshop

00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:50.983
of housewares, or,

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.246
rather than make art with it in a certain sense,

00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:55.076
make objects--

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:57.170
make daily life things.

00:00:57.513 --> 00:00:59.422
I have lots of ideas of things to make,

00:00:59.422 --> 00:01:00.509
but I'm not good at...

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:01.784
I realize I'm good at doing

00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:03.717
what I can do in my own power,

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:05.668
out of my own physicality.

00:01:05.668 --> 00:01:07.915
And then, like, a little extension out from that.

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:10.547
But, I'm not good at, um...

00:01:10.547 --> 00:01:12.553
you know, to manufacture things.

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:14.122
[SMITH, OFF-SCREEN] Yeah. No, here's my list.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:18.508
[The Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia, PA]

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.399
[SMITH] Okay...

00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:24.667
[WOMAN, SUE PATTERSON, LAUGHS OFF-SCREEN]

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.831
[SMITH] These are the things that are done.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.760
[PATTERSON OFF-SCREEN CONTINUES LAUGHING] Nothing like a mega-sized list!

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.183
[PATTERSON] This is not the 'tuck in your shirt pocket' thing...

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:34.508
[SMITH] I have twenty years of these.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.129
Okay, I have this big silver finger bowls.

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:39.476
[PATTERSON] Mmm hmm.

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:40.790
[SMITH] I have the packing blankets I made

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.988
at The Mattress Factory.

00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:43.608
[PATTERSON] Yup, with the birds on them...

00:01:43.608 --> 00:01:45.176
[SMITH] "Tailbone A.D."

00:01:46.436 --> 00:01:49.604
Skull...the skull sculpture which is a doorstop.

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:50.327
[PATTERSON] Yup.

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.551
[PATTERSON] I've worked with Kiki

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:54.425
probably over the last two-and-a-half years.

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:56.993
I've worked at The Fabric Workshop for thirteen.

00:01:56.993 --> 00:01:58.174
So, to put that in context,

00:01:58.174 --> 00:01:59.435
I've worked with a lot of different people,

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:00.107
So, it's sort of...

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:01.999
You get a new experience each time.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.442
And she's primarily doing, with us, textile-related things.

00:02:05.582 --> 00:02:06.412
[Sue Patterson, Project Manager]

00:02:06.412 --> 00:02:08.874
Anything fabric-related, we can whip it up faster,

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:10.305
and knock a screen of something off.

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:12.395
So, she loves that facility.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.274
She appreciates working with people that have other skills

00:02:15.274 --> 00:02:17.199
that aren't available at her house.

00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:18.787
[MAN] Kiki?

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.443
On the fabric, do you want them, like,

00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:22.905
straight up and down?

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:24.683
[SMITH] Oh, I thought they were sort of

00:02:24.683 --> 00:02:26.735
going on an angle, aren't they?

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:27.936
[MAN] Is that what you want?

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:28.503
[SMITH] Yeah.

00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:29.148
[MAN] Okay.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:29.674
[SMITH] Yeah.

00:02:29.674 --> 00:02:30.873
[MAN] So assume, like, this...

00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:31.837
[SMITH] Let's see if you straighten it,

00:02:31.837 --> 00:02:33.156
what it looks like.

00:02:34.218 --> 00:02:37.156
No. It should go at an angle

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:37.870
[MAN] Like that.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.520
[SMITH] Yeah.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.168
[MAN] Okay.

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:45.578
[PATTERSON] Kiki will be making a mixed bag of things.

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.319
And some of those she's working on today.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.411
The wallpaper is one.

00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.750
The coverlet...

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.857
Another blanket is one.

00:02:51.857 --> 00:02:53.487
The little flip doll--

00:02:53.487 --> 00:02:55.412
the owl-cat doll--is one.

00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:56.813
She's doing a bunch of

00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:59.442
cast-silver jewelry objects.

00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:02.350
A colander that has a constellation.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.689
And the wonderful thing about Kiki that I love

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.413
is that she's making art twenty-four hours a day.

00:03:08.413 --> 00:03:09.813
It's like you go to her house,

00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:11.718
and there's everything all over the place.

00:03:11.718 --> 00:03:13.583
People are, you know, calling on the phone,

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:15.610
and there's a pot of glue under the table, and...

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.550
It's this really seamless experience for her--

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.487
That there's no border between

00:03:22.487 --> 00:03:25.211
going to the studio and making artwork.

00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:26.288
And that's really great,

00:03:26.288 --> 00:03:28.395
because it's just natural.

00:03:39.508 --> 00:03:42.444
[SMITH] It'll be a queen-sized bed blanket, so,

00:03:42.754 --> 00:03:45.842
it has the hands with the flowers there,

00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:47.350
and then the hands with the candles

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.581
and the bird.

00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:50.888
And then the bottom part are the heads.

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:56.393
The back side will be the weeping willows there.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:02.469
[SMITH] Perfect!

00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:07.087
It looks alright...

00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:10.435
I mean, it looks like wallpaper in...

00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:11.511
the kitchen.

00:04:11.511 --> 00:04:12.348
[LAUGHS]

00:04:13.838 --> 00:04:15.034
1960-something.

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:16.350
[MAN] In the drawing room. In the drawing room.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.720
[SMITH] A la 1960s.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.958
It's just what I wanted...

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:20.650
[MAN] Just what you need!

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.326
[SMITH] Just what I wanted it to look like.
