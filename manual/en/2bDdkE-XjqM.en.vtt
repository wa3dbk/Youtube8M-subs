00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.730
Home made strudel is the inspiration for baked
apple cannoli wrapped in Athens Fillo Dough.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:13.119
In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon,
lemon juice, and salt.

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.330
Add the cut apples to the bowl and toss to
coat.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.280
In a large skillet over medium high heat,
melt the butter and add the apple mixture.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.950
Cook approx 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally,
until the apples begin to soften.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.410
Remove the heat and cool completely.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.320
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.390
Lay a sheet of fillo dough on the work surface
and brush one sheet of fillo dough with melted

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.579
butter.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.579
To prevent the edges from cracking, start
at the edges and brush toward the center of

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.010
the fillo.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.380
Repeat until five sheets have been stacked
and brushed with melted butter.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.040
Carefully cut the stack in half across the
width, then cut the two halves once more.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.610
Make an additional cut across the length of
the stack to finish cutting your squares.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.590
Top each square with one tablespoon of the
cooled apples, spreading slightly diagonally

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.090
from corner to corner.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.170
Fold opposite corners over the apples to form
a tube, pressing gently to seal the top.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.299
Repeat the filling and folding steps with
remaining fillo sheets and apples.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.659
Place cannoli two inches apart on ungreased
cookie sheets.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.950
Bake 12 to 14 minutes, or until fillo is flakey
and golden brown.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.049
When the cannoli are baking, prepare a vanilla
cream sauce for dipping.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:46.060
In a medium saucepan, combine half and half,
light brown sugar, sugar, vanilla, and butter.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.000
Bring the mixture to a boil.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.450
Cook and stir for two minutes, or until sauce
begins to thicken.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.549
Remove the sauce from heat.

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.189
Serve immediately with two warm baked apple
cannoli.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.539
Enjoy.

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.170
Refrigerate leftovers I'd there is anything
left over.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.359
Athens Fillo Dough, available in your grocer's
freezer.
