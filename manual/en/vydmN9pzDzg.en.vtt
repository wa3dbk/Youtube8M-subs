00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.040
This is how I want you to remember me.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.059
The woman who beat you.

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:12.887
[Howling]

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:14.430
Sherlock?

00:00:23.793 --> 00:00:26.725
Mycroft: One lonely naive man, desperate to show off

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:29.159
I could cut myself slapping that face!

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.205
Mycroft: ..and a woman clever enough to make him feel special.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:33.371
Would you like me to try?

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:35.270
Mycroft: This is a matter of national importance.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.162
Is that a phone?

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.062
It's a camera phone.

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:40.705
On this phone I've got secrets that could topple your whole world.

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:43.222
Mycroft: From now on you will stay out of this.

00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:44.079
Oh, will I?

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.474
Yes Sherlock. You will.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.367
[Moan]

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:52.457
Why does your phone make that noise?

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:54.325
It's a text alert, means I've got a text.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:56.071
So everytime they text you..

00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:56.781
[Moan]

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:58.850
It would seem so.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.623
Henry: They were the footprints of a gigantic hound

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:05.063
[Screams]

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:07.333
You off for this hound of hell like on the telly?

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.267
He said he'd seen terrible things.

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:11.205
It's here.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:13.322
[Howls]

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:14.912
He's back.

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:17.133
Sir, there's been a break-in.

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.432
Mycroft: Moriarty.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:19.520
No rush.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.095
Mycroft: The most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen.

00:01:22.095 --> 00:01:27.555
Moriarty: He's just a big old liar who makes things up to make himself look good.

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:28.357
[Gun fires]

00:01:28.357 --> 00:01:29.260
Do as he says!

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.768
Can't you see what's going on?!

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:34.951
Moriarty: It's gonna start very soon, Sherlock.

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:36.856
Stop it now!

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:38.290
The fall.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.915
[whistling]

00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:44.145
Falling's just like flying, except there's a more permanent destination.

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:46.566
Oh, god.

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:53.481
John: Sherlock!

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.816
Wouldn't miss this for the world!

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:04.227
