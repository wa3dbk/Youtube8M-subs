00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.679
Hi I'm Daniel from Rally Off-Road.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.029
Now when you put a serious suspension lift
into a vehicle it's much more than just springs

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.370
and shock absorbers.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.500
What we're looking at here today is a heavy-duty
and extended panhard rod and an extended panhard

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.960
rod bracket.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.810
The reasons why we use an extended panhard
rod is because when the vehicle is lifted,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.280
the differential moves further away from the
chassis and the angle of the panhard rod pulls

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.279
the diff across to one side of the vehicle.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.730
We have an adjustable panhard rod so that
we can extend it to the correct length to

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.850
make sure that the track of the vehicle remains
central.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.739
The reason why we extend the panhard mount,
is that when the vehicle is lifted we need

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.059
to compensate for the angle on the panhard
rod.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.749
The reason why we do this is so that the panhard
rod is working in almost parallel to the road

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:57.749
position.

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:03.379
As it drops down the angle increases and it
pulls the diff across further.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.790
We experience bump steer in the vehicle and
other handling characteristics which aren't

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.390
very good.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.140
Now when you're choosing an aftermarket panhard
rod the most important things to look for

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.780
is first of all that it's adjustable.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.880
We need to make sure that the adjustment is
simple and effective.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.079
The welds on the end of the panhard rod are
obviously crucial and the mounting rings and

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.579
the bushes.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.340
Any upgraded panhard rod should have thicker
material around the bush and the bush will

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.929
be a good quality rubber, or a neoprene or
polyurethane bush.

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.649
The material that the panhard rod is made
from will be thicker than the standard material

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.820
and possibly a Mecavel or Chrome Moly type
material which is much stronger than a mild

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.820
steel.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.060
So next time you look at them doing a suspension
upgrade to your vehicle make sure that you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.759
pay attention to the panhard rod.
