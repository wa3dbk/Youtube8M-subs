[DUBSTEP MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.670
Yo, what's going on?

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.590
This is El Tiro,
and today, we're

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.090
gonna be learning how to
master the drop that you

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.580
hear in dubstep music.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.280
First and foremost, the style of
dance we are doing is popping.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.570
And there is no such
thing as dubstep dancing.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.710
All right.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.338
Let's begin.

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:36.274
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.540
So breaking down the first
eight steps, the crescendo,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.830
we're gonna use our
left arm as the wave

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.600
and then our right
arm as the trace.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.850
The tracing arm is just going
to use a twisting motion

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.980
like this-- click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.821
And we're also going to have
a twisting motion like so.

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:02.820
So we have our left arm.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.444
We're going to start
with a fingertips.

00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:05.650
And that would be one.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.800
Knuckles will be two.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.960
Our wrist will be three.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.790
Then we're going to
have our elbow be four.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.966
We're going to have
our shoulder be five.

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.460
We're going to go down on
six with the shoulder-- six.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.015
On seven, we're going to go
up with the head-- seven--

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:23.380
and then down eight.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.965
What we're doing here is we're
making a wave really choppy.

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:32.510
And every time, just
keep remembering

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.660
that you gotta twist
and you gotta rotate.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.642
So in effect, you have your
click, click, click, click,

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:39.650
click, click, click, click.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.040
With these next steps,
all you're really gonna do

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.700
is kind of use eight
steps to get to the bottom

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.960
here to where our feet is.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.790
Remember, we're doing
a body wave here.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.316
Try not to end at the booty.

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:51.190
It's kind of awkward.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.877
Make sure you're
landing at your feet.

00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:55.460
And to do that, when you get to
the bottom, all you have to do

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.740
is pick up your toes, like so.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.550
One tip to make your
wave hit those beats

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.030
is kind of add a bouncing
motion as you go down, like so.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.960
So my arm's still gonna
stay right here, and I go,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.115
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:18.040
If we break it down really
slowly-- one, two, three, four,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.990
five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.375
And then finally, the last
part-- all we're gonna do

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:31.660
is a quick body wave
coming up to the top.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.505
And what we're gonna after
we use our arms to end

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:38.680
it is we're gonna do a
nice little bobble head.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.790
So bringing on that
slow motion again,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.860
it would be, from
the bottom, coming up

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.524
toe-- that's left foot--
coming to the right.

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:49.690
I'm gonna put that one down.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.640
I'm gonna sink, lean
forward, coming chest.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.880
Now, when I get to
my shoulders here,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.625
I'm gonna have
both my arms wave,

00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:59.960
but I'm gonna have my right
arm first followed by my left.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.120
In effect, it looks like this.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.290
And then we're gonna
add our bobble head.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.810
In effect-- putting it
all together, we have--

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:44.234
