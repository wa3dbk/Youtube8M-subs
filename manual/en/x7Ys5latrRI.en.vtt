but we have any hope

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.730
get out of the debate let's look at the
video minutes after the gun went off the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.309
victim is the guard agreed church you
could see police and paramedics tending

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.030
to him

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.989
them starting to search for the bullet

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.200
which witnesses say was down about

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.990

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.500
product and they make no idea

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.559
the arrows at trial that they make snow

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.630
programs loaded guns on bowling outright
onto seminary chevron

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.210
what what you think that one of the bad
guy comes in

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.079
with a gun you gotta have a good day in
there with a gun you never know when

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.799
he's bad guys with guns show up as a
bowling alley comes after a year you

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.950
have to see that that bowling and i'm

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.659
well that's what it's really about this
i think you're about to get a three

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.760
hundred

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.290
and there's one sort of wavering a lot
of health and out of time to get those

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.740
to think about the ever seen any kind of
all of the hole in the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.320
that's what that's all about probably
got a big bowl of the level of all

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.770
yahoo to roger everyone pretty good
uh... my average is uh...

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.950
i don't have an average

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.479
okay so here's a look at you go to rise
above that words that way

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.549
unravel at anti-gambling

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.780
aspirin eighty five something like that
made you bring a gun with you

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.340
just in case you're interested in that
it never happened when i say predicts

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.400
the dramatic reductions in how were
these kinds of stories every here cuz

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.299
every week some idiot

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.550
there is something that doesn't involve
guns

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.470
we hear about this and i think we keep
laughing at it but it just keeps telling

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.520
me and it's not actually funny at all ab

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.229
beer supposed to be responsible gun
owners and you hear about people who are

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.739
against any and all kind of gun safety
legislation they're against it you know

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:08.290
that

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.990
then unfortunately though the
responsible gun owners don't seem to be

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.740
that responsibility this guy wasn't
carrying this gun in a way that would

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.380
make sure that it didn't ever go often
for anybody much less himself and of

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.870
course since addison last few weeks
we've had our whole rash of shootings of

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.199
children shooting children and killing
them

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.779
and you know but that the family that
and gave their five-year-old son undone

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.839
a rifle that meant and marketed for
celebrant i mean this is this these are

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:38.139
on the edge of insanity is not already
over the clift uh... in life

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.509
you know i'm there was a face book post
uh... was one of my face but friends

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:46.139
uh... posted about uh... hey i want i
think it might go until i was twelve

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.739
years old and that's a difference to
england and missouri in kentucky that

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.219
was the arabic

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.369
and then other people talk behind on my
when i was sick so i got my when i was

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:55.670
seven women are

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.400
and they were like this is a good thing
they work and i was like this is the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.160
most amazing face book trip and hijab
adversity in the right people i didn't

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.090
know that was it then you gave it get it
done when he was like six or seven years

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.200
although where there was a time when you
just got a gun cuz you lived in a rural

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.920
state

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.010
that's i didn't know that you know when
there was a time when that would help

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.519
you know what the kids are going out
they could actually hunt you know my

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.939
father was raised in deep east texas and
that's what they did they would actually

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.489
go up let me get dinner

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.109
you know but there's a long time ago
really don't really have that kind of

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.739
situation for most of these people who
are complaining about the kinds of gun

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.759
safety regulations that are being
proposed do you think there's some

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.519
boomerang thing going on here that
because we keep talking about this

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.159
fall and and rightfully so that the gun
people

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.409
arm doing crazier things like i can see
why in a good person say you're going

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.469
bowling and then your life

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.749
going to take my because they want my
than if i leave my house without my

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.480
judgment of the writing about

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.430
utilities justice idea

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.909
that you should have your time

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.399
adult i mean what could possibly be the
logical

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:01.259
step through that this guy was well i'm
gonna guess who's picking his his leg

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.970
doesn't work right now but i'm guessing
is opposite penis didn't work as well

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.870
itself because there's a feeling need to
have a gun in their pocket the whole

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.409
time on my wall about i've never felt
the need to seven to one of my pocket

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.019
you know why that's because my penis is
fantastic

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.520
and you also hectic morning machetes
right today steve roberts

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.049
so how is that the reading

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.710
yeah i think it is there's not gonna be
shrinkage of societal used to say no

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.530
shrinkage which is

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.409
nineteen eighties and i u

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.689
hi-fi
