pic of WhatsApp and how to share attachments

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.790
Firstly download couple of apps.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:24.130
The first one is obviously WhatsApp and second
one is dropbox by going through Tools tab.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.321
If you dont find WhatsApp or Dropbox on BlueStacks,
then google it as WhatsApp apk or Dropbox

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:34.000
Apk and open those Apk files using BlueStacks.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.460
