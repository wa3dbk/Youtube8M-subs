Enfants Terribles, formerly "le Rue Balzac",

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.380
is a smart "brasserie",

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:48.400
specialized in the traditional  easy to eat French dishes, focussed on the products

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
The dining room of the Parisian Enfants Terribles is characterized by an "arty" setting,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.510
a traditional decor but with contemporary touches

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.550
We are a French family-owned Group

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.550
specialized in mountain hotels.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.580
Our interior designer is a painter, an old friend of the family,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.650
who has worked for the Cour des Loges in Lyon

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.750
He has made the frescoes in the Bar and the Dining Room

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.840
I have worked as an apprentice with Michel Lentz for 5 years

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.910
Then, I worked 1 year with Marc Veyrat

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.910
Then, in Paris, at Taillevent with Del Burgo

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.000
After that I worked with the Pourcel Brothers for 5 years at the Maison Blanche

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.090
My cuisine is simple and enhances the products

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.150
We propose the Black Angus rib roast,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.190
the spit-roasted organic chicken,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.190
scallops with fresh ceps,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.220
simple in-season dishes

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.270
It's not a gastronomic restaurant or a trendy restaurant

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.310
We have chosen for the decor and the cooking a project focussed on tradition,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.320
continuity and durability

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.320
We have chosen authenticity and values that do not grow-out mode
