00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.509
RICHARD NEIL: So we're going to work on the
jaw bone now. We store a lot of stress and

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:17.770
tension in our jaws, biting down our jaws;
a lot of people clinch in the middle of the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:27.130
sleep. People unconsciously clinch their jaws,
bite down, grind their teeth. I'm sure some

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.300
of you have your dentist say, "Don't grind
your teeth". We do these things unconsciously

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.570
because of stress and tension that's affecting
our dream states. So what I'm doing here is

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:47.320
making small circles with my fingers, small
circles just starting at the--just below her

00:00:47.320 --> 00:01:00.569
ear lobes. It's hard to see where I am at
this angle but we hold the lock in her jaw.

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:07.410
So I'm starting here and I'm working my way
all the way down towards the chin. Slow circles,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:15.470
slow circles so move circle here, move to
a point here, move to a point here. About

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.910
four or five points until you get to the chin.
Depending how big the jaw is. But this is,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.780
this tends to be the greatest culprit right
here, the first one, just before it makes

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.490
that turn to be a straight line. That jaw
muscle. And you can actually hold that there

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.320
for a while and just increase the pressure
just ever so slightly. So I'm pushing up,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:59.770
I'm pushing up towards the ceiling. Breathe.
So I'm moving down the jaw, a little further

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:19.569
down. This feels really good.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.909
When you get down to the chin, we're going
to move to the chin here and create a little

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:32.489
bit of pressure right here at the chin, these
two little dimples that go underneath the

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:43.239
chin bone and just hold that place right there.
You can even smooth it out starting at the

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:54.489
center and moving outward
relieving whatever tension we hold in her

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:04.060
jaw on her chin. So when we return I'll resume
the work on the face.
