00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.180
[Narrator] Automatic Flagger Assistance Devices,
also known as AFAD, or auto-flaggers, are

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.169
portable traffic control devices. They're
designed to allow construction and maintenance

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.070
crews to safely control the flow of traffic
through work zones, without having to put

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.360
themselves directly in front of approaching
vehicles. Traditionally, flaggers control

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.070
the flow of traffic through work zones using
flag staff and portable radios. This forces

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.289
the flagger to stand on or near the roadway,
exposing them to potential danger. With levels

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.690
of distracted driving increasing, the Minnesota
Department of Transportation recently purchased

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.239
three sets of AFADs through its research implementation
program. For some crews in MnDOT District

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.089
Three, AFADs are now a part of their every
day work routine.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.080
[Jason Penaz] It came through St. Cloud, our
district office, up there. They wanted to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.550
try out these new auto flaggers and see how
they'd work out in the field and see how we'd

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.060
like them. We really like them. You get the
guys off the road that are actually out there

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.750
with the flags staff, you could actually be
in a vehicle, away from the traffic when vehicles

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.890
are coming by. I think it's a big safety benefit
for our guys to have the auto flaggers.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.300
[Joe Elsenpeter] We hear all the time that
people don't see us. We blend in with the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.590
background. Well the auto flaggers are a big
machine sitting on the side of the road and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.130
people see them a long ways off with the lights
flashing. I think they see them more.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.120
[Jason Penaz] We have two different styles
here.One is a little wider then the other

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.120
one, so you need wider shoulders to put the
auto flagger on. The other one we have is

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.070
a little more narrow, for roads like what
we have today, where you can get it off on

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.730
a smaller shoulder. You're kind of a sitting
duck there sometimes when you're standing

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.920
out there. You just never know what the public
is doing. A lot of people now are using their

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.090
cell phones and other things like that in
their vehicles, and they're being very distracted

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.879
while they're behind the wheel. And with these,
you can really get off the road and protect

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.650
yourself. Short staff too, it really helps
because one guy can run the controller. You

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.060
don't have to have two or three people out
there, rotating in and out with flag staffs.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.060
It helps us out, cause we're kind of a small
shop, so our crews are small and where it

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.060
would take two guys to flag, we can do it
with one guy now, so you've got an extra guy

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.890
doing a guardrail or whatever. I like them.
It gets the people off the road. 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.930
 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.219
Um, you're not in front of the cars, which is
a big plus, from my experience.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:06.150
