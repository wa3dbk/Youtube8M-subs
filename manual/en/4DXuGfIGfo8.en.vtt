Hi I'm Hartmut. I'm an engineer at Google.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi I'm Shailesh -- product manager at Google.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Shailesh: We're here to introduce Google Goggles: a visual search application
for Android phones.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.750
Hartmut: Until now, the only option for web search has been typing or speaking.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now you can search by taking a photo.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.750
Shailesh: Let's try this book.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.750
Just open Google Goggles. Fill as much of the screen as possible with the object and take a picture.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.500
You'll see the exact book match in the search results, without typing or saying a word.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.500
Hartmut: Another good use is on a business card.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.000
Shailesh: Let's try mine.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.250
Hartmut: Frame the text you're interested in well.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.250
Google Goggles will recognize the text and return a result.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Now I can click to call Shailesh or add him to my contacts.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
Shailesh: Let's go out and check what else Google Goggles can do.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.000
Hartmut: We can figure out the title and artist of this painting.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.150
Shailesh: Or landmark information.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.750
And when you're travelling places where you don't know the language
Goggles can translate text for you.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.500
Just take a picture, for example, of a menu.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Shailesh: Visual search is still in its early stages. It works best on things like we saw today

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.000
but it doesn't work well yet on things like food, cars, plants, or animals.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.000
Hartmut: As this technology advances, we will be able to do more cool things

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
like suggesting a move in a chess game or taking a picture of a leaf to identify the plant.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.250
Shailesh: You might be wondering what happens to all these pictures you're taking.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.250
You can choose to discard them as soon as the search is done

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.850
or save them to your search history to view them at any time.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.000
Hartmut: It's available for Android powered phones now.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.000
To download, go to the Android Market

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.000
and search for Google Goggles.
