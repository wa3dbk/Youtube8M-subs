00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.253
What is up guys? In today's video, I'm going to show you how to unlock  Samsung Galaxy Note 4

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:07.548
to use it with any GSM sim card in the world.

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:17.315
So this is a fantastic phone. It is very elegant. It has a very cool black leather. The only problem,

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:23.278
which I didn't like, is that it's currently locked to AT&amp;T, so I'm going to show you how to unlock

00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:28.617
it from your original carrier to use it with any other carrier you want. In this case, I'm going to

00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:33.885
use it with T-Mobile. So we're going to do it step-by-step. It is very, very simple. This also

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:39.367
works for any other Samsung phone out there. So for now we're going to use this Note 4, and

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:44.688
we're going to unlock it to use it worldwide. So, it is very simple. Unfortunately, we will have to

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:49.442
pay a small amount, but trust me guys, it is worth every penny to have your phone fully factory

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:52.998
unlocked. So with that said, let's begin.

00:00:52.998 --> 00:00:58.015
So power on your phone. All you need is a computer, can be Windows or Mac, and we're going

00:00:58.015 --> 00:01:02.617
to start. The first thing we're going to do is get the phone's IME number. That's a unique number

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:10.334
for every phone, so just type star, pound, zero, six, pound, and you will see that a 15-digit IME

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:15.431
number will appear. That is very, very important. We're going to use only the first 15 digits.

00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:20.576
Based on this number, we're going to request the unlock code to unlock this phone. So keep it

00:01:20.576 --> 00:01:24.858
somewhere close because we're going to need it later to generate the unlock code for this phone.

00:01:24.858 --> 00:01:29.668
For now, we're going to switch to the computer. It can be Windows or Mac, as I said, and you're

00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:34.266
going to open your Internet browser. I use Google Chrome. So I'm going to open here Google

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:40.931
Chrome, and we will have to go to the website unlockriver.com, so I'm just going to go ahead

00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:48.599
here and type it, give me a second, unlockriver.com. In this website, we will request the unlock

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:54.428
code for this phone. So first, you select the original carrier your phone is currently locked to. In

00:01:54.428 --> 00:02:00.074
this case, my phone is originally from AT&amp;T in the United States, so I'm going to click on that

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:04.234
one. Okay, so next you have to select the brand of your phone. Of course, we're going to be

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:10.999
unlocking a Samsung phone, so we select Samsung here, and then you will select exact model of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:17.217
Samsung. So I'm going to look for Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and make sure to select the right

00:02:17.217 --> 00:02:21.524
region as well. So in this case, it's the United States, AT&amp;T.

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:26.640
If you scroll down, it will ask you to enter your 15-digit IME number. That's the number we got

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.690
at the beginning of the video, remember? So just insert it here. Insert only the first 15 digits;

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.215
ignore the last two. Next, you will have to write down your personal email where you want to

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:40.212
receive the unlock code, so just make sure it is correct because they will send you your unlock

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:44.632
code to this email. If you scroll down, you will see an average delivery time and the price to

00:02:44.632 --> 00:02:49.908
unlock your phone. The price and delivery time depends on your original carrier and country, so

00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:54.258
the prices are set by your carrier, not by the website. So after you have filled in everything click

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.341
where it says unlock now.

00:02:56.341 --> 00:03:01.445
All right, so click unlock now, and you will see the following page. Here, you will see a

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:06.339
summary of your order, make sure you read everything here, it is kind of important, and after

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:10.534
you have read everything click where it says checkout with PayPal. Now, as I promised, I was

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:15.108
going to do it step-by-step in front of you, so I'm going to go through the payment, and it's going

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:19.235
to be very fast. It's going to take probably 10 seconds, I promise. If you don't have a PayPal

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:23.349
account, don't worry. You can click down here, pay with any other method.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.508
I do have a PayPal account, so I'm going to log in, and click where it says Pay Now. As you can

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:36.075
see here, it says Pay Now, and it's going to take four seconds. It's very, very fast. So we're just

00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:40.470
going to wait for a confirmation message. As you can see here, it says thanks for your order. The

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.675
payment went through, and then you will see a new page with your order number, okay. That's it

00:03:46.675 --> 00:03:51.287
guys. All you have to do for now is wait. You have to wait for them to send you the unlock code

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:58.115
to your email. This may take one hour. It can take 10 minutes. It can take up to 48 hours or 72

00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:02.313
hours. It depends on every carrier, on every country, and every phone model.

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:06.861
I'm going to show you how the email will look like. This is my personal email account. I use

00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:10.987
Gmail, and you will see that I have received an email saying your unlock code is ready. So we're

00:04:10.987 --> 00:04:15.352
going to open this email, and it says your unlock code is ready and this will unlock your phone to

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:20.189
use it with any GSM sim card. It also includes instructions on how to insert the unlock code, and,

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:25.259
of course, the most important part, is the actual unlock code. If in case, the unlock code fails, you

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:30.787
will have to enter the unfreeze code also included in the email down here. For now, I'm going to

00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:33.293
show you how to insert the unlock code into the phone.

00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:38.060
So we're going to bring up here the phone, press the power off button, and confirm by pressing

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.282
power off. Click power off, and that's it. The phone should be completely off for now. We're

00:04:44.282 --> 00:04:48.986
going to remove the battery, and the following step is kind of important. Here, you will have to

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:53.871
insert the sim card of your choice. In this case, my phone is currently locked to AT&amp;T, as you

00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:59.087
can see here, but I'm going to use a new sim card, my T-Mobile sim card. You can insert any

00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:04.393
other sim card as long as it is different from the original carrier. So we're going to put back the

00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:09.066
battery, and in the meantime, we're going to power on the phone. So we're going to put back the

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:13.701
back cover of the phone as well, and it's going to take a couple of seconds until the phone is fully

00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:19.099
back on. So we're just going to be a little patient here and wait until the phone powers on

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.177
completely.

00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:26.165
Unfortunately, you will always see your original carrier's logo, but once the phone is fully on, it

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:31.061
will detect that you have inserted a non-accepted sim card. So if you swipe to unlock, it will ask

00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:36.274
you to enter the network unlock pin. That's the unlock code we received in the email. So I'm

00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:41.216
going to go ahead and insert the unlock code I received in my email. This is a unique code, so

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:47.753
this exact code will not work for you. So I'm going to go ahead...I'm going to try to adjust the

00:05:47.753 --> 00:06:02.047
camera so that you can see, and I'm going to insert it here. So in this case, its 6-9-5-9-1-5-2-0.

00:06:02.047 --> 00:06:06.841
I'm going to click where it says done, and when I click unlock, you will see a success message. I

00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:12.836
don't know if you can see it here. I'm going to try something, click unlock, network unlock

00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:13.996
successful.

00:06:13.996 --> 00:06:19.002
That's it. That's the message that appeared there, and now the phone is now fully factory

00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:23.725
unlocked. Now you can use it with any sim card of your choice like AT&amp;T, T-Mobile,

00:06:23.725 --> 00:06:30.003
Vodafone, Orange, O2, or any other GSM sim carrier in the world. So that's it for today guys. I

00:06:30.003 --> 00:06:34.168
