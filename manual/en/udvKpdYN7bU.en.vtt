00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.800
Alright, now let's finish this!

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.980
Okay Luffy, just calm down and hear me out for a second. Everyone that lives here at Whisky Peak  is really a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.419
bounty hunter which makes all of them our enemies. 
Hey! Pay attention to me you jerk-ass!

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:22.489
You're just lying! Enemies wouldn't give us tasty food would they?! 
Taste my 10 000 kg press! 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.440
It doesn't look like there's any sense in trying to talk to you. 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.970
You know you're really a moron!

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.930
This time I'm not going to hold back. It'll be your own fault if  you die! Sounds good to me!

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.740
Just a sec- what's going on here? I thought you guys were on the same side.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.040
Ready for my Gum-Gum!?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.040
Oni...Giri!
        Bazooka!

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.790
Let's see which one's stronger..

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.790
your rubber hands or my steel, what do you say?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.530
Yeah, let's settle this once and for all!

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.800
Well now what am I supposed to do?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.800
I don't know how safe we'll be going through there.

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.810
Dammit! Those two are making fools of us all on 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.499
our own turf- the name of Baroque Works will be shamed if we fail in our mission here.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.689
Mr 5

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.079
we can still defeat them, we haven't failed yet.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:34.780
Let's go!

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.679
Ms Valentine.
Right, Mr 5.

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.459
You can't beat us

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.439
You can't beat us! Prepare to die at the hands of Baroque Works officer agents!

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.819
Shut up

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.689
and go away!

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:47.999
You're interfering...with our fight!
