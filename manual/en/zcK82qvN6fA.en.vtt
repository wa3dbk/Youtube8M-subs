hi everyone once again we have the
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 in front of us

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.100
and i just want to show you just how
easy it is to install adobe flash player

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.479
on your samsung galaxy note 2

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.199
so go to google search

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.080
archived

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:24.080
flash player versions

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.230
as you can see the first link is

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.970
directly from adobe

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.840
so let's go to that link

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.430
and what you want to do is you want to
scroll all the way down

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.560
not all the way down but scroll until
you see

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.280
flash player for Android 4.0
devices

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.999
and

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:54.420
even though your device your Galaxy Note 2

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.080
on Android 4.1 it works
perfectly

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.030
download that link

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.430
okay as you could see starting the
download and it just finished

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.590
so click on the download

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.259
and then you could install

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.060
that's all you need to do

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.020
and you could open up any browser except
google chrome

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.440
and go

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.730
to the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.730
website that uses flash player

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.270
okay so i'm going to go to the south
park studios

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.450
okay were i'm just gonna go to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.180
the south park google search

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.790
and below it you should see full episode
player

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.520
another thing to do is you should enable
desktop view

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.830
this way when you go to this link

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.200
it doesn't try to give you the
mobile version

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.600
of the website that does not have flash
videos

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.380
so you can either

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.950
go to full episode player

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.929
or you could enable the desktop view and go to the south park website

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:14.089
and

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:15.989
on the full website

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:16.739
you could

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.760
goto the full episode player

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.279
and let's just see what happens when we

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:31.279
to play this episode

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.549
so as you can't see

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.059
well before they start playing an
episode they start

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.709
playing an advertisement

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.269
but as you can already see see it is playing
an advertisement that's running on flash

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.549
we could confirm that it's working

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.279
so that's all you need to do

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:56.060
and it is just that easy i just want to comment that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.859
the future of flash support on
the

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.549
galaxy note two looks really good because this device has and the identical

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.899
processor to that galaxy S3 has

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:12.519
and samsung and google

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.699
or samsung and adobe

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.989
made an official announcement saying if
you upgrade from by ICS to jelly bean

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.930
on the galaxy s III

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.459
they will continue supporting it

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.719
so the future looks really bright because
any version of flash player that they

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.719
release on the galaxy s 3

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:38.059
will work absolutely perfect on the
galaxy note 2

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.129
that that is the end of the video thank
you for watching i have about forty

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.029

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.360
