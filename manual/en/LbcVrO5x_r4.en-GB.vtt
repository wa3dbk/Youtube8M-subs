00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.899
One of the key differences from cyclocross
to other forms of cycling is that you're forced

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.880
to get off and run with your bike.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.499
That's something that you just don't do on
the road, is it?

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:13.789
Unless you count the 1994 Tour de l'Avenir,
when I had to get off at some roadworks and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.920
clamber out of a deep hole...but apart from
that, you're right!

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.289
This is something you'll probably have to
tackle every race, not just once every 20

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.720
years. It's not a difficult skill to master,
but you do need to know how to do it the right way.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.620
Shall we start with the dismount first, then?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.400
Absolutely, the aim of the dismount is to
get off your bike and then seamlessly start

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.980
running. The key thing, like all things in
cyclocross, is to conserve your momentum.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090
You've got to work hard to build up speed
and therefore you need to bear it in mind

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.109
when you're getting off your bike.

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.070
You want to practice this technique on a flat
stretch of grass, so that there's nothing

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.850
to avoid or stop for. Adjust your speed so
that you're riding a little bit above

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.440
walking pace. Most riders get off on the left
side of the bike so that they can then carry

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.489
it with the chainrings facing away from them.
Hold your handlebars on the brake hoods or

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.420
the drops. On the tops, you'll have no way
of controlling your speed and a narrower hand

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.050
position isn't quite as stable.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.110
Put your left pedal in the 6 'o' clock position
and transfer your weight onto it. Unclip your

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.650
right foot and swing your leg around the back
of the bike and then step through between

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.800
your left leg and the frame. This means that
you'll hit the ground in a running position

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.520
so you can then end up dismounting at faster
speeds. Standing over on one pedal should

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.320
feel really stable and comfortable, right?
You can just cruise around like this to get

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.110
comfortable.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.910
Next, take your right hand, and place it on
the top tube, putting weight through it and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.780
unweighting your left foot.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.710
Unclip this left foot, so your weight is temporarily
supported on your hands, giving you a bit

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.610
more time to touch the ground with your right
foot and start running.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.460
Your right hand is then also in the correct
position to lift your bike either seamlessly

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.000
onto your shoulder, or just lift it up to
clear the barriers.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.500
The only thing youâ€™ve really got to look
out for is unclipping that left foot and then

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.700
stepping through with your right. If you're
riding in muddy conditions then often the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.740
release in your pedals gets a little bit hit-and-miss.
So taking that weight through your right hand

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.980
on the top tube just gives you that little
bit more time to get that right foot down

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.869
and the left foot unclipped, so that if it
is a little bit stuck, and I know you do struggle

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.149
sometimes with clipping and unclipping, this
will help that a lot.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.299
You should never push a cross bike along the
ground, you should always lift it. If it's

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.980
just for a short period of time, just lifting
it like that is absolutely fine. For anything

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.790
longer, it's worth popping it on your shoulder.
To do that, Grab the downtube around 3/4 of

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.980
the way up and then just lift it onto your
shoulder like that. Then slide your hand underneath

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.340
and grab the drops there and then that's really
secure and you can run like that, no problem.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.200
Putting the bike down is then just a case
of reversing the process, and popping it on

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.689
the ground. You don't want to drop the bike,
you just want to place it so that you maintain

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:03.949
control at all times. Once you've got those
dialled, it's then time to think about the remount.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.299
First of all, you want to be holding the bars
on the hoods or on the tops. To learn, I think

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.689
we'll do it on the tops, it makes it a little
bit easier. Basically, you don't want to jump

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.010
back on your bike, even when you're running.
It should feel like more of a slide. You start

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.499
simply by bringing your right leg over the
back of the bike and then you sort of step

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:30.180
over it and you want to land on the top of
your thigh - that's really important, to land

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.700
on the top of your thigh and then your momentum
from running just puts you back in the seat

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.980
and away you go, you slide across. Ultimately
we're going to do it from running, but to

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.329
learn I think the important thing is to do
it from stationary. It's simply a case of

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:53.260
pushing off with this left foot and then just
going for it, really.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.379
Si, we've had a look at all the components
of getting on and getting off the bike. I

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.560
guess it's going to take me a bit of time
to get it pretty polished but I guess I also

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.010
need to sew it all together as well.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.099
Absolutely, you've got to practice with these
things. It does take time to get the skills

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.050
dialled and to get it smooth. You also can't
forget that if you're going to get on and

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.820
off your bike there's got to be a purpose
for it as well. In short, you want to be off

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.690
your bike and running for the shortest amount
of time possible. However, the later you

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.020
leave it before the obstacle, the harder
it gets. As a rough guide, around 4 strides

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.320
before and after the obstacle is about the
maximum you want to leave it and ideally it's

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.140
as short as 2. Sometimes after the obstacle
you might not actually be able to get straight

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.750
back on. It just depends on your speed and
the terrain. It might be quicker therefore

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.700
to carry on running for a bit longer and jump
back on later. As a golden rule, if it's slower

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.110
to ride than it is to run, perhaps you want
to consider running as your option. Real top

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.990
guys use running as a viable alternative to
riding, mainly because the process of getting

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.070
on and off is so slick that they don't actually lose any time at all. Anywhere they're

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.250
slowing down, they'll jump off and run. It's
tough, but it's worth trying to incorporate

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.650
bits of that into your riding as well.
