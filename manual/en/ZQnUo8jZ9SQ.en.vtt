00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.120
As one of the best-selling independently produced
sandbox games ever made – not to mention

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.330
one of the most influential games of the past
five years - Minecraft has inspired a number

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.330
of imitators.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.860
Markus Persson’s open-ended construction-kit-cum-adventure
arrived on iOS this week, just one week after

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.510
imitator Junk Jack hit the App Store.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.810
Unlike many games inspired by Minecraft, Junk
Jack more than holds its own.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.480
Initially, it can seem very unforgiving, plonking
you into its world with no instructions whatsoever.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.390
You’re simply left to go out, explore, and
smash rocks and trees into pixellated bits.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.300
There’s a craftbook that gives you basic
instructions on how to get around and how

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.610
to construct a few basic tools at your grid-based
craft table, but otherwise it’s up to you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.341
to fend for yourself.

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:50.010
To make stuff, you obviously need resources,
so you’ll need to step out into the world

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.540
and obliterate the blocks in the environment
by tapping repeatedly on them.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.620
Gather a few materials and you can open up
your crafting table, a 3x3 grid where you

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.200
drop objects (stone, wood, etc.) and start
creating.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.870
You’ll need a shovel for dirt, and a pickaxe
to smash rocks, while an axe makes short work

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.700
of any trees in the vicinity.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.149
A hammer can break up chests and usable items,
and then, if you want to upgrade your tools,

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.219
you’ll need an anvil.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.649
Once you have the necessary base materials,
you place them in position and voila – a

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.749
new tool is yours.

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:23.569
In a cute touch, the shape representing the
tool in the grid resembles the tool itself.

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.420
Of course, you’ll need a sword, too – because
here be monsters.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.530
In truth, they’re more a minor irritation
than something to be feared, but their presence

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.270
lends a certain tension to your trips away
from home.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.039
You’ll need to craft torches when night
falls to ensure the monsters don’t spawn

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.549
near you, which is just a matter of combining
coal and wooden planks.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.729
If Junk Jack doesn’t hold your hand, its
rules are still logical, and before long you’ll

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.249
start figuring it out before it’s prepared
to reveal all – uncovering its secrets unprompted

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.200
is all part of the appeal.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.579
Though less expansive than Minecraft, it’s
a good fit for iOS, and its pixel-art visual

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.109
style has plenty of charm - as does the dinky
chiptune soundtrack that’ll have you whistling

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.659
while you work.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.950
Before long, you’ll be spinning wool on
a wheel and using a forge to make glass and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.300
cook food, or crafting ingots, building special
items, and getting lost in the wilderness.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.950
The only real niggle you’ll come up against
is the controls.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.230
Icons are small, and rearranging your inventory
can be excruciatingly awkward.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.470
It’s not entirely ruinous, but a few interface
tweaks would help.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.989
Junk Jack isn’t for those who prefer straightforward
objectives – or, indeed, any kind of goal

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.099
at all.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.990
Some will find it overwhelming, but its gloriously
freeform setup should find it a solid fanbase,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.700
even if it looks set to be crushed in the
popularity stakes by the game that clearly

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.360
inspired it.
