Hi! I’m John Armstrong with expertvillage.com.
I’m a professional guitar instructor and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.380
today we’ll be discussing advanced jazz
guitar. Okay next I’d like to start off

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.839
our first lesson of advanced jazz guitar and
discussing nine chords, so far we’ve discussed

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.130
triads and seven chords but now let’s go
into the next group of chords in which we

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.750
refer to as nine chords. What a nine chord
is we’re using the root, the third and the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.910
fifth, the seventh and the 9th note of the
major scale, now the ninth note of the major

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.430
scale would be the same as the second note
but in order to build in upward fashion using

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.890
odd number notes will refer to the second
note as the 9th note. Okay I’d like to first

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.770
start off, we’re not going to start off
with the major 9 let’s start off with dominate

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
9 so it’s going to have a flat and 7 in
it, there’s a nice voicing right here, for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.120
example if I was to do a D9 based off the
fifth string. What I have here is my root

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.149
note followed by my third note of the major
scale, my flat and 7, one, two, three, four,

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.830
five, six, seven flatted, my 9 which is the
same as my second and my 5th, so root, 3rd,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.220
flat and 7th, ninth and 5th. Important to
memorize those chord tones, root, 3rd, flat

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.049
and 7th, 9th and 5th because if I wanted to
simply alter that chord by playing what we

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.480
refer to as a D9, sharp 5 I figure out where
my 5th is which is on the high E string, sharp

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:32.930
it…now I have a D9, sharp 5 chord. Same
thing now that a D9 flat 5, flat the 5 move

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:43.200
back a fret, kind of an eerie sounding chord
but a very popular jazz chord. When I altered

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.509
the 9th either by sharping or flatting the
9th we no longer have what’s technically

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.119
referred to as a 9 chord but we still use
our 9 chord as our departure point, for example

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.610
a D9 sharp 9 is root, 3rd, flat and 7th, take
the 9th and sharp it, the popular ever so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.530
popular Jimmy Hendrix chord or Stevie Ray
Vaughan type chord. The same chord now flat

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.690
and 9th, a D7 flat 9 root, 3rd, flat and 7th,
flat and 9th, I can also have 5ths in there,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:22.540
you can have a D seven flat nine and sharp
five, D seven flat nine, flat five, D seven

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.270
sharp 9 flat 5, where I got a sharp 9th and
a flatted 5th. Unless the 5th is altered it’s

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.010
a passive tone and can be omitted, for example
like the D7 sharp 9 chord but if I have D

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.280
7 sharp 9 flat 5 I must figure out a way to
incorporate that flatted 5th.
