00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.270
[music]

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.500
&gt;&gt; Dave Fahey, Co-Project Scientist: The Global
Hawk is the world's most sophisticated unmanned

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.400
aircraft. NASA's acquisition of these aircraft
are the first by a civilian agency. And so

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.720
that gives us an opportunity to show how we
might use these for Earth science. This capability

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.720
is our future.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.460
&gt;&gt; Paul Newman, Co-Project Scientist: GloPac
is the Global Hawk Pacific Mission. GloPac

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.410
is the first scientific mission that is being
flown on the Global Hawk aircraft. Before

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.090
this aircraft was acquired by NASA, it was
used for actually military reconnaissance.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.480
The Global Hawk is a fully autonomous aircraft.
It doesn’t have any operators onboard. The

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.010
Global Hawk can fly to 65,000 feet, it has
a wingspan that’s just a little longer than

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.700
the wingspan of a 737. A long wingspan allows
you to get to higher altitudes. It can fly

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.880
over 30 hours continuously, and has a range
of over ten thousand nautical miles. The Global

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.270
Hawk can take off from California and get
all the way up to the high Arctic, plus it

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.130
can go all the way to the equator. And so
it’s a really capable plane in terms of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.130
duration and altitude. Much more than any
manned aircraft we've ever used.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.160
&gt;&gt; Dave Fahey, Co-Project Scientist: The value
of the GloPac mission really is two-fold.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.100
One, it’s showing how an unmanned aircraft
of the capabilities of the Global Hawk can

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.710
be used for the benefit of Earth Science.
This aircraft significantly expands our capability.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.200
And second, we will gather some very important
information from the atmosphere during GloPac,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.140
to tell us about the distribution of gases
and aerosols in the upper troposphere and

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.070
lower stratosphere. The upper troposphere
and lower stratosphere is a very important

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.550
region of the atmosphere to study. One of
the reasons is it's not very often studied

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.130
because of the difficulty of getting there.
Satellites routinely sample that region but

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.070
not as, with the same kind of precision that
you might like. So we'd like to do more process-based

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.070
studies in that region.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.069
&gt;&gt; Paul Newman, Co-Project Scientist: There's
a total of ten instruments aboard the Global

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.610
Hawk for the GloPac mission. These instruments
break into two kinds; one is what we call

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.240
a remote sensor, which measures things far
away. We have another type of instrument we

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.690
call an in situ instrument, and this measures
the air that the aircraft is actually flying

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.070
through. They will measure particular gases
like ozone, water, nitrous oxide, or laughing

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.129
gas, plus temperatures, pressures, winds and
so forth.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.310
&gt;&gt; Dave Fahey, Co-Project Scientist: The other
thing is we’re very interested in validation

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.310
of the Aura satellite.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.810
&gt;&gt; Paul Newman, Co-Project Scientist: The
Aura satellite measures ozone depleting gases

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.170
and ozone. The second thing it does, is that
Aura measures various gases involved with

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.040
air quality. So it’s a validation experiment.
You have to make sure that your satellite

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.260
instruments are still measuring what you originally
intended for them to measure.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.260
[music]

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.930
&gt;&gt; Chris Naftel, Global Hawk Project Manager:
One of the great things about this aircraft

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.060
is it can be configured for a wide range of
payloads. Payloads can be mounted underneath

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:29.040
the nose of the aircraft, under the belly
of the aircraft, in the rear tail area. There's

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.860
several bays on the side of the aircraft that
are available. On top, near the front of the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.860
aircraft, under the radome.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.760
&gt;&gt; Dave Fratello, Global Hawk Payload Manager:
So on the airplane itself, we've identified

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.120
over 14 different compartments that are available
for payloads. We've added six Iridium links

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.300
for global payload communication. There's
also four on there for the aircraft command

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.470
and control. So we're actually carrying 10
Iridium systems on the airplane. Iridium is

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.310
an array of satellites. You can be anywhere
on the Earth and you're within Iridium coverage

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.660
24-7. And so it's a great way for us to talk
to the airplane and get downlink data from

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.110
the aircraft no matter where it is in the
world.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.340
&gt;&gt; Paul Newman, Co-Project Scientist: With
most aircraft, the people are either sitting

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.660
in the aircraft and so they're watching their
measurements as the airplane is flying through

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.239
certain air, or they're on the ground, and
you don't see your data until after the plane

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.630
has landed. With the Global Hawk, though,
everybody's sitting in a room called the Global

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.750
Hawk Operations Center, and you're viewing
your data as it's being measured. So you get

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.010
to see your data in real time.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.279
&gt;&gt; Dave Fratello, Global Hawk Payload Manager:
Well, the GHOC, our Global Hawk Operations

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:39.629
Center, it's uniquely divided into two rooms.
We've got the flight operations group in the

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:44.801
front. In the back room we have a fully independent
capability for our payload scientists. So

00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:49.610
we've got 14 workstations there. Each one
dedicated to supporting an individual instrument.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.210
&gt;&gt; Paul Newman, Co-Project Scientist: And
we have all the instrument operators sitting

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.969
in this back room, they can talk to their
instruments and make subtle corrections to

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.720
the computer programming of the instrument,
or they can send it in to a different sampling

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.940
mode. So it's really an interactive process
now. So it's a new way of doing science.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.069
&gt;&gt; Phil Hall, Global Hawk Pilot: When we were
controlling the NASA Global Hawk, it?s a whole

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.199
different challenge. It's more like being
a cross between an air traffic controller

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.110
and pilot because you have this birds-eye
view of the aircraft. It's a very sort of

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.509
a disconnected experience. We have to really
focus on where it is, how it's going to react.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.680
When I give it commands how long is it going
to take. It's a lot of the basic airmanship,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.889
but the hand-eye coordination is a lot different.
It's mouse-screen coordination

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.349
&gt;&gt; Delewis Porter, Global Hawk Pilot: If you're
an airplane pilot, then to think the possibility

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:44.689
of leaving that and start flying an airplane
that's remotely controlled and using a mouse

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.939
and a keyboard, that's a big paradigm shift.
But, as I got more and more involved in it

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.669
and started to search it out and realizing
the potential of the Global Hawk aircraft

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.889
and its impact on the science world, I became
more and more enamored with it.

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.610
&gt;&gt; Paul Newman, Co-Project Scientist: The
GloPac mission is really a partnership of

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.169
a number of federal agencies and private industries,
and universities. NASA is the one who owns

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:14.229
and operates these planes. But that's a partnership
with both NOAA, the National Oceanographic

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.479
and Atmospheric Administration, and Northrup
Grumman, the people who have built these planes.

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.909
&gt;&gt; Dave Fahey, Co-Project Scientist: The GloPac
mission is a great example of the collaboration

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.790
between NASA and NOAA. Both agencies share
an interest in the future of unmanned aircraft

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.830
for their particular program. And those of
us in the GloPac mission see ourselves as

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.490
early adopters. And it’s very clear already
that a success of this aircraft will have

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:42.360
a lot of ramifications because people?’
imaginations will be engaged as to what else

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.500
we could do now that we’ve demonstrated
for the first time that putting scientific

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.940
instruments onboard and taking it far away
from home is a good idea and can be done in

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.940
a successful way.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.889
&gt;&gt; Paul Newman, Co-Project Scientist: I really
think that this is really a historic occasion

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.599
for us. It's because we're on the cusp of
something new. We're on the cusp of using

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:09.800
a plane that's a basically a satellite as
well as a plane. We can venture out into the

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.499
regions where a lot of the weather in the
United States forms but is so remote from

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:20.740
us that we can't get to it. And so that information
is now going to be used to improve forecasts,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:27.819
it'll be used to improve our policies towards
air quality and climate change and ozone depletion.

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:32.839
It's a new way of doing things for us. And
I think that's what makes you think that we're

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.740
really doing something exciting and new and
historic.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.099
