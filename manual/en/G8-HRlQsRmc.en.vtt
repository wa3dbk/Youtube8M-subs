00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.730
Hi girls ! Today, I will show you how to make a special nail art for halloween.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.750
With corresponding colors, that is black and orange.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.440
And I have drawn some dripping blood.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.860
You can obviously use other colors. Like Brown for dripping chocolate.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.820
I hope that you’ll enjoy this video

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.930
and that it'll will give you some ideas for Halloween.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.330
For this nail art, I will use the orange color.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.620
And I apply two coats as usual.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.620
Except that I don’t apply it from the top.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.320
Because later I will make a reverse French manicure.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.590
So I let the first coat dry.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.590
And then, I apply the second one.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.600
The reverse French manicure, also known as Dita Von Teese’s manicure,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.190
consists of leaving the lunula empty.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.240
Then I use a detail brush and black acrylic paint

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.990
To make the reverse French manicure

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.020
And later, I will make the dripping blood.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.290
Vary the size and the height of your reverse French manicure to obtain a beautiful nail art.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.860
Now I draw the dripping blood and I fill in the blank.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.010
Then with an orange liner brush

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.130
Preferably of the same color as the base

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.480
I draw the outline

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.000
And then I have to apply the final top coat to protect the design.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.440
I hope that you’ve enjoyed this video, done specially for Nails.fr
