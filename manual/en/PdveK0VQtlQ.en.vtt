00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.820

So go ahead and grab that.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.270
Okay this is the question that came in.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.550
“Hello Antonio, I’ve been enjoying your
site and YouTube page for a year or so now.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.890
I’ve been impress with your ability to regulate,
create post and put out a new content.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.160
Your consistency is appreciated.”

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.190
Well thank you sir.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.510
“I wanted to ask if you could write or talk
about contrasting white collars.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.530
I was wondering if it limits the shirts versatility.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.390
And if you have any guidelines or suggestions
regarding white collars with the collars shape

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.690
style and the man’s body build.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.799
I'm concerning a white collar on an ecru shirt,
I like the ecru color for many of my suits

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.500
but I have a golden yellow complexion.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.510
I'm Filipino and I'm worried that they’re
going to blend too much with the color, especially

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.290
when I lose my tan with the winter.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.259
I fear the white will help with that or could
I be over thinking it?

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.990
Thank you for your time, Jonathan from Chicago.”

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.610
Okay and he also adds at the end that he works
in government and that he’s surrounded by

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.390
a lot of sharp dressers there in Chicago.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.110
Alright, so let’s talk a little bit about
the contrasting cuff, not just cuff but actually

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.869
he’s asking about the color but usually
see the cuff as well.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.120
So that’s – where is this come from?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.880
And why do you see it on men’s shirts?

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.430
Well the history with this is collars and
cuffs are the first thing to wear out on a

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.430
shirt.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.910
So there was a very – there was an ingenious
woman, at one time she got tired of washing

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.320
her husband’s clothing and she said, you
know, wouldn’t it be easier because it’s

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.110
the cuffs, and it’s the collar that get
dirty all the time and wear out.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.860
“What if I just made them so that they came
off?” and so she did that.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.480
And this is a white on white shirt because
that’s what was primarily wanted about 100

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480
years ago.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.740
And so she took it so it was, she basically
just made it so that they were interchangeable

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:36.480
and – so she saved herself on doing laundry
and what we had was the removable collar and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.480
the cuff.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.070
Now this fell out of style because it was
kind of a pain in the butt to mess with this

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.300
stuff, to attach it, and laundry became easier
to do but what stuck around was the idea that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.490
you could actually mix match colors and cuffs.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.340
And used to again, be white on white but then
you saw the white probably getting stuck on

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.390
blue and I'm sure it happened the first time
because a guy had to had to work.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.730
He was a little bit – maybe he didn’t
really mind so much and his wife was like,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.950
“okay we’re putting this together and
you’re wearing it.”

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.370
That’s how I would like to think it evolved,
who knows?

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.280
That’s probably lost there in history.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.100
But in any case, what we started say, were
different color shirt bodies, mixed with a

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.410
white cuff and a white collar.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.650
Nowadays, I see this primarily in the world
of banking and finance and the signals that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.310
it sends to me and this is important because
this is – whatever comes to somebody’s

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.260
mind, this is what you’re dressing for in
many ways.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.700
What you’ve got to pay attention to.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.200
To me it symbolizes that you’re above working
with your hands and you’re more of somebody

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.020
who works with your mind.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.860
So it’s not necessarily a bad thing but
if you’re in the construction field or you’re

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.380
in a field in which you want to be more down
to earth, more approachable with the people

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.930
that you work with, you probably want to be
careful with that type of style.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.210
It gives kind of a little higher ends style
which, again, if you’re in the banking world

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.210
perhaps you want to send the signal that you’re
not – that you are of someone of the intellect

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.380
and that you’re a good person to invest
your money with.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.049
In any case, you’ve got to make that decision
but you’re question is more okay.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.320
I'm Filipino, I’ve got a little bit color
of yellow in your skin color, especially during

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.300
the summer you’ve got a bit of a tan but
during the winter you’ll lose that tan and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.310
your worried that the ecru which is kind of
a yellowish colored shirt is going to be too

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.780
close to your skin color and the white is
going to help offset that.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.450
I like this logic and I think you thought
through this and this is a pretty – I think

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.710
it’s a good idea and if you think this is
going to look good in it.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.270
Sounds like you’re already surrounded by
some pretty sharp dressers, I would go for

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.270
it.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.810
I think this sounds like a good combination
but just know the history and know the symbolism

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.120
that you’re going to be sending out there
to the world.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.200
But it sounds like you’re pretty aware of
it and hopefully with that little bit of a

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200
history…

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.820
…lesson you’ll be a little bit more prepared
when you put this together.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.100
The other thing that I would talk about is
– okay I'm sorry.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:16.100
You want to tone down the rest of your outfit
because this contrast is going to be probably

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.540
the style feature, so you want to be looking
at everything else you’re wearing and perhaps

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.540
tone it down.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.690
So you don’t want to necessarily work your
brightest tie, you don’t want to wear an

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.900
outlandish pocket square, you don’t want
it to be with the suit that’s already drawing

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.900
attention.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.820
Basically your shirt – because of this contrast
and because it’s not the most common thing

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.090
and again this depends n your environment
but you probably want to let that be the item

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.360
that you’re actually wearing that pops.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.850
Okay, well hopefully that answers your question
and we didn’t get into a lot of other colors,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.740
I think this contrast works great with light
blue, with dark blue, with ecru, I’ve seen

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.080
it with pink, I’ve seen it lavender, so
but primarily it works with solid.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.810
Now once you start mixing the solid white
collar and cuff with stripes like with the

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.600
kind of shirt I have here, you’re going
to – it’s not going to have as much of

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.850
a pop but I don’t think it looks as great
but certain of them can pull off, I’ve seen

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.530
it pulled off but you need to be a little
bit more style savvy.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.120
Okay this is been Antonio Sentinel with Real
Men Real Style, I’ll see you in the comments.
