Howdy folks how's it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen today i'm gonna be showing you to

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:16.309
make the easiest, quickest most customisable
ice-cream sandwich.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.390
Looks really good right and do you know what
out of the 600 odd videos i've done to date

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.929
it's probably the simplest i've ever made
and you can get away with two ingredients

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.220
I used 3 ramped it up a little bit but you
can completely go to town on it I went for

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.399
chocolate cookies because I love them, peanut
butter ice cream because I love peanut butter

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.250
ice cream oh my gosh and some hazlenuts, so
just put your own spin on it.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.200
Before I show you the ridiculously easy steps
that it takes i've had a few messages from

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.750
people saying they wanna see where I live
so I took the go-pro out earlier and did a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:55.129
little bit of shooting, here is my bike cam.

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.359
Yeah that was me peddling on my bike, now
this is shopping basket cam.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:14.620
Kinda cool now this is driving cam, good times
and this is my personal favourite barryoke

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:38.820
car-eoke cam - sings 'hey baby', 'it's raining
men' and 'Never gonna give you up'.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.790
Alright enough of the cams now this is how
I made it you grab your favourite ice cream

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.810
tub and a nice sharp knife then cut a good
section out of it be careful when you do that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.430
make sure the ice-cream is nice and frozen
so it holds it's shape and you can even put

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.730
it back on it's original place and lift it
up so it's like a talking mouth thing.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.810
Sit that lovely wedge of ice cream onto a
cookie that you've turned upside down so you've

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.720
got the smooth side there and snip off the
casing, peeling it off then you put your other

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.300
cookie down on top then you just wait for
a little bit.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.840
I haven't got a watch on but just go with
it you want to leave it about 5 minutes just

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.850
to make it go to room temperature once you're
ready it's gonna get a little bit manoeuvrable

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.570
gently press on it not too much or you will
snap your cookie but gently press on it and

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.670
it'll squeeze the ice cream out the sides.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.670
With your ice-cream all pushed out to the
edges give it a nice roll in hazlenuts or

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.220
whatever you want to do, plonk it on a plate
and then it goes in the freezer until you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.200
are ready to gobble it up which really should
be straight away.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.280
Oh my goodness guys I can't tell you how amazing
that tastes heehee my stomach is doing the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700
conga it's rumbling and shimmying and all
that stuff I am loving it.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.350
But i've got a question for you, if you were
to make one of these right now what would

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.350
you put on it?

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.650
Would you make a bland one with vanilla ice
cream and plain biscuits would you have a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.840
massive stack like a big mac sandwich ice
cream that's what I wanna do right now.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.900
I'd be interested to know so let me know in
the comments box below and i'll reply and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.710
interact with you guys and stuff but there
we go that is our super easy deliciously yummy

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:25.820

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:35.870
Sings '3 way'
