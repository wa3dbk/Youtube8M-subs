00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.680
Do you like 80s?

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.710
Roland DR-HS5 Dynamic Microphone.

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:13.550
Optimized for vocoder.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:16.720
cable length: 5 meters

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:22.250
long enough to use on your big stage.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.160
looks like 80s technopop

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.930
handsfree vocoder!!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.140
microKORG XL

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:42.990
connect both XLR

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:44.920
output to my camera

00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:47.230
Vocoder! vocoder!

00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:51.705
Drums: "BtBx" iPhone App

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.040
The mouth is near the mic,

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:29.810
so you can get clear voice

00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:35.550
you can play self delay.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.730
Of course I depend on default mic.

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:55.500
Although this deteriorates my posture.

00:01:55.501 --> 00:02:04.140
But this headset sets me free!

00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:09.950
This sets my vocoder free!!

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.330
I think you listened terrible sounds today.

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:22.730
Because I connected to "mic input" of the camcoder.

00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:25.100
Don't worry.

00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:28.500
I listened good clear sounds through the headphone.

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:34.880
Roland DR-HS5
