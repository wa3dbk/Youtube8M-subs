00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.510
For me I tend to try stuff that's too
hard for me so I like to be able to get

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.980
up there out and try the move. My name is
Dan Brayack I've been stick clipping for

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.740
about ten years now. Stick clipping on some routes can reduce the danger

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.460
factor significantly. A lot of times
getting to the first bolt's pretty hard

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.970
or it might be a bad landing. If you
stick clip it then you're on top rope

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.309
you completely safe and even coming off
a ledge say and you're worried about

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.510
falling directly onto your belayer, if you
can stick clip you know the first bolt

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.109
then you have that in the system so you
don't end up taking a factor two fall

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.100
or anything like that, so it's pretty
pretty handy. It's safe it's a really

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.239
good idea I don't really see any reason
why you wouldn't want to stick clip. For

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.850
me it's just a personal preference I
mean if you like to hang your own

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.140
draws I mean that's awesome you know
that's great. Everyone has their

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.300
different ethics. I'm
climbing for me. The first thing

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.780
we're going to do is to talk
about regular stick clipping

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.330
The first thing we do is we put our carabiner into
our Squid here and you want to point

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.630
your carabiner
kind up so it faces the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.200
way that you want to go into the hanger.
You put your rope through your quickdraw and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.180
bring your stick clip up to your bolt.
You can put the Squid right through the

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.350
bolt there. Then you actually pull
down on the rope and if you pull down on

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.640
the rope that allows you to push up on
the Squid

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.950
and twist out. Then there you are,
you're stick clipped. Alright say you already

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.070
have the first quickdraw on your route
clipped. What we want to do is what's

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.060
called a rodeo clip. Basically you're
going to put the rope into the already

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.210
hanging quickdraw. So you get your rope

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.940
and orient it so the climbing end is
coming out toward you, put it down into

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.800
the Squid by opening up little ears put
the ears down over top. Then you need to

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.320
hold on to your rope because if you
don't hold onto your rope there's a

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.560
really good chance the weight of the
rope is going to pull out of the Squid.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.789
You bring the loop up to the quickdraw and you
need to be careful that you get it right

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.230
in the little sweet spot of the carabiner. Now
from here what you do is you tug on one

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.510
end of the rope and it clips into the
draw. That's it you're, good to go. Now

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.019
the coolest part about the Squid I have
to admit is the un-Squid.

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.600
The one thing you can't do with the regular stick is unclip an already hanging quickdraw

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.950
from the route. You want to already have
the mouth of the Squid facing in the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.980
direction of the gate. Bring the squid up
to the carabiner and you put the mouth into the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.840
gate and twist and pull down. Then
you have the carabiner in a locked open

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.970
position and you can lift up and
pull the draw out of the hanger. This is

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.290
the Beta Stick compact it's an
alternative stick clipping device. To

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.640
load it, you put your
carabiner in the little nook here and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.560
use your wire to secure your gate and
you're good to go.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.790
To rodeo clip, you get a
bight of rope. Now, make sure

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.260
you don't back clip so you want to
orient the rope correctly. Go ahead and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.370
put a bight of rope through the little
velcro section here. You want to cinch

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.690
the velcro down over your bight. Now when
you're extending the pull up toward the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.530
quickdraw, you want to make sure that you hold
onto the rope tight. If you just let the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.060
weight of the rope pull on the velcro
it's probably going to pull out. You

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.200
extend it up to the quickdraw and pull one
end of the rope through. There you go

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.060
your stick clipped. Another good feature of
the Beta Stick compact is that you can

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.370
actually use it for bouldering to brush
holds that you couldn't normally reach. It's set up

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.440
to put the brush right in the little hole here and it

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.300
sits firm. But you also use the velcro
to cinch it down even further. You're

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.980
good to go -  let's brush some holds.
