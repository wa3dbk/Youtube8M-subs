Hi! This is Diana for Expert Village.com.
I am going to show you how to make a curly

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.460
bow for the package that we just wrapped.
So I am going to stretch out my ribbon pretty

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.400
far. We are going to use it all so use as
much as you need. We are going to start about

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.359
halfway through the ribbon, come down across
the top of the package, flip the package over,

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:44.678
criss cross the ribbon in the back and flip
the package back over. Now you can cut your

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:53.750
ribbon off leaving enough so that you can
tie the ribbon at the top; just a regular

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:05.460
knot. Now for the curly part at the top, I
need to take quite a bit more ribbon here

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:14.630
and I am going to cut it off in about two
or three foot lengths and they do not have

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:28.280
to be the same length; just approximate. Now
we put those all together and hold them about

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.740
in the middle, put that down on top of the
knot that you have already made, tie another

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.530
knot on top of that and I do a double just
to make sure it sticks and now we are going

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.080
to do the curling. So I get my scissors and
I open them because I am only going to use

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.610
one blade and we are going to zip this scissors
along the under side of the ribbon, so you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.470
want to make sure you are using the size of
the ribbon that curls under, hold that tightly

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.180
against your thumb. This ribbon; it is between
my thumb and the blade of the scissors and

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:24.530
pull it fast. You can make a really full bow
if you put lots of extra strands on the top

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.280
that you are going to curl. You can also add
different colors to the ribbon and have a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.490
multicolored curly bow on the top. You could
curl in really tight by holding the scissors

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:44.920
really tight against your thumb or you can
hold it lightly and make loose curls and here

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.590
is the curly ribbon on the top of the package.
