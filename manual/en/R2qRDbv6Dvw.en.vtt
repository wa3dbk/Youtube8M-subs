00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
cars.com auto review

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.240
hi I'm Dave Thomas with cars.com and
this is the Jaguar XF it's been

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.920
tweaked a little bit for 2012

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.940
you can stay competitive against BMW
5-series infinities m and the all-new

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.689
$YEAR lexus GS but remains the only one
of those that features a standard v8

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.000
engine and the XF debuted few years ago
it was a radical design departure for

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.210
Jaguar these days most people are
familiar with it but there are some

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.379
changes which i really like mostly to
the headlights they used to have a bulge

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.949
right here in the middle a circle that
kind of popped out now they're much more

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.219
streamlined it's a much tighter look
also some subtle changes to the

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.579
taillight and i can tell you what i was
driving this last week in Michigan

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.020
Avenue downtown Chicago and it was still
turning heads the standout feature on

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.120
the XF though is the engine the standard
VA puts out 385 horsepower it sounds

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.450
terrific and it's a lot of fun to drive
around the office we've been having a

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.440
debate some of us think we'd much rather
be driving Jaguars these days and BMW

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.940
starting over 52,000 dollars this v8 is
a steal

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.750
however if you want more power there's a
supercharged version of a 5-liter v8

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.760
which puts out 470 horsepower but it
starts at sixty-eight thousand dollars

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.080
and if that's not enough you can move up
to the XF are the highest performance

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.890
version which puts out 510 horsepower
but again you're gonna be paying more

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.680
sorts of $82,000 into any 60,000 our
luxury sedan and you're going to be

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.909
expecting a luxurious interior while
German sedans from BMW and Audi have

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.180
more of a sterile look the Jaguar goes
for something a little more elegant

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.320
especially all their use of leather and
wood trim definitely step up from those

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.500
other two even things like the thumb
wheels on the steering wheel have a

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.180
great deal to them and luckily Jaguar
didn't get rid of to the coolest

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.960
features in the XF the shift knob that
pops out of the center console when you

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.049
start the engine and the events that
roll over when you turn them on and off

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.310
my kids got a kick out of that every
time one of the drawbacks is a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.820
multimedia system that comes standard in
the except its screen is smaller than

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.450
most of the competition out there and
there's some definite lag time during

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.410
the transitions between the screens
while some of our editors don't like

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.950
this system after driving this for a
full week I definitely got used to it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.430
and compared to some of the even more
complicated systems out there it wasn't

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.650
that hard to use

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.769
backseat rooms a concern of yours

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.640
the driver access might not be the
perfect fit you can see here I've just

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.150
enough room behind the driver's seat
where I had it was driving i'm 5 10

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.900
so if you're six feet tall as a driver
your backseat passenger might not be

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.579
that comfortable on paper the excess
truck is one of the biggest in the class

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.260
over 17 cubic feet but reality is a
really narrow opening it's kind of hard

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.040
to use

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.049
now there's a special section cut out
you can put golf bags across the side

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.750
like this to the opening so narrow

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.670
kk pastor driver you're going to need
your driver even without the upgrades

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.930
for 2012 the XF remains a great choice
at a great price for drivers who have

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.930
more performance out of the sports sedan

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.090
