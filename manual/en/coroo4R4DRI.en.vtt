00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:01.967
Hey everyone, Happy New Year.

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:04.670
Welcome to the "Yoga With
Adriene" vlog, I'm Adriene.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.999
It's a bright and beautiful
new year, I'm so excited.

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:12.742
2015, a lot to look forward to

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:15.242
and a lot of mystery.

00:00:15.242 --> 00:00:16.838
There's this joy in the
mystery of the unknown

00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:19.458
and I can't wait to see what
happens in the new year.

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:22.226
So we kicked off the year
with "30 Days of Yoga",

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:26.712
super awesome, I am on day six

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:28.661
but you may be on day one or you might be

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.290
on day zero, looking to join us.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.493
So I'm here to let you know
that you can join us any time.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:36.748
"Thirty Days of Yoga" is
on the YouTube channel,

00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:40.098
it's kind of a DIY, do-it-yourself program

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:44.305
meant to inspire you to
build a home practice,

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:46.276
transform, let go of the things that are

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:48.238
no longer serving you, and get

00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:50.928
strong, tone, and fit!

00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:53.570
It's also a really lovely invitation to

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.829
just kind of take a look at yourself,

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.603
get back to who you are really are.

00:00:56.603 --> 00:00:58.853
We spent a lot of time and energy

00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:00.836
and a little bit of creativity and fun

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:02.327
making a program that doesn't just

00:01:02.327 --> 00:01:06.208
feel like, fitness! Hard! Push! Strong!

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:08.279
I think it's really
well-balanced and really fun

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:10.495
and also is something that
you can return back to.

00:01:10.495 --> 00:01:11.511
So that's on the YouTube channel,

00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:12.912
"Thirty Days of Yoga", check it out.

00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:14.558
If you wanna be inspired,
just look up the hashtag

00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:16.996
30 days of yoga and it'll
rock your socks off.

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:19.211
Such positivity. In fact, somebody left a

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:21.445
comment the other day that I love,

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:25.406
I even screenshotted it, screen shot it.

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:28.383
It said "there's no hate on here,

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:31.949
no trollin', no hate. Adrian
this is awesome, way to go."

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:34.387
And I think that's really cool and really

00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:36.569
indicative and really telling of

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.081
the community vibe that's
surrounding the yoga

00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:41.722
and the at-home yoga practice
with "Yoga With Adriene."

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:44.201
So right on my friends!

00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:46.979
I hope you had a lovely holiday.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.202
I did, it was really nice.

00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:50.171
There's always a little anxiety
at the end of the videos

00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:51.718
as you look ahead and as you look back

00:01:51.718 --> 00:01:54.447
and, I had my yoga

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.407
and my friends to help me

00:01:57.407 --> 00:02:00.419
just remind me to guide myself
back to the present moment.

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:02.621
So hopefully this vlog will help guide you

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:04.640
back to the present moment and just say,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.223
even if you didn't
transition into the new year

00:02:07.223 --> 00:02:08.783
the exact way you wanted to or

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:10.518
everything doesn't seem perfect,

00:02:10.518 --> 00:02:12.340
just relish in the moment.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.778
Life is good and we have our yoga practice

00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:16.321
or maybe it's something else for you,

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.983
running, or walking, or dancing,

00:02:18.983 --> 00:02:21.625
or some sort of movement
in connection to breath

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:24.354
that can help guide you to the next

00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:26.233
present moment and then on to the next.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.818
I got a puppy for
Christmas, I don't know if

00:02:27.818 --> 00:02:30.014
you saw him on my last vlog.

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:33.588
So I wanted to give you a
little update on his growth.

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:35.398
My friend David used to
work at a vet office,

00:02:35.398 --> 00:02:37.024
he said this is how you
pick the puppies up.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:40.357
I think, more dogs, than to
pick the puppies up like this,

00:02:40.357 --> 00:02:42.002
just making sure you support them.

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:45.395
So this is Benji, everyone. Hello.

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:48.401
He's a blue heeler, that's
a frequently asked question.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.661
He's a blue heeler mix, he's very loving,

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:53.949
he's very smart, it's been really fun to

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.447
see him evolve in the last couple weeks.

00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:59.394
I am here today at my
friend Haila's house,

00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:02.929
and Chris' house, and
they have a new baby too.

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.205
Oh, thanks for the kiss!

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:09.227
So we wanted to come together today

00:03:09.227 --> 00:03:10.872
and all say hello and happy new year

00:03:10.872 --> 00:03:13.066
and meet the babies.

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:16.175
I feel bad they're
meeting my hairy dog baby

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:19.630
and I'm meeting their
beautiful actual human baby.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.613
(baby crying)

00:03:27.643 --> 00:03:28.974
Benji, anything to say?

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:30.986
(dog squeals)

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:33.933
He said "Om Shanti, Shanti Om."

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:34.826
Thank you, Benji.

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:37.243
Alright, up next I would love to tell you

00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:38.804
about something really exciting.

00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:41.347
I've had the privilege and the honor to

00:03:41.347 --> 00:03:43.054
do a little cooking collaboration with

00:03:43.054 --> 00:03:44.965
my friends over at Kin Community.

00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:46.569
We've created a show for you called

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.577
"Crazy Happy Cooking" and I couldn't be

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:51.812
more excited to work with
them and just kind of

00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:54.189
dig into other video ideas,

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.784
yoga lifestyle and cooking is one of them.

00:03:56.784 --> 00:04:00.669
I've done some play with my
best buddy Haila cooking,

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.426
which I really love and this would be my

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:05.527
second time to play in the kitchen,

00:04:05.527 --> 00:04:08.151
if you will, and I've had a great time.

00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:09.893
Our first episode just released

00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:11.031
and I want you to go check it out.

00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:15.299
It's my breakfast taco recipe and

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.533
it was a really fun thing to shoot.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:18.883
So please go over and check it out.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.672
Check out "Crazy Happy
Cooking," follow along,

00:04:20.672 --> 00:04:24.106
we have many more recipes on the way.

00:04:24.106 --> 00:04:28.433
The idea is that these are all recipe-less

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:30.423
What am I trying to say?

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:34.417
Meals. These are all recipe-less meals.

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:35.799
So we're not baking, obviously.

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:37.586
I mean, let's keep it real here.

00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:40.009
You might need that recipe to bake.

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.122
The first one is breakfast
tacos for breakfast

00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:45.048
and the idea is that we
work with what we have,

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:48.928
we stay flexible and try
to make everyone happy

00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:50.371
with what we got.

00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:52.992
So, if you have organic foods and you have

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:55.288
access to local produce, then great.

00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:56.852
But if you don't, we make the best.

00:04:56.852 --> 00:04:58.802
We work with what we have and

00:04:58.802 --> 00:05:01.057
we always go with the flow
in the kitchen as well.

00:05:01.057 --> 00:05:04.146
And that can be a practice
that you take on this year,

00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:06.685
especially if you're
not one to like to cook,

00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:08.981
or be in the kitchen,
maybe you try this year.

00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:10.363
So hop on over to "Crazy Happy Cooking,"

00:05:10.363 --> 00:05:12.098
I had an awesome time over there.

00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:13.860
Check out my California kitchen

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.507
and let me know what you think there

00:05:16.507 --> 00:05:17.950
over at the breakfast taco video.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.581
Okay, so last but not least, I just wanted

00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:23.121
to say thank you, thank you
to all my friends who are

00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:26.676
already involved in the
"Thirty Days of Yoga" journey,

00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:29.013
thank you for your
inspiration and your stories,

00:05:29.013 --> 00:05:32.060
you're definitely inspiring
others to join in day by day

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.665
so thank you so much.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:35.657
Thank you for all the
beautiful friends that sent me

00:05:35.657 --> 00:05:37.993
loving cards and notes over the holiday

00:05:37.993 --> 00:05:40.126
and throughout the year, artwork.

00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:42.849
I'm gonna try to share them
on Instagram and Facebook

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:45.226
so other people can see,
whether it's your Etsy

00:05:45.226 --> 00:05:47.948
or just your love and your creativity,

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:50.224
I wanna share that and wanna be sure to

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:53.617
thank you for thinking
of me over the holiday.

00:05:53.617 --> 00:05:54.897
Thank you everyone.

00:05:54.897 --> 00:05:57.599
Let's keep up the great
work, keep up the positivity.

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.549
Don't let anyone rush you, don't let

00:05:59.549 --> 00:06:02.414
anyone slow you down. Be
exactly where you are today.

00:06:02.414 --> 00:06:04.414
You're perfect ♫Just the way you are♫

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.556
Let's have an awesome
year, alright everyone?

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:09.334
Take care.

00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:13.268
Come on Benji, together we bow and say,

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:16.189
"Ow, namaste."

00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:20.923
Aww, now you're being
good, you're a sweet boy.
