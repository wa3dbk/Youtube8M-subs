00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.923
- Computer running a little slow?

00:00:02.923 --> 00:00:04.506
Take a laser to it.

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.976
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:11.037 --> 00:00:12.404
Almost 50 years ago,

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:14.415
Gordon Moore made an observation.

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:17.018
He saw that you could
fit about twice as many

00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:20.043
transistors on a computer
chip every one or two years.

00:00:20.043 --> 00:00:21.750
It was such a great observation,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.931
we made it in to a law, Moore's Law,

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:25.693
and what a great law it's been.

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:28.641
Every 18 months or so you
got twice as much going on

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.654
a computer chip as you did before.

00:00:30.654 --> 00:00:33.556
But is today's smartphone
twice as functional

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:35.791
as a smartphone from two years ago?

00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.352
Probably not.

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:40.244
It turns out there's an
important parallel to Moore's Law

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:41.966
called Dennard Scaling.

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.600
Now this says as transistors shrink,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.004
the current and voltage
necessary to make them work

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.093
should scale at the same rate.

00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:52.246
And for a long time, this held true.

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:54.344
It's sort of like doubling your income

00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:56.764
but you only have to pay
the same amount of taxes

00:00:56.764 --> 00:00:57.891
as you did before,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.357
or eating twice as much but
you burn twice as many calories

00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:03.931
while sticking to the
same exercise routine.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.006
Sounds great, right?

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:06.853
Well, you know what they say,

00:01:06.853 --> 00:01:08.877
if it sounds too good to be true.

00:01:08.877 --> 00:01:11.961
By the mid 2000s,
transistors had shrunk down

00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:13.857
to 90 nanometers.

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:16.114
That's 90 billionths of a meter.

00:01:16.114 --> 00:01:19.299
Now below the size you start
to run in to some problems

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:20.935
with electrical current leakage,

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:22.800
making the chips less efficient.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.410
So today a more fitting
analogy would be fitted sheets.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.943
Let's say you got a
really tight fitted sheet

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:31.934
and you gotta put it on
an enormous mattress,

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:34.094
but every time you pull
down on one corner,

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.278
another one pops loose.

00:01:35.278 --> 00:01:37.726
You see, electrical leaks, well,

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:39.932
that means that you have
an increase in heat.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.780
An increase in heat means the
chance of a system failure,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.441
so you need to add some
form of cooling element,

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.221
like a fan in your laptop.

00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.681
But these require their own power source,

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.362
which means that the
price of the chip goes up,

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.275
and that could mean that
a chip never even makes it

00:01:55.275 --> 00:01:56.271
to market.

00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:58.265
Now engineers have been working on

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:00.160
getting around this problem in small ways,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.831
but for all intensive purposes,

00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.219
Dennard's dead.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.419
(bell ringing)

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.528
Well, actually, technically
he's still alive and well,

00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:09.494
but his scaling, not so much.

00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:11.937
Does this mean that the
pace of computer processing

00:02:11.937 --> 00:02:13.485
will slow to a crawl?

00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:15.972
Have we reached peak iPhone?

00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:17.572
Not necessarily.

00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:20.962
The solution may come in
the form of nanophotonics.

00:02:20.962 --> 00:02:23.078
You use optical signals,

00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:24.514
essentially light,

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:26.362
which are capable of carrying more data

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:28.305
than electromagnetic impulses.

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:31.572
But it's only been recent
that scientists have been able

00:02:31.572 --> 00:02:34.988
to incorporate both optical
and electrical elements

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.591
on the same transistor.

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:39.389
This could lead to the
holy grail of computing,

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.517
a supercomputer capable of
performing at the same level

00:02:42.517 --> 00:02:43.996
as the human brain.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.447
And I know, reality
television makes you think

00:02:46.447 --> 00:02:48.680
human brains aren't that special,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.041
but they totally are.

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.755
They're capable of performing
one million trillion

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.809
calculations in a second,

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.348
which is called an exaflop.

00:02:57.348 --> 00:02:58.181
Exaflop.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:01.883
Just that word alone
tells me the human brain

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:03.442
is pretty amazing.

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:05.831
Nanophotonics could also
lead to improvements

00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:07.230
in space communication,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.542
which traditionally we
use radio waves for.

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:10.868
And those are fine,

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:13.457
but NASA always has to be
careful to avoid interference

00:03:13.457 --> 00:03:14.930
during transmissions.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.830
Using lasers would get
around that problem.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.538
Plus, you can pack in a ton more data

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:23.363
in a laser transmission than
a radio wave transmission,

00:03:23.363 --> 00:03:26.112
Which means we could use
some more of our data heavy

00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:27.658
instruments that we have.

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:29.326
Well I have a question
for all of you this week.

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.802
It looks like nanophotonics
could preserve Moore's Law

00:03:32.802 --> 00:03:33.922
indefinitely,

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.202
but are there any other
technological trends

00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:38.447
that you think are in
danger of plateauing?

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.556
Let us know in the comments below.

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:42.054
