Alright you're looking at the TRITTON C2 Xpress,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.650
External Display Adapter and these are really really useful devices.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.990
These are USB 2.0 powered, Display Adapters and pretty much,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.200
you plug this into USB 2.0 and on the other end out comes,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.980
a VGA or you can add a second monitor.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.820
And these are actually extremely useful for people that have laptops,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.200
or computers. You can't really add another video or get multiple display support.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.600
These will allow you to  pretty much get your second monitor,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.740
increase your work flow, you know, you can get a full excel spreadsheet,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.670
over 2 pages or if you're doing photoshop, you can get your power over here,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.840
and your image over here. You can do a bunch of great stuff,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.640
when you have 2 monitors. Now before I go into this one precisely,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.850
let me bring you up to speed on the Tritton line.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.820
First of all they have the UV 100 which is their C2. That's their regular one.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.250
That one does 1600 x 1200. Then they have the UV 200,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500
which is their C2 Xtreme. That one is 1920 x 1200.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.530
So that's a very high resolution, external adapter. And this is the Xpress.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.740
This little device right here will do, 1360 x 768 and it's pretty much,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410
the smallest Resolution, the lowest Resolution of all of them.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.970
But, you know if you have a small monitor, and you don't really need the big Resolution,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.100
why pay more for the bigger adapter, when you can get this one for less money.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.850
This will do the, again, 1360 x 768, and will do all the popular numbers,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.150
like, what is it, 1024 x 768 or 1280 x 768,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.330
your 17", your 20",  your 19" monitors are a smaller resolution.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.300
It'll do all of those no problem. So very unique device,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.940
and very useful as well. And that's pretty much all,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.310
you can really about these things. They are self power 2.0.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.150
You literally plug them in. You will have a Driver Disc,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.100
that you will need to instal, and it will give you a little icon,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.310
in your bottom, right corner, where the clock is. And it'll tell you,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.660
whether you want to extend the desktop to it or mirror the desktop.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.260
You can do a lot of useful things, you can flip the monitor,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.220
if you want to be looking at  email one end, 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.610
and maybe your website's  on the other or,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.530
if you're blogging and you want to see the entire blog on one page.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.260
Well you can flip the whole thing 90 degrees, the monitor and work like that.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.340
You can set up a raise, because you can use multitudes of these,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.170
and say you want to have  4 monitors, you can use 4 of these,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.840
and have 4 top to bottom, right to left, anyway you want them.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.500
You can do, 2, 2, 2, and 2, or 2 and 4, it's really up to you.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.150
And they're extremely versatile just for that. So if you're the Bloomberg type,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.780
and you're day trading. You have a lot of stocks screens,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.920
you have a lot of different graphs up, those are excellent,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.790
excellent for you guys because again,  you don't spend a lot of money on a video card,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.860
or building a bigger work station, or computer and you pretty much,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.430
just get to add monitors, which is all you really need to do,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.790
and to display a graph, you don't need a Video Card,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.400
you need the most basic display that for you to do that.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.510
They do come with a Three-Year Warranty.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.270
And Tritton is known for making excellent products,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.100
and they've been making these for a while.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.110
They were one of the first to market to an external display adapter.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.510

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.740
