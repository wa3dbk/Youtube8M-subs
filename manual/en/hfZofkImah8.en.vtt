00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.940
Where should we meet

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.860
For the second episode of 'Steve Yoni TV'?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.400
The second episode!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.800
Come to our studio!

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.860
Just come to us!

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.800
See you soon!

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.560
Bye!

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.640
I can’t believe it’s already been 6 months

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.160
Since we promised to meet

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.720
For the second episode

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.800
Finally it’s spring!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.640
It was cold when we were filming last time…

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.000
Another collection is coming up

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.480
You must be really busy

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.280
We are usually busy around this time

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.320
But since we've spent some time preparing for it

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.580
We are looking forward to the new collection!

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.900
This isn't a shop of Steve J &amp; Yoni P!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.120
We called you to meet here

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.460
So that we could present our second label

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.240
SJYP!

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.720
Tada~

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.400
We're wearing angry Donald Duck t-shirts!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.760
One day, I realized that Donald Duck is wearing a blue shirt

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.000
And blue is also the motto of SJYP

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.660
So we thought that the Donald Duck is the character

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.640
That could go well with denim clothes

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.540
Since we are having a Donald Duck collection

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.500
The concept of the shop is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.420
With no doubt, Donald Duck!

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.360
Another interesting thing is that

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.400
We have these displayed Barbie dolls

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.100
Dressed in SJYP clothes

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.300
Can you see that we've worked really hard?

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.040
Are there any dolls that resemble you two?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.540
Well, we don't have the figures of Barbie dolls'…

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.840
We have a blue cube

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.680
We designed the interior like this

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.520
So that when you look at the shop from the outside

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.560
The first thing that you see is this blue box

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.020
On this side we have a ladder as well

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.080
If you go up there

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.300
It's just dust everywhere LOL

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.460
A while ago we met Cheon-hee Lee

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.160
At Hibrow

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.260
I like Cheon-hee so much!

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.300
He is so cool!

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.760
The icon of this era!

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.840
We have many Hibrow products

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.840
At our house

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.800
Did you two plan on this?

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.540
No!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.600
Isn’t our manager pretty?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.500
Hello!

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.040
Your hairstyle is very unique

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.260
To work in a place like this

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.980
I needed something special!

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.480
This is my favorite space

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.980
When you look at that from here

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.920
It feels different

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.780
I personally think

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.860
This is really attractive

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.760
The SJYP shop has

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.480
A structure where

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.460
You can look around

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.420
And find some new things

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.480
From various angles

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.400
As if you're in a maze

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.800
You must have been really busy

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.200
Managing the collection

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.620
Wouldn't you get even more tired

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.860
From preparing your for second label?

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.220
Ah! But it was really fun

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.300
Preparing for this

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.240
One of the favorite moments as a designer is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.160
Is when you try new things

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.380
Our character right now is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.500
Quite experimental

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.840
And gives you pleasant feelings

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.300
I just want to design happily

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.900
I wish we could just keep designing

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.660
Whatever we want to design without getting any pressure from others

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.960
We have a show on Monday

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.140
Do you think you can make it?

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.620
I think it would be nice if you come

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.240
Because on that day

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.640
You can see the whole process at once

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.920
Where are you going after today's interview?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.480
Us?

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.320
We’re so hungry…

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.260
I’m starving!

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.920
I think I am hungrier than usual

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.860
Because it hasn't been much time since I got back from Milano

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.300
Because I am jetlagged…

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.260
I think that’s just an excuse

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.420
Aren’t you always hungry?

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.200
That's you...
