00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.120
Hello and welcome to The Vegan Corner.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.620
Today’s recipe is our twist on a popular
Italian summer dish called Panzanella!

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.040
This salad-like preparation delivers bold
savoury flavours without compromise.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.150
That’s not mentioning that it’s healthy,
whole and gluten-free.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.550
What more could you ask from
low-fat vegan cuisine?

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.300
We really are pushing super
healthy cooking to the limit.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.230
The ingredient list is in the description
below the video.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.220
First of all, you want to cook the Quinoa
and cool it down to room temperature.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.320
To do this, you can watch our video
on how to cook Quinoa,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.750
linked in the description below and in the cards,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.140
or you can simply cook it according
to the instruction on the packet.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.800
Now, let’s do some heavy chopping.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.660
You don’t really need any ninja
skills here, but if you can,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.550
try to chop all the ingredients into
pea-sized pieces,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.800
just to increase the chance of biting
into every single ingredient

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.710
every time you take a spoonful.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.530
The next step is to remove the water
and seeds from the tomatoes.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.020
Reason being is that if you don't, the
Quinoa will soak up all the liquid,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.990
and your beautiful panazella will end up
the same consistency of baby food!

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.480
And that is something we
definitely want to avoid.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.080
The basil should be chopped
roughly or torn into pieces.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.580
The capers can be kept whole,
cut in half, or chopped,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.830
as it really depends on how big they are.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.850
Once the chopping is complete,
we are ready to rock and roll.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.710
Place all the chopped ingredients
into a large bowl

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.910
and stir them to properly combine them.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.580
Next, simply add in the Quinoa and
 stir it in to complete the dish.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.660
Salt is not really needed in this recipe,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.900
as the capers do a pretty good job
at adding saltiness to it.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.850
However, seeing as every brand makes
different capers,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.290
make sure to taste the salad before serving
it and to adjust the salt if needed.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.760
If you are not a massive fan of capers, you
can easily substitute them with olives.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.870
However, be warned that panzanella without
capers doesn’t taste like panzanella!

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.470
Now cover the bowl with some cling film

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.590
and place it in the fridge for a couple
of hours before consuming it.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.290
This will allow for the flavours
to properly blend.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.410
And here is the final panzanella.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.170
If you find the name too difficult to
pronounce or remember,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.450
just call it Italian summery Quinoa salad,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.280
and I promise I won’t be offended and it won’t
have any impact on the final flavour.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.070
I hope you’ve enjoyed watching today’s video
