00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:21.000
Top 9 “Must Haves” For 
Kids In Sports To Be Successful

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.600
As parents and coaches there are some simple,
but critical things you can do for your kids

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.610
in sports that will make a huge difference
in their happiness and success in playing

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.670
their sport.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.670
1.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.670
Encouragement

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.360
I put encouragement first, because this is
by far the most important need of any kids

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
in sports.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.210
You cannot over do encouragement.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.730
The problems start when parents and coaches
give praise only after good performances and

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.370
call that encouragement.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.970
All that does is give the child the idea that
your acceptance and approval is dependent

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.220
on a good performance.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.320
What parents need to do is simply express
their joy and excitement about watching their

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.040
athlete play their sport.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.640
For example, instead of saying, “Way to
hit that home run”, what would be more encouraging

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.940
would be to say something like, “I loved
the confidence I saw when you were hitting

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.270
the ball up there.”

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.020
Notice that you can say that last sentence
even if your kid struck out!

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.020
2.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.640
It’s NOT about the winning

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.030
First question to ask yourself is, “why
do you want your kid to play sports?”

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.659
Most parents and coaches agree it is for them
to have fun and build life skills.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.950
Your kids can accomplish these two things
whether they win or not and there is a case

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.400
to be made they learn more from losing.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.850
3.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.850
Good nutrition

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.049
Unfortunately, this is one of the most ignored
areas of youth sports.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.590
Your kids are out there moving their body
and sweating.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.560
It is extremely important to keep them hydrated
with water, not those florescent sports drinks.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.800
Also avoiding sugary snacks that spike their
blood sugar then bring them crashing down.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
4.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
Sleep well

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.620
It’s very easy for parents of kids playing
sports to ignore this, because there is “only

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.830
so many hours in a day” and they also have
homework, family chores, etc.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.171
They are so worried and stressed out about
keeping up their studies and giving their

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:39.770
all to their sport, they often have trouble
sleeping.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.569
They need wind down time at night and a regular
bedtime schedule.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.569
5.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.810
Acceptance among peers

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.360
This is a biggie.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.540
While you can’t make all of your kid’s
friends like him, you CAN check in to find

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.080
out how he is fitting in with his team or
group.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.970
Some coaches pit players against each other,
but studies show everyone does better when

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.690
there is team harmony.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.840
This is especially important when working
with girl’s teams.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.440
Bullying is also prevalent in youth sports
and there should be a no tolerance policy

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440
on your kids team.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.800
It is a big reason why kids quit sports.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.360
6.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.459
Respect their opinion

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.040
Just because you played or know something
about your kid’s sport, does not mean YOU

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.010
know the best way to help him become a better
player.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.620
You know you are on the wrong track with helping
your kid, when you think to yourself “Well,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.420
it worked for me.”

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.879
In my free ebook, “The 10 Commandments For
A Great Sports Parent,” I teach parents

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.750
a number of effective ways to giving advice.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:03.690
It starts with asking permission and respecting
“no.”

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.040
If you go past that, you are only hurting
your relationship and ultimately his confidence

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.240
and performance.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.349
7.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.930
To be taught and shown physical skills

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.430
There are approximately 3 million youth sports
coaches out there and less than 20% of coaches

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.590
have any training to be a coach.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.780
85% of all coaches are the parent of one of
the players.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.640
In other words, do not assume they are getting
good skill instruction.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.440
It’s up to you to make sure this is happening.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.260
Take a keen interest in what your child is
learning by asking them about their latest

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.260
skill.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.450
Really be present in these conversations and
ask open-ended questions to keep it going.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.970
When some kids get the personal instruction
and others don’t, it creates a formula for

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.060
destroying confidence.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.120
8.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.770
To have mental skills modeled and explained

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.130
My definition of mental toughness is when
you are focused, confident, determined, and

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.949
resilient...especially under pressure.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.780
We have an 8-step program in our Mental Toughness
Academy to help your child develop these mental

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.780
skills.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.960
It’s your job though to model them.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.930
For example, if you want your child to learn
sportsmanship, you’d better be a great sport

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.770
from the stands by clapping at appropriate
times for the other competitors and keeping

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.639
quiet when there are bad officials calls.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:45.190
If you want your kid to be calm under pressure,
show him how to do that at home.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.020
This is the most powerful way that kids learn
anything.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.479
9.

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.250
Advocate for them

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.610
Most youth sports programs are well run.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.479
Most coaches are well intentioned.

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.210
Unfortunately, sometimes things fall apart
and it is the parent’s job to step in or

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.520
pull the plug when the young athlete’s sports
participation is tilting to the negative.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.910
Always remember, when approaching the coach,
to present your concerns with the utmost respect

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.800
for another human being who is doing their
best.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.820
A fabulous technique that I’ve taught parents
in confronting a coach or director is to use

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.009
the “feedback sandwich.”

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:37.910
This means, you start out the conversation
with praise, followed by your concern, and

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.550
finishing up with more praise.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.169
Here’s how that could go:

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:48.300
“Hi Coach, I just want to tell you how much
I appreciate all your efforts and time you

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.800
put in for this team.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.710
I’m very grateful for all you do for these
kids.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.330
I wonder if I might ask you about Johnny’s
playing time and what you think he needs to

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.270
do in order to get more time on the field.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:08.419
And by the way, that last game where you pumped
the team to get that win was brilliant....(then

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.620
be quiet and let the coach speak.)
