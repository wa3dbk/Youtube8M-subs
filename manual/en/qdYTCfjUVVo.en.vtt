00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:09.420
An important skill

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.790
for all RC aircraft Flyers

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.850
to learn is how to maintain orientation
on your aircraft

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.130
just by its movement alone.  If it
hasn't happened to you already,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.689
there will come a time when you
either accidentally or on purpose

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.109
fly your aircraft too far away where you
really can't tell

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.460
which is the front and which is the back.
When this occurs

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.940
beginners may panic and may
accidentally fly the aircraft

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.350
out of range and may lose the aircraft.  So how
can you tell the difference

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.789
which is the front and which the back so that you can safely bring it back to you?

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.390
Well, it is very simple.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.590
 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.320
Imagine this being the
quadcopter

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.489
at a point where you really can't tell
its orientation any more

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.540
You've accidentally flown too far away. So how do you fly it back to you safely?

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.020
Very simple, just give it a little

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.689
forward pitch to get some forward
movement. In this case you'll notice

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.049
from a distance that the dot the sky which
is your quadcopter

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.049
will be moving to the left. All you have
to do

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.210
when it's moving to the left is turn it
left to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.729
start bringing it back toward you. Similarly

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.829
if the quadcopter is pointed to the right, and

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.140
you start to give it some forward
pitch, you should notice some right

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.579
movement off in the distance.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.310
So in this case all you have to do is
turn to the right

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.979
to start bringing it back toward you. So
again

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.659
If it is moving left turn left.  If it is moving
right, turn right.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.890
Very simple.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.530
Now I will do some demonstration flights to show this.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.920
 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.329
We are going to fly the quadcopter to a distance

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.979
Where I can just barely see it or think that I
can barely see it with the camera.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.470
We will demonstrate moving left and then
turn left, and then moving right

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.470
and turning right.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.550
I will be flying at a distance that I can see the quad, but the camera will
probably have a hard time seeing it.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.660
Right now I don't know what is the
orientation of the quadcopter.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.459
So how do I bring it back to me?

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.569
I notice some slight movement to the left.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.230
So all I need to do is turn left.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.160
I keep turning left until the movement
stops or starts moving

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.690
in the opposite direction.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.110
I'm still turning left, still turning left
until the movement stops.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.849
And here it comes back to me.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:00.550
Now it's moving right, so now I should turn right

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.980
to keep it coming toward me.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.980
So let's do that again. I will send it back off
into the distance.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.090
When I get there, I am going to give
some hard rudder to scramble

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.890
its orientation, so I don't know which direction it is pointing.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.640
I am turning it, turning it, turning it.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.310
Now I do not know
which way it is pointed.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.500
Now I give it some forward pitch and I notice some right movement.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.510
So all I need to do is turn right.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.080
I am turning right, turning right, and now
here it comes toward me.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.450
Let us do that again.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.580
This time I will send it upwind.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.580
I give it some forward pitch.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.220
It is moving left, so I am turning left,
turning left.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.660
And here it comes back to me.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.940
Practice this many times.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.950
Keep the quadcopter at a close distance when practicing.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.990
It is an important skill to learn.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.090
You will eventually be able to fly

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.090
greater distances than you normally
would.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.220
Let us send it out again. Scrambling it again.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.900
Give it some forward pitch,
it's moving to the right.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.970
So I am turning right, turning right.
Now it is starting to move left.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.390
So now I am turning left.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.390
And here it comes back to me.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.510
Let us do that again, and I will keep demonstrating.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.510
I'm turning it. Now I do not know which way it is pointed.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.640
I give it some forward pitch.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.870
It is moving to the right, so I turn right.
I keep turning right, and here it comes

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.690
back to me.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.690
I will demonstrate one more time with my V222 quadcopter.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.960
I do not know which way it is pointed.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.150
Forward pitch.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.410
It is moving right, so I turn right.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.430
And here it comes back to me.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.280
Hope this has helped you.  If so, I would appreciate a YouTube thumbs up.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.169
Good luck!
