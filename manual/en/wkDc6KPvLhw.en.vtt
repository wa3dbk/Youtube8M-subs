00:00:06.838 --> 00:00:10.128
Jekyll is a static site generator.

00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:17.168
This basically means that it extends the functionality
and efficiency of making static websites.

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:21.618
Static meaning that the site doesn’t interact
with databases and isn’t as user friendly

00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:24.918
to update, but it’s much faster because
of this.

00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:30.468
You write the content in different languages
including markdown, HTML, CSS and it can be

00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:33.378
extended to use preprocessors like SASS.

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:39.318
Once written, the static site is created and,
because these sites are simple files, you

00:00:39.318 --> 00:00:43.818
can host them on different web hosts, some
for free, such as GitHub Pages.

00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:48.568
There’s a link below this video on how to
host your Jekyll site on GitHub Pages.

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:53.368
This free program is definitely worth learning
to simplify development, even if it’s just

00:00:53.368 --> 00:00:55.348
for making prototypes.

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:59.808
If you use a Mac or linux based operating
system, you can install it easily if you have

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:03.118
Ruby and RubyGems on your system.

00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:08.007
Simply type in gem install jekyll to install
it.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.958
If you’re like me and have Windows, the
process is a bit different.

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:16.247
First, download and install RubyInstaller
with the link below.

00:01:16.247 --> 00:01:22.088
Now, download and install the corresponding
Development Kit found on the same page.

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:31.597
Open the command prompt by typing cmd.exe
in the start menu and type in ruby dk.rb init

00:01:31.597 --> 00:01:33.588
and press enter.

00:01:33.588 --> 00:01:38.888
Now run ruby dk.rb install and press enter.

00:01:38.888 --> 00:01:44.027
Finally, install Jekyll with gem install jekyll.

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:49.757
If you ran into a problem, read the description
and check the FAQ I linked to.

00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:53.857
Once installed, you can start a new site using
your terminal or command prompt.

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:59.208
First, navigate to where you want the site
folder to be by typing cd and dragging the

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:01.317
folder onto it and pressing enter.

00:02:01.317 --> 00:02:05.167
Now, create the site by typing ‘jekyll new
sitename’.

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:10.408
To view it in the browser, type ‘jekyll
serve -w,’ which tells the jekyll to create

00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:16.358
a local server so you can view it in the browser
and the flagged w tells it to watch for updates.

00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:21.328
Now, go to http://localhost:4000 in your browser.

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:26.458
Jekyll’s folder structure is a bit weird,
so let me try to explain it.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:30.798
Folders that begin with an underscore are
either part of Jekyll’s site-building process

00:02:30.798 --> 00:02:33.658
or ignored by Jekyll when it builds your site.

00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:39.098
The configuration file has data that tell
Jekyll how you want your site to be built.

00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:46.138
The includes folder has partial html or other
type that you can include in your actual pages,

00:02:46.138 --> 00:02:50.038
which lets you only have to change one file
instead of each.

00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:54.938
The layouts folder has template layouts that
will hold the content.

00:02:54.938 --> 00:02:59.738
Instead of repeating your code, you instead
only have one file that you write.

00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:04.448
Posts is where the blog posts are held and
include only the content of your site that

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:07.978
will be used in conjunction with the layout
files.

00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:12.808
The plugins folder holds extensions that make
Jekyll more powerful.

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:16.528
The site folder is what Jekyll makes when
it creates your site.

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:20.798
The contents in this folder is what will be
your finished product.

00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:25.588
The full description of the file structure
can be seen on Jekyll’s site linked below.

00:03:25.588 --> 00:03:28.618
There are plugins that you can include to
make Jekyll more powerful.

00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:35.278
One plugin that I use converts SASS files
into css and includes it automatically in

00:03:35.278 --> 00:03:38.198
the head file that’s included.

00:03:38.198 --> 00:03:40.698
Begin by making a file in the layouts folder.

00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:43.188
This should be like any normal HTML page.

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:48.918
There are many tags written in YAML that Jekyll
reads and interprets when making your site.

00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:52.258
You can use this tag to indicate the page
title.

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:54.468
This tag will render the content.

00:03:54.468 --> 00:04:00.748
To make the actual content, make an HTML file
in the root directory and use this format.

00:04:00.748 --> 00:04:06.948
To add a layout to a page, simply write layout,
colon(:), then what you called the HTML file

00:04:06.948 --> 00:04:08.608
in the layout folder.

00:04:08.608 --> 00:04:12.488
You can also add more information such as
the title of the page.

00:04:12.488 --> 00:04:17.538
Everything under this top part will be considered
content in the page.

00:04:17.538 --> 00:04:22.088
Jekyll is a powerful tool for making simple
sites that don’t get updated often, sites

00:04:22.088 --> 00:04:26.737
that you update since you know how Jekyll
works, or prototype sites.

00:04:26.737 --> 00:04:31.178
If you want to learn more about Jekyll, the
full documentation is linked to underneath

00:04:31.178 --> 00:04:32.357
this video.

00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:33.077
Thanks for watching.
