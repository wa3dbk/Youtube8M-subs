RYAN LARSON: So now we're going to take a
physical look at the actual scale on how it's

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.340
written out in tab and how we read is--this
is our top string going down to our lower

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.000
string, right? Here is our A string right
here, and I wrote down the actual frets that

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.920
we play from the scale, so you have--our B
flat is right here on the 3rd string, 1st

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.960
fret right? So I put a square around it, and
then we have it again on our 3rd fret on our

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.440
top string, so we have 1-3, open-1-3, open-2-3,
right? And then if we play that 1-3, open-1-3,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.579
open-2-3 right, so you can play along at home.
So this is the great chart for you to write

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.959
down and you can this tab on the internet
and we'll be written out the exact same way,

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:51.569
its first position, your B flat major scale
and again we learned the numbers so these

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:58.789
numbers I put on the top are the actual degrees
of the scale 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1. And now, if

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:05.369
we look at the actual pitch names, that starts
on B flat and we go up the alphabet, so B

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.340
flat has three flats and you will see that
but once you're in B flat, the chords that

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.380
I have given to you already have the flats
there so you have B flat, C, D, E flat, F,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.859
G, A, B flat, so 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. So now if
we go through the frets, we have B flat on

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:30.670
the 1st fret, C on the 3rd, D on the open,
E flat on the 1st fret, F on the 3rd, G on

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.420
the open fret on the top string, A on the
2nd fret, and B flat again on the 3rd fret.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.060
So now when you go through and you see a B
flat major chord, and if you're on a key of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.829
B flat, you will see E flat 7th chords or
major chords, you will see D minor chords,

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:52.429
C minor chords, you'll see F7 chords, you'll
see G minor chords, and A half-diminished

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.299
chords. So all these notes that are in the
scale you will utilize and you will be able

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.060
to see them and then you find out what number
in the scale it is by counting on B, so if

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.539
it's an E flat, I can go B, C, D, E flat right
there, so there is my E flat right, B, C,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.870
D, E flat. So if I have the A chord, I can
go B, C, D, E, F, G, A, so there is my A right

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:28.700
there. Like got the A right here too right,
1-7 right? B flat, A right below it, so go

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.670
through and really write that scale down and
just start getting it memorized under your

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.090
fingers as we go through and start our reading
adventures in the key of B flat.
