00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.590
Hey there gold nakers!

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:07.740
This is Reckles with WTBGold, and today we're
talking about one of the biggest gold making

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.420
changes to come to Warlods of Draenor news.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.690
It actually came out a couple weeks ago so
I've been waiting to tell you guys just to

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.010
make sure it was actually a thing annnnnd
it's a thing.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.090
It's happening.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.020
It's live on the Beta, and it's pretty exciting.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:35.550
So, the first part is that the Neutral Auction
Houses are going to be completely removed

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.780
from the game and that's because they are
completely worthless now that THE ALLIANCE

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.270
AND THE HORDE ARE GOING TO BE MERGED TOGETHER!

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.360
That's right guys, you're going to be selling
to your enemy.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.930
But, that by itself, I'll let you freak out
for a little bit.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.730
I completely lost my cool when I first heard.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:13.909
I mean, there's so many implications of what
this means that it's kindof mind-boggling

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.090
when you first hear about it, right?

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.880
What are prices going to do?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.979
What's the amount of goods going to do?

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.749
What's going to happen on each individual
server?

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.880
What if you have more horde?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.119
What if you have more Alliance?

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.969
What's going to happen OHMYGOD!

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.350
But, let's break it down, let's talk about
it, and figure out if it's a good thing, if

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.659
it's a bad thing, why Blizzard is doing this
and make sense of everything.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.681
I'm here, I got your back, everything is going
to be OK, and in the end, I think it's going

00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:48.869
to be a good thing.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.469
So, the first thing you gotta realize is that
this is essentially a large-scale server merge

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:57.539
for everyone.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.679
Everyone is just going to be pretty much just
doubling their Auction House size.

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.170
So, raise your hand if you've been through
a server merge before.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.490
Wasn't that bad, was it?

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.860
I mean, you freaked out at the beginning.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.410
You thought your Auction House was gonna crash
or whatever, but everything kindof stabalized,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.860
and maybe one market tanked but everything
was kindof ok.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.769
Everyone is still making money, right?

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.040
That's what this is going to be like.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.560
The reason people still make money when Auction
Houses grow has to do with some neat economic

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.769
theories having to do with imperfect and perfect
competition, market elasticity, and the fact

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:53.000
that prices in WoW decrease according to the
inverse log of the market size, the server

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.750
population.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:03.890
So the last part is what I'll focus on and
that's pretty much just saying that if the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.069
Auction House size, if the server size doubles,
the price of the goods won't fall in half.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.650
So, let's say you're selling gems for 200
gold each.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.249
And you're selling 10 of them a day.

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.569
Then you're making 2,000 gold.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:24.129
If your server doubles, then you'll be selling
20 gems a day but you won't be selling them

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:25.329
for 100 gold.

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:33.300
You'll be selling them for 125 gold or 150
gold, and so you'll really be making 3,000

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.040
gold from those gems because you'll be selling
twice as many for a little bit more.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.450
So, in the end, you'll actually be making
more money.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.389
The only problem with this is that we're talking
about revenue increase and not profit increase,

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:56.390
so on Servers that have 20% Alliance and 80%
Horde, the Alliance is going to see a huge

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.620
decrease in the price of their goods, and
so people like blacksmiths or Jewelcrafters,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.519
the crafters, they aren't going to be able
to turn a profit on their goods.

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.030
But generally those servers have already been
merged with other, other servers that balance

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.560
that out, so they should be good.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.890
Most of that's already been taken care of
by now.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.100
And if they haven't they will be by the time
of release.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.720
And the last thing I want to talk about is
competition for the gatherers out there because

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.789
y'all know I love me some mining.

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.180
I don't think these markets are going to be
hugely affected.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.419
Generally, because there's enough of the same
goods being posted.

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.949
It's just the same ore over and over being
posted, and there are enough farmers going

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.780
out and posting already.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.630
Like, in the crafted markets, you generally
only have a few posting regularly.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:08.020
But for ore and herbs, everyone's posting
all the time and there's a lot of people farming

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.100
ore and herbs regularly.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.940
So, when we merge factions and start selling
Ghost Iron Ore, and True Iron Ore, and Blackrock

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.270
Ore, it shouldn't make that big of a difference
when the amount of people posting on the servers

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:30.350
goes from 20 on the Alliance to 40 on the
Alliance and the Horde.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.759
We'll see a small decrease, but generally
the amount of buyers are gonna double and

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.650
the amount of sellers are gonna double, but
it's going to even out.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.380
Because it's already hit pretty close to that
bottom, that equilibrium point where the sellers

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.310
say "hey, I don't want to go any lower than
1 gold per ore, ok?"

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.620
So if you're worried about ore selling for
10 silver each or something like this come

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.650
Warlords of Draenor, don't worry about that.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.600
Remember we gotta gather this stuff on ground
mounts, it's gonna take a lot of work, and

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.770
people aren't going to stand for that.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.880
So, that's all I got, thanks for listening,
and if this was helpful, or you have any guildies

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.979
who are worried about this, please subscribe,
share this on Facebook, Twitter, or send it

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:17.979
out on Reddit.

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.300
I really appreciate that.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.909
And that really helps my channel out.

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:27.920
Have a great day guys, and remember that the
key to making gold, in the end, is just to

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.920
Search.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920
Craft.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920
Post.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.920
Every Day.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.921
Bye.
