00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.280
In this twisted dimension there is a sharpening whirlpool of light

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.400
With the power of a hidden watch, it becomes an invisible wind

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.140
The marking clock-ticks match together with my loneliness

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:55.560
But you took my hand, and guided me on without a word

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.400
Zig-zag controlling the motions of my swaying body

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.720
Leading astray the cut-off dimensions

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.540
Zig-zag wrapping around it a thick wall

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.120
Gaps in time continue to open – It’s a fantasy

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.460
Now a peaceful moment filled with a sweet perfume

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.420
The teacup I’ve polished reflects in it my eyes

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:56.280
Sleepless night after sleepless night I wait for you

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.700
I imagine the death of my body, and it fills me with an unpleasant feeling

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.540
Zig-zag My reverberating body is swallowed

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.780
The tell-tale beat reminds me the end is coming

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.840
Ziwa-ziwa The broken spell leaps forward

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.740
Bursting open the secret gate, the moonlit night shines

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.840
No one knows the real truth about me

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.580
No, not even you know the past that I can’t take back

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.580
Tick-tack I’m losing sight of my body lit by fire

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.560
I hear again and again a dangerous sign

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.760
Tick-tack My reverberating body is swallowed

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.820
The tell-tale beat reminds me the end is coming

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.840
Scattered into countless pieces left by my knife

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.860
My memories no one knew are swept away

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.900
This power so detested… To you

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.920
I’ve decided to give my everything – On this flowering night of the 16th moon.
