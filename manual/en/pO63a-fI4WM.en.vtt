Hey everyone I’m Justin with AmericanMuscle.com
checking out a great starter mod with the

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.650
versatility to expand with your horsepower
needs and your budget, I’m talking about

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.299
the C&amp;L cold air intake kit for all 2011 and
up mustang GTs.

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.599
That versatility comes from C&amp;Ls unique design
that includes this metal insert allowing you

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.710
to run this kit with or without a tune.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.180
So if you are just starting out and don’t
have the money to fork out for a tune right

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.600
away, but plan on getting one down the road
this intake is for you.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.000
Whether or not you decide to run a tune this
intake will definitely give you a nice bump

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.039
in power and sound by replacing your air box
with everything you see here.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.300
Including a plastic heat shield, intake tube
itself, usable high air flow filter and that

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.300
special metal insert.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.800
Now whenever you run a cold air intake kit
more power is the obvious expectation, however

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.880
you tend to receive more throttle response
and fuel efficiency as well as my favorite

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.210
part: that nice little growl to your engine.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.379
As we mentioned earlier you do not need to
run a tune with this intake from C&amp;L but if

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.370
you do want to see maximum gains then you
do want to pair it up with our custom BAMA

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.370
tune and remove that insert.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.240
So were going to get a baseline down from
our 2011 first and see what kind of improvement

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.650
this kit makes.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.970
So in stock form our automatic 2011 GT just
put down 345 horsepower and 303 ft/lbs of

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.570
torque at the rear wheels.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.260
Now let’s get that restrictive factory air
box out of there and install this new intake

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.420
from C&amp;L which should only take about an hour
with standard hand tools.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.800
As I mentioned earlier we are going to pair
the C&amp;L intake up with our 93 octane BAMA

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.820
tune to really optimize our gains.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.310
This is going to optimize your spark timing,
adjust your variable cam timing; perfect those

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.540
air fuel ratios and give you drastically improved
throttle response.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.750
With the automatic guys it’s really going
to improve shift firmness and shift points.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.350
Now with our kit installed and our tune up
loaded let’s turn the rollers one more time

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.350
and see what kind of power this kit made on
our GT.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.980
Well we 
just finished up our second run with our C&amp;L

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:11.390
intake and BAMA tune installation where we
made 365 horsepower and 338 lb/ft torque,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.170
making for a peak gain of 23 horsepower over
our baseline numbers and gains a 57 horsepower

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.990
and 57 ft/lb of torque at the curve.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.280
So even though we ran this intake with the
tune to get some really big gains, you do

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.460
have the luxury of bolting this kit up and
running it without a tune and making considerable

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.900
more power over your factory air box.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.440
So even if you don’t have a tune yet but
plan on getting on in the future this kit

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.010
from C&amp;L has you covered.
