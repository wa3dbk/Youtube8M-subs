00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.250
To aquascape a saltwater aquarium this is
very, very critical.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.959
This is what you're going to be staring at
every time you look at your aquarium.

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.940
So you want to put a lot of thought into it.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.550
First you need to look at the materials.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:21.270
I like dry reef rock like Marco Rock or Real
Reef alternatives to buying live, living reef

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.270
rock.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.810
For one reason, living reef rock, you never
know what you're going to get on it.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.210
You're going to get a lot of dead organisms.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.270
You're also going to get pests and hitchhikers.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.609
And it's not sustainable.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.410
You're taking a living reef and they're dynamiting
it and destroying it to serve as the materials

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.870
that we use in an aquarium.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.610
So if we really want to be environmentally
conscious about what we're doing we should

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.170
try to promote companies like Real Reef or
Marco who are good, realistic alternatives

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.270
to living, real reef rock.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.840
That being said, when you decorate your aquarium
the techniques that you want to use are those

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.800
that complement the shape and design of the
aquarium and the relation of the aquarium

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
to the room.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.390
If it's a peninsula aquarium, you want to
stack the decorations high on the side that's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.189
touching the wall and then bring them down
slowly, to the point where it's a nice open

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.149
area for the fish to congregate in the part
of the tank that's open.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.749
So remember, just like with a lot of things
nowadays, less is more.

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:25.670
A nice open look for the fish to congregate
in the middle I think is better than having

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.609
a lot of rocks where the fish can hide.

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.549
When we first got into this industry it seems
everybody would decorate their tanks by sloping

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.249
the rocks at a steep angle from the front
bottom of the tank to the back top of the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.249
tank.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:40.299
I'm not talking about the sand bed.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.209
It's okay to make the sand bed stacked like
that, but the rocks themselves it just looks

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.329
so purposeful and everything looks the same
when you stack the rocks like that.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.509
So you want to have a lot of nooks and crannies
and caves.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:53.739
You want the fish to feel secure.

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.490
But you also want to create as much open space
as possible.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.969
And the reason for this is to allow the water
to move freely through the tank and keep a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.419
lot of the waste in suspension so the filter
can get at it.

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:08.340
If you have too much decorations in there,
it's going to really impede the water flow

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.000
and have you relying on more pumps, more equipment,
more electricity to move that water around

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.689
and it doesn't really serve much of a purpose.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.849
You don't want to put a lot of rocks in there.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.680
There's such a thing called the golden ratio
where you have like a 4/3 proportion where

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.709
the rocks are stacked higher on one side than
they are on the other side and that ratio

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.420
works well for a lot of people.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.150
You can actually Google that.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.980
And then the sand or the gravel substrate,
I like a nice fine sand but if it's too fine

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.660
it's going to get blown around by the current.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.989
So you want a sand that's got a granular size
large enough where it doesn't blow around

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.170
but not too big where it looks like rocks
in a saltwater aquarium.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.790
The days of using crushed coral, I think,
are gone.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.440
It just doesn't look as good as a nice clean
sand bottom.
