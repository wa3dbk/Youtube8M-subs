00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.260
Nokia 808 PureView.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.260
Expected soon.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.180
The camera phone megapixel wars are over,
and Nokia won.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.340
How?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.810
The Nokia 808 PureView is how - a Symbian
Belle smartphone (although these days it is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.349
called Nokia Belle) with an astounding 41
megapixel camera sensor on the back.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.810
Yes, 41 megapixels..

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.240
Obviously, the camera is the main thing with
the 808 PureView but before we get too involved

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.930
in that, it might be worth having a look at
the rest of the handset.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.710
Unlike many of Nokia's other recent offerings,
this is based on the tried-and-tested Symbian

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.780
OS, now called Nokia Belle.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:56.420
There is a 4" 360 x 640 pixel curved AMOLED
touchscreen panel, 3.5G and WiFi support,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.460
GPS, an FM transmitter, Bluetooth, an HDMI
output port and NFC support.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.610
There is 16GB of internal flash memory plus
a microSD slot, and there are a wide range

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.720
of built in applications plus many more you
can download.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.229
It also makes phone calls.

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.950
Now to the camera - the 41 megapixel sensor
is enhanced with Carl Zeiss optics, but there's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.420
more to it than just megapixels.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.189
You might be surprised to find that the default
picture size for the Nokia 808 PureView is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.549
just five megapixels.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.340
This is where Nokia's new PureView technology
comes into play - the phone uses all those

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.200
extra pixels for oversampling, and combines
them all into a very sharp and clean image.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.299
It also means that the 808 can effectively
emulate a lossless 3X optical zoom because

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.579
it simply has so many pixels on the sensor.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.700
Alternatively, you can change resolutions
and use up to 38 megapixels at a time for

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.939
stills photos, and you can them manipulate
them yourself, for example on a PC.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.340
The camera also comes with a Xenon flash plus
an LED light for video recording, autofocus

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.100
and touch-to-focus, and the video capture
capabilities go up to 1080p video at 30fps

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.910
with an emulated 4X lossless optical zoom.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.190
In addition, the 808 PureView has features
such as face detection, a video editor and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.190
scene selection.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.250
Usefully, there is an optional tripod mount
available for the 808 as well.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.670
You might notice that the camera sticks out
a bit - the 808 PureView is 4mm thicker at

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.620
the camera end, coming in at a chunky 18mm
thick.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.220
It's also a little heavy at 169 grams, but
then it's a lot less bulky then a dedicated

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.520
digital camera.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.850
There is a rumour that the Nokia 808 PureView
might be one of the last Symbian.. sorry,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.240
Nokia Belle devices to market.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.350
If that is the case, then it is an impressive
way to bow out.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.510
It certainly shows that Symbian can do things
that Windows Phone cannot, and perhaps it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.030
challenges Nokia's Windows-only strategy for
future smartphones.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.020
At the moment, Nokia don't given any indication
as to cost or availability for the 808 PureView,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.520
and given the unusual design and very high
end camera we would not like to take a guess

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.920
either.
