00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:10.679
*Transcripts of G2012-129_Earth_At_Night*

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.679
[00:00:03.99]

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.679
[00:00:04.00]

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.679
[ music ]

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.679
[00:00:09.28]

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:15.679
In daylight, our big blue marble is all land,
oceans and clouds.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:16.679
[00:00:15.47]

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:17.679
[00:00:16.15 ]

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:18.679
But the night is electric.

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:19.679
[00:00:18.90]

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:20.679
[00:00:19.32]

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.910
Seen from space, our planet comes alive with
light.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.910
[00:00:24.00]

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.910
[00:00:25.00]

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.500
This new view of the Earth's night lights
is a composite of data

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.760
acquired by the polar orbiting Suomi NPP satellite.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.760
[00:00:34.00]

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.760
[00:00:35.00]

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.980
Aboard the satellite, a newly designed instrument
called VIIRS is able

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.040
to collect what scientists say is a remarkably
detailed view of the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.160
Earth at night.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
[00:00:46.00]

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
[00:00:47.81]

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.170
In some places, city lights resemble solitary
stars in the night sky.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.170
[00:00:53.00]

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.170
[00:00:54.10]

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.809
In other places, dense clusters of galaxies.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.809
[00:00:58.00]

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:59.809
[00:00:59.54]

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.640
The satellite can even distinguish brightly
lit boats that line Egypt's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.680
Nile River.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680
[00:01:05.36]

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.680
[00:01:06.36]

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.390
And the massive flames from gas flares produced
as a byproduct of oil

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.630
and gas exploration in the Middle East.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.680
[00:01:14.32]

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.740
[00:01:16.33]

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.830
As the satellite passes over the darkness
of the Himalayas, it shows how

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.770
human settlement is bound by natural borders.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.799
[00:01:25.00]

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:27.820
[00:01:27.26]

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.080
Even political borders are starkly visible
in this view of North and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.380
South Korea.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.380
[00:01:33.30]

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.380
[00:01:34.30]

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.080
And in a line of fishing boats that dot the
Yellow Sea.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.080
[00:01:38.00]

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.080
[00:01:40.00]

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.810
But not all light is electric.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.680
Glowing just as bright, flaming wildfires
burn across Australia.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.780
[00:01:48.00]

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.890
[00:01:49.40]

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.180
This new view of the Earth at night offers
a unique perspective for

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.500
exploring the many places in which we live,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.500
[00:01:57.94]

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.070
and seeing the impact of human populations
around the world, no matter

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.100
how faint or how bright their lights shine.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.340
[00:02:06.40]
