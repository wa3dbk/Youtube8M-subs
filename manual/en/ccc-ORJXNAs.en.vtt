00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:12.543
Should I learn Dvorak keyboarding?

00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:14.253
That's pretty esoteric.

00:00:14.253 --> 00:00:17.323
I've heard it is a very efficient way to type.

00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:18.833
It's faster.

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:21.233
It is faster once you learn it.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:25.943
It is a steep learning curve for everyone
who is trained on the standard QWERTY keyboard.

00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:30.263
The QWERTY keyboard was designed to take a
long time to type because the keys on manual

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:32.633
typewriters kept sticking.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.303
We don't have those constraints anymore.

00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:38.473
You still have the constraint on keyboard
supply.

00:00:38.473 --> 00:00:42.813
Imagine learning DVORAK typing and then having
to wait for the special keyboard before you

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:44.063
can start typing.

00:00:44.063 --> 00:00:49.313
The Dvorak layout supposedly uses less finger
motion, reducing the risk of carpal tunnel

00:00:49.313 --> 00:00:50.733
syndrome.

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.633
That's irrelevant if you actually get more
key strokes in per minute.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.723
It reduces you error rate.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:01.123
If you learn Dvorak, your error rate on QWERTY
boards will be higher when they don't have

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:03.653
the esoteric board laying around.

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:07.132
You can use the keyboards on almost any computer.

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:10.053
All computers use QWERTY keyboards.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:15.043
Most operating systems let you switch to it,
but iOS doesn't have it on their touchscreen

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:16.043
systems.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:20.162
Dvorak is more accessible to those with just
one hand.

00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:24.492
While we joke about doing things with one
hand behind our backs, typing shouldn't be

00:01:24.492 --> 00:01:25.692
one of them.

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:28.722
Well, maybe on a cell phone.

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.963
Why didn't Dvorak take off?

00:01:30.963 --> 00:01:36.013
It is too costly to retrain everyone on something
theoretically more efficient.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:40.783
Hardware costs are less of a concern, but
the software compatibility problems aren't

00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:42.263
going away.

00:01:42.263 --> 00:01:45.632
We do Six Sigma projects all the time to improve
efficiency.

00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:50.952
But you can go back to what you were doing
if that process improvement project fails,

00:01:50.952 --> 00:01:53.783
which around two thirds do in some regard.

00:01:53.783 --> 00:01:58.202
Putting manufacturing equipment back is less
disruptive than saying you wasted all your

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:00.512
time learning to type another way.

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:02.882
Yeah, you're right.

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:07.182
Learning to type faster on my cell phone is
a more useful skill and won't go away until

00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:11.193
they have good voice recognition software
for smartphones.

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.092
That will never fly.

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:18.113
All you need to do is hook it up to the average
guy for a few hours and get professional documents

00:02:18.113 --> 00:02:24.893
that are a weird hash of technical jargon
and ChatRoulette.
