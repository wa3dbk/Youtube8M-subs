00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.510
You watched us design and build this house
in 150 days, but the work is far from over.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.950
We're about to jump into my favorite part
of the process of bringing all this together.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.740
Join me for an exclusive look right here on
eHow Home.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.080
I just found this rug over there in the corner
here at the fabric store.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.382
And what I see is this rug or something similar
to it in the entry hall of the house.

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:40.920
I'm prone to bring all kinds of things into
fabric store like this old chair that I found,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.920
an upholstered chair.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.589
I know it doesn't look like much, but it's
in good shape -- the springs are great.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.559
You know, it needs new fabric.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.280
But I'm not even gonna reupholster this chair.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.949
It's a Sheridan type wingback chair, and I
think it's gonna be perfect in the entry hall.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.510
We got white boards, and then below for the
wainscot, we did those big white blocks of

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.510
wood.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.040
So this will be up against that.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.080
So I've gone around and I've picked out some
fabrics that I think would really work well

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.690
as a slipcover for this chair.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.190
And I wanna use a linen.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.550
I'm not thinking I'm gonna go with this gold
linen -- I think want something really neutral.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.210
And this one feels really good to me.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.790
It's about $23 a yard.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.300
Or this one.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.700
I think these are the two here.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.680
And so we cover it with this linen with a
piping on it.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.480
You can see the piping here all around the
edge.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.500
So the linen would have a light colored piping
on it.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.730
And then in the center, I could do some sort
of monogram like you see here with this headboard,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.190
and that could be in the same color as the
piping, which would look pretty good.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.490
Picking out a color that would work with whatever
rug I use.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.720
But I definitely wanna use an old farm cotton
rug like this.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.140
I think they're classic and they look really
great and gonna work beautifully in our farmhouse

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.790
chic setting.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.060
Well, here's the chair.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.060
What do you think?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.980
It took a little while to get it all pulled
together, but I think Pat did a fabulous job.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.290
You know, it doesn't fit too snuggly, too
tightly, on the chair, which I like.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.440
I like a sort of loose, casual fit.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.350
And I think the embroidery turned out really
well.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.940
I love the way the white piping or the white
cording here really makes it pop.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.200
It's neutral.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.010
It's gonna fit in just about anywhere in the
house.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.390
We have a special place for it.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.000
I can't wait for you to see it ensconced in
its new setting.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.090
