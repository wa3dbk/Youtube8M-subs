Hello and welcome back to the world of Scafflogic.
In this training video I would like to show

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.560
you how to make a mansard roof with or without
a gable.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.460
As you can see I have already made two building
objects 800 X 1400 cm. which will serve as

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.559
the ground foundation for our new mansard
roof. On the left building we will create

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.920
a gable, but on the right one we won’t.
So, let’s get right to it.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.699
Let’s begin by creating a gable on the first
building and going into edit gable to make

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:59.600
modifications. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.420
On the current screen we have some parameters
we can change, but I need more advanced options

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.920
which I can access by clicking on the advanced
options category. Now I am able to edit the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.720
parameters I need. I will change the length
settings to 90 cm. which is the distance between

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.360
this point and this point, creating the steeper
angle that I need. We can also bring the gable

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:40.440
down slightly. 
And now we have our gable structure. We will

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.530
click okay and copy the gable to the other
side, like so, and confirm.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.200
Now it is time to add the roof and see if
it turns out the way we want it to. You can

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.909
see that the system has made all the required
angle calculations so we should get a nice

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.049
mansard roof. Let’s go to 3D to have a look.
And here you can see we have installed the

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.509
first mansard roof successfully.
Let’s do the same thing with the other building,

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.907
but this time without gables, Doing it this
way will allow us to make a more sophisticated

00:02:11.907 --> 00:02:17.430
roof. We will right click on it, go to the
roof operator, and add the roof. Then we will

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.400
go to properties and tell the system that
we want a steep angle all the way around,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.600
apply to 75 degrees, and click okay. When
I add the roof now, the system will aid us

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.370
in placing it.&nbsp; When we look at it in 3d
view we see that the roof has been created,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.530
but it seems a little bit too high, so let’s
go back in to the roof operator and select

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.720
cut roof and adjust the roof to a specific
height of 6 meters. We will click apply and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.319
then okay. Now we have a line which indicates
that the cut will be made to our specifications,

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.810
but we also need to change the angles as well
because right now the system still thinks

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.170
we want 75 degree angles all the way through
the system. Let’s just adjust this to 18

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.239
degrees, click okay, hit enter, and now you
can see how our roof structure has changed.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.019
And here we have another completed mansard
roof.
