00:00:06.477 --> 00:00:07.321
- hello everybody

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:09.555
we're at Benaroya Hall at the play-off

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:11.180
of the International 2013

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.134
we're going to get into the room where Na'Vi will have some rest

00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:17.656
while other teams will be playing

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.445
I'm sure there are some people

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:21.340
I guess it's Dendi's relatives

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.790
let's talk to them

00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:29.999
as we can see LGD.Int is here

00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:36.282
Silent from Quantic Gaming

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:37.373
- Hello

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:39.407
- Oleg "prb"

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.023
how can we get to Na'Vi?

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.976
- these people are from Na'Vi

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:49.821
can you see them?

00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:52.447
- how can we get to their parents?

00:00:52.447 --> 00:00:54.884
- you have to go to another row

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.508
- how did you get here?

00:01:00.257 --> 00:01:02.320
he's so angry too!

00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:05.712
we got here 'cause everything is possible when we do it!

00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:07.804
let's go! turn it

00:01:19.853 --> 00:01:21.883
the cam is too close to me

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:28.530
we're coming into the last door

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.632
oh, here we can see Na'Vi and Virtus.pro

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.836
now we'll come to their parents

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.457
by the way, here's Lex and NS

00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:38.101
how are you doing, guys?

00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:39.474
- everything is fine

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.347
- yeah, everything is ok

00:01:41.578 --> 00:01:44.321
- great! let's go!

00:01:44.782 --> 00:01:57.424
here we can see the fan-base of Daniil Dendi Ishutin

00:01:57.424 --> 00:02:02.674
they are his mother, sister and her husband

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:04.721
hello! can we talk for a while?

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:06.237
- sure you can

00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:09.394
- tell us please how did you get here and

00:02:09.394 --> 00:02:10.736
why are you here?

00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:15.610
- we came to support our favorite team and my brother as well

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.862
- I heard you participated in the documentary which will be presented in a few days here

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:26.172
are you looking forward your debut on the wide screen?

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.392
- yes, sure, this is also very interesting

00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:31.111
we'll be very glad to see the result

00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:35.314
- how do you think, which place will take Na'Vi at this tournament?

00:02:35.765 --> 00:02:39.942
- I don't want to make any forecasts

00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:43.734
of course we're supporting them and with them only the victory

00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:48.139
- do you communicate with other players except Dendi?

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.485
or have you made a friendship with anybody at this tournament?

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:53.421
- we haven't managed yet

00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:57.764
we communicate with the Russian speaking players of different teams

00:02:57.983 --> 00:03:00.455
who we already know

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:02.014
with the speakers as well

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:04.704
we haven't got acquainted to all of them yet

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:05.797
- thank you so much!

00:03:05.797 --> 00:03:06.882
I hope you'll have a great time

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:08.189
good luck!

00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:11.486
the end!
