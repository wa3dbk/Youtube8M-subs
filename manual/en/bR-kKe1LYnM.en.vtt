00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.980
florida lawmakers recently voted to ban
florida's one thousand internet cafes

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.089
actually it's a little bit more than a
thousand

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.029
they did this because charity that was
tied to lieutenant governor jennifer

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.630
carroll was shut down on suspicion of
being an internet gambling front

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.880
now that was their stated reason

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.490
as to whether or not that's the entire
picture i'm not sure

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.949
uh... my suspicion is that since a lot
of the politicians in florida get money

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.290
from the casino lobby they're trying to
get rid of the competition to the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.190
casinos and a lot of these

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.200
internet cafes were

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.330
they did a lot of gambling here

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.880
uh... alright fair enough it seems to be
a cut-and-dried log was only one problem

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.000
the bill was so poorly worded

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.150
that they accidentally band

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.160
all computers and smartphones in the
state

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.440
wow

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.230
quote the ban defines illegal slot
machines as any system or network of

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.360
devices there may be used in a game of
chance

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.080
won a tremendous mistake how do you not
realize that the laptop at the ripe and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.230
at the desk top

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.110
fitted android and iphone

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.799
and by the way i am i saying actually i
come knock on your door like imagine

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.860
they go to the wind waves out there like
a calling for a ride only have one and

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.320
they're now i mean obviously they're not
gonna do that right

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.280
but international issue

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610
okay the number one problem we have in
politics is of course corruption we've

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.090
covered in a million times ninety three
percent of the time the politician that

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.300
raises the most money

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.580
win the election

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.910
so when they get into office they
legislate in favor arm

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.250
the people who funded their election
ride their campaign so it's the rich

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.550
it's big businesses and they always grew
over the people that's the number one

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.150
problem in politics

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.710
i'll close number two problem

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.219
incompetence and idiocy

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.690
as evidenced by this story

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.950
florida deciding

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.830
then computers or
