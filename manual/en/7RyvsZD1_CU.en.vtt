00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.470
Hi Everyone,

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.080
I have a quick update on the rocket mass heater
since the stainless steel heat riser finally

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.649
rotted out.

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.130
Once again, taking a look at the barrel, there
is still some flaking on the top and also

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.580
along the sides.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.670
My guess is that this is from the extremely
high humidity in the greenhouse along with

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.650
cycling the heater on just once a day and
then letting it completely cool which is condensing

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.580
a little moisture on it.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.529
Looking down inside the barrel, there was
a little ash at the bottom which was expected

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.699
considering it has run the entire season without
being cleaned.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.540
What I found to be a bit surprising were the
pieces of stainless steel that were also in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.640
the ash which had blown up and out of the
heat riser.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.080
Looking down into the heat riser, or what
someone likes to call a "well", the insulation

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:58.600
has settled a little bit, but the stainless
steel pipe has collapsed down nearly a foot.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.990
The outer shell of the heat riser, which is
10" galvanized stove pipe, is in excellent

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.110
condition.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.760
These sections can be used for other experiment.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.650
The rock wool insulation was in fairly good
condition along the top, but had hardened

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.610
up a little so I disposed of it.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.700
It was interesting to see what happened to
the rock wool.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.690
The first inch that was on the inner part
against the heat had discolored and hardened,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.060
while the outer inch was still soft and looked
new.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.310
There was a very distinctive line between
the differences.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.370
I got about 1000 hours of burn out of this
heat riser so it did surprisingly well considering

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.770
the abuse I put it through.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.380
Once I pulled the stainless steel pipe out,
it became very apparent that there was nothing

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.860
left to it, and once again, the rock wool
which was exposed directly to the fire had

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.860
melted.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.470
Laying out the remains of the stainless steel
pipe showing the original 5' of length, this

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:18.560
is what was left of it.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.540
Now that the old heat riser has been removed
and the base has been cleaned up, it's time

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.640
for a new heat riser.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.120
I'm finally going to buckle and install a
heat riser made from fire brick.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.150
I decided to dado some of the fire bricks
so that they couldn't collapse into the center.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.290
The original heat riser was 6" which is a
profile of 28.3" square inches.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.819
To minimize the waste of brick, I dado cut
two bricks and then set two complete bricks

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.370
on their ends.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.020
With this setup, the profile area is slightly
less by 2 square inches.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.989
Even though it's slightly smaller, I decided
to take the risk since the heat riser is taller

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.240
than most heaters and it should have a stronger
draft.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.840
A cheap wet saw goes right through the fire
brick and it's brittle enough to tap off any

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:20.940
extra material that didn't come off from the
saw.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.459
For the last step, I built a steel cage around
the outside to hold everything in place.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:33.320
Since the steel frame isn't directly in the
blast zone, it should hold up for quite a

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.580
while.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.350
That's about it for this heating season.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.200
I have a few more ideas in mind for next year
so hopefully I can get them built before we

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.590
start heating again.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:54.400
Thanks for watching!
