00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.980
Here we have a thirty two inch Samsung LCD
TV.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.400
In this video we are going to discuss some
basic troubleshooting methods for a Samsung

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.650
TV that does not power on and does have a
standby light in the front of the TV.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.609
In most Samsung LCD TVs we will have 4 boards.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:41.100
We have the main board, the power supply board,
the backlight inverter.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.920
The backlight inverter can sometimes be covered
by a plastic or metal shield.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.050
We also have the t-con board, the t-con board
can also sometimes be covered by a shield.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.510
Click the link in the video for more information
on the basic functions of these boards.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.610
If you cannot power on your TV, the first
you will want to check is that you have the

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.680
TV plugged into an outlet that is working.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.860
After making sure that the outlet is working,
you will want to check and see that your TV

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.680
has a standby light.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.850
The standby light will typically be blinking
or illuminated on the front of the TV.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.830
If you do not see a light in the front, then
you do not have standby.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.220
If your TV will not power on, and you do have
standby, then the problem is most likely with

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.380
either the power supply or the main board.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.150
The first thing you can do is to visually
inspect the main board and power supply looking

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.530
for damaged components.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.520
Here we have a closeup of the power supply.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.980
You can look over the board and do a visual
inspection looking for any raised or puffy

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.970
capacitors, or any burnt or damaged components.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.390
Here are some examples of what a puffy capacitor
or burnt and damaged component will look like.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.150
If you have any damaged components that look
this way, you should replace the board.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.390
If there is not a replacement board available,
you can also try replacing the individual

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.409
components or purchasing a repair kit.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:17.090
Removing and installing new components requires
the ability to be able to solder.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.480
When looking for damaged components or burn
marks, you can also look at the bottom side

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.750
of the board.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.280
You would simply just need to disconnect all
of the cables and then remove the screws that

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.529
hold the board to the panel.

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:34.040
Be sure when disconnecting cables and removing
screws, that you take a picture of what the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.350
board looks like in the original state with
all of the cables connected and then you will

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.190
have a reference for when you reconnect all
of the cables.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.359
Here is a closeup of the main board.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.239
You can look over the board and do a visual
inspection, again looking for any damaged

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.239
components.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.860
If you have any damaged components, then you
should replace that board.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.420
If you do not see any damaged components,
the next step would be to check voltages on

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.129
the power supply and the main board.

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.209
If you do not have the skills or tools to
check voltages, but still want to try and

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.129
fix your TV, you could also replace the power
supply and main board one at a time and see

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.959
if one of those two boards fixes the problem.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.080
If you are going to purchase multiple boards,
and replace them individually to see if one

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.749
of the boards, fixes the problem, before purchasing,
be sure to understand the return policy of

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:32.329
the company you are purchasing from, as there
may be restocking fees for any returned parts

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.010
or parts that are not returnable at all.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.569
