00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.430
Hello! My name is Grady Johnson and I'm a
professional painter. And today I represent

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.380
expertvillage.com. Now we're going to talk
a little bit about spackling on a door jamb.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.799
Now, earlier we talked about spackling walls.
Now interior or exterior walls spackle about

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.400
the same. But door jambs and wood trim very,
very different including baseboards. If we

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.519
leave ridges and stuff on this, it's going
got show. So we want to pile it on up real

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.090
thick and then sand it on out perfectly smooth
and you'll find a bunch of these little holes

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.079
here that people use. They'll staple things
on the door jamb, or they'll stick little

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.710
post it notes on it, that kind of thing and
then those will leave little holes that you'll

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.149
want to fill. So just go through and look
for them and get a little bit of spackling

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.820
on the end of your knife. Just take that little
thing there and then you're just going to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.610
cram that right into the hole. Now you see
how that's bowed up a little? We want that

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.079
to stay bowed up. We want to push it into
the hole. So keep that little ridge up on

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.720
it like that and see that way when we sand
it, it will sand out nice and smooth. So we

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.200
get a little bit on there. Again, we want
to keep that ridge up on it bowed up a little

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.159
bit. Don't smooth it out flat. The same thing
with these here on the outside. These are

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.110
the most important because these get the hand
traffic and be sure to just even that out.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.280
Now finally, we do see up here a couple of
recessed holes. Now these holes are up in

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.610
a spot that we can't get out blade into. So
we're just going to take a little bit of spackling

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.170
on the end of our finger and cram that up
in there. Alright and then we're going to

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.250
again, try to pile that up over the top of
it with our finger so that we can get that

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.340
with the sandpaper. So we got that up in there.
Oops, it looks like there's one more there

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.600
and a couple over here. So I'm going to finish
this up and get the other jamb. But this is

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.479
how we do the spackling on interior door jambs.
