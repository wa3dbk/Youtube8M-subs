00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.800
Sandvik Coromant's modular system,
Coromant EH, is expanding

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.280
to include a wide assortment of
indexable milling cutters,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.400
boring heads,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.960
solid carbide heads along with
integrated machine adaptors

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.720
and different shanks.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.160
Two customer concerns can
be addressed

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.000
with smart tooling solutions

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.080
and indexable milling cutters
with EH coupling.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.040
For end milling in large machining
centres at longer overhang

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.640
with diameters 10 to 32mm,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.600
the choice of shank material and
its outer dimensions are critical.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640
With our G-undersized heavy
metal shanks,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320
you get clearance all the way
along the shank.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.640
For small and medium sized
machining centres,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.840
to keep the tool within
the critical gauge line

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.240
is extremely important.
