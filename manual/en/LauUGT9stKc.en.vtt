00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.660
I will next explain the application that we
will use as our example and cover the hardware

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:29.800
that was put together to make it work.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.340
We start with a cylindrical polyethylene tank
that can hold up to ten gallons of water or

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.880
other fluid.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.300
We already determined we need the ability
to maintain a known volume within the tank

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.530
that our process will rely on to accurately
mix additive as the mixture is being used

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.100
at a random rate.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.059
The volume in the tank will be handled with
a small Diaphragm Pump controlled by a variable

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.230
DC motor controller that can accept a 0 to
10 volt DC analog signal from our Productivity

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.940
3000.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.700
We will monitor the level in the tank by means
of an Ultrasonic Sensor that will produce

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.280
a 0 to 10 volt DC analog output signal that
is proportional to the distance between the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.200
sensor and the surface of the water.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.780
The sensors output will be connected to a
Productivity 3000 Analog Input Module.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.899
Here we see a diagram representing the working
application.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.960
The Process and Reservoir Tanks are shown
with the interconnecting tubing for both filling

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.710
and draining the Process Tank.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.630
The Ultrasonic Sensor used to measure water
level is shown mounted through the lid of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.540
the Process Tank.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.950
We will use the level to calculate the volume
of water contained in the tank.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.070
In our demonstration, a manually operated
ball valve will be used to set the rate at

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.430
which the mixture is used through a siphoning
action, with the water returned to a Reservoir

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.950
Tank, so it can be reused.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.230
A hand operated Primer Bulb, as might be used
on a gas tank for an outboard engine on a

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:15.280
boat, is used to initially start the drainage
flow, with a siphon tube used to prevent loss

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.340
of flow once the system is primed.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.730
Much of the design that went into our example
application was based on using products that

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.739
are carried by AutomationDirect.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.150
Of course the Productivity 3000 Programmable
Automation Controller is our main focus and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.140
feature for this tutorial.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.570
With its abilities, and the ease of adding
a C-more Touch Panel, we are able to quickly

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.950
setup, control and monitor our application.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.400
And it was a no brainer to use ADCs sensors,
relays, push buttons, power supplies, protective

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.500
devices and wiring components to round out
the design.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.650
Here we see the components from other sources
that were used to complete our application

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.650
design.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.180
These included the polyethylene tanks, Diaphragm
Pump, DC motor controller, float switch, the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.690
Primer Bulb, vinyl tubing, fittings, and a
19 inch relay rack.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.680
The arrangement of the equipment used for
the example application was designed so all

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.379
of the components would fit on a portable
relay rack.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.610
On the front includes the Productivity 3000,
C-more Touch Panel, Power On and Emergency

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.950
Stop push buttons, Process Tank with Ultrasonic
Level Sensor and overflow float switch, and

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.739
a Stack Light Tower mounted off to the side.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.130
On the rear are found the ZipLink modules,
power supplies, Stride Ethernet switches,

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.870
relays, circuit protection, DC motor controller,
reservoir tank, and Diaphragm Pump with a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.269
12 volt DC motor.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.549
Also included are terminal blocks and wire
duct to keep the wiring neat.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.970
ZipLink modules and cables aided in allowing
the wiring to take minimum time.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.110
Seen next is a series of wiring diagrams,
or if you prefer, schematics, that detail

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.470
the wiring in our application example.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.520
In particular is the use of protective devices
and separate DC power supplies for the general

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.290
DC devices, analog input and output signals,
and DC power to the Diaphragm Pump motor.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:40.620
The first diagram includes the Power On, Emergency
Stop, relays, float switch and general 24

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.610
volt DC circuitry.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.760
Sheet 2 of the diagrams shows power and communications
to the Productivity 3000 and C-more Touch

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.410
Panel.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:00.100
Also shown is the 24 volt DC power for the
Stride Ethernet switches and the analog signals.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:07.010
Sheet 3 continues with the Productivity 3000
discrete DC input and output I/O modules,

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.540
and the use of ZipLink modules and cables
to make the actual wiring clean and simple

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.820
to accomplish.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.300
The last diagram includes our Productivity
3000 analog input and output modules, ZipLink

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.030
modules and cables to keep the analog signal
wiring simple, connections to the Ultrasonic

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.050
Sensor, and a Rhino 12 volt DC power supply
for the Dart DC motor speed controller used

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.000
to power the Diaphragm Pump motor.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.131
The Ultrasonic Sensors 0 to 10 volts DC signal
is wired into the first channel of the analog

00:05:44.131 --> 00:05:51.270
input module by way of a ZipLink module and
interconnecting cable.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.710
The first channel of the analog output module,
using a ZipLink module and interconnecting

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.780
cable, provides the 0 to 10 volts DC signal
to the Dart DC motor speed controller, which

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.470
allows the Diaphragm Pump to produce a 0 to
1 gallon per minute flow rate to the Process

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.050
Tank.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.550
Next we need to configure the jumpers on the
analog input module so the 0 to 10 VDC signal

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:29.190
from the Ultrasonic Sensor can be used to
determine the water level in the Process Tank.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.030
The P3-04ADS Analog Input Module we have chosen
has the ability to be configured to accept

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.100
either voltage or current signals, and each
type of signal can also be configured for

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:50.720
different ranges, such as 0 to 5 volts DC,
0 to 10 volts DC, 4 to 20 milliamps, etc.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.050
To keep it simple, we will set the Analog
Input Module up so all four channels will

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.180
accept a 0 to 10 volts DC signal.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:08.700
This will provide a 0 to 65,535 count range
within our Productivity 3000 ladder logic

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.340
program.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.880
Join me in Part 4 of this video series as
I cover configuring our hardware, explain

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.080
the use of Tagnames, and do some calculations
to get our signals into understandable and

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.750
useful engineering units.
