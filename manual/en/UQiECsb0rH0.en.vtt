Hello, guys! It's Yooncharmi!

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.920
I'm obsessed with strawberries lately so for today's video,  I'm gonna show you how to do strawberry makeup!

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.820
I'll be doing strawberry- inspired red cheeks and unique green eye lines that look like strawberry stem! Let's begin!

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.740
I already finished my base makeup so,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.840
I'll start with the eyebrows.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.220
Just fill in the gaps lightly

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.620
and feather in little strokes.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.100
This eyebrow pencil is very thin and matches with the natural color of my eyebrows really well so

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.380
it's very natural.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.000
But I personally think that black eyebrows do not suit me very well because of my hair color,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.620
so I went for the brown eye mascara.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.500
Brush it through the brows backward first to coat the color evenly.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.960
And then brush through again but this time, following the natural shape of the brows.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.640
I believe that everyone would have a shadow with this kind of color.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.620
Apply to the double eyelid area and blend it out little further.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.040
You can use your finger to blend it out and soften the edges

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.640
but I felt like using a brush does a better job so i went with a brush.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.460
The star of today's makeup, strawberry pink!

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.480
This shadow is the most important part of today's makeup.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.480
I'm gonna take this to my lower lash line to give that strawberry hue and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.280
also take it to my cheeks.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.720
When you apply it to your cheeks, make sure that you take it closer to the eyes

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.920
which makes this makeup unique and even more girly.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.860
I used my hand to apply because it's an eye shadow

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.160
If you have puff or any kind of blush brush,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.540
it'll be much easier to blend using that.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.940
I'm really making my money's worth with this aegyosal stick.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.980
I'm gonna apply this on my double eyelids to make them pop.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.580
I also applied it on my lower lash line all the way to the inner corner but not on the outer edge.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.080
I wanted light and soft vibe so I went for the brown eye liner.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.420
If you find it difficult to draw a line with one sweep,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.420
it'll be much easier for you to start with small strokes and connect them until you get your desired eyeliner.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.140
For waterline, you can divide it into small sections and wiggle the liner on to the roots slightly as you go.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.780
That way, you wouldn't have that weird white line that doesn't go well with eyeliner.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.200
I'm gonna use this reddish pencil to keep this strawberry vibe going.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.060
Apply it on the outer corner of the under lash line(a.k.a. triangle zone).

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.500
Slightly overdraw the line to open up the eyes.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.280
This color is quite deep so it'll add a little definition as well.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.020
For today's makeup, I've chosen the brown mascara, which is unusual for me.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.460
Wiggle the wand back and forth and pull it out upward with a zig-zag motion.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.480
Go lightly on the under lashes as well.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.480
Brown mascara looks very natural

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.840
and when you look at it up close, it's not just plain brown. It has coppery red hues, which I really like.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.420
I'm gonna use this strawberry color tint, known as 'Sulli tint'!

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.260
I really like the color but it kind of cracks on my lips

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.400
so I wouldn't purchase another one, personally.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.540
Pat it on the inner part of your lips. Pat, pat, pat.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.280
This lip plumper will make my lips look like dewy and fresh strawberry.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.160
You can just top it off focusing on the center of your lips and... Mwah!

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.420
One more thing!

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.820
You can't call it strawberry makeup without drawing a cut little green stem.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.260
Add the green liner up on the eyeliner you drew in, just on the outer corner to like a fresh green stem.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.500
And the strawberry makeup look is done!

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.080
