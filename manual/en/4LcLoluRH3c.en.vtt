Hi everyone, it's Melissa, the writer and
star of Adult Wednesday Addams.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.010
And I just wanted to say thank you so much--

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.010
You're welcome.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.010
Wednesday.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.650
I didn't see you come in.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.650
Exactly.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.650
You look nice.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.700
I mean, you look the same.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.390
Thank you.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.210
I was just doing a Thank You video to our
fans.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.770
Do you want to say anything?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.430
Normals first.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.430
Okay.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.249
I just wanted to thank you all for your enthusiasm
about the series.

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.249
It's meant so much to me.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.539
I feel so grateful for all of your support.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.449
It's made October the best month.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.519
Um, do you have anything that you want to
say to the fans?

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.519
No.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:56.519
No?

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.269
Every breath they take is an expression of
my gratitude.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.699
That's nice of you, Wednesday.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.480
I know.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.360
People have been asking about a second season,
and I just wanted to let you know that I am

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.510
working on it.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.110
I'm writing it and I just have to raise some
money but I promise you that it is coming.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.980
And in the meantime, I will be posting Wednesday
and non-Wednesday related content on this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.980
channel.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.180
So I hope you stick around.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.670
I have one more thing to say.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.790
Okay, you should do that.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.030
I have a message for the 46 people that clicked
Thumbs Down on the videos.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.440
I promise you that soon enough those thumbs
will be mine.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.890
That seems fair.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.520
So what are you doing right now, Wednesday?

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.230
Do you want to hang out?

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.590
Have you seen Orange Is the New Black?

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.250
I have Netflix.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.700
She's great.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.590
We're really good friends.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.390
She just must have been busy.
