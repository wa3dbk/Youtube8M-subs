00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.280
Hello and welcome to the eleventh episode
of my Call of Duty Ghosts Weapon Guide.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.180
In this episode: the MSBS - a modular Polish
assault rifle design capable of filling a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.390
wide range of roles.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.170
The MSBS's damage is the highest within the
assault rifle class, and is the only such

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.800
weapon capable of killing with two shots to
the body at a close range.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.050
One burst kills are the norm out to a middle
range, where damage quickly drops to a much

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.180
less appealing 5 shot kill, for a minimum
of two bursts.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.100
As a burst fire weapon, your overall sustained
rate of fire will be lower than that of an

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.750
automatic: your maximum possible output equates
to around 450 rounds per minute.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.340
Within the burst, cyclic rate is very high,
however: close to 900 rounds per minute.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.269
Paired with the high damage up close, hipfire
can sometime prove very effective as a last-ditch

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.450
defence.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.880
However, it is worth noting that the MSBS's
hipfire spread is slightly worse than a typical

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.200
assault rifle - so you may want to equip steady
aim, or ensure you're at a point blank range

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.570
before firing.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.980
Recoil is quite high, deflecting rapidly upwards:
although the burst fire mode does much to

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.440
ensure good fire control.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.790
Nevertheless, the latter portion of your burst
may miss your intended mark at a distance,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.490
and as such you may often find you'll need
multiple bursts to ensure a reliable kill.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.050
Aim time is standard for the assault rifle
class, at 300 milliseconds: and movement speed

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.680
is standard too, at 90 percent of the base
speed.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.570
Magazine capacity is the usual 30 rounds for
an assault rifle, or 45 with extended mags:

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.980
given that the burst fire mode of the MSBS
will help moderate your consumption, reloads

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.290
are seldom a problem.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.380
In any case, resupplies are relatively quick
- taking 2.63 seconds to complete.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.360
Burst lethality should be your paramount concern
when building an MSBS class - if you don't

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.459
kill with a single burst, your time to kill
will lag behind the other assault rifles.

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.849
Ensuring accuracy is important - and for that
reason an optical attachment can be a worthy

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.930
selection.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.970
The Holographic sight is a good mid-range
option, with a little extra zoom when compared

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.340
to the red dot: this will allow you to place
your bursts squarely on target.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.959
The foregrip is another useful choice, as
it will tighten up your burst grouping for

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.180
more effective use at a distance: potentially
securing a critical one-burst kill.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.900
Alternatively, the Muzzle Brake will extend
your 2-shot kill range slightly, improving

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.930
performance at a middle range.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.480
For your perks, Focus is an important choice,
as it reduces both idle sway and the flinch

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.420
from incoming fire: each potentially fouling
the lethality of your burst.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.560
Worth considering is Deadeye: an expensive
option but one that can prove invaluable:

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.499
with your shots gaining a random damage buff,
with increased probability the longer your

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.079
streak gets.

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.670
It can work very well as part of a specialist
strike package, kicking in once you've found

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.790
your stride.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.760
With Deadeye active, your bursts will be very
potent indeed - killing with just a single

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.609
headshot at close range, and with far greater
reliability at longer distances.

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.249
This means your weapon is less likely to let
you down, and the MSBS is the perfect weapon

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.299
with which to aim for the higher streaks.

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.870
Hardline is another option which can assist
on this front, making the top assault streaks

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.940
slightly more obtainable, and helping you
gain the deadliest support available.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.499
The MSBS is a deadly 3-shot burst weapon,
capable of quenching your enemy's hopes faster

00:03:58.499 --> 00:03:59.959
than they can react.

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.909
It deals the highest per-shot damage in its
class, and is the only assault rifle capable

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.670
of killing in two shots to the body by default.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.709
This lethal damage is meted out in a precise
package, with the 3 rounds dispensed very

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.120
quickly - and normally securing a kill.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.440
However, the moderately high recoil and damage
drop may conspire to deny you a one-burst

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.790
despatch, and it's here where the weapon suffers.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.730
A mandatory burst delay means your next burst
isn't immediate, requiring a small pause and

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.850
another pull of the trigger.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.890
During this time, an automatic weapon may
have the chance to tackle you, knocking you

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.870
off target or dealing lethal damage.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.620
Still, with careful aim you can minimise the
number of bursts required - and for the accurate

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.260
player the weapon will perform ably.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.160
Truly, the rapid volley of the MS will deceive
your opponent...

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.170
...and that is no BS.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:06.950
Thank you very much for watching, and join
me next time - when I'll be covering the MTAR-X.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.500
Until then, farewell.
