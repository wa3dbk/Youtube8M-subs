bjbj &gt;&gt; RYAN: Hey what's up guys? This is
Ryan from TheWorkoutCorner.com and today we're

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.000
going to talk about a framework that you can
use to help you get the body that you want.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.330
But for me personally there was definitely
a time when I was very frustrated with the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.880
lack of results as far as I was trying different
programs, different exercises, and I just

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.160
quite couldn't get all the pieces to fit and
it didn't make sense. Because I was going

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.140
to the gym, I was doing what I was supposed
to do, and there was some progress but it

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.550
wasn't the results that I was expecting or
really hoping for and felt that I had earned

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.210
from the work that I had put in. So before
I go adding tons of videos on workout programs

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.470
and exercises I wanted to make sure that this
core framework is really understand because

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.210
it's so important in helping you get the body
you want and stay committed and focused on

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.789
your goals. [PAUSE] &gt;&gt; RYAN: All right so
this is an overview of the framework. If you

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:12.670
want a more in depth study I suggest you sign
up for the 7 Day Program below where I will

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.899
go over these in details with you once each
day so it's a little more easier to digest.

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:26.429
[PAUSE] &gt;&gt; RYAN: All right so you are ready
to get the body that you want. What's the

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:36.539
first step? Well you kind of already started
it and that is the vision having the vision

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.679
visualizing the body that you want to have
or that you want to achieve. [PAUSE] &gt;&gt; RYAN:

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:49.479
All right the next step is we need to translate
that vision into a goal. A goal is something

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:57.990
that is specific and measurable. [PAUSE] &gt;&gt; RYAN:
So after the goal, after we've determined

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.669
and set the goal we want to achieve the next
step is determining the strategy. The strategy

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:17.659
which is 
strategy and the strategy is going to be how

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:25.879
we accomplish or achieve that goal. [PAUSE]
&gt;&gt; RYAN: After the strategy the next step

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:37.690
is the tactics and this is the doing phase.
This is the stuff we're going to do. This

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:47.920
is like your workout program, your diet program.
[PAUSE] &gt;&gt; RYAN: So after we have the tactics

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:59.219
the bottom of the rung are the tools okay.
And the tools are all the different building

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:06.010
blocks available to us for achieving our goal
and vision. That's going to be the specific

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.359
exercises. Food, supplements, gym, home, wherever
you're working out. These are all different

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.340
tools. They're not tools in the sense of hammer
but different components or different building

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.689
blocks that we piece together to give us the
goal. [Music] how to get the body you want
