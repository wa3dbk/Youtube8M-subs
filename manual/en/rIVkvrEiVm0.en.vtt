00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:16.718
What is at the center of the universe?

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:18.054
It's an essential question

00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:21.140
that humans have
been wondering about for centuries.

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:22.947
But the journey toward an answer

00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:24.406
has been a strange one.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.764
If you wanted to know
the answer to this question

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:28.850
in third century B.C.E. Greece,

00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:30.494
you might look up at the night sky

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:32.070
and trust what you see.

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:33.404
That's what Aristotle,

00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:35.854
THE guy to ask back then, did.

00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:38.212
He thought that since we're
on Earth, looking up,

00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:40.032
it must be the center, right?

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:41.876
For him, the sphere of the world

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.630
was made up of four elements:

00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:44.045
Earth,

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.497
water,

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:44.964
air,

00:00:44.988 --> 00:00:46.165
and fire.

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:48.417
These elements shifted around a nested set

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.779
of solid crystalline spheres.

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:53.298
Each of the wandering stars, the planets,

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:55.175
had their own crystal sphere.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.636
The rest of the universe
and all of its stars

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.845
were on the last crystal sphere.

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.764
If you watch the sky change over time,

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:03.693
you could see that this idea worked fine

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:05.892
at explaining the motion you saw.

00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:08.059
For centuries, this
was central to how Europe

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:11.162
and the Islamic world saw the universe.

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:13.968
But in 1543, a guy named Copernicus

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:15.978
proposed a different model.

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.251
He believed that the sun

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:19.501
was at the center of the universe.

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:21.075
This radically new idea

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.463
was hard for a lot of people to accept.

00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:25.621
After all, Aristotle's ideas made sense

00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:26.875
with what they could see,

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.960
and they were pretty flattering to humans.

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:30.881
But a series of subsequent discoveries

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:34.644
made the sun-centric model hard to ignore.

00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:36.715
First, Johannes Kepler pointed out

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:39.561
that orbits aren't perfect
circles or spheres.

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:41.480
Then, Galileo's telescope caught

00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:43.487
Jupiter's moons orbiting around Jupiter,

00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:45.390
totally ignoring Earth.

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:48.728
And then, Newton proposed the theory
of universal gravitation,

00:01:48.752 --> 00:01:52.154
demonstrating that all objects
are pulling on each other.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:54.127
Eventually, we had to let go of the idea

00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.130
that we were at the center
of the universe.

00:01:57.154 --> 00:01:59.827
Shortly after Copernicus, in the 1580s,

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.074
an Italian friar, Giordano Bruno,

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:03.784
suggested the stars were suns

00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:05.578
that likely had their own planets

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:08.681
and that the universe was infinite.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:10.909
This idea didn't go over well.

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:14.503
Bruno was burned at the stake
for his radical suggestion.

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:17.380
Centuries later,
the philosopher Rene Descartes

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:20.383
proposed that the universe
was a series of whirlpools,

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.800
which he called vortices,

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:25.259
and that each star
was at the center of a whirlpool.

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:28.017
In time, we realized there
were far more stars

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.308
than Aristotle ever dreamed.

00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:32.299
As astronomers like William Herschel

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:34.440
got more and more advanced telescopes,

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:36.546
it became clear that our sun is actually

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.993
one of many stars inside the Milky Way.

00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:42.248
And those smudges we see in the night sky?

00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:43.592
They're other galaxies,

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:46.080
just as vast as our Milky Way home.

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:49.998
Maybe we're farther from the center
than we ever realized.

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:52.976
In the 1920s, astronomers
studying the nebuli

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.461
wanted to figure out how they were moving.

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:56.819
Based on the Doppler Effect,

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.465
they expected to see blue shift

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.008
for objects moving toward us,

00:03:00.032 --> 00:03:02.638
and red shift for ones moving away.

00:03:02.662 --> 00:03:05.351
But all they saw was a red shift.

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:08.258
Everything was moving away from us, fast.

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:10.616
This observation
is one of the pieces of evidence

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.580
for what we now call the Big Bang Theory.

00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:14.795
According to this theory,

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.128
all matter in the universe

00:03:16.152 --> 00:03:19.981
was once a singular,
infinitely dense particle.

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:21.830
In a sense, our piece of the universe

00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:23.703
was once at the center.

00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:26.664
But this theory eliminates
the whole idea of a center

00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:30.055
since there can't be a center
to an infinite universe.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.125
The Big Bang wasn't just
an explosion in space;

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.346
it was an explosion of space.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.092
What each new discovery proves

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:40.591
is that while our observations
are limited,

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.604
our ability to speculate and dream

00:03:42.628 --> 00:03:44.574
of what's out there isn't.

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:47.721
What we think we know today
can change tomorrow.

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:49.890
As with many of the thinkers we just met,

00:03:49.914 --> 00:03:52.171
sometimes our wildest guesses

00:03:52.195 --> 00:03:54.568
lead to wonderful and humbling answers

00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:58.512
and propel us toward even more
perplexing questions.
