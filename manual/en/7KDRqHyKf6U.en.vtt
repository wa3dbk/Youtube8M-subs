00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:01.799
Hi, guys.

00:00:01.799 --> 00:00:02.799
It's Cerine.

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:03.799
Welcome back to this channel.

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.350
So if you live in Canada, you are probably
really happy as I am because it's finally

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.350
springtime.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.120
And to help us get into the spring/summertime
spirit, I thought I would show you guys how

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.500
to create this look.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.829
It's sort of like beachy, surfer-chic hairstyle.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.609
And it's worn by a lot of different celebrities
and models and stuff like that, just generally

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.609
awesome people.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.899
All you need for this is the TRESemmé Perfectly
(Un)Done line.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.390
So if you have naturally straight hair, like
I do, or if you have curly or wavy hair but

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.379
you want to better enhance the overall texture
and look of it, it's really important that

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.150
you use a lightweight shampoo and conditioner.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.410
So the line that I just mentioned is perfect
for this because it takes out the residue,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.079
but it still leaves your hair really healthy
and shiny and, of course, really, really bouncy.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.920
Once I have prepped my hair in the shower,
I will hop out and pat my hair dry with a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.920
towel.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.179
To help create some texture in my really,
really straight hair, I will grab a small

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.449
section of hair above my left eyebrow, twist
it as I pull it towards the right, add in

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.790
hair, continue twisting, and I keep doing
this until I reach the right side of my head.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.780
Then I just twist the section up into a little
bun, and I will tie it or pin it down in place.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.150
I typically will leave my hair like this for
about 30 minutes while I go about the rest

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.540
of my morning, and while my hair is still
damp I'm going to mist it with the TRESemmé

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.720
Sea Salt Spray from the mid-length to the
ends.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.270
And to be perfectly honest, I used to think
this was more like a fad, gimmick product,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.200
but it actually really, really helps to add
texture to my hair.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.620
Now comes the fun part.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.010
Grab your diffuser attachment and plug that
into your blow dryer.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.440
If you don't own one of these already, I highly
recommend you get one, especially if you have

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.790
naturally curly or wavy hair because you'll
have more control over your look.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.180
Your look will be softer, and your hair won't
be as messy or as frizzy when you are done

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.180
styling it.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.830
I've already flipped my head upside down,
and I'm going to blow dry my hair by just

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.110
lifting the diffuser into my curls as I have
the air blowing.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.930
I'm keeping the blow dryer to a medium setting
so as to not overheat my hair or to mess up

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.030
the curls, and I'm also making sure I distribute
the air really evenly throughout my entire

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.800
head just so my hair is all drying at the
same time.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.330
I like to dry my hair upside-down until it's
about 80% dry, and then I flip my hair right-side

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.730
up again just to check how it's looking and
to part my hair.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.099
If your hair is naturally straight like mine,
I highly recommend you blow dry it completely,

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.870
because otherwise if you leave it to air dry,
you may notice the gorgeous waves we've just

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.310
created will straighten out a bit more.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.200
So to create a little bit more curl and a
little bit more definition, I'm going to pull

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.700
out small sections of hair and twist it away
from my face, spray it with the TRESemmé

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.620
hairspray and then blow dry it with the diffuser
attachment removed.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.770
Once you're happy with the look, you can set
it in place with the hairspray.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.260
I am again using the TRESemmé Ultra Brushable
Hairspray just to make sure the waves stay

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.400
in place and my hair still feels really natural,
and the curls and waves are really bouncy

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.230
and flowy.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:15.319
Here again is the final look that we just
created using a couple of products and a blow

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.010
dryer with a diffuser attachment.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.610
That is it for now.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.700
Thank you, guys, for watching.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.560
I hope you have a fantastic week.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.099
Get outside, enjoy the weather, walk your
dog, play with a Frisbee, chase a squirrel.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.490
I see where I was going with that one.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.510
Anyway, that is it for this tutorial.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.510
Thank you so much for watching.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.670
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.800
Make sure you thumbs this video up if you
did so that I know, and I will see you in

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800
my next video.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.940
Bye, guys.
