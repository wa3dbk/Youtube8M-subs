00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.198
- Get her out of there.
- Go! Delta, move! Now!

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.890
&lt;i&gt;- She's not here. She's gone.&lt;/i&gt;
- Goddamn it!

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.188
&lt;i&gt;- They are not on the tram.&lt;/i&gt;
- He's one guy!

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.559
&lt;i&gt;[ Nicky On Radio ]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jason, please don't hurt me.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[ Bourne ] What were my words?&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.190
I said leave me alone,
leave me out of it.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.758
[ Nicky ] I did. I swear.
Jason, I told them
that I believed you.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:42.202
I'm gonna ask you
some some simple questions.

00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:46.072
You're gonna answer me honestly,
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you.

00:00:46.143 --> 00:00:48.805
- Delta, give me something.
- They're on it! They're on it!

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.109
Who's Pamela Landy?

00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:54.639
&lt;i&gt;- [ Nicky On Radio ]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;She's a task force chief.&lt;/i&gt;
- Is she running Treadstone?

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:57.482
No, she's
the deputy director.
Why is she trying to kill me?

00:00:57.554 --> 00:01:01.547
&lt;i&gt;[ Nicky ] Last week&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;an agency field officer tried to&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;make a buy off of one ofher ops.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:05.288
He was trying to sell out
a mole or something
and you got to him before we did.

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:07.489
&lt;i&gt;- I&lt;/i&gt; killed him?
- You left a print.

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:10.556
&lt;i&gt;There were partial prints&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that trace back to Treadstone.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;They know it was you.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:14.331
&lt;i&gt;- That is insane.&lt;/i&gt;
- Why are you doing this?
Why come back now?

00:01:14.404 --> 00:01:16.929
Landy will find--
Stop. Stop.

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:21.239
Last week
I was 4,000 miles away in India,
watching Marie die.

00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:24.212
&lt;i&gt;They came for me,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and they killed her instead.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:26.272
&lt;i&gt;This ends now.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:31.254 --> 00:01:34.417
&lt;i&gt;- [ Radio: Static ]&lt;/i&gt;
- Find her.

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:38.450
- [ Gasps ]
- What do you people want with me?
Why are you trying to frame me?

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:42.294
- Please! I'm only here because of Paris.
Abbott dragged us--
- Abbott? Who's Abbott?

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:44.333
Conklin's boss.
He-He shut down Treadstone.

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.198
Is he here in Berlin?
Yes.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:48.203
Did he run Treadstone?
[ Sobbing ]

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.331
Did he run Treadstone?
Yes.
Conklin reported to him.

00:01:51.408 --> 00:01:53.342
[ Continues Sobbing ]
Please. Please, I swear--

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.471
What was Landy buying?
What kind of files?
Conklin-- Stuff on Conklin.

00:01:57.547 --> 00:02:00.482
It was something to do
with a Russian politician.

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:09.992
Neski.
Wh-What?
What are you talking about?

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.793
&lt;i&gt;[ Conklin ]&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Training is over-- Training is over--&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Training is over--&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:17.390
When-- When was I here in Berlin?

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:20.368
What are you talking about?
For Treadstone.
I did a job here.

00:02:20.437 --> 00:02:23.338
When?
No, you never worked
in Berlin before.

00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:25.738
My first job. In Berlin.
You know my file.

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.676
- You've never worked Berlin before.
- My first job!

00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:31.407
No, your first assignment
was Geneva.
You fucking people!

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:34.644
[ Screaming ]
I swear! I swear!
I know I was here, Nicky!

00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:37.812
- [ Sobbing Intensifies ]
It's not in your file!
- I know I was here!

00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:40.721
&lt;i&gt;No, I swear-- Oh, please.!&lt;/i&gt;
