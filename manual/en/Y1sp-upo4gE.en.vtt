hello stairway looking at replacing the
bill perry on a two thousand seven jenny

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.670
format but this procedure should work
for free but jc five were seized export

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.499
dept

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.050
in this particular vehicle

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.990
whenever i ask her r_t_e_ less in really
bad popping sounds

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.569
and

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:20.909
infuriated with the rotation wheel

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.710
but this is one spot where the wheel
rotates which is an indication that the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.439
middle of may have failed

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.060
one of the more likely reasons why you
anyways he is one of the war

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.770
we'll see if that is that they are

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.010
uh... and that was pretty sensors
integrated into the home

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.770
uh...

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.210
it can be kind of a tricky procedure but
it's not too bad ice formations or

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.740
observe all the four specifications and
then take your time today

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.209
the suspensions people can be very
sensitive you've got anything that's

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:50.630
lives are at stake in just a little bit

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.110
uh... so let's get started

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.310
look at the car support was vaccines and
then remove the wheel

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.490
and then we'll remove and now he's
either of these two twenty one on your

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.440
books right here to removed the brake
caliper emer

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.570
and arrangement for one of your voice we
were able to remove the breakout

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.770
which i have just sent

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.870
from a bungee cord right here

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.520
it's critical that you know a lot of
original grandmother brake lines of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.430
events

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.150
required

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.120
some people use the geyser

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.190
whatever usually truly have the caliber
of security

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.580
painfully aware

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.450
unitel

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.109
uh... we have removed the rover

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.960
was the they did a little nervous

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.780
we are getting

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.240
the caliber of mistake sometimes

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.870
but also the rover

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.570
was personnel room

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.360
bratislava

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.540
and we will put your

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.300
beloit waters of along the rotor

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.550
and uh... those

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.200
of the offbeat

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.520
spin around probably come off the bench

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.580
put the brakes

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.180
previous work on b

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.370
apartheid

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.729
and uh... that's what you were

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.680
is uh... disconnected

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.390
as is uh... that's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.590
insults dash

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.439
with uh... with this dot right here

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.910
which went out on a with iran about

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940
to break that loose utna

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.499
until there is

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.889
your amount you can just get a uh...

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.480
holds about were walker something like
that who

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.099
and we don't want you to know and and
and and i love your recent breakthroughs

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.199
and yet the heroin removed here's a
little bit rehear for summer and i

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.789
expected you're hit with a little bit of
the people last year which i don't think

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:32.599
they have

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.639
and uh...

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.359
either meaning it

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.249
india

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.619
people turn out in this procedure that
you final discounting

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:43.640
uh... never going to do the lower ball
joint not which is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.760
just behind the wheel of

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.049
facing downward

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.599
association of that's facing down that
senate when one of the year

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.930
andrea or all of you and store on its
own separate people working for

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.019
uh... reviews from the above

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.629
can argue that

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.659
if you want to work

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.430
to soften the blow virtually no ban on
smoking and inside sledgehammer

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.430
hewitt separatism

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.779
profits and start

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.609
even after i a lot of other

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.789
failures using that to blackboard
triumph of love

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.599
uh... he had not come loose a little bit

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.369
flirted with record on the control arm

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:37.260
which i'm not afraid of what you will of
course clerks of u_s_

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.299
was able to get to the it was without
usual sort of the control or justin

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.209
you try it

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.799
be careful in

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:45.790
immediately

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.589
but uh... sometimes it's the force
against the blues and sometimes it's the

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:50.519
vibration

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.049
uh... from

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.879
striking metal on metal

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.899
message footer

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:57.519
with this particular react

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.999
sup with fast food

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.859
with our two other get straight to go to
a puzzle

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.039
and there are these t_-fifty five
classes right here

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.189
particular separator more

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.889
uh... with an adapter amenity fifty-five
socket which is kinda an unusually large

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.020
g_-fifty five

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.459
so make sure that you were

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.719
you've got all these in your kid before
you start

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:22.300
slacks a let's get them removed so that
i would also make sure that you just

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.360
think you were a eighty s we'll speak
sensor so you don't damage the connected

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.219
when you

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:35.340
and absolutely no speak five access we
have the wheel of a separate

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.560
and uh...

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.280
don't you

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.610
will also leave

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.510
which i think is the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.729
or the better of some ways you can get
for uh... a reasonable price

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.280
uh...

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.430
basically recently reviewed in reverse
order pain very close attention force

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.770
are process the patient

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.430
but will not stand for the reassembly
source in a city that right now

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.169
and we have those three fifty five fax
is four down to nine six foot pounds to

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.189
to get the widow of assembly

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:06.489
secure

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:08.219
the uh...

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:09.720
remain fasteners

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.290
are going to have alan

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.130
uh...

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.970
alan lipke inside a politically studs
with uh...

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.710
legal family

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.130
and to get us started really need to
uh...

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.050
to put down in part artist like that
from this case

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.930
the uh...

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.409
lower our

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.080
uh... also assembly

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.709
has been a six to twelve year

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:33.060
interior alan

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.050
twenty twenty one millimeter dot stand

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.889
will see that you started

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.169
and once it's tight enough

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.009
these flood waters dot

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:51.590
and then she wants you to your final for
which with corporate genocide

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.009
you've got that will roll might work
against human fifty two-foot pounds

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.789
hands and

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.489

are a look at the bottom backup we uh...
extremely operating hours with uh... a

hundred and twenty two-foot path for
symbolism series organelles

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:19.529
advice you can possible out

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.539
and that it's easy to neglect the
allotment to expect

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.080
uh... respect supporters without

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.160
when she noticed that moderate impacts
and i would recommend

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.550
you know in others as you can get in the
air apparently on the ground with star

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.699
starter

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.949
and it turned out to programs

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.939
festival of colours his job as you can
see it's a it's really pretty

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.360
straightforward i recently had friends
ivy holiday shoppers you by phone at

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.199
four oh seven hundred dollars for this
procedure which really blew me away

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.799
whenever i've been in a c_e_o_ who will
uh... which is almost five months with

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:55.520
the front moved we'll

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.599
prone rather have the moving of had my
choice

00:06:58.599 --> 00:06:59.909
uh... but still

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:03.559
uh... easy to say a lot of money on a
very simple procedure like this if you

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:07.389
had a wheel speed sensor that sound
recording some strange noises when

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:10.009
you're steering handsome excessive

fertile playing in new york inhibited
and no

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.509
but first we must always do it every
question still reports one of the
