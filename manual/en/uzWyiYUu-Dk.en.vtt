00:00:01.537 --> 00:00:04.910
Hi, this Loren Lockman. I'm coming to you from
 the  Tanglewood Wellness Center

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:08.379
I've been asked to talk a little bit 
about Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.023
Is there a way that people with Multiple Sclerosis
can heal? because MS is one of those conditions

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:25.940
that the medical people say it's incurable, 
it's progressive, it's going to get worse, the body's 
attacking itself and there's nothing that they can do

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:29.433
rather than to treat symptoms.

00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:34.333
Let me tell you a little bit about my experience with MS,
I don't have a tremendous amount of experience

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:40.307
I think I've worked with 6 people over the last 15 
years with MS, and I'll tell you about a few of them today

00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:47.703
The first one was a woman who was introduced to
 me by her employer, her conditions had 
progressed until the extent

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:51.936
and surely wasn't capable of working anymore, 
and she didn't know what to do about it

00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:55.818
and her employer came here to me and said: 
"could you help her?" and so she referred her

00:00:55.853 --> 00:01:04.389
employee to me. The woman at that time was not
 willing to fast, she was afraid of it, 
she wasn't sure if she could do it

00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:10.845
whatever it might have been. So I coached her 
instead on making radical changes to her diet

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:21.871
and essentially adopting a fruit and simple leafy
 greens salad diet. So she lived on only fruit 
and only simple greens salads

00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:26.259
and that might sound crazy, I've been doing exactly 
the same thing for over 20 years now

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:32.852
and what happened was within about 6 months, 
this woman felt so good she was able to go back to work

00:01:32.887 --> 00:01:39.454
and had basically eliminated almost all her symptoms,
 in just 6 months time by changing her diet

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:45.226
but that does not work for everybody, but in her case, 
because most of what it was going on for her

00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:49.610
 had not advanced so far that was still 
a succesful strategy.

00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:58.547
The second person I will tell you about was a very
 interesting and dramatic situation. This was a
woman that came to me in her mid 50's or early 50's perhaps

00:01:58.582 --> 00:02:10.440
and her MS had progressed until the extent that
 she could no longer lift her right leg, so she would
walk dragging her right leg behind her

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:17.080
and it was an interesting thing because our last 
location in the United States, this is our forth location,

00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.822
over the last 15 years

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:28.500
our last in the US, was a 3 storey building where 
you came in on the middle level and we had only
2 guest rooms on that walking floor

00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:38.781
and we had 5 uptairs and 2 downstairs, and we had 
4 other guests who were in worse conditions
to taking stairs than she was

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:43.766
so she actually winded up meeting to the uptairs, 
and at the beginning of her fast it was fine, 
she would walk up the stairs

00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:51.517
she would lift her right leg with both of her hands 
and put it on the next stair. By the time 
she was about 10 days into her fast,

00:02:51.552 --> 00:03:01.653
she was too weak to do that, and one of my employees
 or I would phisically carry her up or down the 
stairs everyday, up to multiple times a day

00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:12.060
By the time she completed her fast, she fasted with
 me for 32 days, and in these days consuming only water,

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:19.797
no juices, no supplements, no anything else, 32 days 
only water, and what happened as a result of that

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:26.813
by the time she was complete with her fasting and 10 
days of refeeding she was walking up and down the stairs

00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:35.464
without needing to lift her leg with her hand, she
 was lifting her leg under her own power, using her leg 
the way it was designed to be used by the first time

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:39.715
in several years, and that was very exciting thing.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:48.729
The last person I'll talk about today was another
 woman, and this woman was a professor 
in the California University system

00:03:48.764 --> 00:03:58.820
University of California, Berkley I think. She was a
 professor there, she actually had very few phisical
symptoms but her MS had progressed until the extent

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:08.073
that she could no longer think clearly, and what
 this meant was she wasn't able to teach, she winded up
taking a little retirement because she simply wasn't

00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:18.232
capable of doing her job anymore, so she came
 to fast and she had intended to fast for 32 days,
based on my coaching I said to her:

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:26.345
"This is a very serious situation, in order to completely 
reverse this, you're gonna want to spend 
at least 32 days fasting"

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.719
and that was what she agreed to do, so she was going 
to spend 6 weeks at the center as the last
 one that I mentioned to you

00:04:32.754 --> 00:04:45.536
but she came with 3 other women that she knew
 and each of them were only intended to spend
 4 weeks at the center, on the 20 first days

00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:49.130
 each of those other 3 were about to
 break their fast the next morning

00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:58.418
the woman with multiple esclerosis came to me and said:
 "I'm gonna break my fast tomorrow too and I'm going
to leave next saturday when my friends leave"

00:04:58.453 --> 00:05:06.129
and I pleaded with her not to do that, because 
I was confident that would not be in her best interest

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:13.330
but she wouldn't be persuaded, she missed her
 husband and she wanted to go home, and importantly 
she said to me:

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:19.929
"I came here because I had no mental clarity, and I'm 
now thinking more clearly than I have for at least

00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:23.643
10 years, I completely accomplished 
what I wanted to accomplish"

00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:32.934
my response to her was that, 
let me ilustrate it for you. We've all heard about 
the straw that breaks the camel's back

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:41.595
So if we imagine there is a camel that one last straw, 
maybe the 10.000, who knows, 
the straws on the camel's back caves in,

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:50.555
if the camel's back had a spring in it and could pop
 that up, if we took one straw off at 
that point, what would happen?

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:59.367
it would go right back to where it was before.
 I explained to the woman, to this client with MS
 that her symptoms were perhaps only 

00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:09.058
one straw away from returning,
although she was thinking as clear as ever
that maybe she wanted to keep going so that 

00:06:09.093 --> 00:06:17.014
she could take as many straws off the camel's
 back as possible, again, she wouldn't be persuaded.
She broke her fast, she went home, 

00:06:17.049 --> 00:06:25.431
she was doing great, she was thinking clearly.
What happened though was that over the 
following 2 o 3 months, and maybe her choices 

00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:32.075
weren't optimal, whatever it was, 
about 3 months later she sent me an email, 
she said: "Loren, now I understand what you

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:39.783
were trying to tell me", she said:
 "my symptoms have come back, my back was like it
 was before, not as bad but has come back to certain

00:06:39.818 --> 00:06:47.590
 extent that I realise I should have fasted longer",
 and she winded up coming back about a year 
after her first fast, and she completed a second fast

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:56.907
 as intended, and until these days, 4 o 5 years later,
 she has been doing fantastically well, thinking clearly,

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.677
functioning as well as possible,
because when she got home that second time,

00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:07.164
having had that first experience she followed
the coaching that she got about maintaining

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.379
an optimal diet, and the other lifestyle
choices as well as possible.

00:07:11.414 --> 00:07:18.687
Having seen this 3, just talking about these 3
particular people with Multiple Sclerosis,

00:07:18.722 --> 00:07:24.637
I'm confident that almost anybody now,
it's entirely possible that someone has a condition,

00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:31.001
any condition that progressed long enough
and has deteriorated enough, maybe there

00:07:31.036 --> 00:07:38.227
will be some aspect that is not completely reversible,
but we never know who or when that's gonna be.

00:07:38.373 --> 00:07:44.697
I approach every situation as if our amazing body
can completely cleanse and heal itself,

00:07:44.732 --> 00:07:52.209
if it's given the opportunity,
and MS and almost every other so-called
incurable disease are no exception,

00:07:52.244 --> 00:07:56.079
the body can handle these things
if it has the right opportunities.

00:07:56.114 --> 00:07:59.355
If you or someone you know is
dealing with Multiple Sclerosis,

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:05.176
you may want to consider finding a place
where you feel comfortable with it,

00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:09.627
that you believe in and that you trust,
and go and do a supervised water-only fast,

00:08:09.662 --> 00:08:19.089
because there is no more powerful way with this
or any condition to allow your body to be in conditions
in which it used to cleanse and heal itself. Thanks
