00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.660
We'll finish our scarf by cutting a fringe
and knotting it. You want to take a nice sharp

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:16.070
scissor and cut about 2 1/2 to 3 inches up
the edge of the scarf. Do not cut too close

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.460
to where the last slit of the weaving comes
out. Because you don't want it to rip through.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.939
You want to keep the distances about a half
inch away from any other slit. And just cut

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.109
right up straight about 2 1/2 to 3 inches.
Okay? And then we'll knot the ends and we'll

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:48.530
tie our woven in piece into the knotted ends.
So just for now just push it out of the way

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.229
and slip that out. Okay. Now to knot it we're
going to do a simple square knot. We'll start

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.989
with the end that has the coordinating fabric
sticking out. Our woven fabric. Put your coordinating

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:09.030
fabric together with one of the fringe pieces
and hold it as one and then we'll just do

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:20.560
a simple knot with the red over the black.
And then red over black again. And pull that

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.490
tight. Okay. That's your fringe. Now move
down to the next section. You just have the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.570
green and the black. You're going to go green
over black. Pull it tight. And then green

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.850
over black again. And pull that tight. And
just continue all the way down the edge of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:52.210
the scarf. Now you'll see as you're doing
this that it kind of gets tight and bunchy?

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.219
Don't worry about that, we'll stretch it out
in the end. Just pull it nice tight knots

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.259
so they don't come out. And do a consistent
knot in all the way down. Try to do your knot

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:13.900
the same way each time. Green over black.
And green over black. Okay. Now when you'll

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.330
see, see it's a little bunchy? Just give that
a little tug. You might even hear a little

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.530
bit of stretching going on there and that's
fine. And continue on to the end of the scarf.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.560
We finished our no sew fleecy scarf. If you
want to add a flower or some other kind of

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.550
decoration take a look at our pillow section
to find out how to do that.
