Hi, I'm David Clemen on behalf of Expert Village
and today we're going to learn the basics

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.289
of drawings. Now that I've given you some
basic drawing techniques and tools we...and

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.930
we've done some doodling and freestyling had
a little bit of fun. We're going to get a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.950
little bit more advanced and we're going to
try a still life. So, I've set up here on

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.171
my table this little plaster Paris sculpture
that I made in high school. This is a small

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:31.490
book here and then we've got a wooden giraffe.
His name is Jeffery. I don't really know if

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.960
it's Jeffery but we're going to use him. So,
what I'm going to do is I'm going to...this

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.629
is where we can apply the gesture drawing
technique. Basically before I go to a final

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.520
drawing I just want to kind of lay out what
this...the book, and the sculpture, and the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.089
giraffe is giving me and kind of get where
I want to lay everything out. These are the

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.049
straight lines that we practiced in warm up.
Just go in here. And I'm just...all I'm trying

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.100
to do is get the gesture right now, I'm not...see
this is a sphere I can just bust out into

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.501
my spiral technique get that there and now
drop a straight line here do my spiral technique,

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:15.400
go here. So this is kind of an odd shaped
sculpture but see if I kind of look at in

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.970
the spiral technique, I see that it kind of
wraps around and gets bigger and it gets smaller.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.640
So, all I'm going to do is go in here just
kind of pick out the shape and it's got a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.310
big knot up there but it goes back. Got a
knot here like this o.k. now the way I've

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.530
drawn it on this page I'm really only going
to get up to the chest of the giraffe but

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.660
that's alright cause see I'm doing a concept
drawing. I'm just doing a gesture to see if

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.720
I like the composition of this particular
drawing. Now that I've done that I'm going

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.580
to just...remember how we drew Woody the Wooden
Doll over here. We're doing the same thing.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.950
We're basically kind of tracing it to get
our lines on the back of the giraffe and how

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.890
his legs are structured. See an animals legs
are not too different from a humans legs.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.530
They kind of connect here at the hip. They
get down, they get bigger then they get smaller

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.830
to the knee. You can apply it in lots of different
cases. O.k. and so now that I've got the gesture

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:26.410
if I want to add in Jeffery's jubilee of jumbo
spots I can and see all of a sudden, I have

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.940
gesture drawing of this still life and that's
the beginning of still life drawing.
