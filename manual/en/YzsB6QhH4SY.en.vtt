00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.650
You can freeze raw foods.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.600
It does break down the food a little more.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.810
Does, I believe kill some of the enzymes.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.180
But it's still going to be raw.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.660
So, it's kind of a half and half.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.150
It's not something you want to do often in
my opinion because it does get rid of some

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.150
of the nutrients.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.701
If you look at the nutrients of any frozen
food it's going to be less than a fresh, off

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.640
the farm food.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.590
You want to freeze sparingly.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.500
But there are definitely techniques that you
can use to create culinary interest by freezing.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.120
For instance, you can freeze a lot of desserts.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:59.200
You can make cheesecakes out of nuts and a
sweetener like dates and create awesome desserts.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.770
It kind of depends on how perfect a diet you
want.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.040
I'm big on the belief that you want to make
it fun.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.230
You don't want to be so strict that you get
bored with it.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.040
No matter how perfect you eat I've got news,
you're still going to die.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
You know, it's like, it's not that it's going
to make you live forever.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.760
It's going to make you live a long time and
without health problems.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.500
But you still want to enjoy it.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.380
The one I do the most as I said was frozen
desserts.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.180
I do mousse, chocolate mousse, key lime pie.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.860
Things like that work great frozen.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.200
But you don't want to use your everyday stuff.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.450
You certainly don't want to freeze like your
leafy greens and that kind of thing.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.610
They're just not going to hold up well.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.160
But if you're just freezing nuts and seeds
and then it's going to be fine to freeze some

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.160
of it.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.340
But, keep it to a minimum when you freeze.
