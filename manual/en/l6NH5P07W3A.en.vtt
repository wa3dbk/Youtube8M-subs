00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.430
Simply that just three words to sum up
last season Paris Saint-Germain

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.700
they won the league once again they won

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.830
also the League Cup which was the first
domestic double in the in the history

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.460
Ibrahimovic was named player of the
season. But Monaco gave them a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.660
a bit of a run as well and so was Lille
at least until Christmas

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.160
James Rodriguez was a 
great player from monaco

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.090
especially after Falcao got injured
in January which was a shame because

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.769
we would have liked to have seen Monaco
with Falcao and James Rodriguez through

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.730
whole season. This season once again
will be PSG

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.820
against the rest of the country's a
simple as the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.649
They haven't lost any of their big players

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.640
in Paris, Ibrahimovic is still there, Cavani is still there, Thiago SIlva is still there

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.420
Verratti still there.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.550
And they've added as well, David Luiz

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.910
from Chelsea on massive deal of Â£50 million
pounds

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.739
They've added Serge Aurier the very promising
Ivory Coast right back, came on loan from

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.100
from Toulouse. And in the meantime Monaco have lost James Rodriguez

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.189
Marseille are in all construction and
the new manager

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.100
Marcelo Bielsa, Lyon have lost Bafetimbi Gomis

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.189
who was one of their best strikers.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.180
Lille were the big surprise of last
season

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.740
and they've kept more or less the same squad
going into the season

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.090
but you wonder if there were just a one season wonder. 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.509
The other very interesting thing in France the season is the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.630
we've got seven clubs who changed
manager in the summer, some of them

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.150
are giving new manager the first
experience

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.840
you know as head coach. For example Bastia have appointed Claude Makalele the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.329
former Chelsea midfielder who was assistant at
PSG and they're both Laurent Blanc

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.070
and Carlod Ancelotti

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.939
but now decided I was his time to be number one and it will be very interesting

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:47.970
to see how does at Bastia.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.990
It's the same for Willy Sangol the former Bayern Munich defender

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.250
and France defender who 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.280
was named us head coach for Bordeaux
this summer and again he's arrived

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.290
fresh new ideas exactly like Makalele
at Bastia and it will be very interesting to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.310
see what kind of football his team plays,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.440
how he develops as as a as a head coach.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.360
In terms of transfers this summer in France once
again

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.530
it's all about Paris Saint-Germain they have signed two big players

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.610
one especially is David Luiz from
Chelsea

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.950
in a $50 million pound is just before
the World Cup as well.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.020
You know considering financial fair play
hit

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.640
PSG quite hard, only allowing
them to do one big transfer

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.910
up to 60 million pounds and after that
having to sell before buying.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.629
They put all you know their eggs in the same
basket with David Luiz,

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.629
you could see especially, after we saw in 
the World Cup that it's a bit risky

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.840
however Laurent Blanc sees Luiz as a
partnership

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.209
with Thiago Silva and not just a play on
his own, they're both in because they

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.459
think him and Silva

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.610
have the potential to be the biggest partnership at center half

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.500
you know in the whole of Europe. The other big transfer for PSG is Serge Aurier 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.099
the Ivory Coast right back, who was at Toulouse
and had to come on loan because of  financial

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.629
fair play because PSG couldn't afford to
buy him

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.650
and balance their books, which is quite
interesting. The third one

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.780
now is a bit special one is Divock Origi the the Belgian striker. Who left Lille

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.420
and then came back, I think it was very
important for Lille and for French football

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.659
to be able to keep him and I thinkLiverpool understood that

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.970
he's going to play Champions League football with Lille so he's going to continue his progress

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.500
and continue to improve in the
French league, instead of coming so early

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.239
in the Premier League with Liverpool.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.830
With emerging talent in France in Ligue 1,  now gone for the first one to Monaco and Anthony Martial

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.600
who is a strike who's only 18 had some good moments, good games
last season

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.700
scored a few important goal, then go injured,

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.049
and in the last six months it was a bit tougher for him. However is a fantastic

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.810
talent is like Thierry Henry

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.750
at the same age, he's got pace, is very
good in front of goal, he's got skills

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.989
he makes good runs, he's a clever player
and I think  

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.330
he's is probably by far the most
promising of all the young strikers we've got.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.220
For the second player I've gone another striker

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.500
who's a bit older, just one year older, he's
19, he's called Neal Maupay

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.340
He plays for Nice, is half French, half Argentinian, he's exactly like David Trezeguet in a way,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.970
and he was the second youngest
player in France to score in Ligue 1

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.800
at just before 17. Again his progress has been
slown down by injuries last season

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.200
but I expect him to be fully fit and very strong this
this year coming with Nice.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.250
Another player to watch for next season
in France is Paul-Georges Ntep the Rennes

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.100
offensive midfielder, he signed six months ago from second division club Auxuerre.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.180
and in the last six months made a massive
impact in the team,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.960
scored five goals in the League in 10 appearances. He's a very strong player

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.190
he can play on the wing, he can play behind the striker

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.090
he's got a very good strike on the
ball, he's a clever player

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.300
he can create chances because of his
pace and of his skills but he also can finish.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.740
From a fans perspective I think this is a very important season

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.930
for one thing, first there's the momentum of the World Cup

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.150
that has been massive after what
happening in 2010

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.380
what happened in the Euro's in 2012 all those
problems I think

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.650
the the good World Cup by the French national
team has made

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.460
the French fans and the French public fall in love with football again, in a way

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.280
and and I think that the viewing figures
for you we look up wit when massive

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.009
and you can see the examiner after the
war kept people wanted the lead to start

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:24.289
so

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.930
almost soon as the water pennies people
would say okay now we're gearing up for

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.150
the

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.620
for the for the and I love the lord
thank Simon Khan from the water because

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.190

whatever I think it would have been at a
terrible Sunday

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.530
phones crushed again in the first one of
the work that body for me I've

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.259
another problem with with the squad with
players with attitude

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.570
even if from a big plays a flat like but
when I like hummus Rodrigo

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.820

incredible with a pipe wrench with

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.400
which was already a very beautiful stage
in life

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.009

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.340
step higher

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.410
angle for the semi-final may be defined
at the gym like and when I could do

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.530
and when I cook who will strengthen the
squad now that they've got the money

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.199
from the how much would be getting

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.050
expected to sign three for players club

interesting for the fans
