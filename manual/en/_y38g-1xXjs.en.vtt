00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.840
So you're somebody struggling, hitting chip
shots and pitch shots solid.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.700
You're getting an inconsistent contact, sometimes
thin, sometimes heavy.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.220
This can waste a lot of shots in a round of
golf.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.310
You're getting yourself getting caught up
in the technique, but it's simply not working.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.680
I want you to give this a try: Next time you're
on your short game area practicing or you've

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.290
missed a green, I want you to become more
aware, in your practice swings, of where your

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.290
low point is.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.820
We want the low point of your swing, where
you'll be brushing the grass, to be somewhere

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.500
int he center of your feet, where you'll be
positioning the ball.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.400
I think this is something elite players do
and professional players do instinctively,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.970
even if they're not aware of it.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.640
Yes, in their practice swings they're getting
a feeling for the speed of swing they need,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.760
but they're also getting a feeling of developing
the correct low point, where the golf ball

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.210
will be positioned.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.680
Maybe when you become a little more aware
of where your low point is you might start

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.930
to realize that your low point is too much
towards the right side.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.030
Now, instinctively, just trying to move your
low point more to the middle of your feet,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.549
your mechanics can change.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.030
Maybe you'll start with a little more weight
in your left foot, naturally, your left shoulder

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.120
will be a little lower.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.560
It will also stop you hanging back, trying
to lift the ball in the air, definitely a

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.580
cause of the low point being too much to the
right side.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.980
Maybe you'll become aware that your low point
is too much to the left, you're leaning into

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.980
the shot.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.550
Again, trying to make the low point more in
the center of your feet, instinctively start

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.740
to rotate through the shot better, creating
the correct low point.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.240
It's very important in your practice swings
to get a feeling of where your low point is,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.740
matching it to where your ball position will
be.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.920
So once you've got a feeling for this in your
practice swing, it's as simple as walking

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.370
into the shot and repeating that feeling.
