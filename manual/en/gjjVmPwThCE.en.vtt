00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.900
blackjack is one of the most common
games in the casino

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.250
but it's also one of the most dangerous
to your bankroll if you don't know the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.170
right way to play

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.860
once you've watched this video you'll be
familiar with all the rules

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.520
and you'll be ready to continue to our
next video explaining basic blackjack

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.369
strategy

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.859
but before we get to gameplay let's go
over a few basic concepts

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.600
in blackjack the goal is to beat the
dealer the player wins if his hand as a

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.279
higher value than the dealers without
going bust

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.519
the player also wins if the dealer busts
and the player doesn't

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.290
busting is when the total value of the
hand goes over 21

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.900
and when players bust they automatically
lose regardless of whether the dealer

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.790
busts as well

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.710
next you need to learn the card values
deuces through nines are all counted at

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.540
face value

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.820
while tens jacks queens and kings have
value of ten

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.440
aces can be either one or 11 so if
you're dealt an ace or a 5 your hand has

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.460
a value of six

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.519
or 16 the most powerful hand is an ace

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.070
any card with a value of ten this is
called a blackjack

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.619
if a player's dealt a blackjack they
automatically wins

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.180
unless the dealer also get a blackjack
in which case the hand is a push

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.439
now let's look at how a hand of
blackjack plays out

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.200
each hand begins with everyone getting
two cards

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.820
all cards are dealt face-up except for
the dealers last card which is dealt

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.630
face down

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.439
the players all have to act first and
have four options

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.490
hitting standing doubling down or
splitting a pair

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.049
hitting means you want another card and in
blackjack you always use hand signals to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.619
tell the dealer what you want to do

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.259
if you want to hit just tap the table in
front of your hand

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.450
players can take as many cards as they
want until they either stand

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.810
or go bust if you're happy with your
hand

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.990
just wave your hand over your cards to
tell the dealer you stand

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.049
on certain powerful hands you will want to
double down

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.469
doubling down means you make a second
bet equal to your first

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.909
and received one and only one more card
to tell the dealer you want to double down

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.749
just place your second bet right next to
the first one

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:10.770
if the players first two cards are a
pair

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.970
they have the option of splitting them
and playing two separate hands

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.220
to tell the dealer you want to split just
count out a second bet equal to your

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.140
first in place a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.140
outside at the batting box on the felt
the dealer will then split your pair

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.950
and you'll play out two separate hands
some casinos will offer you a separate bet

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.420
called insurance when the dealer is showing an ace

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.849
all you need to know about insurance is
that it's a bad bet and should always be

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.470
avoided

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.269
after all the players have finished building
their hands the dealer flips over there

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.870
down card and decides whether they
should hit or stand

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.709
whoever has the highest hand without
going over 21 wins

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.930
and a blackjack automatically wins
against everything except another

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.780
blackjack

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.920
winning bets pay out at one to one

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.689
unless the player wins with a blackjack
which pays out at 1.5 to 1

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.580
