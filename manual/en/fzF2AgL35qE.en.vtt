00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:06.673
- [Voiceover] A tonsillectomy
is removal of the tonsils.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.669
In fact, the name is actually
very straightforward.

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.254
- ectomy is a Latin
suffix, meaning removal.

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:17.828
So, a tonsillectomy is
removal of the tonsils.

00:00:17.828 --> 00:00:19.986
Now, when we refer to the tonsils,

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:23.006
we're specifically talking
about the palatine tonsils,

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.560
which, in this open-mouth view right here,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.671
you can see in the back of the mouth,

00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:30.854
just before we get into
the back of the throat.

00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:32.618
They kind of hide back here.

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:34.685
I have them colored in
this purplish-pink color,

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:36.310
but they're actually the same color

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.168
as the rest of the mouth.

00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:40.536
Actually, there's two sets of tonsils.

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:41.719
There's these, right here,

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.439
that are visible in the mouth.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.179
There's also tonsils that can be seen

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.038
through the nasal passage.

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:49.290
They're out of direct view from the mouth.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.702
When we refer to a tonsillectomy,
it's these tonsils,

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:55.582
the visible ones, that
we're talking about.

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:58.199
These are called the palatine tonsils.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:59.989
They're called the palatine tonsils

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.591
because they're somewhat related

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:04.494
to the roof of the mouth.

00:01:04.494 --> 00:01:05.607
The roof of the mouth, of course,

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.812
is also known as the palate.

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:10.641
But, if a tonsillectomy is
removal of these tonsils,

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:13.172
what is removal of these tonsils?

00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:17.400
These are actually referred
to as the adenoids.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.558
They have another name, known
as the pharyngeal tonsils,

00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:23.390
but they're most commonly
referred to as the adenoids.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.898
In fact, the removal of the adenoids

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.562
is known as an adenoidectomy.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.837
Commonly, many patients
get both the tonsils

00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:33.556
and the adenoids removed.

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:35.111
These are actually two procedures

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:36.272
done at the same time,

00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:39.031
a tonsillectomy and an adenoidectomy.

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.215
Wait a second.

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:42.583
You might actually be asking yourself,

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:44.812
"Well, aren't my tonsils important?

00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:46.693
"Why would I want to remove them?"

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:50.315
Sure, the tonsils are actually
a fairly important organ.

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:52.080
However, they're only important

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.843
when we're developing,
when we're very young.

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:58.442
When we're children, the tonsils
are actually fairly large.

00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:01.785
Their purpose is to act like little traps,

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:05.728
so when bacteria, or viruses,

00:02:05.728 --> 00:02:08.560
or any sort of microbe
gets into the mouth,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.045
or potentially through the nasal passage,

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:14.691
then the tonsils act as
a first line of defense.

00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:17.105
Tonsils are very vascular structures,

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:20.101
meaning that they have a lot
of blood vessels going to them.

00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:23.282
They also have a lot of
white blood cells in them.

00:02:23.282 --> 00:02:25.859
This is important because
if bacteria or viruses

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.435
get trapped on the surface of the tonsils,

00:02:28.435 --> 00:02:31.641
then the white blood cells
can respond accordingly.

00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:34.752
They're particularly
important when we're young,

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:35.865
as I said before,

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:38.605
because our immune system
is still developing.

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:41.392
As we get older, the tonsils
actually will shrink up,

00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:43.314
and shrivel to a smaller size.

00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:48.423
They may actually shrink
to become barely visible

00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:50.735
near the roof of the mouth.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:53.522
I like to think this is
because when we're young,

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:56.285
we're still looking for many
different types of bugs.

00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:58.466
But, once we're older,
we've already been exposed

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:01.184
to all these different bugs,
and these different microbes.

00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:03.831
So, we no longer need
the tonsils to inform

00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:05.549
the rest of the immune system

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.523
to get prepared for this bug,

00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:10.054
because our body has already
prepared in the past,

00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:12.185
and fought off an infection
similar to the one

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:14.345
that's now being presented.

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:17.874
Removal of the tonsils is not
the worst thing in the world.

00:03:17.874 --> 00:03:20.010
There are actually a lot
of really good reasons

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.262
that the tonsils should be removed.

00:03:22.262 --> 00:03:23.121
For example,

00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:25.990
some patients get tonsils
that are infected,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.965
over, and over, and over again.

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:29.846
This is chronic tonsillitis,

00:03:29.846 --> 00:03:32.466
chronic inflammation of the tonsils.

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:36.523
Patients who get frequent
tonsillitis, frequent infections,

00:03:36.523 --> 00:03:39.125
should actually have them removed.

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:40.750
In fact, frequent infections may mean that

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.675
the tonsils have become
colonized by a microbe.

00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:47.318
Thus, the removal can stop
these frequent infections.

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:49.776
Frequent infections is one.

00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:51.100
Along the same lines,

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.397
development of an abscess near the tonsils

00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:56.533
can be a reason for removal.

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:59.296
An abscess is a fluid-filled pocket,

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:01.432
and it's usually filled with bacteria

00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:03.405
and really nasty stuff.

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:04.957
If it's next to the tonsils,

00:04:04.957 --> 00:04:07.952
it's called a peritonsillar abscess.

00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:09.694
These abscesses can be dangerous,

00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:13.036
and can lead to more severe
illnesses, such as sepsis.

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:14.152
Sometimes, they can be drained

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:15.823
without removing the tonsils,

00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:18.076
but many times, this is not possible,

00:04:18.076 --> 00:04:21.320
so health practitioners
opt to remove the tonsils.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.295
Really, a final reason,

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:25.617
and it's kind of an umbrella reason,

00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:29.763
is if patients are having
difficulty breathing,

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.271
or difficulty eating,

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.198
the tonsils might be removed.

00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:37.921
The idea is the tonsils may
be obstructing the food,

00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:40.660
or obstructing proper breathing.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.866
For example, if you
look at these adenoids,

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:46.534
they might swell up to sizes
that are just way too big,

00:04:46.534 --> 00:04:50.013
and obstruct the flow of air
through the nasal passage.

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:52.213
Maybe when patients lie flat,

00:04:52.213 --> 00:04:54.907
they can't breathe air in as well.

00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:56.811
This sometimes leads to issues,

00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:59.388
such as obstructive sleep apnea,

00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:01.687
difficultly breathing while sleeping.

00:05:01.687 --> 00:05:04.125
Some patients who have
difficulty breathing

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:07.445
may have the adenoids
and the tonsils removed.

00:05:07.445 --> 00:05:10.157
Now, after the surgery,
people often wonder,

00:05:10.157 --> 00:05:12.734
"When can I actually eat?

00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:15.196
"When can I have that
nice, juicy burger again?

00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:18.487
"Or, maybe a delicious
salad, or grilled chicken."

00:05:18.487 --> 00:05:20.059
Well, it really depends on what

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:22.798
the health practitioner
or the surgeon says.

00:05:22.798 --> 00:05:25.097
But, generally it's about two weeks

00:05:25.097 --> 00:05:27.512
before a patient makes full recovery.

00:05:27.512 --> 00:05:29.601
Maybe 10 days to two weeks.

00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:31.552
Patients who actually
have a tonsillectomy,

00:05:31.552 --> 00:05:32.853
or adenoidectomy,

00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:35.198
often really don't care
about food right away.

00:05:35.198 --> 00:05:37.890
Oftentimes, the throat
may be painful or sore,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.376
or they may have jaw pain,

00:05:40.376 --> 00:05:43.626
or pain anywhere along
where the surgery was.

00:05:43.626 --> 00:05:45.646
Patients may also have ear pain, too.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:47.179
That's because the connection

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:50.738
between the nasal passage to
the ear, the auditory canal,

00:05:50.738 --> 00:05:52.951
is right next to where the adenoids are.

00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:54.043
It's right about here.

00:05:54.043 --> 00:05:55.547
So, patients may experience throat pain,

00:05:55.547 --> 00:05:58.241
jaw pain, ear pain, neck pain,

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:00.216
headache, any sort of symptom

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:02.150
that might be related to the head.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.518
All of these symptoms
are normal after surgery.

00:06:04.518 --> 00:06:07.305
Patients are encouraged
to take pain killers,

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:08.373
because patients may be

00:06:08.373 --> 00:06:10.969
in a good amount of pain after surgery.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.271
This is all normal. Having
this pain is normal.

00:06:13.271 --> 00:06:16.498
However, if patients develop
difficulty breathing,

00:06:16.498 --> 00:06:18.675
that's a very serious symptom.

00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:21.231
If a patient develops
difficulty breathing,

00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.623
it may be a sign that the
throat is swelling up,

00:06:23.623 --> 00:06:25.689
and swelling more than it should.

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.174
Since we all need air to breathe,

00:06:27.174 --> 00:06:30.937
it's important to contact a
health practitioner immediately.

00:06:30.937 --> 00:06:32.979
Otherwise, the throat may
start to get so swollen

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.269
that it closes and makes
breathing impossible.

00:06:36.804 --> 00:06:40.078
Another major complication
that can occur is bleeding.

00:06:40.078 --> 00:06:43.051
Because these tonsils are so vascular,

00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:45.768
or in other words, they have
a large blood supply to them,

00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:47.927
bleeding may occur after the surgery.

00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:49.729
A certain amount of bleeding is okay,

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.714
but if bleeding becomes active,

00:06:51.714 --> 00:06:53.246
and just doesn't seem to stop,

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.290
that's a complication that should also

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.773
be mentioned to a health practitioner.

00:06:57.773 --> 00:06:59.469
With that in mind, it's actually important

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.169
not to eat anything that's red.

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.670
Eating something, like
a cup of red Jell-O,

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.735
or a delicious watermelon ...

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.815
Even though these foods
are soft and easier to eat,

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:14.300
they should be avoided
because they are red,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.762
and may be mistaken for blood

00:07:15.762 --> 00:07:18.363
if a patient starts vomiting.

00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:20.332
Patients should avoid anything red.

00:07:20.332 --> 00:07:22.463
They need to avoid solid food.

00:07:22.463 --> 00:07:25.087
They should avoid anything
that's very citrusy,

00:07:25.087 --> 00:07:27.154
spicy, or hot.

00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:29.220
That glass of orange juice,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.048
or that bottle of hot
sauce, should be avoided.

00:07:32.048 --> 00:07:34.347
When I say hot, I don't
mean just spicy food.

00:07:34.347 --> 00:07:36.970
Hot beverages should
actually be avoided, too.

00:07:37.476 --> 00:07:39.382
All of these foods should be avoided.

00:07:39.874 --> 00:07:42.081
Again, if these directions are followed,

00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:44.217
patients are generally expected to recover

00:07:44.217 --> 00:07:46.214
two weeks after the surgery.

00:07:46.214 --> 00:07:48.373
Again, always check with
the health practitioner,

00:07:48.373 --> 00:07:50.508
or surgeon, that's doing the surgery,

00:07:50.508 --> 00:07:52.481
and follow their directions.
