Hi Gang!
Here's a 3D printed sprocket that I both designed

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.509
and printed.
I made it for my sparking bike.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.820
It's turned by this chain,
so that it can turn the disks of this Wimshurst

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.139
machine
which creates the sparks.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.740
In this video I'll show you the steps that I went
through

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.400
to make that 3d printed sprocket.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.720
I first looked online on websites like thingiverse.com
and sure enough there were some there.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.290
But I wanted to try my hand at designing my
own.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.580
So using Blender 2.71,
a free 3D modelling and animation software

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.119
that I use a lot,
I drew up the sprocket.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.140
In the Scene panel I set the Units to Metric
to keep things easy.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.920
And then I set the scale to 0.001.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.590
I used the smallest sprocket on the back wheel
of my bike

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.760
to get all the measurements.
As you can see it's a fairly simple part,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.250
with a nice flat bottom and no overhanging
pieces.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.170
The underlying mesh is also fairly simple.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.960
When it was ready, I exported it as an .STL
file.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.480
I did my printing at the University of Ottawa's
Makerspace,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.149
and the printers there are various versions
of MakerBot's Replicators.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.659
I opened my .STL file in the MakerBot program.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.130
I next brought up the Settings window.
The Infill is how much of the inside is filled

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.170
in.
Here's what it did with my selection of 50%

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.219
Infill.
This saves on plastic and printing time.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.329
Since it was a sprocket, I wanted at least
50%, for strength.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.170
But even more important I think was this Number
of Shells.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.319
That's this outline of material it puts here.
As you can see,

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.969
that just happens to fill in the teeth of
the sprocket,

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.189
making them strong.
4 shells seemed to work well.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.350
That's all I modified
so the next step was to bring up the Export

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.779
window.
That calculates an estimate for how long

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:40.649
it'll take to print.
If it's too long then you can go back

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.810
and change the settings for less infill and
so on.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.700
When I exported it, it created an .X3G file,
which I put on an SD card to put on the printer.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.700
It starts by printing some bottom layers,
called a raft.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.509
Once the raft is done, it starts on the actual
part, my sprocket.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.529
Notice the 4 shells being laid down, along
with the infill.

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:06.939
And after a while
it gets working on the part which the shaft

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.349
will go through.
Until finally, it's done.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.069
The whole thing is stuck to the bed but once
it's removed,

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.400
I can take it home and work on it some more.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.500
The first thing is to remove the raft
and extra material from the bottom.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.720
Then I have to sand the teeth.
Both sides need to be sanded,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.060
while constantly checking the fit in the chain.
But after around 15 minutes sanding, it fits

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.480
great.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.120
Next I drill out the hole through the middle
a little more,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.600
so that my bolt goes on with a tight fit,
not requiring anything else to grip on.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.280
And there's the finished sprocket.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.319
I then remove the old crank from the Wimshurst
machine

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.250
and put on the sprocket.
It works!

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.019
Once it's on the bike,
I put on the chain.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.539
And once it's outdoors, you can see the end
result works great!

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.340
Well, thanks for watching!

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.659

That includes the one where I show more of
my sparking bike in action,

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.579
and more on how I did it all.
Another on using a Peltier module to do thermoelectric

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.379
cooling.
And one on using Nitinol wire, a shape memory

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:14.480
alloy.
