00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.850
HE WAS THE FUNNIEST GUY I'VE

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.120
IT'S GOING TO BE HELL TRYING TO

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.820

HE'S A LOVABLE PERSON, LIKE

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.730
LIKE I REMEMBER THIS MORNING I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.630

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.400

HE WAS A STANDOUT STUDENT, AN

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.950
ATHLETE HERE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.
