00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.984
- So what exactly is the central
dogma of molecular biology?

00:00:06.524 --> 00:00:08.335
Well, really it could just be called

00:00:08.335 --> 00:00:11.854
the central dogma of all
of life because it explains

00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:13.976
how you and I take this conglomeration

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:16.810
of genetic information
from each of our parents,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.231
and how this information
gets transferred into

00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.190
generating a full-blown
human being, like you and me.

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:25.773
So some very clever scientists,

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:28.201
Francis Crick and James Watson,

00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:31.538
or "Watson and Crick," as
they're often referred to as,

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:34.239
are credited with discovering this dogma,

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.059
which they say deals with the detailed

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.611
residue-by-residue transfer
of sequential information.

00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:42.374
Or, as Marshall Nirenberg,
who won the Nobel Prize

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:44.866
in Physiology and Medicine, once said,

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.886
"DNA makes RNA makes protein."

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:51.809
And I think this simple explanation
really just says it all.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.232
So let's explore this
concept a little bit further.

00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:56.368
So we have three major players here.

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:59.347
DNA and RNA are nucleic acids,

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:02.032
which are made up of nucleotides,

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:06.142
and proteins are made up of amino acids.

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:08.449
And the information starts
at the most basic level

00:01:08.449 --> 00:01:12.768
stored as DNA, which can
then be re-stored as DNA

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:17.311
when DNA copies itself in a
process called "replication."

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.818
Then DNA can be copied into RNA

00:01:19.818 --> 00:01:22.616
in a process called "transcription."

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:25.506
And then finally you can
use the information in RNA

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:29.808
to synthesize a protein in a
process called "translation."

00:01:30.532 --> 00:01:35.345
Now since DNA, RNA, and
protein are linear polymers,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.913
this means that each
individual unit, or monomer,

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:42.495
is only attached to, at
most, two other units.

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:46.991
So say we have a monomer,
which is just one unit.

00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:50.314
They are connected in a series like this,

00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:53.703
which makes it a linear
polymer, and this is the same

00:01:53.703 --> 00:01:58.237
for DNA if each of these
is a deoxyribonucleic acid,

00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:01.364
for RNA if it's a ribonucleic acid,

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:03.911
or a protein, which are just amino acids

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:06.070
all connected in a linear polymer.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.617
So what does this mean?

00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:09.382
This means that the specific sequence

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:12.757
of each of these monomers
effectively encodes information,

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:15.134
and that that transfer of
information is faithfully

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:19.803
preserved from DNA to RNA to protein.

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:22.447
Each polymer sequence
is used as a template

00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:25.648
for the synthesis of the next polymer.

00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:29.514
And you could go into any
step in this sequence and

00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:32.834
determine what the corresponding
polymers would look like.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:36.339
So in other words, you
could take DNA and obviously

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.863
figure out what the corresponding
RNA would look like,

00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:42.453
and then what the corresponding
protein would look like.

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:46.373
So this whole process
is the central dogma.

00:02:46.464 --> 00:02:48.987
It can sometimes be a
little bit tricky to keep

00:02:48.987 --> 00:02:51.943
all of these terms straight,
so I'll try to break it down

00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:54.661
a little bit for how I
like to remember them.

00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:56.372
For DNA, I think it's pretty easy.

00:02:56.372 --> 00:02:58.156
When you go from DNA, and DNA makes

00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:00.922
a copy of itself, it's called replication

00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:03.105
because DNA is just replicating itself.

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:05.848
It's making the same copy of itself.

00:03:06.293 --> 00:03:08.251
Transcription and translation,
on the other hand,

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:11.245
it's kind of easy to get
these two terms mixed up.

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:15.224
One of them obviously is
talking about DNA to RNA,

00:03:15.224 --> 00:03:16.718
whereas the other one is talking about

00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:18.961
going from RNA to protein.

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:22.808
So if you look at the word
transcription, it has the word

00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:27.438
"script" in it, so I think
of it as going from one

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:30.795
written form to another
kind of written form,

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:34.770
and both use nucleic
acid, so they both use

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.456
this sort of alphabet, if
you will, of nucleic acids.

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:41.739
And so you're just going
from one kind of alphabet

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.854
to the next kind of alphabet.

00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:47.871
Translation, on the other hand,
which is also the same term

00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:51.656
that we use when translating
one language to another,

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:55.449
describes going from
nucleic acid to amino acid,

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.792
so it's like you're using
one kind of language

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:00.379
and going to another kind of language,

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.901
because you're going from
nucleic acid building blocks

00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:05.642
to amino acid building blocks.

00:04:05.642 --> 00:04:07.149
So hopefully that helps you keep

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:09.373
these terms straight a little bit.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.282
So what did we learn
about the central dogma?

00:04:12.282 --> 00:04:15.246
Just remember the simple statement that

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:20.166
DNA makes RNA, which makes protein.
