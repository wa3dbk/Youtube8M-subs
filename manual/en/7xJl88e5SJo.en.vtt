Hi.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.900
I'm Sarah from SewingMastery.com and we are
going to open up a brand new Husqvarna Viking

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.440
serger, the S-21.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.789
Now with these videos, we're going to do a
video on every page of the manual so they're

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.080
going to be nice and short and sweet and you
can go to the one you need right away and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.760
come back later to the other ones that will
help you in the future.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.610
Now if you own a serger of a different brand
or a different model, these videos are fairly

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.370
generic so they will help you.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.180
Take a look around and see what you can learn
about your sergers.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.630
You know, so many times people say, "Oh, sergers
are so hard to thread."

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.829
Eh, I'd say just by knowing how your serger
works, it's going to make it so much easier

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.030
to use.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.200
Let's start by actually opening up the serger
and seeing what comes with it.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.829
This machine is both a serger and a cover
stitch machine so there's going to be some

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.010
extra parts in here that we'll save for our
cover stitch videos.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.219
First off on the top we have some assembly
required.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.999
This is the spool holder for the back of the
serger.

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:15.740
We have the little tree that is going to attach
in that small little area and place our threads,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.369
so we'll come back to that.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.020
Then we have a tread catcher.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.399
This will slip underneath the serger.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.299
We also have some of those cover stitch parts.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.969
They're kind of all sitting down inside these
little cubbies on top of the serger.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.659
A box of accessories which we'll go through
all of them.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.740
We have a foot control and power cord up here,
some spool holders so we'll put those around

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.740
there.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.399
This is actually a clear dust cover kind of
all rolled up down here.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.719
These are going to look like of funny but
these are legs for a sewing table.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:02:02.360
In the side over here there is ... I'm going
to take this styrofoam off first.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.509
This is a slide-on table.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.270
The legs will go on and really give you a
wonderful work surface.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.250
That alone is worth a lot when you actually
buy this serger.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.260
We have a little DVD.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.330
That's nice because because it will show you
nice and up close some extra threading.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.650
Then you have your manual and warranty cards.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.610
I'm going to just slip the little CD in there.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:35.020
Our serger should be, yup, ready to come on
out and here she is.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.670
Next we're going to go ahead and get through
the accessories, how to get some of those

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.830
items attached and we'll get into threading
and then all the stitches that are available

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.890
that you can do on this Husqvarna Viking S-21
serger.
