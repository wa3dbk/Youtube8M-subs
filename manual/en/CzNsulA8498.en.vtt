Welcome!  In this tutorial, we'll look at how to 
search against scripture citations in the ATLA 
Religion Database with ATLAS 

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:11.066
using the Scriptures Tool on the EBSCOhost 
platform.

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:17.033
Let’s start by looking at how scripture citations 
are assigned so that we understand what we are 
searching.  

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:25.000
ATLA indexers create scripture citations for 
article, book, essay, and multimedia records 
that: 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.033
•  feature an academic treatment of a given 
passage AND

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.066
•  refer to scripture at the chapter or verse level.

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:35.033
The citations follow the structure and 
organization of the Revised Standard Version of 
the Bible.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:41.033
Now let’s look at how to search against these 
scripture citations.  

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:45.066
There are many ways to enter a scripture 
reference into a search query.  

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:48.000
With all the variation in citation formats,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
it’s not always clear which one we should use to 
get the best results.  

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.033
The Scriptures Tool helps us avoid this problem.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:02.000
It searches within ranges of biblical chapters 
and verses, and doesn't require you to know

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the form of the scripture citation heading you are 
trying to search.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:20.066
To see how it works, we'll access the Scriptures 
Tool by clicking on the "Scriptures" button in the 
upper toolbar of the EBSCOhost interface.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:25.033
That button takes us to a list of the books of the 
Bible displayed in canonical order.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:35.066
This list is hierarchical; you can browse through 
the names of the books and use the expand 
option to drill down from the book, 

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.033
to the chapter,   

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.000
and to the verse.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.066
You can also execute a search within any level 
of the list by clicking on the book name,

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.033
chapter number,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.066
or verse number.

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:06.033
To search for materials on Deuteronomy 6:4, for 
example, click on the "expand" option next to 
Deuteronomy.

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:12.033
Then click on the "expand" option next to 
chapter 6,

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:18.033
and then click on "verse 4."  You'll then see a 
screen displaying your search results.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:28.000
When we take a closer look at some of these 
search results, we see that we have records 
where Deuteronomy 6:4 is present in the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.033
scripture citation field,

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:38.000
and others where Deuteronomy 6:4 doesn't 
appear directly in the record, but falls within the 
range of chapters and verses in the heading.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If we want to narrow or broaden our search, we 
can use Boolean operators and add additional 
terms to the search fields at the top of the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
search results page.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We can also click on the "Show More" link in 
the left hand column and adjust the search 
limiters.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:20.033

related searching in ATLA's databases, we hope
