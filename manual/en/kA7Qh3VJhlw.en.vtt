00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:03.834
(♪ Light Music ♪)

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.834
T-shirts are all the rage
in fashion for teens these days

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:12.433
and I want to show you
some real simple projects

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:14.934
you can make using T-shirts,
whether they're recycled

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:16.567
or whether they're purchased
at Michaels.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.834
The first one
is this trendy T-shirt.

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:20.667
You'd find them in all
the stores right now,

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.633
but they're very simple
to make.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.300
I started by cutting off
the sleeves

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.967
and simply cutting a fringe.

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:27.734
This is how you do it:

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:30.767
You just cut off the hem
of the sleeve

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:32.934
and that will kind of let
the T-shirt curl

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:34.633
and give a nice smooth look.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.000
And then you will begin
by the fringe.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.300
And to keep it nice
and straight,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.633
the best way is to find
the point in which you want it

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.734
to hang on your body
and create a line,

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.633
and just draw it
with a pencil,

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:45.934
right across the T-shirt.

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:47.200
Once you found your line,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.166
you might draw a straight line
down the middle,

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.600
and that is your point
you will begin cutting.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.033
I like to cut the hem
off the bottom too

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.133
because it will help
the T-shirt curl

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.967
when you pull the strings
after they've all been cut.

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:01.734
A nice sharp scissors
works great for this project.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.433
and once you have it
all marked,

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:05.533
you will begin
by following your line

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:09.633
and cutting nice and straight,
up to the point you have marked

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.700
as the mid-point
on the T-shirt.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.934
We'll continue across
the T-shirt on both sides

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.934
trying to keep your lines
as straight as possible.

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:19.767
Now, if you're experienced
with cutting,

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:21.433
you could go use
a rotary cutter,

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:24.000
but I would say most teens
are using the scissors.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.834
You simply will cut
your entire shirt into fringes,

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:29.133
and once you're finished,
you will go back

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.166
and you will pull this.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.233
And, look, you have
a totally different look

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:33.266
than you did cry prior.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.667
Once you have finished
cutting the entire T-shirt

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.100
and you've pulled
on each string,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.200
you will get this trendy look
that you see in all the stores.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.567
This T-shirt
is really fun.

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:45.233
You can add beads
if you wanted to accent it.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:46.767
You could trim off the arms

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.066
and you could cut it to make it
a sleeveless shirt.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.767
That's one of the fun projects.

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:53.934
The other one is just as easy,
and it's making this necklace.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:57.066
It's taking a strip of T-shirt
that you cut off the bottom.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.934
So you've started
with a tube of T-shirt,

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.767
you cut it open
and you begin to stretch it

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.600
to create these long strings.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.400
All you to do is tie
the strings together

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.633
to create one long rope.

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:10.367
Once you've tied
the strings together,

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:11.967
I'll just show you with two,

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:16.066
we'll then loop it around
to get the size you would like.

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.133
Like that.

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:20.133
We'll trim these sides off
and you will find any charm

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.967
you would like and you will use
another piece of T-shirt

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:26.100
to tie it on to the bottom
of the necklace.

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:29.066
So that's the beginning step.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.567
This is what it would
look like when finished.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.667
Trim up your ends and you have
a real funky T-shirt.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:34.767
I used tie-dye,
you could use a solid color,

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:37.066
you could use
a recycled pattern shirt.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.133
Lastly, the same concept
is done

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.133
by taking another string
of T-shirt,

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.934
tying it together,
adding a couple of beads,

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:45.934
the wood beads work best
because they're the biggest.

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:48.133
Just wrapping it around
your wrist for a bracelet.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.834
These are three very
simple T-shirt ideas,

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:53.266
and I'd love to see
your ideas on Facebook.
