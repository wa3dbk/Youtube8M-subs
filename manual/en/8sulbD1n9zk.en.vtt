- Hey what's up you guys?
This is NovakTutorials.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.857
Today I thought I'd do my
first kind of real Review,

00:00:14.857 --> 00:00:18.369
because I know I've done App
Reviews before, and I'm gonna

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.164
do more of those, don't worry.
But this is just kind of a

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:24.753
video where I wanted to 
make my first real review,

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:28.668
of a real item. So here in 
this first one, I'm going to

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:32.736
talk about this beautiful
camera. There will be a link

00:00:32.736 --> 00:00:36.187
in the description, where you
can go and you can buy this.

00:00:36.187 --> 00:00:40.037
Or you can just go to your 
local store, it should be there.

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:50.043
It has 10.2 Megapixels. It
has 5x Zoom Lense, that looks

00:00:50.043 --> 00:01:00.252
kind of like this. And 
it has this theme tune.

00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:03.016
So you can see, it looks kind
of like this, and when you

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:10.117
turn it off it goes in. Now this,
it's a pretty good camera.

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:16.040
But it's, it's mostly for
taking pictures. It's not so much

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.347
doing videos. I mean you can
shoot a video but, it's not

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.659
gonna be as good quality, as
it's gonna be with pictures.

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:25.833
Actually not that good quality.
So, that's why I bought

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:29.624
this camera, your looking at
right now. So I'm about to show

00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.463
you a video, where I talk in
the background, and you get to

00:01:32.463 --> 00:01:35.680
see what things this 
camera can actually do.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.432
And how good it is, so enjoy
and you get to see how good

00:01:41.432 --> 00:01:45.072
quality it shoots. In the end
of the video, there will be

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:49.354
a little video where I'm
shooting with this camera.

00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:52.973
And there will also be a picture,
you get to see the difference

00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:56.208
between picture and video, and
you get to see how it shoots.

00:01:56.674 --> 00:02:00.624
So I just wanted to say that,
and enjoy the video, here we go.

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:06.111
So this camera. Pretty good 
actually, it shoots pretty good.

00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:14.601
We're gonna just turn it on. And
this pops out like I showed you.

00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:30.726
Now, you will see a pretty
shitty quality, but it actually

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:35.166
shoots pretty good. So when
you have to take a picture you

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:41.386
shoot up here, press it hold
it down. Take a picture, and

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:46.935
it makes this sound. And you
can zoom, by clicking this and

00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:55.515
this. And here you can go
to the menu. And you can click

00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:58.887
around in the menu, here and 
here and here and all of these.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:04.974
You can go to your videos,
by clicking this button.

00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:08.718
And you can delete them by 
clicking this, and go to yes.

00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:13.242
So, we're just gonna 
turn it off for a second.

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.957
I'm gonna show you the details.
Like I said, it was a 5x

00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:22.869
camera zoom lense. But the
cool thing is, that there are

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:28.625
actually details on it. And
this might sound a little nerdy,

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:47.622
but hang along. It's 4.9-24.5 
mm and 1:3.5-5.9 27 mm.

00:03:47.622 --> 00:03:51.704
And that basicly says, that
it's pretty good zooming.

00:03:51.704 --> 00:03:55.826
So this is basicly for zooming.
It's for taking pictures.

00:03:55.826 --> 00:04:02.238
So yeah, it's a pretty 
good camera. I'd give it probably

00:04:02.238 --> 00:04:04.967
4 out of 5 stars, because it
could be a little better but

00:04:06.272 --> 00:04:08.688
you have to consider,
that this only cost'...

00:04:08.688 --> 00:04:14.323
I don't know, I bought for like
250 dollars, so it's not that

00:04:14.323 --> 00:04:17.507
expensive. (get it for 70 
below!) So that's also why.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:21.497
So I'm giving it 4 out of 5
stars. So right now I'm about to

00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:24.777
show you the video where 
I shoot with this camera.

00:04:24.777 --> 00:04:31.454
So enjoy, Subscribe all of that
for more Reviews in the future.

00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:34.197
And leave a comment telling me,
if you think I did this good

00:04:34.197 --> 00:04:36.667
or bad. (read more about
it below!) So, here we go.

00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:40.183
(Picture 720p 10.2 MP Quality)

00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:50.402
(Video 480p bad quality)
