00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Wak: Let's first look around inside. And don't run, just walk.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
?: Except when we run away.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Wak: Hold the torches.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Wak: Hey sit down. 
?: Let's crawl. 
Wak: No just sit down.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Wak: Leave the gate open. Otherwise we may get into trouble when we run away, lol.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Wak: Let's start our journey then.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
?: There's something on the right. 
??: We can't mine them, can we?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
?: Oh it's very smooth.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Wak: Yeah things like these. We can mine them. Let me do it. Can we?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
?: An iron pickaxe should be used. 
Wak: Oh, really? Aha, similarly as in Minecraft.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Wak: I know where iron is.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Wak: We should make the iron pickaxe first. And we will need to increase our levels first.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
?: We need to walk in line, for safety in emergency.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
?: Watch ur step.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Wak: It says I am cold. Lol, we are so barbaric. Hey, the hunger doesn't go down thanks to our sitting.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Wak: This cave is a low level dungeon, so it is unlikely there are such things as bats.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Wak: Will something appear here? 
 ?: We r going down very deep. There is nothing.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:50.000
?: Oh it is likely that there is something. Something is shining.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Wak: Wait. No, no. Wow, there is something white. Like a white crystal.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
?: It seems like somewhere I watched in the trailer. 
Wak: Well, everywhere must have such an air.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
?: Wow, it is a very steep cliff here. Oh, not so much as first thought. 
 Wak: watch out.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Wak: Let's continue. Let's remain seated. Caring our stamina. Go seated.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Wak: Let's go and see. We just explore today. Let's bring the iron pickaxes next time.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
?: Hey, there is a forked road. 
Wak: where? who is speaking? 
Rain: This is Rain.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Wak: Ok, guys. Let's first go this way.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000
?: No, it is not a road. There is a cliff. 
Wak: Hey, lol, Rain. Make a way for me. What is it? No, it's not this way.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.000
?: It says I feel cold. What is it? 
Wak: Hold the fire. Let's warm up each other.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
?: Is there no way here? Is this the end? 
Wak: No, there is a road still.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Wak: we can jump over here, no, not here. Can we mine these stones? Yeah it is a regular stone.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Wak: Yeah, that way. Let's go and see.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Wak: Hey, Zzogam. Please mind ur stamina. We have to consider the way back. Let's reach the end.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.000
?: Wow, well it is a dodo. 
Wak: Oh, I thought it was a zombie because of u, lol.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
??: How did it get in here? Did it fly? It is level 33.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Wak: It is just a coincidence. It was outside, but just randomly walked in here. There can't be only one otherwise.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:20.000
?: It was very surprising. 
Wak: It is very deep here, really. Can we mine the wall?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Wak: Level 33 dodo. That's crazy. 
?: Another forked road. 
??: It is a fork this time.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Wak: Let's split here. Cuna, Rain to the right.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:46.000
?: A scorpion. 
Wak: Huh? Oh hey, hey, what is it, what is it?? Lol. Come up here.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Wak: Anesthetic arrow. Hey, are u all alive? None dead? Ok, let's go back!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Wak: Expedition over. Don't go beyond here. There must be valuable ores.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Wak: Was it a snake? Anaconda?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
?: It had a mane, so.. 
Rain: It was level 9, I think.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Wak: We were too scared, lol. We might have been able to kill it. We are not on raptors, so..

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
?: It was very narrow down there. We need iron spears. 
Wak: Yeah. Iron spears.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
?: I learned, but we need to try crafting it. 
Wak: Yeah, let's have some iron ores.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Wak: Honestly, I saw the head first, and I thought it was a dilopho.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Wak: So I thought there is a dilopho down here, and was about to say kill it, and then the movement is wrong behind its head,lol.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.533
Wak: They say it is very strong. That's what I heard.
