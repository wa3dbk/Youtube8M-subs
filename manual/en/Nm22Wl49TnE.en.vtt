00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.100
Now that Ted Cruz has officially
jumped into the presidential race and

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.400
he'll be followed by a lot of other candidates
you would never consider voting for,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.300
let's ask a simple question:

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Will we ever see an atheist
presidential candidate?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.400
Actually, let me clarify.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.700
Will we ever see an "openly"
atheist presidential candidate?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.700
The answer seems to be "no"
for a variety of reasons.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.000
First, let me get
into the facts.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.400
Atheists are still
unelectable in America.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.800
According to a 2012 Gallup poll -- which we made a
video about and you can see a link to in the description --

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.500
when it comes to an otherwise fine
candidate who shares your values,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.600
only 54% of Americans said they would
vote for an otherwise fine candidate

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.900
who happens to be
an atheist.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.500
That's lower than someone
who's gay, or Muslim, or Mormon.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.700
We were lowest
on the list.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.000
So, atheism is a political liability,
no matter what else you have going for you.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.200
There are also no openly atheist
members of Congress right now.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.700
535 members in Congress.
Zero atheists.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.700
So, it's not like we have any role models
we can look up to in that sense.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.800
There are a handful who say
they're "unaffiliated,"

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.100
but they don't say
anything beyond that.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.300
In case you're curious, the highest
ranking atheist in political office today

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.800
is Ernie Chambers,
a State Senator from Nebraska.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.000
There are also a small handful of State Representatives
who are openly atheists, like Juan Mendez, of Arizona.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.600
But no one
on Capitol Hill.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.000
But maybe you're thinking:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"The demographics are changing.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.900
There are more non-religious
people today than ever before.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.400
And the younger you get, it looks
like they're just increasingly non-religious."

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.200
And that's true. About 20% of Americans
say they have no religious affiliation.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.700
And that percentage jumps to 30%
for people under the age of 30.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.800
And these numbers never seem to go down,
they always seem to be increasing.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.700
So that's good, right?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.100
Not necessarily.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.000
The Pew Research Center last year did a poll
where they asked non-religious people specifically

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.700
if they were more or less likely to vote
for a candidate who happens to be atheist.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.100
You'd think 100% of them said they were
more likely to vote for an atheist candidate.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.400
I mean, at worst, maybe some of them
said they just wouldn't care.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.600
Guess what.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.800
24% of non-religious people

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.700
said they would be less likely to vote
for someone who did not believe in God.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.700
I'd like to say that's proof
we're really independent thinkers,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.400
but when you have to fight just to get the
votes of people who are supposed to agree with you,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.300
I mean, good luck getting votes of people
who are already predisposed to not like you.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm not saying we should automatically vote
for someone just because he or she is an atheist,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.600
but you'd hope that if they
say openly that they are atheist.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.300
It's really just
a symbol.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.600
It's a sign that they know how to think critically,
and ask tough questions, and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.400
respect the separation
of church and state.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.500
I think the best hope we have of seeing an
atheist President any time in the near future

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.700
is electing someone for very different reasons.
Hopefully, you know, reasons we agree with.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.800
And then praying really hard that they
come out as godless once they're in office,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.800
or something
like that.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
You never know.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.500
Maybe future president Ted Cruz is just
hiding his atheism really, really well.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.400
My name is Hemant Mehta and I write
