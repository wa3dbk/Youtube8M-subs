00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.050
Hi!

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.050
I'm the YouTube deal guy!

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.310
Welcome to your one stop shop for daily deals!

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.599
I am again coming to you from a fake kitchen.

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.080
Now before I get to today's deal that will
forever change your relationship with meat,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.810
sounds odd but anyways, I want to remind you
that if you are not yet subscribed to this

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.359
channel, click the subscribe button on your
screen right now and that will sign you up

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.359
for all of my big deals.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.952
You might know me from your local TV station
or USA Today.

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:26.650
There is nothing more important to me than
saving you money!

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.650
None of these are paid products.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.019
And now from our fake kitchen I bring you
a real chef, Chef Binks!

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.160
My favorite chef that I bring back time and
time again because he gets more thumbs up

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.890
than I do for my videos!

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.899
And his credibility to the kitchen is awesome!

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.649
Now one problem I constantly struggle with
is the cost of meat and I'm always buying

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.339
expensive cuts so they will be tender, but
apparently there is a professional chef way

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.019
to get that off my radar!

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.019
Absolutely!

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.989
Meat is one of the most expensive items that
you will use in your home kitchen.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.059
It is one of the biggest costs on our bill!

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.489
Second would come produce which is one of
the second or third base things we do.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.070
But the way you can take an in-expensive cut
of meat and make it taste like filet mignon

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.660
is by using this little known chef secret.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.713
Something you will find in every professional
kitchen across America and which I've had

00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:14.720
in mine for over 25 years.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.020
It's called the Jaccard.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.800
Surgical steel, razor sharp blades.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.180
Penetrates and pierces the meat, breaking
down the muscle tissue.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.990
This allows them to marinate quicker and be
more tender, and again also breaks down tissue.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.660
Super easy to use!

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.220
That is all you have to do and I am only using
two fingers right now!

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.160
So each of those cuts are not only breaking
down fiber but if I had a marinade does that

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.330
allow it to permeate into the meat differently?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.810
In half the amount of time!

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.740
So if you're in a rush using this is perfect!

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.860
This gets it ready without waiting twenty
hours!

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.782
Even if you wanted to use an in-expensive
steak for kabobing, which is actually better

00:01:55.782 --> 00:02:00.620
because it is thick and will stay on a stick,
this device will make your meat nice and tender!

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.450
This device can turn a five dollar piece of
meat into a fifteen dollar piece of meat!

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.069
Alright now let me show you this price!

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.000
The price you see on your screen right now
is an awesome deal!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:26.760
Now 25 years ago I paid about 48 dollars for
mine, which was very expensive for that time!

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.770
And now the price I've found is far under
40 dollars!

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.890
The price is right now on your screen!

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.050
Now please remember that none of these are
paid products, I don't make a dime of commission

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.050
on anything I show you.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.660
