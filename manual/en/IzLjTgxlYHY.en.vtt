00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.980
Okay you guys, this next one is also, again,
one of my personal favorites.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.120
It's called the Cross Open.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.759
And I just kind of showed you with my hands
cross open, but we're going to be doing it

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.800
with our feet and our legs.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.020
It's a great lower body workout.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.170
You're going to get low into a nice hip hop
style squat.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.010
But first you have to cross your feet.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.290
So, we're going to break it down nice and
slow to start.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.290
Cross your feet.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.210
Cross right over left, and then jump out,
and hold.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.210
Okay?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.500
And then you can just rock it out.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.989
And then you go to the other side.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.649
Cross left over right.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.329
Cross, out, rock it out.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.329
Okay?

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.559
So that's the slow version.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.910
Now, if you take it up in tempo the rhythm
is a little bit different.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.140
It's cross out, okay?

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.289
Cross open, cross open.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.289
Okay?

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.059
So, we're going to do it first slow, and then
take it up to tempo.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.800
So cross open to start.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.800
Ready?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800
Go.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.850
And cross open, good.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.650
Cross open, and cross open.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.680
So get low, into the floor.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.820
Get that jump.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.180
Cross down, good.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.180
Cross down.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.750
So, you're working your legs.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.299
You're going to feel that in your quads and
in your lower legs as well.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.650
I want to take it up in tempo so that you
get the feel of the 90s, right.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.390
This is like one of those great moves from
that era, right?

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.409
Where you got down.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.280
It's like at a house party.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.280
So take yourself there.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.470
Go to that house party.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.990
Do the Cross Open.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.990
Ready?

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.990
Here we go.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.560
Up to tempo, down, two, three, and down.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.880
Two, three, and down.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.040
Two, three, and down.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.560
Two, three, again down.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.790
Two, three, and down.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.049
Two, three.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.049
Good.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.980
So, how many should you do?

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.189
Let's say ten.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.890
Do ten, and then see how you feel.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.890
Okay?

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.429
Enjoy you guys.
