00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:13.722
OK Welcome to another restoration

00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.737
this is a Viscount 1979

00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:20.828
Gran Prix I do not know to much about this bike

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:22.837
I do know it was made in England

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:24.532
quiet interesting

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.350
and the company originally

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:31.002
was lambert and Viscount

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:34.016
that was the 1970s them bikes was quiet expensive

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:36.016
this was a later model 1979

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:38.590
so I think Yamaha or something like that

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.829
took the company over

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.905
so we have the shimano components

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.170
it has a Simplex Rear gear gear system on it

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:47.337
but yes bit of a mixed bunch

00:00:47.337 --> 00:00:49.742
its a later model so I don not think its that expensive

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.642
but it does need restoring

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:55.633
so regards to taking it back to its original state

00:00:55.878 --> 00:00:58.118
I have noticed its handle bar tape

00:00:58.118 --> 00:01:00.373
is probably the same its of a cloth material

00:01:02.498 --> 00:01:05.138
and the bracket for the light is missing

00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:06.831
needs a different saddle

00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.704
and well everything just needs really cleaning up

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:10.204
its hardly moving

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:11.427
to be honest with you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.770
yes the tyres really do need replacing

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.532
a real good clean up this one

00:01:16.532 --> 00:01:18.883
I do not think its been cleaned for many many years

00:01:20.238 --> 00:01:22.878
so lets crack on and see how it comes out!

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:18.286
OK well that the frame all stripped down

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.005
everything came off fairly ok

00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:23.879
the only thing that is damaged is the bottom bracket

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.036
the ring that holds the bearings them selves

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:29.462
has perished and will need replacing for sure

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.279
and yes thats it

00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:36.483
its all solid and very little rust

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:38.732
so yes should be a good one

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.949
Right ok well

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.286
heres the frame all stripped down

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.321
its now all ready to be put back together again

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:27.477
all the equipment is set out on the side there

00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:29.790
I have had a few issues with a few bits of equipment

00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:32.705
first one was the crank and the pedals

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:34.360
they was completely seized on so

00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:36.763
I had to strip the pedal down itself

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:39.912
we had to file down one side to get a good grip

00:03:40.684 --> 00:03:44.124
then we had to lubricate it heat it up let it cool down

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:47.487
lubricate it heat it up let it cool down that process really

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:48.537
just repeat that process just to get the lubricant in there until it released

00:03:50.607 --> 00:03:52.367
so yes managed to free them

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:54.261
unfortunately we have sacrificed the pedals

00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:56.234
so I have got hold of some other pedals

00:03:56.234 --> 00:03:57.564
they are with in keeping

00:03:57.564 --> 00:03:59.719
these are rat trap pedals themselves

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.436
so they are within keeping with the bike its self

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:04.783
compared to the old original ones

00:04:04.783 --> 00:04:07.032
the other thing that I have had a bit of a problem with

00:04:07.032 --> 00:04:08.641
the simplex rear gearing system

00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:13.585
the spring that is loaded in the gear had completely corroded

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.990
so I have had to find a replacment Shimano rear gearing system on there

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:20.162
and

00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:23.430
what I have also purchased is a Brooks Saddle

00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:24.895
Brooks Saddle there

00:04:26.163 --> 00:04:30.403
got some new handle bar tape I have got some nice white cloth tape

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.651
it was on the bike when I received it

00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.840
I have also managed to get some 27"  inch and a quarter gum wall tyres

00:04:37.263 --> 00:04:39.023
for the wheels themselves

00:04:39.557 --> 00:04:41.237
the other thing I have got

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.160
which was just to finish it off was this

00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:45.671
lovely crome pump

00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:47.653
so it should look really well when its put back together

00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:50.378
so lets crack on and make a start

00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:50.878
 

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:58.458
OK

00:05:59.238 --> 00:06:00.518
bikes all finished

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.440
what a result

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.951
its came out really well

00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:05.768
just a good deep has really changed this bike

00:06:05.768 --> 00:06:06.983
it was ready for the scrap heap

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.620
im sure

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.091
we have brought it back

00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:11.798
and its now ready to be ridden again

00:06:12.356 --> 00:06:12.996
from 1979

00:06:13.366 --> 00:06:14.326
looks amazing

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:15.757
just a bit of deep cleaning

00:06:16.232 --> 00:06:18.472
really enjoying the lamp bracket

00:06:20.178 --> 00:06:21.938
also what I didn't mention

00:06:22.142 --> 00:06:24.622
we have these quick release wing nuts

00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:26.966
which was the first sort of quick release

00:06:29.093 --> 00:06:31.253
they are in keeping with the bike

00:06:31.253 --> 00:06:33.325
I did see these on the brochure itself

00:06:34.076 --> 00:06:35.756
so just on the front wheel

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:38.904
and yes looks amazing

00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:40.197
it looks so much better

00:06:40.197 --> 00:06:41.241
really happy that I have done this restoration

00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.376
all that is left to do know though I suppose

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:44.445
Is try it out and get it out on the road

00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:39.503
OK well

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.750
this really has been a great ride

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.250
a bit of a bone rattler

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:44.570
but from 1979

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.923
to bring it back on the road and bring it back to life

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:48.175
36 years old

00:07:48.175 --> 00:07:50.138
who would of thought it does not look it at all

00:07:50.138 --> 00:07:52.297
but yes I have really enjoyed doing this project
