00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:02.148
Stuffed tomatoes

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:08.422
Today I'm going to make stuffed
tomatoes with quinoa.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.108
They're perfect to go along with meat

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.434
or chicken or fish.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.245
Or even when you want a very light dinner

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.337
then you make two of these tomatoes

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.091
and eat them by themselves, it's perfect.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.188
Let's cook?

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:26.338
Let's cook

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.428
I'll start this recipe

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.868
by cutting off the lid of the tomatoes.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.137
And removing all the pulp inside them.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.914
I'll place the pulp inside this blender

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.920
and blend until it's mashed.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.400
Then strain it to remove the seeds

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.548
and cook the quinoa with this pulp.

00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:58.114
Add 1 cup of quinoa to the pulp.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.965
I've already washed and 
drained the grains.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.960
If you think the quinoa is still a 
bit hard when it's cooking

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.325
you can add a little hot water
and let it cook

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.491
until it softens.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.628
I'll season with a pinch of salt
and a tablespoon of cajun.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.262
If you want to make this
spice mix called cajun

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:21.280
click here and take a look
at this video.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.651
Or just buy a mix from the supermarket.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.405
When my quinoa is ready, I'll add 1/2 a cup of corn

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.880
1/2 cup of peas

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.057
1/4 cup of chopped cashew nuts

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.531
half a red pepper without the
seeds in the middle.

00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:49.485
I think it's too strong, but it 
depends on your taste

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.634
add as much as you'd like,
with or without the seeds.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.630
- Want to try one, honey?
- I do.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.868
I was craving for it before we
even started recording.

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:03.954
With the seeds... I don't know 
why I'm swallowing this.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.394
You're swallowing? Dude, you're crazy.

00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:13.017
It isn't wearing off, then?

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:15.977
Besides the pepper, that you 
decide the amount

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.742
and Paulo is dying in front of me.

00:02:21.062 --> 00:02:22.251
It's not funny.

00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:25.657
I'll also need 100g of 
chopped feta cheese

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.811
and a bit of chopped chives to add in
the end, just a little when it's all done.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.125
To add a nice flavour to
your mixture.

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:44.411
When the quinoa is ready, seasoned
and packed with delicious things

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.525
I'll pour a bit of oil in this pan, just
a little so the tomatoes don't stick

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.560
then I'll stuff them with quinoa 
and bake them for 10 minutes.

00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:59.851
10 to 15 minutes at 220ÂºC.

00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:03.980
Leave until it's warm and the
tomatoes look baked.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.451
If you want, add some salt inside the 
tomatoes before adding the quinoa

00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:11.450
or even some oil.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.291
I won't add it because I think it's
already seasoned enough.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.262
I don't need it.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.108
- But it's a tip.
- You don't need it, huh?

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.142
I don't! Don't need more salt in my life.

00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:23.600
But it's just a tip, if you want some more.

00:03:41.085 --> 00:03:44.788
And Paulo almost died in this
episode, eating a red pepper

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.645
- Was it good?
- Delicious. I'm still recovering.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.708
- In three days you'll be fine, right.
- Exactly.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.685
Well, don't do this at home, but make
these stuffed tomatoes

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.360
with quinoa, that are delicious 
and very healthy.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.765
And if you're on a heavy diet,
use cherry tomatoes.

00:04:01.645 --> 00:04:02.857
Right.

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:09.040
Then you'll have to eat a
thousand cherry tomatoes.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.560
This was another delicious and healthy
recipe from Let's Cook.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.988
I'll see you next week with another
amazing recipe. Bye!
