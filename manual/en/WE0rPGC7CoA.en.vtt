&gt;&gt;A Kemp's Ridley?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.789
&gt;&gt;Yup, they usually live right on our spots
we want to fish.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:20.789
They are usually the tell tale

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt;Cool beans, looks like we are in the right
spot then, the Humminbird sure was lit up.

&gt;&gt;Twenty, twenty two

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.320
&gt;&gt;Fishing in twenty-one foot of water I guess
if it drops a foot every mile we are about

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.710
twenty one miles out.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:48.670

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.109
&gt;&gt;Yeah, actually

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.479
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;How do you normally fish these
fish?

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.479
When you bring clients out

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.290
&gt;&gt;What I normally do is start out with artificial
and, usually you'll catch a few on it the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.140
bite will slow down you always bring a live
bait, dead bait, you know.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.049
Just gotta bring all the tricks in the bag,
you know?

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.260
&gt;&gt;Something is down there chewing on this
one.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.260
There he is!

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.260

[laughing] Ugh, the DOA Swimming Mullet.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.060

I've caught fish everywhere I've thrown this

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.060

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.060
&gt;&gt;Look at this.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.060
&gt;&gt;A red huh?

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.060
&gt;&gt;It's red grouper.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:18.380
&gt;&gt;Check that out you say you don't get too
many reds on this spot do you?

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.380
&gt;&gt;No not this shallow

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.380
&gt;&gt;Awesome deal, how's my Swimming Mullet?

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.380
&gt;&gt;He's in good shape bud.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.330
&gt;&gt;Let me see that Red, that is such a beautiful
fish.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.570
&gt;&gt;Let me see if I can grab this guy, I want
to show him off.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.900
So how big do the Reds have to be?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.210
&gt;&gt;They have to be twenty inches in the gulf

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.210
&gt;&gt;Twenty inches.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.210
&gt;&gt;He might.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.210
&gt;&gt;But they're out of season right now

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.880
&gt;&gt;Oh out of season This one is a lucky one

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:53.560
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;What a pretty fish, gah look

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.200
&gt;&gt;That is a pretty fish.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.380
Absolutely beautiful mouth, look at all the
red in there.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.420
Absolutely beautiful fish, ohh.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.000
That's one way to release them huh?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.050
&gt;&gt;He was still alive.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.050

And by, Trokar The world's sharpest fish hook.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280
&lt;Blair&gt;That screen is lit up on that Humminbird.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280
And you say those are grouper

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.280
&lt;Chris&gt;Yes sir.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.280
&gt;&gt;Cool, this is the first time I've used the
ONIX there from Humminbird, now I know what

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.280
they look like.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
&gt;&gt;Well welcome back folks, we are still sitting
off of Homosassa here.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280
We still got Captain Chris on the boat with
us and we are still jigging these DOA Swimming

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280
Mullet and hoping to show you one of these
great big gags.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280
Kind of easy fishing.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280
All we are doing basically is kind of just
dropping them down.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.280
We figured out that the hole is right back
here.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280
You said that the bite usually slows down
after you throw a couple artificial so, we

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.280
might be going to live bait here pretty soon.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280
And we're gonna see what happens.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280
Drop them on.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280
&gt;&gt;Let's do it.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280
Twenty foot huh, that ain't much drop.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;Nope.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.280
&gt;&gt;Uh oh there you go.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.280
&gt;&gt;uh oh!

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.280
&gt;&gt;That looks like a good one!

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.280
&gt;&gt;A little better.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
For sure.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280
&gt;&gt;Let me get this guy in.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.280
Watch you do a little work.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.280
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;Oh yeah.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.280
That's a nice color.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280
&gt;&gt;Is that the right color?

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.280
&gt;&gt;Oh yeah.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280
&gt;&gt;Not a bad fish.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280
&gt;&gt;Oh yeah!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280
I think it's samiches at Seagrass tonight
huh?

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;Starting to look that way.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280
&gt;&gt;Well there you go.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280
Shallow water grouper on a DOA Swimming Mullet.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280
That's my favorite color.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280
You know everywhere I've ever fished and thrown
that lure I've caught fish on it.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280
&gt;&gt;Look you knocked the eye right off.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280
&gt;&gt;That is the ticket with that.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280
Awesome fish.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.280
Oh, he's still got plenty of life in him after
you whooped him.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280
&gt;&gt;Oh yeah.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.280
&gt;&gt;But you think he's one good for Seagrass
tonight?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280
&gt;&gt;Yes sir, he's right there.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280
&gt;&gt;Awesome grouper.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280
Twenty one foot of water.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280
On the big sticks.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280
We're using the big offshore stuff on these.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280
You would not believe how hard these grouper
pull.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.280
Unbelievable, y'all ever get a chance definitely
come see Chris.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280
I'm ready for one how about you?

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.280
&gt;&gt;I'd like to see that.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.280
&gt;&gt;When you leave fish to find fish you usually
don't find fish, so when this bite runs out

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280
here we are gonna go in and do his specialty
which is some of that real shallow water grouper

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280
stuff so.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280
We've already changed baits, we stopped in
this morning and saw, what's her name?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280
Baitfish Bonnie?

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.280
&gt;&gt;Ms Bonnie.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.280
&gt;&gt;Ms Bonnie at the bait barn up there.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.280
Right on the way out, we got pin fish and
uh, what did you get there?

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280
Threadies?

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280
&gt;&gt;Dead thread fins.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.280
&gt;&gt;Dead threadies, so...

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.280
We are going to whack a couple of fish.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.280
We'll see what happens.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.280
&gt;&gt;Oh, son!

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.280
&gt;&gt;He tore that thing.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.280
He'll come back and eat it.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.280
There he is, there he is dude.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.280
Kingfish dude look at the size of that Kingfish.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.280
&gt;&gt;Kingfish, oh lordy.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280
&gt;&gt;Nice, dude.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.280
You might want to back off on that drag a
little.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280
&gt;&gt;That's circle hooked.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.280
A kingfish.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.280
What's a kingfish doing eating a pinfish?

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.280
&gt;&gt;That's awesome!

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.280
&gt;&gt;That is a monster too.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.280
&gt;&gt;Nice surprise

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.280
&gt;&gt;That looked like about a forty pound kingfish
when he flashed.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.280
Well, the grouper man just turned into the
kingfish man

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280
[Laughing] One thing about a circle hook is
that on a kinfish once you got him like that

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280
as long as they you know, do left hand turns
or right hand turns whatever side of the mouth

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280
they're hooked on.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280
You can pretty much catch them as long as
they don't bite the leader.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280
It's eighty pound, so we'll see what happens
here.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280
He's right there oh yeah that's a good king
bro.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.280
&gt;&gt;Nice fish dude.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280
And he's not ready yet

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.280
&gt;&gt;Uh oh, I'm gonna go up front.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.280
&gt;&gt;Yup, keep moving, keep moving.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280
&gt;&gt;Oh!

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.280
&gt;&gt;Oh, right at the end.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280
[laughing] &gt;&gt;Like I said, he was doing left
hand turns and even though it's eighty pound

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280
leader he turned back around and bit that
line it's cut clean as scissors if y'all ever

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.280
seen kingfish teeth.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.280
That one if you had put your finger in his
mouth, he would have clipped it.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.280
Oh well, lets get re-rigged.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.280
&gt;&gt;So you like the way that spot lock works
huh?

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.280
&gt;&gt;Oh man that's great!

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.280
&gt;&gt;Unbelievable, I've done it, you know off
the Atlantic in like two hundred and ten feet

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280
of water, three hundred feet of water.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.280
And uh, you don't need seven hundred feet
of anchor line to anchor your boat up.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280
&gt;&gt;It changes everything.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280
&gt;&gt;Oh oh, that was a thump thump.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280
&gt;&gt;That's a good fish right there.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280
&gt;&gt;Uh oh, oh get him son!

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280
Uh oh.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280
&gt;&gt;Here we go!

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.280
&gt;&gt;I just gave you a Roland Martin 'son' so
you better land this fish.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.280
&gt;&gt;Oh, SON!

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;Oh yeah, I think that one is
gonna have a hook in him.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280
Uh oh, you got me?

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280
No something got me.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280
[Laughing] We got color!

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.280
Holy moly!

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.280
That's a pretty good fish there brother.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.280
&gt;&gt;Not bad.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.280
&gt;&gt;Yes sir.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.280
&gt;&gt;Circle hook in the corner of the mouth.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.280
&gt;&gt;Yup, show you that what I didn't do was
reel down like he did to get him right there

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.280
in the corner of the mouth, y'all check that
out.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280
That is the way a circle hook is supposed
to work, every time.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280
You say the limit on grouper is what?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.139
&gt;&gt;You get two gags per person, two reds per
person when they are in season.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:49.850
&gt;&gt;That is cool and that is a Lazer Sharp circle
hook right there doing the job brother.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.560
Look at that fish Absolutely beautiful.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.970
That's the way to do it there Captain Chris.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.569
We are gonna put this one in the box.

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.190
Y'all stay tuned, we are gonna be right back
with some more Addictive Fishing.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.380
And it don't get much prettier than that right
brother.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.380
That is awesome.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380
Come get ya come samiches off of Homosassa.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.380
&lt;Blair&gt;Oh oh, He's nervous.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.380
&lt;Chris&gt;Mine got whacked and then he let go.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.380
&gt;&gt;So Chris, with your charter business you
do the same thing you come out and throw a

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.380
few artificials and then, you go to the threadies?

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.380
&gt;&gt;Go to thread fins or live bait

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.380
&gt;&gt;Simple little knocker rig.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380
This is the same type of rig I use offshore
for flounder where I go.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.380
Same stuff.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.380
&gt;&gt;Really?

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.380
Some of the big gags they prefer you put a
four or five foot leader out there.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.380
You know, behind a sinker and a swivel.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.380
They don't like to see that sinker so much.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.380
&gt;&gt;Do you use Seaguar?

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.380
&gt;&gt;Yes, oh yeah.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.380
&gt;&gt;They are the best.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.380
And if y'all

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.380
&gt;&gt;Oh!

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.380
&gt;&gt;If y'all happened to notice, I don't have
that sound in my guides anymore of a real

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.380
kind of a rough braid.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.380
We switched over to Smackdown, it's made by
Seaguar.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.380
Highly recommend it, they are the number one
fluorocarbon leader material out there in

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.380
the world so, why not try their line out.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.380
It is amazing.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.380
My casts are...

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.380
Well you just saw it.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.380
Heck they are forty or fifty percent further
than they were.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.380
And it's thin.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.380
So twenty years you've been doing it huh?

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.380
&gt;&gt;Yes sir.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.380
&gt;&gt;And that's how long it took you to get the
name 'Grouper Man' around here.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.380
That's what everybody was calling ya.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.380
"Oh you're going with the grouper dude, you're
gonna be killing 'em." and so far so good

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.380
&gt;&gt;I guess that's not a bad nick name.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.380
&gt;&gt;That's definitely not a bad nickname.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.380
How in the world do you find these spots?

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.380
Are they on charts or you...

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.380
&gt;&gt;No sir, I think it was probably experience
in the Keys growing up spotting these rock

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.380
piles.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.380
I can see them, I don't know you just got
a feeling for them.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.380
You know, it's a different color brown in
the water than a grass spot.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
&gt;&gt;So get ya a good Humminbird like that ONIX
right there and turn the bottom machine on

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.380
and start idling a lot of times guys troll
those big lip plugs around here.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.380
Mirrolure makes a great one that- Oh oh...
...that you can troll with

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.380
&gt;&gt;There he is, he's trying dude.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.380
That's a big fish he's in the rock.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.380
&gt;&gt;Hopefully that leader, I retied it so...

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.380
Ugh!

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.380
Still not a good, not a keeper.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.380
&gt;&gt;Not a keeper?

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.380
They're steady though.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.380
and that's good.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.380
&gt;&gt;The power, I was thinking I was gonna throw
my eight footers out here today catching these

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.380
fish, but uh no.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.380
[Laughing] I'm using the they call this one
the boat rod.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.380
I call it the pitching rod.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.380
Look at that, all the way up to the knot.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.380
That is frayed up.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.380
There's a couple of nicks in that I'm gonna
have to do a full re-tie on that That's the

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.380
sixty five Smackdown.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.380
There's a couple of frays in that so you know
that was in the rock too.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.380
Good abrasion resistance.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.380
First year we've been using it.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.380
Awesome stuff.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.380
I'm gonna get re-rigged.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.380
Show you how we got these livies rigged.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.380
You want to put them Ow!

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.380
You know why they're called pin fish if those
things get you right there.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.380
But uh, we're not through the spine so he
can uh swim down there really freely.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.380
Once you get them down in the water.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.380
You'll feel them just going (makes noise).

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.380
And when they really start going like a cricket
on fire, get ready because you're fixing to

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.380
uh get your line stretched.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.380
Oh he's already nervous.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.380
How long you been doing this?

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.380
&gt;&gt;Twenty years.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.380
&gt;&gt;You've been guiding twenty years?

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.380
&gt;&gt;Yes sir.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.380
&gt;&gt;You're originally what you said you're a
conch right?

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.380
&gt;&gt;Key West Conch, yes sir.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.380
&gt;&gt;A Key West Conch &gt;&gt;Fifth generation.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.380
&gt;&gt;Really, so what brought you back up this
way?

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.380
&gt;&gt;Oh moved up here, just at the end of high
school.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.380
My parents left when all the conchs decided
to get out of town cause it was getting too

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.380
expensive.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.380
&gt;&gt;It's rare you can find- they bus all the
works in now from Miami don't they?

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.380
&gt;&gt;A lot of them.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.380
&gt;&gt;..big greyhounds you see them going down
that- Uh oh! ...going down that stretch every

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.380
morning.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.380
&gt;&gt;It's amazing when I go down there now and
you go in the t-shirt shops and placed that

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.380
are local businesses and they tell me that
they have never met anyone from Key West before.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.380
in Key West.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.380
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;That's pretty sad actually.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380
&gt;&gt;I got a buddy of mine that I went to high
school with that lives down there.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.380
He moved down there and got the keys disease
real bad.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.380
The keys disease is just you get down there
and you fall in love with the place and you

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.380
never leave.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.380
&gt;&gt;You can't leave.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.380
&gt;&gt;Uh here we go.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.380
&gt;&gt;There he is.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.380
Oh oh yeah!

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.380
&gt;&gt;He's in the rock come on out.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.380
&gt;&gt;Come on.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.380
&gt;&gt;He's out.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.380
(struggling) Ugh, that's what I like about
this short rod you can put it on your hip

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.380
real quick.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.380
Yes sir that's a nice one brother

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.380
&gt;&gt;Nice!

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.380
&gt;&gt;Rock and roll baby.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.380
&gt;&gt;One more time.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.380
&gt;&gt;Look at that circle hook right in the corner.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.380
&gt;&gt;If you take these circle hooks the way they
are, and you just roll it around, it will

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.380
pop right out.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.380
&gt;&gt;And I reeled I didn't set the hook.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.380
Yes sir!

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.380
Amazing how these fish fight.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.380
If y'all ever get a chance to come do this,
y'all gotta come feel how hard these gag-

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.380
blah, I cant even talk.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.380
How hard these gag groupers pull in this shallow
water.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.380
What's cool about it you don't bring them
up like what I'm use to in the Atlantic we're

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.380
fishing a hundred and twenty foot for them
a lot of times.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.380
You bring them up one atmosphere (makes noise)
they blow up like you know they get those

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.380
Marty Feldman eyes poking out of their head
and stuff you see that grouper right there

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.380
you don't even need a venting tool if you're
releasing him.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.380
And that one is going in for a samich.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.380
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;Yeah he is

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.380
&gt;&gt;Y'all stay tuned we are gonna be right back
with some more Addictive Fishing.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.380
Captain Chris Wilkins right here off of Homosassa.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.380
Beautiful water, stay tuned we're gonna be
right back!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.380
(Play it) &lt;VO&gt;Addictive Fishing is brought
to you by Star Brite.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.380
The world wide leader in marine automotive
and rv care products.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.380
Wright and McGill.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.380
Never compromise.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.380
Engel.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.380
The original high performance cooler company.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.380
DOA lures.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.380
The unfair advantage.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.380
And by, Seaguar.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.380
Trust Seaguar when everything is on the line.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.380
&lt;Blair&gt;Oh, that was a hit!

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.380
Alright Chris new spot, what do we do on this
one?

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.380
what do we do on this one?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.380
&lt;Chris&gt;This place here is just a little spring
and it's got a little ledge off to the side

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.380
of it.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.380
What you want to do is throw your plug across
it and get it at swimming depth before it

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.380
gets there and just swim the plug right across
the top and it usually sparks a reaction.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.380
&gt;&gt;Let's try this spot.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380
Cranking, cranking, cranking.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.380
Uh oh!

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.380
Uh oh.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.380
Good one?

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.380
&gt;&gt;Better, you gonna boat this for me Mr. Blair?

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.380
[Laughing] &gt;&gt;Long as you bring him on the
starboard side.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.380
&gt;&gt;I'm gonna work on that.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.380
That one is fighting a little bit better than
the others.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.380
&gt;&gt;Oh yeah.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.380
&gt;&gt;It's a sail cat.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.380
[Laughing] Hey there is some keeper grouper

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.380
Nice fish right there.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.380
Well what do you say we turn her back in to
the home stretch there and see if can get

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.380
somebody to cook one of these up for us up
back there?

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.380
&gt;&gt;I bet you we can.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.380
[Laughing]

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.380
&lt;VO&gt;Rig it right by Wright and McGill

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.380
&lt;Blair&gt;Captain Chris Wilkins, Homosassa.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.380
First time I've ever fished with him.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.380
One awesome guy to fish with.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.380
Definitely knows I think where every little
rock and bump is and if you've ever been to

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.380
Homosassa It is miles and miles of crystal
clear flats.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.380
And normally when you're out there fishing
Captain Chris likes to throw artificial over

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.380
the spot we were using everything that DOA
makes out there

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.380
&gt;&gt;Big DOA Shrimp brother, does it every time.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.380
&gt;&gt;And we hit one of these spots, I was throwing
a big DOA shrimpz and I had this fish hit

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.380
me.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.380
And we were using the big seven foot and seven
six boat rods on these fish and when that

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.380
fish hit me and I set the hook.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.380
&gt;&gt;There he is there he is right there!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.380
&gt;&gt;I literally dislocated my shoulder on that
fish and I was in pain the rest of the show

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.380
and plus for about three months.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.380
Before it finally went back in.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.380
But uh, one great way to fish for grouper
out there, you don't have to go you know super

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.380
far out and super deep, like I said unfortunately
it was a little bit dirty that day so we brought

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.380
out the Lazer Sharp circle hooks and we put
the boots to them.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.380
Literally every drop we were catching fish
when we put it down, whether it be a grouper

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.380
this big a grouper this big or one of the
big grouper that we couldn't even stop.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.380
Highly recommend you going with Chris if you
ever get a chance to.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.380
One awesome place to fish in Homosassa.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.380
Remember one thing though, every fishing season
starts right here at Dick's.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.380
&lt;VO&gt;Rig it Right by Wright and McGill.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.380
&gt;&gt;Well folks, we tried a couple of spots on
the way in it's his specialty the water was

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.380
what just a little bit too dirty? you think?

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.380
&gt;&gt;A little dirty.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.380
&gt;&gt;Hey he did get a nice one out though.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.380
Y'all saw that hook set man that made me want
to stay there until dark.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.380
But, ran out of time we caught plenty of fish.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.380
I want to say thanks to Gator MacRae this
is his place right here it's called MacRae's

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.380
of Homosassa.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.380
If y'all ever get a chance to come here I'd
highly recommend it one of the most beautiful

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.380
spots in Florida to come and fish and hang
out and have a good time.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.380
