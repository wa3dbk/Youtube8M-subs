00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.510
Unknown to people during the Stone Age, the
brain was the center of their nervous system,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.740
including the center of emotions. A heart
beat faster when one was excited, and among

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.380
the many assumptions that was to endure was
that the heart was the center of emotions.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.270
Humans had a six-layered brain, a brain at
the inner-level with involuntary and automatic

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.660
functions common to other creatures: breathing,
sexual response, vision, mobility, taste and

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.150
smell. The outer part of the brain, especially
the prefrontal cortex, was larger in humans

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.120
than it was in those from whom they had descended.
About 100,000 years ago, our ancestors had

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.890
a brain weighing about one pound. In humans
this grew to three times that amount: a collection

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.790
of a 100 billion neurons with as many as 10,000
connections that supplied them with their

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.530
cognitive skills.
Chemical distribution affected mood and emotion.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.810
Beneficial chemicals gave humans empathy without
which they could not have survived. It helped

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.060
them to live in a group not unlike the canine
creatures humans domesticated. An incapacity

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.780
for empathy was the stuff of psychopathic
loners and the black widow spider, the product

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.780
of another evolutionary line a loner who
ate her mate immediately after fertilization.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.200
Humans had a chemistry that made rage possible
and produced aggression and self-defense rather

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.290
than enduring passivity.
Within species, nature did not provide precise

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.190
amounts of anything. Near amounts was the
likelihood. Variation existed, with one variation

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.920
creating the difference between male and female.
The distribution of differences in height,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.299
intelligence, aggressiveness or whatever would
in modern times be depicted in normal curves,

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.750
Biology of the brain made humans what they

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.310
were, but in making their way through the
challenges of life, people had to make choices,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.810
and their environments differed. Making choices,
Stone Age humanity was on its way to creating

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.560
different cultures. The minds of people were
products of their biology but also the age

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.760
and culture within which they lived.
