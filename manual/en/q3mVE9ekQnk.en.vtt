&gt;&gt;Tana: Hi, I’m Tana Amen.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.090
Thank you for joining me on Ask Tana.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:13.340
This question comes from Karen Carr (please
forgive me if I destroy your name) Chojnacki

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.150
and she’s confused about oils.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.029
She wants to know what’s the truth about
oils.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.680
I included deeper look at oils on our community
as well as in my book but I’ll start by

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.550
saying avoid cheap oils that are high in Omega
6 fatty acids and caused inflammation.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.260
This includes corn oil, soy bean oil, sunflower
oil and safflower oil.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.510
There are many oils that are healthy for consumption
but in their raw form or in their raw form

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.080
but become toxic when used for cooking.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.000
This is because all oils begin to break down
when they reached their smoking point.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.250
So, oils that get hot very quickly and reaches
smoking point at a low temperature are the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.490
ones you don’t want to cook with.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.380
This includes the all favorite olive oil.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.120
I know that’s hard to hear.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.990
Oils that are great for cooking with are the
ones they are either sold at room temperature

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.570
or are known to have a very high smoking point.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.909
These include refined coconut oil, grapeseed
oil, avocado oil, almond oil and macadamia

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.219
nut oil, which is one of my favorites.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.609
So now let’s talk about canola since that
was part of your question.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.710
The word ‘canola’ is a made-up name.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.069
It comes from the words Canada, low-acid and
oil.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.630
It’s not a real plant by itself but derived
from the grapeseed plant.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.770
Grapeseed oil has been historically used for
industrial purposes and lubricant for machinery.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.159
It’s also toxic when used for cooking and
has been linked to lung cancer and lesions

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.459
on the heart.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.579
Of course there are a couple of good features
to the oil, which is what has been capitalized

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.409
on but overall it’s very high in inflammation
causing Omega 6 fatty acids and comes from

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.539
crops that are primarily genetically modified.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.229
In other words, there isn’t much wholesome
about these oils starting with its name.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.270
Thank you for your question.
