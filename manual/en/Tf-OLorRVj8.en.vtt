00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.710
Polygons aren’t always preferable to pixels,
better hardware doesn’t always result in

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.250
better software and things that are good don’t
always get better with age.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.210
Gem Smashers is proof of these things.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.350
And if it looks familiar, that’s because
it’s kind of a decade old.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.260
The original Gem Smashers was released for
the Game Boy Advance back in 2003, and it

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.559
was actually a pretty interesting puzzler.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.990
Gem Smashers had an original concept, fun
gameplay and a colorful style, and it was

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.500
a really pleasant surprise on the GBA.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.350
But on the 3DS, the surprise isn’t quite
as pleasant.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.570
Nonetheless, Gem Smashers is kind of like
Breakout meets Bust-a-Move.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.830
Gems are scattered across the screen, and
controlling the character of your choice,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.450
you bounce around and break them.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.250
Because your character moves automatically,
you’re only in charge of steering.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.670
So you control the angles with the circle
pad while breaking the gems, collecting power-ups

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.650
and avoiding bad things.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.560
So in terms of its gameplay, not a whole lot
was changed for the 3DS version of Gem Smashers.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.010
The problem is other things were, and few
were changes for the good.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:56.099
My 
first big disappointment was the game’s

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.099
appearance.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.310
Gem Smashers trades in the colorful sprites
of the original for polygonal graphics, and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.320
frankly, they just don’t look as good.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.129
A lot of this comes down to preference, but
for me, a good sprite beats a mediocre 3D

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.310
models every time.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.780
By using the latter, this version of Gem Smashers
actually ends up with a more dated appearance

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.030
than its decade-old predecessor.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.840
Another problem is that the levels are noticeably
larger on the 3DS.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.769
This becomes an issue because it slows the
game’s pace.

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.430
You spend a lot more time bouncing from gem
to gem than you did in the original, which

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.640
can make the game feel a bit tedious.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.849
Of course, there’s also a lack of consequences.

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.000
Bumping into the skull blocks does nothing
more than cause you to respawn.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.439
And because there are no lives, you never
really feel like there’s a point to what

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.439
you’re doing.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:52.340
It feels like busywork more than a video game.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:05.269
Fortunately, there’s also an arcade mode,
which is actually better than the story mode,

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.549
as well as a multiplayer battle mode.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.959
Its in these modes that you’ll probably
have the most fun with Gem Smashers.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.849
The concept is still interesting, but I was
really disappointed with the way this version

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:17.849
turned out.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.590
I had high hopes for Gem Smashers, but unfortunately,
it’s a shadow of its former self on the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.550
3DS.
