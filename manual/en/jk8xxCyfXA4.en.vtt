00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.600
In this segment we are going to talk about 
the different Backers and how they are used in laminate.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.700
We start out with what's known as 10Mil.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.200
And when you look at a website 
and you see the different backers listed,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:31.000
we'll list 10Mil, 22Mil, Wood-on-wood and phenolic 
back as well as the PSA or Pressure Sensitive.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.100
The numbers or description describes the backer thickness,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.000
and in this case a 10Mil Veneer will have 
a 10Mil thick backer on it or 10,000's of each backer

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.300
and it's mainly used for pressing applications,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.300
If you're using a vacuum press or a platen press or a hot press

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.000
when you're laying up your panels 
for whatever type of work you're doing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.200
Then we have the 22Mil and the 22Mil is basically two layers of a 10Mil

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.700
and there is a crylicote adhesive in between
 which actually adds up to that finished thickness of the Backer,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.000
and this is mainly used for Contact Cement applications 
or if you have to do something in place.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Contact Cement is basically your only option
because you cannot press in certain circumstances

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.500
and so the added thickness in the Backer

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.000
get adds to the stability of the veneer itself.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then in the Wood-on-wood back, 
as I was saying earlier is used for applications

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.800
where it's more akin to like a traditional type lay-up, because in a traditional type lay-up you know 50 years so years ago,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.000
you would have a substrate 
and the substrate could be built out of a state construction

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or a series of boards glued together or plywood or particle wood,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.400
and then they would have a substrate layer veneer laid down,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.900
and then a primary veneer that is laid down 
on top of that in a cross banded fashion.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.300
and what that does is adds to 
a great deal of stability in the final surface itself.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.000
I hope this gives you an understanding of the different types of backers and how they are used in relationship to your project.
