Behind the Scenes
New Website, New Hi Scores

00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:15.528
Mod Lee M is the Lead Creative Designer for RuneScape and has the job of making the website for RuneScape 3. 

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:19.656
Behind the Scenes interrupted this man on a mission to find out more.

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:24.104
I think it's really important with the new game and the 6th age,

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:28.202
it's a change of an era and we really wanted to represent that in the website.

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:33.672
The game looks absolutely amazing and we wanted the website to reflect that. 

00:00:33.707 --> 00:00:38.400
The brief really was to make a more contemporary website and visually more appealing, 

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:39.863
more in line with the game. 

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:42.640
I want people to come there and go "Wow! this looks amazing"

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:47.192
So one of the biggest changes that the players will see is the six buttons on the homepage,

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:50.360
three of those buttons they can customise to their own needs, 

00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:54.839
we really want to make it so that the players can customise it to what they want 

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:57.584
and they can go to where they want as quick as possible. 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.815
We've also built a big expansion which ties into the website as well. 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.224
Seasonal High Scores are a brand new game feature,

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:06.464
they're a natural extension and addition to the current high scores system

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:11.648
but they give the RuneScape development team  the flexibility to tailor content to the players. 

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:15.443
Currently the RuneScape high scores are ruled by veteran players 

00:01:15.478 --> 00:01:18.704
and it doesn't really give the chance for less experienced players to compete. 

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:23.328
Rather than being permanently on and running forever, they'll run for an allotted period of time. 

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:27.752
At the end of the alloted time the high scores are reset and everybody can start from fresh again. 

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:31.447
We've tried to tailor each seasonal high score around different types of play styles, 

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:35.971
so if you're a PVM player we may do a high score based around the Dominion Tower, 

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:39.384
if you're a bosser we may do high scores around boss kills,

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:42.952
if you're a skiller we'll be able to tailor high scores that tailor to that too. 

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:47.095
Because seasonal high scores can run either weekly, fortnightly, monthly,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.216
it allows players to dip in and out of the system as and when they please. 

00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:54.736
Community Management is going to have their ears to the ground listening to what the players want.

00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:57.272
If they want to be whacking each other with rubber chickens 

00:01:57.307 --> 00:02:02.064
or if they want a large scale clan battle of Wildy event, Seasonal High Scores can deliver that. 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.255
There really is no limit to the kind of content that we can add Seasonal High scores to 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.224
and we'll be definitely be looking to go to the players for suggestions in future. 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.664
Because we've upped the competitiveness we felt it was only right that players who win receive some kind of reward

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.312
so they can show of their awesomenes to other players in the RuneScape community. 

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:27.200
So what we've done is players who finish on top for a particular run of high score will receive a unique Crown head override, a title and a unique emote.

00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:28.981
Obviously we're still toying with ideas at the moment 

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:32.084
so those definitely aren't final but that's kind of the direction we're heading in. 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:35.773
While the emotes and title rewards are for Seasonal High scores, 

00:02:35.808 --> 00:02:40.453
we are currently investigating how we can apply those to the high scores as they stand right now as well. 

00:02:40.488 --> 00:02:43.933
Updating the website as big as RuneScape's is a huge project.

00:02:43.968 --> 00:02:47.924
What we really wanted to do was release it along a longer period of time 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.308
and incorporate in that player feedback as we go along. 

00:02:51.343 --> 00:02:52.797
We care what the players think 

00:02:52.832 --> 00:02:56.397
and that's one of the reasons why we're not releasing it all in one go, 

00:02:56.432 --> 00:03:00.285
we want to do it module by module and get player feedback as we go along 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.437
and I think that'll help us shape the website in the future. 

00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:06.684
The pages which will be included in that first update will be the home page, 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.702
the news section and one which I'm most looking forward to, the new high scores. 

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:14.165
Mod ThatJim will be back next week 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.253
showing us all how RuneScape 3's interface is shaping up thanks to community feedback...

00:03:19.288 --> 00:03:20.597
what a guy.
