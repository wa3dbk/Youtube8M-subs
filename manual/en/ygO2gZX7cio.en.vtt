00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:09.820
Fear not for when he issues his mighty battle
cry the world will be saved.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.700
Heya playas!

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.039
Wouldn't it be awesome to be a superhero?

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.180
Superheroes, they've been around since the
beginning of, well, forever.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.769
Whether it's biblical warriors fighting off
dragons or Greek soldiers battling cyclops'

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.279
heroes can be found in every single epic tale
told.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.620
So if superheroes existed then, can we say
that they exist now?

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.429
Yes we can but, the concept of the superhero
has shifted to more military and government

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:41.429
powers.

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.089
The idea of a vigilante such as myself is
dying out and is shunned upon by most people.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.459
Fear not for there are vigilantes still out
there such as Phoenix Jones in Seattle, Red

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:54.149
Voltage in Salt Lake City or Teriffica in
New York.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.989
Yes, these are real people and they're out
there fighting crime for your benefit.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.769
They wear body armor, they carry mace and
even use whistles.

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:02.850
Whistles!

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.880
But it leaves me to ask the question that
ancient philosophers used to ask, who watches

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.880
the watchmen?

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.390
You see, there is no proper training for these
vigilantes like there is for the police and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.409
therefore they're allowed to carry out justice
in whatever way they see fit.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.560
So if a person is elected to administer justice,
who makes sure that they don't step out of

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.670
line and become a super villain?

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.310
I guess the boring laws do, which is a good
thing because it helps somewhat stop the nut

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.420
jobs from calling themselves vigilantes and
causing havoc.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.300
So, should people be allowed to govern themselves?

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.399
I mean, the police can only be in so many
places at one time.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.590
I could think of a lot of neighborhoods that
not only deserve to have their own private

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.420
vigilante force but actually have a task force
to patrol the neighborhood at night.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.579
Sure, wearing a superhero costume may get
you some funny looks and may antagonize drunk

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.299
people to want to pick fights with you.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.970
But it's all part of the job.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.070
You see, Freud said that when you wear a costume
you become the character you're trying to

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.070
portray.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.291
It allows you to step outside your limiting
reality to embrace the concept behind the

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.539
superhero to accomplish extraordinary things.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.611
Which is why when it's late at night on a
weekend and you're completely trash and you

00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:04.020
need a way back, the sober Super Josh will
be there.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.960
But don't take advantage of that because I
can only fly so fast with this cape.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.099
Like this video if you support the superhero
vigilante community, leave a comment letting

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.209
me know, who would you put more trust in a
vigilante superhero or a police officer and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.099
subscribe to the channel to show Super Josh
some support because maybe one day I'll reveal

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.590
my secret identity.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.590
Just kidding.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.530
As always, love and peace!

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.890
Oh, I'm going that way.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.900
I am in desperate need of a battle cry.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.560
I am the terror that flaps in the night, not
that's taken.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560
Spoon!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.560
No I've heard that before.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.090
Cowabunga dude, no that's just a blatant rip
off.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.430
To infinity and beyond!

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.019
He's not even a superhero.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.129
It's clobbering time!

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.540
Isn't that like a Spongebob quote?

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.590
Hurrapowers activate!

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.409
No, I'm not even going there.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.030
I got nothing, any suggestions?
