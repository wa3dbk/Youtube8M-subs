What's up everybody. This is Ahmed Dirie with Tackle the Kitchen. And today, we're going

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.640
to tackle an issue that many of us deal with
on a regular basis. That darn sweet tooth.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.060
You know what I'm talking about. Sugar. Sugar is one of the many reasons why so many of

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.680
us fall off our healthy eating habits.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.000
You know, I gotta be honest with you. Sometimes, sweet stuff are just too good to pass up on.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.880
Thankfully, we can curb our cravings for sugar by making our own dessert where we know exactly

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.540
what it was made with.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.590
Alright. So, today... today's recipe is sweet
potato brownies. And the best part about it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.470
is, it is not only sweet, but it has no processed sugar.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.530
So you know it. I'm already in the kitchen.
Let's throw it down.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.420
Here's the list of ingredients you'll need
for this recipe.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.650
One thing to keep in mind is that you can
buy prepackaged oat flour, or make your own.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.530
Grab regular rolled oats and grind it yourself.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.820
Without peeling the sweet potatoes, boil them for 20 minutes till it becomes soft. You should

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.439
be able to peel it afterwards without hassle.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.170
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and we'll
go ahead and start with the ingredients.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.930
Once you've peeled the sweet potatoes, start mashing it up in a mixing bowl.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.560
Add in your oat flour.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.409
Pour the egg whites into the bowl and then
pour in the pureed apples or apple sauce.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.900
Add in the baking powder and then pour in
the organic honey.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.159
Finally, let's go ahead and add the cocoa
powder and then start mixing.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.930
Basically, mix it until all your ingredients
are well combined.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.040
If you're feeling a little nutty, like me,
what you can do is add in some pecans as well

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.070
as some walnuts. And make sure you mix it
all up.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.979
Spray the pan with a little coconut oil and
then pour in your mixture.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.049
With a spatula, even it all out.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.820
Put it in the oven for 30 minutes. To know
that it's ready, poke in a toothpick or spaghetti.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.890
If it comes out clean, you're done.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.530
Let it sit for 15 minutes and then serve.
