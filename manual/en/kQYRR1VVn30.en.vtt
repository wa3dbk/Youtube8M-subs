Hi this is Yolanda from Vanveen bulbs dot
com. And in this segment we are going to learn

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.240
all about how to control bagworms. Now bagworms
are generally found east of the Rocky Mountain,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.150
so they are not a big problem in the west
coast. Luckily. But they have become a problem

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.810
on the east coast. Now what happens is there's
some moths that lay their eggs in these bags.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.159
They look just like a silken bag. And they
hang from pine trees. And so when you look

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:34.250
at them they look just like little bags hanging
from a tree. And you are wondering what is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.070
that. Well inside those bags there's thousands
of little eggs. And so when they hatch they

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.469
make these little larvae that get all over
our trees and eat all the needles and into

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.609
the wood and it will do a lot of damage to
your trees. So there's a few ways that you

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.800
can control them. So the first thing that
you should do is always rake up all of your

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.609
pine cones in your leaves under the trees.
And when it looks like a pine cone in the

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.990
tree it might actually be a bag worm because
they look just like a pine cone. So whenever

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.210
you find them in the fall pull them down and
get rid of them physically. That's the first

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.119
thing that you should do. So in early spring,
the caterpillar hatch out of the bags. So

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.369
it is at that time that you can try to control
them chemically. So there's a spray that you

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.700
can use and it's called the Bacillus thuringiensis
and it's an organic control for caterpillars

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.640
and you spray the whole tree down in early
spring. You can't really kill the larvae until

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.770
they've hatched so you want to make sure and
spray them as soon as they come out of their

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.770
little bags. And BT as it's also known is
safe to animals but it also kills all types

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.860
of caterpillars so it will kill every type
of butterfly in your yard. So only use it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.840
as a last resort. A preventative measure that
a lot of people have been using is actually

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.430
spraying down the trees with some oil. Whether
it be vegetable oil or soybean oil it actually

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.560
protects the trees because of the little bagworms
cannot live with the oil. It breaks down their

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.320
little coverings. So there's lots of easy
ways and lots of information on the internet.
