00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.380
So these are some of the supplies you'll want
to use if you're making aromatherapy blends.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.549
Whether you're making bath salts or oils and
lotions or misters, one good thing to have

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:19.130
is just a glass or ceramic container, a bowl
is easy, so that if you're mixing something,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.830
for example, bath salts, you can kind of pour
here and then it's landing, whatever is extra

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.810
is landing in the bowl and it's easier to
contain and it's also something that's easier

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.441
to clean up. Essential oils will have a really
strong scent to them, so if you're, if you're

00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:43.210
using a glass container or ceramic container,
and then you're going to wash that afterward,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.719
that's a little bit better than say using
a wooden bowl or letting any spillage go onto

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.840
a wooden surface. This is actually a solution
of half water and half witch hazel and this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.250
is what I use to clean my droppers. And ideally
if you're going to be blending various kinds

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.970
of essential oils, you want to use one dropper
for each essential oil and then rinse it with

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.729
the witch hazel and water by squeezing the
dropper, and then wash this with soap and

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.409
water as best you can. And try to keep one
dropper for each type of essential oil so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.040
that you're not mixing one oil to the next
and contaminating the whole container. The

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.630
other thing you're going to want is, say you're
making bath salts, you want some kind of container

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.409
that you can put it into. And you know you
can go to Pier One or Cost Plus and they have

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.950
pretty little jars like this that are really
nice. There are companies online, there's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.750
a company called SKS and they sell these blue
bottles and they're just a clear or excuse

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:02.830
me, almost clear, blue bottle and those are
really great for lotions. Containers for massage

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.890
oils are good. Plastic isn't usually the best
way to put, to contain massage oil. It's better

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.970
to get some kind of a glass bottle with a
squirt top. Another great thing if you're

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.100
making essential oil products with, like bath
products, Epsom salts. That's a wonderful

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.190
product. Go to any drug store, two dollars
and ninety nine cents for three pounds. Very

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.000
cheap, and actually whether you buy Epsom
salts in a drug store or in a fancy boutique,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.061
it doesn't matter what the packaging is, it
is always the same thing inside that package.

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:42.140
So it doesn't matter how much you spend on
it, you're always going to get the same thing.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.600
So get them cheaply if you can. May as well.
So having some good containers if you're going

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.650
to blend a big batch of bath salts, sometimes
having a big container that you can mix things

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.770
in is really nice, you know, just get what
you like. Another good thing is a mask. You

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.261
might know, you might like a certain formula
and know how you make it and you want to make

00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:11.330
another batch of that, but if you are exposed
to the essential oils for an hour, you might

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.460
feel a little bit giddy and funny, so you
can wear a mask so it doesn't give you a headache

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.800
or make you a little bit giddy to be having
that extra amount of time that you're with

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.110
the open essential oils. Also, rubber gloves
are very good. You really don't want to get

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.300
the raw essential oil on your skin ever if
you can avoid it. It should always be in some

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.100
kind of carrier like oil, massage oil, or
in some kind of salts for bath salts or whatever.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.220
You don't ever want it to go directly onto
your skin. And one final thing which is kind

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.630
of unusual, is we don't have it in front of
us, but a little bit of milk is good. If you're

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.290
going to put essential oils into your bath
or if you're going to put bath salts with

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.100
essential oils into your bath, you can put
a tablespoon or two of milk into the bath

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.150
with them and that helps to break up the oil
that goes onto the surface of the water. So

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.430
these are some of the kinds of tools that
you're going to use when you make essential

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.970
oil blends.
