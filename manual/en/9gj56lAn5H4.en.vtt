00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.360
I'm proud to be able to say I'm a marine and that I  made this

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.360
but I'm even more so proud to be able to say that I did this for my mom.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.150
Hadn't it been for the Marine Corps I think I probably wouldn't have had it  

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.830
in me, truthfully, to really push forward.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.170
I was a small-arms repair technician so I was the guy that fixed all the Marine's guns.  

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.750
That instilled a lot of values and a lot of 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.369
trade in me to learn how to work and
do things with my hands.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.230
You know, I know tools and I understand
having the right tool for the job is paramount.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.710
I was heading in to go to work one day and I had to stop by the house and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.770
I go out to the studio and my mom-I heard her like

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.660
she was really fussing. And she's fussing at her machine.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.100
She says, "I can't believe how much money I've spent on these machines and this is the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.720
kind of crap they give you to work on."

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.830
And what she was referring to was the screwdrivers or the equipment 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.020
that comes with the sewing machines.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.840
And she said "if I have this problem,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.140
I promise you, every quilter has this problem."

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.950
It wasn't something that I was doing for myself. 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.160
This was something that I started for my mother, doing something to make her proud.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.990
Her resume is so deep

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.270
probably thirty years of, you know, working with fabric and being a fiber artist.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.320
She's been in the Smithsonian.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.100
She's received awards all over the globe.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.830
When I'm at some of the quilt shows half the traffic that comes to the booth

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.140
is-they stop because they want to look
at Mom's quilts.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.290
The attention to detail, the time, and

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.580
the passion that I know, that I've seen first hand

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.790
that my mom puts into these quilts, that's just a work ethic

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.150
that I believe honest in my heart that was instilled in me by my mother.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.930
And this has been an amazing opportunity to say "Thanks, Mom." You know.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.000
(laughs)

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.130
My name is Joseph McCraw and I am the creator of 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.950
Screw B Do.
