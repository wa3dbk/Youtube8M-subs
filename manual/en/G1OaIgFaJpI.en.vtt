00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.849
Beardlovers, sup.

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:02.849
Sup.

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:04.540
Go on!

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.540
Sup!

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.540
Sup.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.700
To eat or drink or engage in eating or drinking
by taking small swallows or mouthfuls.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.820
And you better sup soon or your food's gonna
get cold and I'll have to make an EXPLOSION

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.299
to make it warm again because it's EXPLOSION
Wednesday, which I'm not sure is an official

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.299
thing yet.

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:18.299
Still trying it out.

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:19.299
So... sup?

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:20.380
No, don't eat.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380
I'm over that.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm just saying what's up?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.839
Ever heard of slang?

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.449
Speaking of things getting cold, it's friggin'
COLD here now.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.660
I don't like it!

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.660
Bbbrrrrrrrrr.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.660
Shivers shivers.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.550
It is becoming dangerously unlikely that I
will refrain from wearing pants.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.180
Temperature sensitive, my naughty bits are.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.980
I don't know why I did a Yoda impression there
at all.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.980
I have no idea.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.860
So how do you stay warm when the outside is
a hellish, barren, frozen tundra in which

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.200
not even love can survive?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.720
I'll never let go, Jack.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.940
I'll never let go.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940
She let go.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.050
And he went pfft straight to the bottom of
the ocean.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.050
Dead.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.050
Like love in the cold.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.190
That's why Midwesterners are always so nice.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.070
They have to overcompensate for when the cold
takes the affection away.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.290
Am I being overdramatic?

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.820
I don't even know anymore.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.010
My mind is numb.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.510
Ah crap, the heat just kicked in.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.560
It's gonna ruin the sound.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.560
Just a second.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.560
Turn that off.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.560
There we go.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.880
So here's some easy ways to stay warm during
the months when it's so cold that you question

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.640
whether we were put on this planet to suffer
or to suffer a lot.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.859
If it's Wednesday, I highly recommend EXPLOSIONS.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:14.859
Ahhh.

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:15.859
They are warm.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.150
Though they are fleeting, so I recommend using
a lot of them.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.150
EXPLOSION!

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.150
EXPLOSION!

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.150
EXPLOSION!

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.150
EXPLOSION!

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.150
EXPLOSION!

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.270
If you don't like a lot of explosions because
you're a "wuss-bag" or "nun" or "war activist

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.960
hippie," it helps to have a lot of flammable
stuff around, because then you only need one

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960
explosion.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.490
And that explosion can make sweet hot love
to the flammable stuff and leave behind its

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.819
explosion babies.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:35.819
Or fire.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.130
Hippies, you have a lot of flammable stuff
around.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.759
You know what I'm talking about.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.759
Scraggly beards.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:41.759
You have a lot of scraggly beards.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.759
Careful, though.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:43.759
Don't light those on fire.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.759
They're on your face.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.570
Another way to stay warm is to watch my videos
because I've been told I have a warm personality.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.909
AHAHAHAHAHAHA!

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.659
Also, I'm really hot.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:53.659
AHAHAHAHAHA!

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.780
It's also good to drink a warm beverage.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.780
I keep a stockpile.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.340
I simply heat up a bunch of glasses of water
in the microwave and then to preserve that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.340
heat, I put 'em in the fridge.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.890
If you wanna preserve it for a long period
of time, put that hot water in the freezer.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.619
It's also good, because when you grab your
hot water from the fridge and you want a little

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.259
heat boost, you just grab that extra hot water
from the freezer.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.950
And as I always say, there's nothing more
comfortable than some warm tears.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.000
If you're having trouble bringing the tears,
think of something sad.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.129
She told Jack she'd never let go.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.739
She let go.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.180
Consider a portable space heater.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.740
Or in my case, a light saber.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.420
This thing keeps me warm everywhere I go.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.420
Ahhh.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.420
Cozy.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.420
Mmm.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.989
Ooh, getting a little hot.

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:38.989
Ahh.

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:39.989
That's better.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.989
Hey Wheezy.

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.939
Oh hey, Carl.

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.310
My arm!

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.310
Oh god!

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.519
Where'd I get this anyway?

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.519
Oh yeah.

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.700
A few weeks ago I went to Lucasfilm in San
Francisco.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.079
I bet it's warm there now.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.079
It was warm when I went.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.489
I got some footage of it.

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.489
Wanna see?

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.489
Thanks, guys.

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.810
I love Star Trek.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.019
So do you wanna cut up stuff with a light
saber too?

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.599
Who doesn't, am I right?

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.599
Am I right?

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.599
Emma, write!

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.599
Write something!

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.599
You're never gonna be an author if you don't
write!

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.209
Anyway, here's an app you can download called
Brisksaber so you can cut stuff up with a

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.209
light saber.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.430
Oh, whoop... it's not working!

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.430
Oh.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.570
Don't use a real light saber on it.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.700
Shiver me timbers!

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.010
Don't use a real light saber on it.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.010
Use your finger.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.010
Oh, this is good fun!

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.930
All the violence without all the consequences.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.470
Link in the doobly-doo to download this.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.470
Hmm.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.470
Slice you, I will.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.470
I'm a dork.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.439
I think girls would be really good at this
game.

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.470
I always see 'em using this finger motion
at me.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.739
No.

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.049
Get away from me.

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.049
Creepo.

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.760
Guys, check it out.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.580
This is awesome.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.469
It's me.

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.349
It's me.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.180
Limbs are popping!
