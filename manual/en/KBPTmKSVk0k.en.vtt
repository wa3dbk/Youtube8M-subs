00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.279
also wanted to point out that during the whole thing, that debacle during

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.029
Tmobile's release  of  the iphone five
that it took so long

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.399
for the computers just weren't working

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.379

years years, but here it is ladies and gentlemen

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.930
off the bat

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.790
obviously we have seen tons of unboxings
from here on youtube we've seen a lot

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.950
of reviews of them on youtube but what
makes this from different if that is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.339
exactly for  Tmobile

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.479
there is no tmobile branding on the phone

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.399
which is a good thing, um yea

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.979
it is exclusively for
tmobile now

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:03.979
very excited uh... got mine unlocked
too  already

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.499
but check it out

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.779
you may be wondering okay it's just
another iphone blah zay blah

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.619
no big deal.....Right!

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:14.629
but you got to remember

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.809
Tmobiles Broadband

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.509
thing

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.829
whatever its called...

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.120
works on a whole different radio frequency

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.309
what that means is that any of the iPhones
Could

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.629
work on tmobile but you're not going
to get the AWS, 4G LTE speeds

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.599
and just to make sure that this is actually a tmobile phone

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.639
