Hi I'm Judith Kingsbury of savvyvegetarian.com
Welcome to my kitchen!

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.349
Today I am going to cook Millet!

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.529
Now you might be thinking, oh Millet isn't
that bird seed or hippie food?

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:35.250
Well, yes to both of those and it's also extremely
nutritious, just as nutritious as quinoa,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.660
if not more so.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.750
Plus it is 1/5th the price of quinoa.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.700
So in my books millet is the new quinoa.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.250
The first thing I'm going to do is cook some
basic millet.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.980
The way that I like to cook it is to toast
it and then add some boiling water.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.899
Two and a half cups of water to one cup of
millet

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.890
A little bit of salt, bring it back to a boil.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.780
Put the lid on and cook it for 20 to 25 minutes.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.090
Now I've got my sautÃ© pan heating up here
and I'm going to stir and toast this millet.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.760
Until it starts to turn a nice golden brown
color.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.680
Here's my millet, this is the kind of millet
that you find in North America, the one that

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.470
they feed to birds.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.030
I've got the heat on medium high.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.400
Stirring all the while.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.390
No oil, there is no oil in the pan.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.040
I read somewhere that if it starts popping,
then you've got the heat too high.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.909
Mine is popping so I turned it down a bit.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.880
It's starting to turn color now.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.670
Maybe a little more.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.390
I think that this is roasted now, it's not
burnt but it's definitely roasted.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.690
That is roasted quinoa, no sorry.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.979
That is roasted millet!

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.610
Got quinoa on the brain here.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.989
What I need is two and a half cups of boiling
water.

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.473
Add a little salt, just use about a quarter
of a teaspoon.

00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:20.239
Add the boiling water.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:39.099
Put the lid on, set my timer for twenty minutes.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.950
You do bring it to a boil.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.430
It boils as soon as you put the boiling water
in.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.279
When you roast it, it cooks up really nice
and dry and fluffy.

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.409
When you don't roast it, it tends to be gummier.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.320
Which doesn't matter if you're going to use
it to make cereal or put it in a stew or something

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.320
like that.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.109
But if you want to serve it with a nice sauce,
like a vegetable say coconut curry sauce or

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:18.469
a mushroom gravy sauce, then ya, you want
it nice and dry and fluffy.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.719
And it smells really good.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.549
Does it taste kind of like nutty?

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.340
Well we can taste it and find out.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.799
It needs vegetables and Sauces..

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.180
Ya definitely.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:39.309
But it's like avocado, it almost has no taste
at all until you put something with it.

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:40.309
Right.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:41.309
It's bland.

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:45.950
Well quinoa has a real distinct taste and
some people object to that.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.189
But this, this is not going to offend anybody,
it's like rice you know.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:56.249
This is just plain cooked millet, no roasting
or anything like that.

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.430
This morning I used it to make some millet
chickpea patties.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:09.749

So now this is a millet and mung dahl stew.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.909
Something quick and comforting and satisfying
that you can make for dinner.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.520
Especially if you have already cooked dahl
and millet in the fridge.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.290
Even if you don't.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.620
It just takes twenty minutes to half an hour
to cook those things.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.570
And you can always make extra.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.030

This is my flat bread dough that I make.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.680
I use millet flour, oat flour and a combination
of different starches.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.270

So in the morning you can make millet porridge.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.259
Just use some of this cooked millet and a
couple of cups of non-dairy milk, some raisins,

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.479
nuts, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.919
Chocolate?

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.360
Ya.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.810
Cinnimon.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.680
Really pretty versatile, you can have it for
breakfast, lunch or dinner.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.889
And in many parts of the world they do just
exactly that.

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.699
We don't have to do that, we are very lucky
here that we have other things that we can

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:26.290
eat but if you feel like you're missing out
on quinoa because it's so expensive, hey just

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.770
go for millet.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.990
Thanks for joining me to make millet.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.560
Enjoy your millet whatever and I'll see you
next time!
