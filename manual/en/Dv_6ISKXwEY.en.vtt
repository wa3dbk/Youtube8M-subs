00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.620
 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.120
Hi everyone. So today we're taking a look at the Samsung wireless

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.219
charging pad.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.129
Now this particular device is designed
for the Samsung Galaxy S6

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.380
but it will also work with any device
that happens to support the wireless

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.840
charging standard,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.029
sometimes known as QI. Now, 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.210
what's really interesting about what Samsung have done here is they've kind of taken a bit of an 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.640
industrial 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.800
design point of view with these charging
units. We had all sorts of different wireless

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.710
chargers from

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.590
things stuck on angles to pillows and
all sorts of different things.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.030
But Samsung here have gone for something that looks quite industrially designed really.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.320
It fits in with the Samsung range quite
nicely but doesn't necessarily

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.590
leave me feeling like they've created a
brand new paradigm of design

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.820
or anything like that.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.050
It's functional but more importantly it
does lie flat

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.570
unlike many chargers. These wireless
chargers, like I say, we've seen

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.680
a variety of different funny styles but
certainly the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.310
most successful in my opinion is the one
which allows the smartphone to sit flat

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.890
on top of the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.250
charger.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.020
Now, it all works pretty well I have to
say.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.690
Charging is slower than plugged into the
dedicated charger that comes with the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.590
Samsung Galaxy S6 and you do lose that
rapid charging

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.720
option there. The option that effectively will allow you to charge the device

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.680
in just over an hour to full power. But that
said there is some real convenience here,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.100
from being able to simply pop your device
onto the pad

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.220
and then pick it up again to use your device whenever you want, no messing around with

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.840
cables.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.280
What I found was the Samsung Galaxy S6 spent more time on charge

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.180
because of this because

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.619
I'm not having to worry about going and
finding the cable or anything like that.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.240
Essentially this can live on a coffee table, anybody who needs a bit of charge

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.420
can just pop their device straight down on top of it. 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.140
Now this retails for £40, is this good value for money?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.569
Well, in a word, no. It isn't good value for
money at all.

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.470
£40 is a heck of a premium for what amounts to a wireless charger.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.380
I picked this up actually for £10 because Samsung very kindly sent me a

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.000
£30 voucher 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.170
for their Samsung store. It came effectively with my Galaxy S6 as a reward for

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.829
ordering the device from Samsung. However, if I'd been asked to pay £40

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.239
for this

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.860
I'm afraid I probably would've passed. There simply isn't enough here in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.250
that which is all you get in the box to
really warrant,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.720
well £40. Like I say Samsung cheaped out to the point

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.350
where they didn't even bother to put a
USB charging cable in the box.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.739
Apparently you're supposed to just use the one that comes with your phone  which is all

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:30.440
well and good

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.000
unless you happen to want to set up
multiple charging points, you know, wired

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.380
cable downstairs perhaps

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.880
and the wireless charger upstairs on your  office desk. Not so here

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.910
Samsung would like to charge you about £18 for a cable,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.000
yes a USB cable £18, and about £30 for a charger. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.310
It's bonkers, it's unrealistic and it's
the typical price gouging we see from

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.359
market-leading companies for accessories.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.450
But the Samsung wireless charger does
work exceptionally well.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.680
It does what it says on the tin and it does it competently and it also does it whilst looking

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.590
reasonably nice while sat on your table.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.120
However at £40 it really isn't

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.470
enough here to justify that price point. When these drop in price

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.129
they would be worth buying. Around a
£20 item, that's what this is really

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.849
worth here.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.640
If you're interested in wireless
charging, well the Galaxy S6 supports

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.860
wireless charging standards

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.230
so you don't have to buy Samsung's device. You could quite easily buy it from

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.959
absolutely anywhere. Literally just make
sure the wireless charging pad

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.849
supports the wireless charging standard
and it will work with the Galaxy S6.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.860
That should allow you to get the wireless
charging you need

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.860
for less than Samsung are charging.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.849
