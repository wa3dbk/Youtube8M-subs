00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.750
Where are you Christmas? 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.870
Why can't I find you?
Hey Ora-buddies. 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.019
It's me Morgan the Orabrush tongue. 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.829
You know what I am getting sick of?

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:19.829
Is all of the commercialism surrounding Christmas. 
It really tans my hide. It's all presents, presents, presents. 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.330
all the time

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.349
Make a buck, make a buck. 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.189
What was sacred is now saving, and the only thing divine is discounts. 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.160
Gratitude has now been replaced by greed. 
(Creepy voice calls) Morgan! 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.790
I am sick of it! 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.220
Tell me what you like about christmas in the
comments below one thing's for sure

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.390
if we don't say goodbye to greed. We can say goodbye to all that is good

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.760
about Christmas. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.160
(Creepy ghost voices) Morgan! 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.930
Orabrush guy. 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.150
Hey, whats up?

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.060
well people complaining about the
commercialism of Christmas, and ignoring its 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.180
positives. 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.990
So Morgan, tonight you will be visited by three ghosts, so you can get a clue. 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.990
NO!

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.049
Watch your mouth. I am the ghost of pre-Christmas shopping. 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.370
Listen. This is the one time of year I get to shop 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.360
day in

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.560
 and day out. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250
and not be criticized for being a shopaholic. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.750
people actually call me generous. 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.410
So if you want to make a buch of teenage girls and mom really angry, 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.160
sure, take the commercialism out of Christmas, I dare you. 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.220
Holy @#$^

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.700
Watch your mouth. I am the ghost of Christmas

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.610
presents. 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.839
I don't know what kind of pampered childhood you had, but

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.510
this is the only time of year that I get much from my parents. 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.869
mom and dad save all year so they can give me a few things 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.519
that will bring me joy all next year. 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.309
If you want to get rid of

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:26.569
 presents at Christmas time,

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.139
Ill raise an angry army of 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.120
pre-teens 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.519
and we will hunt you down tongue man. 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.739
Wake up!

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.979
4:00 AM!

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:44.269
Time to go shopping!

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.259
The spirit I fear most of all. 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.349
I am the ghost of the day after Christmas sale. 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.079
I know.... 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.379
Listen up tongue man! 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.099
You know that the shopping that takes place between Christmas and New Years, drives this economy. 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.510
Yeah... 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.980
and one of the ways out of this recession  is to spend our way out. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.359
I am a small business owner. 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.620
Small business owners like me 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.270
make up 90% of the of the business during this time of the year. 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.169
You want to steal from my family. 
No!

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:21.079
You want to take food off of my daughters plate?
No! Never! 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.260

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.449

I can change! 
I don't believe you! 
I can change! 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:39.969
Ill go into credit card debt! 
What else are you going to do?!
I'll spend all year round as if it were December! 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.520

Christmas is a time when people's hearts change. 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.149
