Hi, I’m Cameron from Kingston. Today we’re going to show you how to install an SSD drive into your computer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Kingston’s SSD Upgrade Bundle is designed to make upgrading from a traditional hard drive to a solid-state drive fast and easy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Before beginning installation, it is important to verify that the SSD provided in the kit is larger in capacity than the “Used Space” on the system hard drive you’re replacing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:37.000
To determine the “Used Space” on your hard drive, boot your computer to your desktop, double-click on My Computer and then single right-click on the C: drive and select Properties.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If the “Used Space” is greater than the capacity of the SSD, you must temporarily move some of your data such as pictures, movies, and music off of the drive to an alternative data source such as an external hard drive or USB Flash drive until the “Used Space” is less than the new SSD capacity. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
After the cloning portion of the installation is completed, these files can be moved back to their original location on the hard drive.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Turn off the power to your computer, disconnect the power source and remove the battery pack from your notebook.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The hard drive in a notebook is usually accessible by removing a panel from the bottom of your notebook.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Remove the system hard drive from your notebook and disassemble the system drive bracket.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Next, open the external drive enclosure included in the kit, switch the lock to the unlock position and slide the two panels apart. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000
To assemble the system hard drive together with the external drive enclosure, align the pins of the hard drive to the SATA connector on the enclosure and push them together until the drive is securely in place.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then align the top and bottom panels of the enclosure and slide them together.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
To secure the enclosure, switch the lock to the lock position.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Next we will install the SSD in your notebook and attach the external drive enclosure.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Assemble the SSD with the system drive bracket and insert the drive into the drive bay of the notebook.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Using the USB cable provided in the kit, attach the system hard drive installed in the external drive enclosure to your notebook via any available USB port.
