00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In 1914, a young soldier wrote home to tell
his family and friends about Christmas spent

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.230
in the trenches of World War One. “It was
a memorable day.” he said. “From Christmas

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.230
Eve to Boxing Day, not a shot being fired.”
In this centenary year, we’re again reminded

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.329
of the importance of these brief informal
truces, which gave soldiers on both sides

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.289
a moment’s respite from that violent conflict,
and which, in the decades since, have come

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.660
to symbolise the power of Christmas to bring
people together, even in the most challenging

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.309
of circumstances.
At the heart of this festival is the birth

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.660
of Jesus Christ, a time of joy and celebration
for Christians around the world. Yet the core

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.660
values this story represents - love, charity,
hope – are universal, speaking to and uniting

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.620
people of all faiths and none.
This Christmas and beyond, we can each do

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.360
our bit to help secure the fairer, more peaceful
world that the soldiers in 1914 longed for,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.220
and our children deserve. Reaching out to
those people – wherever they may be - who

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.740
feel isolated, who are caught up in conflict
or who need our help.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.450
This is also our chance to say thank you to
the countless men and women working so hard

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.990
at home and abroad to keep us safe and well
over the festive period. That includes of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.130
course our armed forces and their families
who sacrifice so much for our country. Our

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.840
emergency service workers and all those caring
for others this Christmas.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.500
Thank you, and may I wish everyone a merry
Christmas and a very happy and healthy New

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.850
Year.
