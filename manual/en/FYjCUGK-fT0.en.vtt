00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The Frank Lloyd Wright living room was built overlooking Lake Minnetonka, outside of Minneapolis.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.567
From the window you would see a distant view of the lake and lots of sky.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:27.266
The room is so permeable that you are almost outdoors, while you feel protected and safe,

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:31.834
you almost are in a large tent in the woods. This was sort of my first step into Modernism,

00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:38.734
which after this I began to appreciate more and more.

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:42.433
Wright had gone to Europe; his designs became simpler.

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.500
The chairs and the tables

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:54.634
have no moldings, they tend to be a lighter wood. It’s using very much just the vocabulary of line, rather than the vocabulary of naturalistic forms.

00:00:54.634 --> 00:01:02.166
This is the only room, I would believe in the period rooms, that actually had electricity.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:08.000
There’s this technological change that’s happening.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.367
Mrs. Little was trained as a pianist in Cologne,

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:18.700
was apparently quite good, and wanted to use this room for dual purposes:

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.433
both to have the family live there and use it and enjoy it, but her piano was

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:30.367
firmly planned as part of the room.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:37.334
She always meant to be able to give small concerts.

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:44.734
Although it’s probably about fourteen feet high,

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:50.533
it comes off as low, horizontal room.

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:55.133
You’re both in a space that feels comfortable,

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:58.133
but at the same time

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:08.467
feels very grand. Wright is working with piercing every wall and trying to get light from all directions.

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:14.266
A lot of people do think that the skylight is the sky. It isn’t a skylight, it’s a light fixture.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:18.334
He intentionally made the living room, a free-standing pavilion.

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:24.300
The most important room in the house, is gonna be its own structure. It’s a country house, you’re there to relax, and the space

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:37.400
somehow transmits that. It is a room that engenders great relaxation, great calmness, great peace.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:49.567
I don’t think there’s any other room that I know that makes me feel quite like this. This is a work of art meant to be lived in.
