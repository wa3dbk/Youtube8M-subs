00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.940
Hi everybody I'm John Graden from the Martial
Arts Teacher's Association and johngraden.com.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.910
This is the back leg side kick. I love to
kick. Two ways to do it. One, form traditional

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
where we are going to lock it out, show the
lines, demonstrate our technique, that's what

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.210
traditional karate is. It is a demonstration
of ancient techniques. We do them as accurately

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.980
as possible to honor the arts and I love that.
The other way to throw it is more practical

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.180
and a fighting scenario where we are not going
to hold it out and we are going to fire it

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.579
and recover so here is what it looks like.
When I throw a back leg side kick I'm going

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.500
to come right at you with it so get ready.
I am going to bring the knee right under my

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.510
body and once it comes across this foot has
to pivot hard and far. Ideally it is going

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.480
to go 180. What does that mean? Toes are pointed
forward, now the heel faces you and that is

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.180
a 180 pivot it goes all the way around. It
doesn't have to be a 180, 160 or 170 is fine

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.329
but shoot for a 180. So what I am doing now
is I am going to bring the knee across my

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.040
body and then thrust it straight into you
with the back leg side kick. I am hitting

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:12.179
with the heel, most beginners rather than
bringing it across and kicking straight out

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:17.899
they will not get it across, aim the shin
and end up doing a sloppy roundhouse kick.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.630
You know better than to do that so I'm going
to bring the knee across, thrust it out and

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.020
then bring it right back to me. Straight out
and straight back. Watch again. Shoulders

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.069
are relaxed, the shoulder is going to come
all the way through, back leg, side kick.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.310
As this leg is coming through I want to take
this forearm and lead with it because I don't

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.359
want to get hit in the stomach with his side
kick on the way in. See this is a big move,

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.049
that can be a really wide open target. So
as I am doing this technique I am protecting

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.290
against a potential counter attack by keeping
my elbow in the center so I am here straight

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.190
through, back leg side kick. Great technique,
strike with the heel and that's the back leg

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.309
side kick. I'm John Graden. Thank you.
