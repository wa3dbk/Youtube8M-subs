00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.320
Sighs. Why does no one like my restaurant? 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.819
Oh what!? Who are you?

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.450
&gt;Me? I'm Chobae!
Where did you come from!?
&gt;Oh haven't you noticed me before? 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.289
&gt; I've always been around that wall.
Are you serious...

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.749
&gt;By the way, you look so bored!

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.259
Hey, don't you think you are too friendly? 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.220
 I'm depressed at the moment.
&gt;What's wrong?

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.720
No one likes my restaurant...

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.510
&gt;Maybe it's over priced? 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.999
No way! Beef Noodle is only 200YEN!

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:40.470
&gt;Oh really! Isn't that too cheap? 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.200
&gt; It probably tastes really bad!
No! It's great! 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.450
You are very rude! 
I have a few costumers and they say it tastes really good!

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.900
&gt;Yeah, actually it looks pretty good.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.530
Maybe this place is dirty.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.379
&gt;Well, I wouldn't say it's clean, 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.929
&gt;but you don't have cockroaches or mice, do you? That's clean enough.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.710
You think?

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.210
&gt;Yeah, do you use fine ingredients?
You really are rude. 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.310
Of course I do!
&gt;But you still get profits out of 200YEN noodle, right?
What?

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.909
&gt;You can't expect it to be so popular being just cheap anymore. 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.190
&gt;How about make it a little bit more expensive and use better ingredients?
You...

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.550
&gt;If you improve the taste, 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.800
&gt;you will have more customers!

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.080
... you are very rude 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.560
but I must say, you are a good person. 
Thank you.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.539
&gt;&gt;Don't be taken in by his words.
Mr. Kanbayashi!

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.150
&gt;Who are you?

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.810
He is the oldest customer.
&gt;&gt;This beef noodle is already the best! 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.330
&gt;&gt;He is trying to trick you!!

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.450
Mr. Kanbayashi?
&gt;&gt;The reason you don't have many customers is his, 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.450
&gt;&gt;Chobae!
&gt;No no,
 you will have customers back once you make it better!
Who do you believe?
Chobae or Mr. Uebayash
