hi friends welcome to quick and easy
cooking

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.940
I'm Mrs.Vahchef Ragini thumma today
I'm going to show you one of my favorite

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.730
chutney in Telugu we call it as ullipaya karam
in English you can call it as

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.759
onion karam but this is very very tasty and
this goes excellent with Jowar ki roti

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.940
or even maize ki roti

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.480
millets roti anything which is dry this
goes

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.470
excellent so let's go ahead and make
this awesome chutney

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.580
this is totally wrong there is no
cooking process in this

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.130
so we need onions chopped onions
coriander powder some ginger some

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.890
chopped ginger some garlic chopped
garlic little bit salt garam masala

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.480
chili powder

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.509
so first here is ding chick in this add
little bit of ginger

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.750
if you want you can add ginger garlic paste
but i wanted fresh so i'm adding this

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.550
fresh ginger and freshly chopped garlic

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680
first we are going to make this paste

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.580
so this ginger garlic paste is all ready
now we are going to take this in a bowl

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.940
in this add chopped onions some
coriander powder all the ingredients you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.659
can use it as per your taste and chilli
powder garam masala powder and salt

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.229
be careful this we are going to eat it
just like that so little bit less salt

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.600
and just mix it once

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.770
now in this add oil if you want more
chili powder you can add more

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.850
I like little bit spicy for this jawar ki roti
because this is very

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.260
plain so with this we eat this with
a little bit more chili powder

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.470
so just that's it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.150
the onion karam is all ready we are going
to eat just like this only

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.100
nice crunchy crunchy onions

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.930
nice garam masala flavor fresh
ginger garlic paste you try it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.400
then you tell me how it is this is very
very very awesome

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.390
if you want you can add a little bit of
turmeric also to give you a little bit

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.180
of color but this is perfect for me

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.200
I love this whenever I make this jowar ki
roti or any rotis like dry rotis I

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.459
love to eat this

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.390
so I hope you're going to
try this wonderful chutney at your place

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.470
and serve this with jowar ki roti they're
going to enjoy it

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.120
so see you in another more interesting
homely cooking

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.959
