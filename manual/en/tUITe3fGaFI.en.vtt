00:00:00.973 --> 00:00:04.016
My name's Nicholas Keyawa, majoring in mechanical engineering.

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:07.108
My name's Matthew Keyawa, and I'm majoring in electrical engineering.

00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:09.013
I am 23 years old.

00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:13.960
Hmmm... I am...? 23...?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.680
My parents didn't know they were having twins.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.859
So they thought the baby was a fat baby, by the way, just one fat baby,

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.679
and it was gonna be due in December. But then it came along in November.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.597
Thanksgiving night. -On Thanksgiving night, mom goes into labor.

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:33.798
She goes to the hospital. There is a skeleton crew. Her doctor's not there.

00:00:33.798 --> 00:00:36.012
And bam! I come out. -He comes out. And then...

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:40.415
Doctor looks at my mom and says, "There's something else in there!" (laughter)

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.624
Then out he comes. -Then out I come. I'm not breathing initially,

00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:45.343
but they get me going eventually. -They get him going.

00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:46.977
As you can see, I'm still here.

00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:49.569
And no brain damage. -No brain damage.

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.835
I thought about what my life would be like without this guy right here.

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.069
I don't like it. (together) I would not like that life.

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.634
Because, you think about, he's always been by my side,

00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:00.840
so it's constantly having a study partner all the time

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.872
and someone who thinks like you but doesn't at the same time.

00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:07.904
He can make you see things that you never would have saw before on your own.

00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:10.975
It's like having a gateway into your own mind. -It is.

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:14.928
We both went into engineering because we both love science and mathematics

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:16.878
applied to real-world situations.

00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:21.096
I felt like, in the sciences, the more I understood about the world

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:25.159
and how things worked, I just felt, the more I understood myself in a way.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.940
I saw engineering and saw what type of careers it would lead to,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.126
and I immediately knew I wanted to do it.

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:34.230
Ditto on that. (laughter)

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.971
There's so many brilliant professors.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:37.427
I don't even call them professors. I call them my mentors.

00:01:37.427 --> 00:01:41.790
I think of them as mentors. The amount of involvement they give their students into.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.445
I mean, they give you so much academic research, work experience.

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:49.234
That's just one on one. They tell you what's out there. They tell you how to get it.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:53.232
And you can't really get that anywhere else at any other university really.

00:01:53.232 --> 00:01:55.604
We were tutors for the engineering department here at CSUN.

00:01:55.604 --> 00:01:58.056
He was a tutor for electrical, mechanical, civil, calculus--

00:01:58.056 --> 00:02:02.512
All disciplines of engineering. I was tutoring everyone that was coming in.

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:07.333
And it was a great position, seeing how people 's faces glow when they learn something.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.598
That just gave you such a rush.

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:12.260
And for them to understand it and for them to get it,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.164
I have to understand it and get it, in and out.

00:02:15.164 --> 00:02:20.369
So it really reinforced all my classes and all the knowledge that I gained at CSUN.

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:26.034
And I did the same thing. -Say "Ditto!" -Ditto. -Ditto.

00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:32.993
Graduating this May. Yeah! Okay. And I'm going to plan on staying here at CSUN

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:36.001
for my  master's in engineering, specifically, control systems.

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.710
To give you an idea of a control system, it would be like your

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.602
cruise control system in your car. That would be a control system.

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:45.278
Currently I'm working on the intelligent ground vehicle here at CSUN.

00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:50.249
We have a robot that's about 200 pounds and it's pretty much on four wheels

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.553
and it's able to go through a soccer field that's full of obstacles and boundary lines.

00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:57.973
And it's able to go through all that autonomously, all by itself.

00:02:57.973 --> 00:03:00.676
No human being is telling it how to get around the course.

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:04.278
It's doing it based off data it collected from a camera and a laser.

00:03:04.278 --> 00:03:07.149
I am considering, more than likely I will, go for my Ph.D.

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:11.003
and hopefully become even part of like, life-changing projects

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.812
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in space exploration.

00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:16.995
So that's like my main thing I wanna be part of for the rest of my life.

00:03:16.995 --> 00:03:19.746
We used to be some people that were not really outgoing.

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:22.961
We didn't speak very well. We weren't very social.

00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:27.554
The energy you feel here? It was just not there when we first came here.

00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:32.494
Meeting the professors, and meeting just the overall energy that everyone here has,

00:03:32.494 --> 00:03:35.596
and all the other students, they really helped me and my brother

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:37.297
really come into our own skin.

00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:39.570
I mean, CSUN made us who we are today, pretty much.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.125
Or, actually, CSUN gave us the facilities for us to make ourselves who we are today.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:46.088
So... -Well put. -There you go.

00:03:46.088 --> 00:03:48.787
There's definitely a lot of one-liners in here they could definitely put in that article.

00:03:48.787 --> 00:03:52.533
Oh, they could. (laughter)

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.533
(music)
