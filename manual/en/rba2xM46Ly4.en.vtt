00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.500
Cool, so in the last lesson, let's tackle
the most important part of music, that's a

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.070
joke, all things are important in music, and
they all build upon each other, but you've

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.780
figured out the staff, they've gotten to the
fact that there nine little places for the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.230
notes to go, nine little homes for the notes
to chill out on, and that they move from down

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.170
to up, all that stuff's cool. What they don't
understand is that, that doesn't mean anything

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.920
unless you have a guide. And you have certain
guides that help you. You have this guide,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.410
his name is G, G clef, he is in love with
G, and you have this guide, his name is F,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.550
he is in love with the F. So, start with one,
doesn't really matter. He's so in love with

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.540
F, this F guy, that he puts his two dots,
right on the F line. And how do you find the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.879
F line? You can count up. One, two, three,
four, and whatever is on the fourth line,

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.559
is F, he loves it. And that F is a special
F, it's a special F on the piano, and you'll

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.259
point out the bass clef F for them to see.
So, if that's F, on this line, what's the

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.289
note right above F, and they'll say G, and
that's how you write G, and then you can just

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.939
write in a G on space four to show them. This
is amazing, you'll be amazed at how quickly

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.899
the kids will be like, oh yeah, if that's
F, the next thing must be G. What you're doing

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.170
for them is breaking down the logic. But that's
why it makes sense. And if they can understand

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.950
why it makes sense, it will make sense to
them every time. So you've got the F guy,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.569
he's in love with F, then you take the G guy,
he's in love with G, he's so in love with

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.759
G that he makes his fat curly-Q right around
the G line. Where's the G line? They may be

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.479
able to find it on their own now, they'll
be able to count up one, two, line two is

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.729
the G line, that's a special line. Or you
could say he's making a hug around G, or he's

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.749
doing something. I don't know. Make it up.
Something around the G line. This G is not

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:11.019
any G, he's in love with a certain G, and
that's right here on the keyboard. So again,

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.069
if that's G, what's the note right above G.
And they'll be like, A, exactly, that's how

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.610
you write A on the staff. That's the basic
of the logic, if they can get that, and they'll

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.200
be able to get it, then you're doing well.
You?re doing really well, and they'll be able

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.530
to understand where the notes fit on the staff.
And secondly, where they match, secondly and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.859
most importantly, where they match the notes
on the keyboard, and that will be how they'll

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.510
