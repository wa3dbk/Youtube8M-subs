00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.660
Hi, my name is Otto and today I'm going to talk about our bike,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.460
which we bought at the beginning of June. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.940
We are in Liberec(Czech Rep.), we traveled just 10,000   kilometers, 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.640
so I decided to make this video, where we will talk about our bike,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.220
what are it's properties, equipment and what ever we ride.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.500
It is this bike - Honda PCX 125. 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.180
It is scooter from Honda, characterized in that it is not like any of 125ccm scooter.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.340
Instead of free space between the legs there is relatively large tank for 8 liters.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.080
With this new model for 2014, the tank has increased for 2 liters.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.940
It is possible to reach up to 368 km, we drove on it.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.140
This is our record so far.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.740
Among the biggest advantages of the motorcycle includes all the LED lights.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.300
In the front of the bike, as some see in the video, has a nice LED light.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.200
By day, therefore it will not be much to see.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.920
Has the option to high beam lights.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.320
On the dashboard we can see it now 10,000 kilometers,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.120
clock, fuel level, even here the possibility of high beam, or START / STOP system indicator.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.040
 On-board computer is showing  counter of daily kilometers and average consumption.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.720
 Average consumption at our 10.000 km were 2 liters.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.000
There is now seen 2,1 l, it is because I am now in city traffic.

00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:49.704
This consumption is slightly higher.

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:55.064
When we went to the Balkans, consumption 
was 2 liters; 2.1; 1.9 liters.

00:01:55.106 --> 00:02:02.666
We ride two, we were fully loaded and the consumption from rising more than 2.3 l / 100 km.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160
It's beautiful.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.140
 There is a relatively large storage space under the seat and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.580
 other storage spaces still 
here,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.880
where you can fit half-liter bottle to drink.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.180
This is a little bulky, but fits in there.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.335
There's 12V outlet,

00:02:21.394 --> 00:02:26.734
which turned on automatically when you turn the ignition key to START,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.640
so no problem there leave charger pluged in when you leave your motorcycle.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.800
So now we can look at this storage place.

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:40.074
 There are so many things fits inside.

00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:41.934
We have here safety lock,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.560
we bought fix pack on tires, which we did not even used once for the entire 4000 km.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:03:02.180
This set is worth five hundred CKZ with the fact that there are wicks and bottles to inflate the tires, so don't need a pump.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.100
Of course mandatory hi-vis vest,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.340
original tools from Honda, which means,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.900
one screwdriver.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.260
A beautiful thing for threaded through helmet.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.340
Here in this helmet and fasten the hook so you will hang beautifully here.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.120
So one helmet to fit in the space and a second helmet can leave hanging.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.340
Of course carry a mandatory first aid kit.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.940
And when we ride on a motorbike somewhere else, so there's all kinds of things.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.880
Of course START / STOP system works in the way that a warm engine,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.060
which is heated so after a minute, minute and a half drive,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.780
you can turn off or you can turn Idling Stop, that means START / STOP.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.400
At the crossroads of three seconds engine turned down.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.420
A slight twisting motion of the gas start engine.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:18.700
There's horn, warning lights, turn signals, which are on the other side, main beam.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.140
Now we can check sound of engine after 10 000 km,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.240
started and the sound is still the same as when we bought it in Motosalon.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.260
[engine starts]

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.340
As you can hear the sound is still the same,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.840
unchanged.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:57.940
The bike behaves beautifully. We ride IRC tyres, with whom I had once laid.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.540
 We do not know how those rubber are good or not.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.860
They have a pretty good sample after 10 000 km,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.580
there's almost no visible wear.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:23.420
Front has motorcycle disc brakes at the rear has a brake drum,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.260
that when braking the front or rear part,

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.920
so that force you respect to one or the other wheel, so that when braking front brakes will rear 20%, and when braking the rear, so you 20% of the front brakes.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.820
This is about all of this motorcycle.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.220
This bike definitely will go with us for long trip again, we hope.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.040
Look forward to the next video!

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.080
Hey.
