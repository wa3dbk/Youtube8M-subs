00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.890
I want to show you my favorite edition of
Eragon.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.760
There have been a number of editions over
the years: the self-published edition to start

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.270
with, Random House’s original hardcover
edition, various paperback editions, omnibus

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.509
editions, foreign editions…a lot of editions.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:30.940
However, my absolutely favorite version of
Eragon is the tenth anniversary special, deluxe

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.080
edition.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.480
The cover, this piece of art, was done by
an awesome artist called Ciruelo Cabral.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.920
If you’re a fan of fantasy, you’ve probably
seen some of his dragon paintings and stuff.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.280
Inside the book, I have an essay talking about
the experience of working on the series for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
ten years, what it’s like to look back on
Eragon after all this time.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.260
And then the coolest part, for me, is that
the book itself is illustrated.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.680
And I managed to talk a number of different
artists, very cool artists, into working on

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.750
the book.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.070
So we have this first painting by Donato,
who did Arya and the elves, with her being

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.540
ambushed by the Urgals on the edge of Du Weldenvarden.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.400
And then, of course, I did this drawing, which
is a portrait of the character Brom.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.740
I was actually kind of nervous to draw this
because not only is he a beloved character, but

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.620
I also used my dad as a model for Brom, which
seemed fitting.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.070
Mind you, my dad doesn’t actually have a
beard.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.740
I gave him that, so he does look a little
bit different in real life.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.380
But it was a lot of fun to do this one.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.799
It’s pencil with color added in in the computer.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.090
Also we have this great painting of the Ra’zac
in the cathedral at Dras-Leona, by John Jude

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.660
Palencar.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.580
And, as usual, he’s done his wonderfully
creepy job of painting this.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.140
We also have this painting of Eragon and Saphira
by Ciruelo Cabral, who, as I said, also did

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.870
the design on the cover.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.249
I love this painting of Eragon and Saphira.

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:21.329
To me, it captures the feel of their emotional
connection better than just about anything

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.109
I’ve ever seen.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.569
I absolutely love this painting.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.889
Also we have this painting by Michael Hague.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:33.200
It’s of the battle under Farthen Dûr, with
King Hrothgar facing off against a Kull.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.290
Now Michael Hague has been working for a long
time and he did an illustrated version of

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.999
The Hobbit that I grew up with, and I loved
the illustrations, so I had to ask him to

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.389
contribute a piece for this book.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:52.980
And last of all, we have this painting of
Saphira and Arya breaking the star sapphire,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.459
while Eragon faces off with Durza in the bottom
on Tronjheim.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.930
And this was painted by Raoul Vitale, who
obviously had fun with the flames, and colors,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.939
and dragon, and all of that.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.689
So, those are some of the things that are
in the tenth anniversary edition, along with

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.269
some tweaks to the text here and there, just
to polish off a few of the rough edges.

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.889
I hope you can get a chance to get a hold
of one of these for yourselves because, as

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.249
I said, this is my absolutely favorite edition
of Eragon.
