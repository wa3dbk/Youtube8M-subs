00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.050
My name is Larry Cook and I would like to
share with you four natural remedies that

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.200
you can use to stop leg cramps and foot cramps
right away.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.660
Let me start by saying that for quite a few
years, I used to get leg cramps and foot cramps

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.410
all the time, and I went and saw a naturopathic
doctor and I found out from this naturopathic

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.410
doctor.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:33.960
Dr. Angela Agrios, here in Los Angeles, that
I had some circulatory problems and it never

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.820
occurred to me what was causing the leg cramps
or what the issues might be, but we noted

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.040
down pretty quickly, she noted down pretty
quickly and I got on to a supplement plan

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.000
and did a lot of other things to help build
my circulatory system.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.830
In so doing, the leg cramps and the foot cramps
diminished.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.770
However, with that said, I still get leg cramps
and foot cramps every now and then, and what

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.479
I want to do in this video is share with you
a little bit about what happens, why we get

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.979
leg cramps and foot cramps and what we can
do to stop those pretty quickly.

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.250
First of all, like I mentioned, circulatory
issues can be one of the causes, and if you

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.409
have leg cramps or foot cramps on a regular
basis, I really recommend that you go see

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.679
a naturopathic doctor, get checked out and
see whether or not that's a contributing reason

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.090
for your foot cramps or leg cramps.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.350
Another reason for getting foot cramps or
leg cramps should be an electrolyte imbalance

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.990
or depletion of electrolytes.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.340
Electrolytes are minerals and the three main
ones are calcium, magnesium and potassium.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.680
If someone goes to the sauna, sweats a lot
or exercises, sweats a lot, you can easily

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.759
lose a lot of electrolytes, and that is definitely
a contributing cause to foot cramps or leg

00:01:58.759 --> 00:01:59.759
cramps.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.149
Finally, another major reason is when there's
cold feet or cold legs.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.579
That can contribute to leg cramps or foot
cramps.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.380
If one of the reasons why we get leg cramps
or foot cramps is a lack of electrolytes or

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.380
electrolyte depletion, then obviously it makes
sense to put electrolytes back into the body

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.420
and I've been using an electrolyte replenisher
for quite some time now, several years, and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.250
it's called Ultima.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.470
I highly recommend it.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.730
I actually met the rep from Ultima many, many
years ago.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.380
They gave me a great story about what they
do, no artificial anything.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.380
It's all natural and so I've been using it
almost every single day and I don't have any

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.410
tie to them, but I really do like their product,
and so if I get a cramp at night and I know

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.280
that I've either exercised really hard that
day or I went to the sauna and sweat it, I'll

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.310
immediately take some Ultima and that will
definitely help subdue the leg cramp or foot

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.310
cramp.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.060
If you think that there's an electrolyte imbalance
and you take an electrolyte replenisher, that

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.080
definitely is a good idea.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.410
That's the first method, and then number 2
would be take magnesium, because magnesium

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.520
is also not only an electrolyte, but it calms
the muscles.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.350
It calms everything down, and speaking of
calm, a great magnesium supplement on the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.650
market is called Calm.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.520
It actually can help you go to sleep as well,
so I highly recommend Calm.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.610
It gets into the system right away.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.520
I've been using it for several years and if
you want to go to sleep more easily and if

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.470
you want to stop leg cramps and foot cramps,
give Calm a try.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.690
Now the third remedy I'm going to share with
you is a homeopathic remedy.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.200
It's called Cuprum.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.180
This is what it looks like, Cuprum.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.110
It's a homeopathic copper remedy.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.510
Now here's the interesting thing about Cuprum
and homeopathic remedies.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.880
Homeopathic remedies work at an energetic
level, and when you work at the energetic

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.390
level, sometimes it can work really super
fast and if you've ever wondered whether or

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.750
not homeopathy works, here's an experiment.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:20.459
Get a cramp, get some Cuprum, take the Cuprum,
take 2 pellets under your tongue, and in about

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.039
2 to 3 minutes, your cramp will be gone.

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.770
Tell me that's not amazing, and I guarantee
you that it works most of the time for most

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.770
people.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.770
It works for me.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.069
I keep this in my pocket at all times.

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.979
I can't recommend it enough.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:42.539
I learned it from Dr. Angela Agrios and if
you want to have an instant cramp relief remedy

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.460
on you at all times, take Cuprum wherever
you go.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.069
Now the fourth remedy is a really interesting
remedy because I found it in a health foods

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:50.069
store.

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.069
I wasn't even looking for it.

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:57.910
I just happened to see it and it's called
Stop Leg and Foot Cramps in about a minute,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.449
Stop Leg and Foot Cramps in about 1 minute.

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:10.819
I was like, "All right, I want to try that.",
so I did, and it works.

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.780
It does work in about a minute.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.120
I was really quite pleasantly surprised.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.389
I tried it independently of the other remedies
I told you about.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.389
I did a little research.

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:28.569
What's inside this product is ginger, apple
cider vinegar and garlic, and interestingly

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.770
enough, I did a little research on those three
ingredients, and guess what, they have a lot

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.830
of potassium.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.389
Each ingredient has a lot of potassium.

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:42.319
They don't say whether or not that's the exact
reason but I have a sneaking suspicion that

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.360
that has a lot to do with it.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.419
I think that this product probably gets potassium
into the body quickly.

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:55.729
They call it an old omish formula, and all
I can say is that it definitely works.

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.879
Okay, now you have four natural remedies that
you can use to stop foot or leg cramps and

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:09.699
they include the Ultima electrolyte replenisher,
Calm magnesium, Cuprum, a homeopathic remedy

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:15.740
that will stop it immediately, and Stops Leg
and Foot Cramps in about a minute, an old

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.740
omish formula.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.539
