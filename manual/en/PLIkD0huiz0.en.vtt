00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.583
So, what energizes your soul, meaning, 
what reenergizes you...?

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:24.125
Family, friends, music, what is the thing that makes you 
say "That makes me feel new!"

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:28.833
In such a busy life, what do you believe makes you feel better?

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:29.833
Sleep!

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:30.417
Sleep.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:39.500
Great.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:44.042
That's it, here… A little more! Great!

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:46.292
Thank you very much!

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:48.750
Hold it.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.917
No, she said it's ok, she said 
I'm allowed. Don't mess it.

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.333
Beautiful. Thank you!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.750
(singing) Hello!

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.125
Hi.

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:35.083
Had you seen this?

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:36.000
Fantastic!

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.875
Oh, the hair...

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.708
Looking good right?

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.833
Hairstyle "tchu", hairstyle...

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:41.542
Tcha!

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:42.125
Tcha!

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:42.750
Ok, let's do this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.292
Yeah, my friend! Thinking it's easy?

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:55.875
- I'm offline, today I'm offline.
- The script.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:59.208
Looking forward to sleeping, right? It's going 
to have to be a quick nap this afternoon.

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:01.542
My goodness, I need to sleep.

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:02.583
Stay quiet!

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:04.583
"Pirate" I'm not thinking straight today!

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:05.417
I understand!

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:09.458
Hold it as you would...

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:10.625
Yes...This way, look.

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:11.583
Imagine me like this!

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:13.583
Hold it, hold it right!

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:14.208
Setting up.

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:14.917
Hold it your way!

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:16.708
Are you listening?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.292
Yes

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:20.750
Can you hear me?!

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:25.750
Can't do it today, not today.
 Today it won't happen.

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:29.250
Hey, Duda, I'm feeling drowsy, help me out!

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:31.708
You can do it, you can do it. Have faith!

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:32.667
Let's go!

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:34.292
Beautiful!

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:39.208
Here is how it works: 
I access the website, buy your autograph…

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:44.292
and receive, at home, this picture, 
or the one chosen - autographed...

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:45.042
Dedicated.

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:49.000
"With love, wishing Duda all the best!" 
In your handwriting. Got it?

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:54.583
- This shirt…
- Shirt, done.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.417
Just don't let the badge show.

00:02:57.708 --> 00:02:58.333
Ok!

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.500
I have to go, eat, shower and sleep.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.625
I know, I know! I'm with you! I also have to...

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.125
Everything you've mentioned, I have to do as well.

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:06.792
Sleeping, you have already slept!

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:07.875
True, I have slept!

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.458
- Ney, I bit more to this side.
- Hi, I am Neymar.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:11.250
Articulate, Articulate.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:13.250
Hi I am Neymar, get my bla bla bla...

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:16.958
Why didn't my father enroll me in english 
classes when I was a kid?

00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:18.917
Money!

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.875
Money!

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:24.292
Yes, the money! Instead he gave you soccer boots.

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:24.958
He did better.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.667
Yeah, choosing the soccer boots!

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.875
That's it!

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:34.833
Hi, I am Neymar, get my dedicated 
autograph at MyStarAutograph.com

00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:35.583
Yeah!

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:39.750
Let's go!

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:42.625
No way! What else do we have to get on camera?

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:46.833
Carol, Carol is 13 years old and suffered 
a car accident...Is that it?

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:48.708
Last june.

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.500
Yes, and she is in a coma, not doing well.

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:55.375
Apparently, according to those who wrote 
to us, she is not responding to anything.

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:57.708
Not responding to her dad… she only 
responds when someone says "Neymar."

00:03:58.375 --> 00:03:59.000
Can we go?

00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:02.292
That's it, not a problem. It's for a TV report.

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:07.833
Yeah!

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.625
Perfect! I swear to God I will 
only ask for 4 more things.

00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:21.333
(in Spanish) Thanks for the letter, I hope 
to see you ready to play again soon.

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:24.083
A big hug to you!

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:25.500
Yeah!

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.083
Got it? For me it worked!

00:04:27.292 --> 00:04:28.208
I did, dear.

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:30.417
Come on! I rocked with my spanish!

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.708
Last one, "Esporte Interativo" (online channel)!

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:42.083
Yeah, done! We killed it! Have a great afternoon, 
a nice lunch to everyone and a great weekend!

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.583
Autograph these 3 jerseys?

00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:44.750
I rocked with my Spanish!

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.708
Piratinha, you are the man, thank you so much!

00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:49.208
Thank You!
