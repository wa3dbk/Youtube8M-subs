00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:01.931
- Good morning, clan.

00:00:01.931 --> 00:00:05.228
And welcome to day 1025, 
I believe it is.

00:00:05.228 --> 00:00:07.062
Earlier this morning, 
I got out here in the garage,

00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:09.542
and I pulled out the dirt
bikes, got their gear out,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.771
boots, pulled out the
bike, got it started,

00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:13.001
nice and ready to go.

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.162
Picked up the kids from my brother's house

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.995
for their sleepover, and they

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.340
aren't feelin' like goin' riding today.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.803
Specifically, Sierra was the one who said,

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:23.572
"you know dad, I kinda feel
like just bein' a lazy day,

00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:25.155
"just kinda wanna just
sit around the house,

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:27.593
"and maybe watch a movie or something."

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:29.428
Bryce was like, "I don't
care, I'll go riding

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:30.515
"if you wanna go riding, I'll stay home

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:31.578
"if you wanna stay home."

00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:33.105
He doesn't care either way.

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:34.800
So obviously I'm a little bummed,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.005
'cause, you know, I
wanted to take 'em riding.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.792
Especially after watching
supercross, you know,

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:41.000
the last couple weeks.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.061
But if they're not feelin'
it, they're not feelin' it.

00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:44.710
Sierra did tell me however,
"dad, it's not that

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.770
"I don't wanna go riding anymore,
like I'm not done riding,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.832
"I just don't feel like riding today.

00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:52.061
"Like I don't feel like
going riding right now."

00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:54.370
So, I get that, they stayed up late,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.103
and they got up early, obviously,

00:00:57.103 --> 00:00:59.222
and so they're just kind
of, you know, being bums.

00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:00.847
Which is exactly what
Tiffany does on Mondays,

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:02.891
so I cannot blame the kids at all.

00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:05.677
So, Sierra is in her room, on her iPad

00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:07.047
watching some YouTube videos,

00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:09.155
and Bryce wants to play
some basketball, so.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:10.405
So I'm gonna move my truck, move the car,

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:11.804
and we're gonna play some basketball.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:13.096
(brief heavy bass beats)

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:18.715
(YouTube videos playing in background)

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:22.687
Ah, mommy has to go to work.

00:01:22.687 --> 00:01:24.520
Bye mommy! Have fun!

00:01:25.547 --> 00:01:27.997
- Hey guys, it's me, Sierra,

00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:30.905
right now I'm in my room as you can tell,

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:32.995
the purple walls.

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:37.221
Bryce is still sleeping, on my bed.

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:40.704
And, oh my god.

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:42.017
Earlier he was like...

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.244
like moving his lips
around, it was really funny.

00:01:46.244 --> 00:01:49.797
When he's awake, when he wakes up,

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:51.417
we are actually gonna watch a movie.

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:52.485
We're gonna have like a movie day.

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:53.832
We were gonna go to the movies,

00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:55.383
because we're not going dirt bike riding,

00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:57.542
sorry about that guys, it's just,

00:01:57.542 --> 00:02:00.956
I feel really lazy today,
so sorry about that.

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:03.417
We will go this week, though, so.

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:04.856
Yeah, so we're gonna watch a movie here,

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:08.214
I popped some popcorn, and I try making it

00:02:08.214 --> 00:02:10.768
more like we're actually
at a movie theater,

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:12.296
'cause I made two papers.

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:14.381
I made one with all the
movies we can watch,

00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:16.541
I made another paper with the snack bar.

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.327
So I said you can get a
popcorn, you can get drinks,

00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:23.042
which we have soda, we have water,

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:26.084
daddy can maybe even
have something alcoholic.

00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:29.492
And then we can also, oh
my god he still has his,

00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:31.187
he still has his mouth open.

00:02:31.187 --> 00:02:33.226
And then we have candy, so,

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:34.874
I thought that's kind
of like a movie theater,

00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:37.870
'cause they have candy, popcorn, drinks.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.402
They also have like pretzels
and stuff, but you know,

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:41.887
we don't have that stuff,
we have the usual stuff

00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:43.953
that people normally get, like popcorn,

00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:45.996
and candy, and drinks.

00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:50.535
So daddy said that he
will let me pick a movie,

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:51.814
and let Bryce pick a movie.

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:53.068
I don't know what Bryce is gonna pick,

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:54.600
'cause he's been asleep this whole time,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.896
but on iTunes I just bought Maleficent,

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:02.054
so I'm gonna pick Maleficent.

00:03:02.054 --> 00:03:03.888
I can't wait, I love movies!

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:05.187
- [Clintus] Hi Bryce, how was your nap?

00:03:06.293 --> 00:03:06.847
Good.

00:03:06.847 --> 00:03:07.985
And we all get to pick a movie, right?

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:10.238
I'm watching, I'm actually
watching two TV shows,

00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:12.630
as my movie time, just 'cause I've got,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.458
like 24 shows recorded
that I haven't watched,

00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:17.547
I haven't watched TV in
four months, five months.

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:18.894
So I'm watching two shows.

00:03:18.894 --> 00:03:20.465
She's gonna pick, she picked Maleficent,

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:21.649
we're gonna watch Maleficent,

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:22.782
and then Bryce hasn't
picked his movie yet,

00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:25.035
but he has a whole list of
movies available to him,

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:26.289
so we'll see.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.049
But it's movie night at home, yay!

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.390
Ah, Sierra's making more popcorn for us?

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.828
- Yeah but this time, it's
from the popcorn machine,

00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:34.151
'cause the one that we were just eating

00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:36.492
was from the microwave, just popping it.

00:03:36.492 --> 00:03:39.650
This time I'm making it
from our popcorn machine.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.960
- [Clintus] Movie time popcorn!

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.422
- Yep, it's actually movie time.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.259
- [Clintus] Yeah, this is the good stuff.

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.624
This was a Christmas
present from Mimaw and Papa,

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:45.687
like what, three or four years ago?

00:03:45.687 --> 00:03:46.495
- Yeah, a long time--

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:47.832
- [Dad] Five years ago? I don't know.

00:03:47.832 --> 00:03:49.918
(popping sound)

00:03:49.918 --> 00:03:51.635
It's just like the movies!

00:03:54.194 --> 00:03:55.814
Alright dude, what movie
are we watching now?

00:03:55.814 --> 00:03:57.115
- Percy Jackson.

00:03:57.115 --> 00:03:59.065
- Percy Jackson the Sea of Monsters.

00:03:59.065 --> 00:03:59.765
It's pretty good, huh?

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:00.222
- Mm-hmm.

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:01.211
- Good choice, good choice.

00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.974
Continuing the movie marathon,
I am introducing the kids

00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:06.644
to Waterworld, which was
one of my favorite movies

00:04:06.644 --> 00:04:10.173
growing up, Kevin Costner.

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:12.286
Basically the polar ice
caps melt, and the world

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:13.447
is covered with water.

00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:15.374
It's like a, you know, desolate future,

00:04:15.374 --> 00:04:17.510
I love those kind of movies,
the post-apocalyptic stuff.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.691
Something bad happened and
mankind is trying to survive.

00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:21.899
Yeah, it's a good movie.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:22.549
You diggin' it?

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:22.939
- Mm-hmm.

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:23.636
- You diggin' it?

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:24.978
What about you Bryce,
you diggin' Waterworld?

00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:25.604
- Yeah.

00:04:25.604 --> 00:04:26.905
- Yep. Pretty cool, huh?

00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:28.739
I never understood why everyone
hated this movie so much.

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:31.297
Everyone, it had such
a bad rap, I loved it.

00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:32.133
I still love it.

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:33.480
I'm sure most of you now at this point

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.286
have heard Shay Carl's announcement

00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:37.747
that he's no longer a daily vlogger.

00:04:37.747 --> 00:04:40.219
He's gonna be posting three
to five videos a week,

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.618
a minimum of two per week,

00:04:42.618 --> 00:04:45.328
and Twitter just blew up
with like "oh my gosh,

00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:47.162
"are you serious, this
is the end of the world,

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.971
"you just, you crushed me, you
hit three million subscibers

00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:51.063
"and now you're giving up?"

00:04:51.063 --> 00:04:53.356
The thing to keep in mind is,
he didn't say he was quitting,

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:55.980
completely, he's just
taking away the name,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.513
the title of daily vlogger.

00:04:57.513 --> 00:04:59.737
He's no longer a daily vlogger.

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:03.754
He's gonna vlog like, I
guess, the majority of people?

00:05:03.754 --> 00:05:05.310
Where they just vlog
a couple times a week,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.144
when something happens, when, you know,

00:05:07.144 --> 00:05:09.972
he does longer videos
anyways, I could see one video

00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:12.387
being like Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, in one video.

00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:15.591
And then like Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, in one video.

00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:18.377
You know, something like that,
I could see that happening.

00:05:18.377 --> 00:05:20.928
But you know, Shay said
he was gonna quit before,

00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:22.477
and he lasted like two or three days,

00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:23.638
then he started vlogging again.

00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:25.240
So, who knows?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.773
At the end of the day
though, he's been doing this

00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:29.002
for almost six years.

00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:30.883
There's tons of content out there.

00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:32.570
Well I guess I had a
lazy night with the kids,

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.985
watchin' movies, but you know what?

00:05:34.985 --> 00:05:35.751
It was awesome.

00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:39.178
Just chillin' on the couch,
watchin' movies with them.

00:05:39.178 --> 00:05:40.432
Of course they have tons of questions

00:05:40.432 --> 00:05:42.103
when they watch movies, they're
like what does that mean?

00:05:42.103 --> 00:05:43.357
What are they doing, what, I?

00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:45.819
And it's like, guys, guys, just chill out.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:46.724
You know, their inquisitive minds

00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:48.698
are always asking questions
about anything in life,

00:05:48.698 --> 00:05:50.261
and what's goin' on, and like,
as soon as something happens,

00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:51.051
they're like, what is that?

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:52.003
What does he mean by that?

00:05:52.003 --> 00:05:52.815
What happened to that?

00:05:52.815 --> 00:05:54.208
It's like, it's a movie,
give it some time,

00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:55.834
it'll come out, it's a story.

00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:57.538
But that's what this
is all about, you guys,

00:05:57.538 --> 00:05:59.861
this whole new journey
that I'm on is like,

00:05:59.861 --> 00:06:03.483
I wanna be able to work
normal hours, so to speak.

00:06:03.483 --> 00:06:05.155
And then when they come home from school,

00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:08.034
I wanna be able to stop working,

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.657
and hang out with them, you know,

00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:12.683
for a few hours a night.

00:06:12.683 --> 00:06:14.902
And then when they go
and do their own thing

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:16.592
with their friends over,
I can come back to work,

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:19.155
and I can work late like I'm doing now,

00:06:19.155 --> 00:06:20.906
and it's awesome.

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:21.811
It's so awesome.

00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:25.131
Before, I would come home from my job,

00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:27.537
and then I would have to work
a couple hours every night

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:29.598
on YouTube stuff, and that was taking away

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.920
from my time with the kids.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.521
And so now, because I
have basically all day

00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:37.678
to work on YouTube stuff,
I can focus and concentrate

00:06:37.678 --> 00:06:40.697
and give them more of
my real genuine time.

00:06:40.697 --> 00:06:42.554
Lookin' forward to more of this, for sure.

00:06:42.554 --> 00:06:43.827
As always, if you like this
video, be sure to give it

00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:45.865
a thumbs up, and we'll
see you guys tomorrow

00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:48.791
for another day, and another vlog.

00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:49.512
See ya.

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:51.763
Well guys, like Sierra said,
sorry we didn't go riding,

00:06:51.763 --> 00:06:54.661
but they were not feelin'
it, and as you could tell,

00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:56.030
they were definitely in lazy mode.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.841
We did not leave the couch all night,

00:06:57.841 --> 00:07:01.023
we watched three movies
back to back to back,

00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:03.087
all the way up until their bedtime.

00:07:03.087 --> 00:07:05.146
But, also like she said, stay tuned,

00:07:05.146 --> 00:07:07.236
we definitely will go
riding sometime soon,

00:07:07.236 --> 00:07:08.444
'cause the bike's out, the gear's out,

00:07:08.444 --> 00:07:10.412
it's in their face, it's
just a matter of time

00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:11.563
before they look at it and go,

00:07:11.563 --> 00:07:13.188
ooh, dad, let's go ridin'!

00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:15.220
And so it'll happen, just be patient.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.061
On the screen, two more
really great videos,

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.657
you definitely wanna check 'em out.

00:07:18.657 --> 00:07:21.974
One year ago, we ran in the
Rock 'n Roll Half Marathon.

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:25.178
So, Tiffany, her sister Theresa
came into town from Texas,

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.639
and myself all ran the half marathon.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.903
Jack ran the full marathon,

00:07:29.903 --> 00:07:33.208
so a lot more to see, this video.

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:34.451
I didn't choose much video this year,

00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:36.077
but last year I shot a lot of video,

00:07:36.077 --> 00:07:38.626
so check it out, I actually
run the course with my GoPro,

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:41.482
you can actually follow
me along in the race.

00:07:41.482 --> 00:07:44.635
Two years ago, we went to
Colton's birthday party,

00:07:44.635 --> 00:07:46.539
after Bryce's basketball game.

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:48.532
It was a superhero-themed
party, it had a jump house

00:07:48.532 --> 00:07:50.064
and everything, and then
we go and have a sleepover

00:07:50.064 --> 00:07:53.431
at Mimaw and Papa's preparing
for the Rock 'n Roll Marathon.

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.074
So check those out,
annotations are clickable links

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:56.653
in the description down below.

00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:58.162
Be sure to follow me on Twitter,

00:07:58.162 --> 00:07:59.091
that's where all the action is,

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:01.506
that's where I post updates
and photos and stuff

00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:02.644
in real time.

00:08:02.644 --> 00:08:04.040
And we'll see you tomorrow.
