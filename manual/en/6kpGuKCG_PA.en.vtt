Hey, itís Marie here with another Q &amp; A Tuesday!

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.480
Q: Alright, so letís get rolling and weíve
got a great question today, and this one is

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.059
from Tia. So sweet, she writes:

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.710
ìIím a mom of a 4-year old and Iím expecting
my second child later this year.î God Bless!

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.410
ìIím a fan of your blog. Itís been very
helpful in the process of adjusting my thinking

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.780
toward business. Does being ambitious or wanting
more success mean youíre ungrateful for the

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.280
current gifts in your life? Is it possible
to be fully grateful for the current blessings

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.770
you have and still pursue the six- figure
income, the fame, the entrepreneurship, etc.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.190
with abandon?î

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.610
Want to know my answer? Do ya? Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:11.030
Wait you know who else says yes? (ìCome here,
Snicker.î Picks up puppy: ìKuma says yes.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.600
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!î)

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.460
A: Hereís the reason why I love this question.
Iím so happy that it came up. One of the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.359
biggest challenges that most of us go through
when weíre starting to explore spirituality

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.819
and discovering the whole idea of being super
grateful for what you have is we can feel

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.700
guilty about wanting more. Itís almost as
if, ìOh, I really have to just you know be

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.630
okay with everything that I have now.î Which
is great but itís human to want to create.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.380
Itís human to want to grow, to want to explore
to expand, and take in more. And, I just want

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.430
to make a little note here, you know wanting
more doesnít equate to materialism. It doesnít

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.509
always mean toys. You could want to touch
more lives. You could want to expand your

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.929
ability to love. So wanting more in of itself
is nothing that you should shy away from and

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.819
I absolutely believe with my heart and soul
that you can be extremely grateful for what

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.709
you have and go ìballs to the wallî with
your dreams!

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.709
So I have a few strategies to share with you
that will help you accomplish this. In my

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.670
lovely book called Make Every Man Want You,
How to Be So Irresistible Youíll Barely Keep

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.959
from Dating Yourself! Which by the way, weíre
going to give you a free audio download, missy;

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.680
just because you asked such a great question!
I talk about a concept called This is It.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.480
This is It really means that you treat this
moment like itís the most amazing moment

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.420
of your life. You look around in your world
and you just make it the best it possibly

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.420
can be.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.790
So in short, wherever youíre at, thatís
where the party is. So if you find yourself

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.860
standing in line at a bank and thereís a
really long line, and everyone else is cranky,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.099
this is it! This is your moment! So youíre
going to party with it. Youíre going to hang

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.459
out. Youíre going to have a great time! Talk
to people in the line. Really appreciate where

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.549
youíre at! But that doesnít stop you; the
whole ìthis is itî mentality doesnít stop

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.109
you from having big dreams that youíre also
going to pursue.

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.049
So itís a matter of just finding that balance
but you can absolutely do it and donít let

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.609
anyone tell you that youíre ungrateful for
what you have if you have big dreams and ambitions.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.469
So one more little note and itís about complaining.
This is a great way to just basically check

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.950
yourself before you wreck yourself.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.160
Checkadee, checkadee, check yourself before
you wreck yourself!

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.040
If you catch yourself complaining, youíve
slipped out of the modality of being grateful

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.100
for what you have. And, itís going to be
really hard to really attract great things

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.269
or be really ambitious or have the energy
you need to achieve those big dreams. So use

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.900
complaining as a bit of a barometer. If you
find yourself saying, ìOh, this sucks. My

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.040
current clients suck. My boyfriend sucks.
Blah blah blahÖî Not so good. Stop it. Donít

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.790
beat yourself up but just get back into the
grateful mode and keep kicking ass towards

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.790
your dreams!

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.189
