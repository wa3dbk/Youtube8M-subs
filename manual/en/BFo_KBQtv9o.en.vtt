Hello and welcome to the tutorial on adding a Running head and page numbers

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.966
in APA format in Word 2010 for Windows.

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.166
The first thing you will have to do is open your Word document.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:16.166
You can either open a saved document or start a New Blank Document.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.666
Next, select the Header section of your document.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:26.832
You can do this by either double clicking at the top of your document or clicking on the Insert tab and Header.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:33.199
In the Header &amp; Footer Tools: Design tab, check the box next to “Different First Page.”

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:41.966
In the Header &amp; Footer group, click on Page Number. Select Top of Page and the option “Plain Number 1.”

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Now in the Header section of your paper, before the page number, double click and type

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.966
“Running head:” followed by an abbreviated title of your paper in capital letters.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:01:00.033
The Running head should be a maximum of 50 characters, counting letters, punctuation, and spaces between words.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:04.033
It should appear flush left in all uppercase letters at the top of the title page.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.133
Place your cursor to the left of the page number and press the Tab key

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.799
once or twice to move the number to the right margin.

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:17.466
Select the Running head as well as the page number, click the Home tab,

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:21.232
and change the font to Times New Roman, size 12.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.466
You have now created a first page header in APA style.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:30.233
Next, page numbers need to be added to the rest of your paper’s headers.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:35.099
Click on the Insert tab. Select Page Break.

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:44.166
Select the Header section of page 2 of your document. In the Header &amp; Footer group, click on Page Number.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:51.466
Select Top of Page and the option “Plain Number 1.” The page number “2” is inserted.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:56.866
Type your paper title in all capital letters, but without “Running head:.”

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.233
Place your cursor to the left of the page number and press the Tab key

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:03.266
once or twice to move the number to the right margin.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:10.532
Every page from now on will have your title in all capital letters on the left and the page number on the right.

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.899
Select the paper title as well as the page number,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.366
click the Home tab, and change the font to Times New Roman, size 12.

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:25.966
You have now finished adding a Running head and page numbers to your paper in APA format.

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:31.166
