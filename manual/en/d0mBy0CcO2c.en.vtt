00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.509
I am an expert in movies, why? Because my
wife and I go on date night once a week. Well

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.719
all right maybe I am not an expert in films
and all but I can help you by providing some

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.390
tips by turning your DSLR footage in to more
of a flimic look.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
The first item I want to talk about is Setting
your camera to 24 frames per second. To be

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.400
honest this is probably provides the smallest
value to it, of all the items I am going to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.500
tell you about. Most people can not tell the
difference from 24 to 30 fps, it happens more

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.059
on a sub-conscious level. People can't tell
the difference between 24 and 30 frames per

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.649
second The reason I shoot at 24 frames per
second is not the look, it is because it creates

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.370
smaller file sizes.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.190
Shoot with a shadow depth of field This new
canon cameras and I think and some of these

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.640
other manufacturers they have these huge large
sensor on them which help you creates this

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.850
shallow depth of field. If you watch any movie
or good TV show and you are going to see this

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.530
used over and over again where the background
is all out of focus and all your focus goes

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.600
the subject or the person telling the story.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.880
aspect ratio, this is the second most important.
Normal people notice this right away when

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.800
their TV is letter boxed when it starts. This
is a dead giveaway that this is a film. So

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.460
shoot your movie with a similar aspect ratio.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.260
Shoot in 720p or higher, to match film you
are going to need all the resolution you can

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.220
get. However many will not notice that much
difference between 720 and 1080.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.390
Use a tripod, a monopod, use a rig on your
shoulder, most important keep it steady unless

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.500
shakiness adds to your story.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.040
Use a slider or a dolly at least a few times
to reveal something, you see this over and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.050
over again in just about every movie.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.460
use a gib, most films use an establishing
opening shot and most on done on some sort

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.250
of gib where the camera glides up from street
level into the trees to give you a different

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.250
perspective.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.270
Shoot your videos flat and then Color your
video in post. The in camera settings while

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.939
very good can be a bit over saturated or have
too much contrast. There are many tutorials

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:18.650
on how to color your video to look more like
a block buster.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.879
Don't zoom in or zoom out while filming, instead
shoot far away then close up with a cut between

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.310
shots. Zooms are super fun on a camcorder
but I would bet that most film crews just

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.819
own prime lens and don't use any zooms unless
it is a very special shot.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.790
This last one has nothing to do with video,
but if you audio sounds like cr*p because

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.739
the mic is mounted on the camera, or you are
missing some inportant background music that

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.780
completes the scene or missing foley noise,
even if you did everything else right on this

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.329
list the audio which 50% of your video, and
if the audio sucks it is really not going

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.930
to help you get that film look.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.329
Alright I hope that helps, again I am not
an expert on film but these are the things

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:14.650
I need to work on myself and talk to you guys
later. Bye.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.769
Tell a good story. Tell a good story.
