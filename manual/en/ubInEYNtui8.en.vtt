00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.380
The doors on GE's Clean Steel and Hot Point metallic models

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.460
are covered with a
clear plastic film to protect the finish.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.340
This film must be removed after the refrigerator is installed.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.940
Remove the product information sheet and set aside.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.080
To make the removal of this film easier, neither the refrigerator

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.420
nor the freezer door handle is attached
at the factory.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.969
Open both refrigerator doors.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.919
To remove, loosen a section of the film
from the edge of the door and slowly pull it free.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.140
The tools required for this task are a
Phillips screwdriver

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.960
a T20 torque screwdriver, and a pair of
gloves.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.160
You will also need the door handle packet

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.400
located in the bottom shelf in the fresh food door.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.880
Remove the tape and pull out the door handle packet.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.960
In the drawer handle packet

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.060
there should be a fresh food door
handle, a freezer handle,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.840
5 Phillips screws, one T20 torque screw,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.580
a screw cover, and a plug button.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.380
The handles are installed on the side that swings open.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.620
Once you have determined which side the handles go
on, you are then ready to attach the handles.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.159
When installing the refrigerator handle,
start by installing

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.499
two Phillips screws in the top of the
handle.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.740
Start both screws, but do not tighten them yet.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.120
Then screwed the T20 Torx screw in the
front until it is snug.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.920
Once the screw is snug, tighten the top two
screws until they are snug.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.820
Do not over tighten.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.300
Over tightening these screws may cause the screws to strip or the handle to break.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.300
After all the screws are tightened,

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.399
press the screw cover into place over
the front screw.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.940
Because the refrigerator doors are reversible,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.100
there is a hole in the opposite side of
the handle

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.560
where they handle would go if the doors were reversed.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.420
In the door handle packet there is a plug button that goes into this hole.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.800
Firmly press the plug button into the
hole until the plug button is all the way in.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.420
It is best to start installing the
freezer door handle,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.140
beginning with the top Phillips screw first.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.290
Do not tighten the screw until all screws are started.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160
Once you've started the top screw, line
up the bottom holes on the underside of

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.220
the freezer door with the bottom holes of the door handle.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.110
Then screw in the bottom screws.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.620
Now that you have all the bottom screws
snug,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.520
tighten up the top screw until it is snug.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.420
Again, if you over tighten the screws, you run the risk of stripping the screws or breaking  the handle.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.869
All screws should just be snug.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.220
Once all the screws have been tightened, the installation is complete and your refrigerator is ready to be used.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.090
