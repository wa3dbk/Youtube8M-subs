00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.190
To install a new chain, you want to make sure
that you're using the correct size.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.240
So to find out the size of your chain, basically
it's the speeds of your bicycle.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.869
So in the rear here, you'll see, if you count
each cog, there's one, two, three, four five,

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.320
there's nine cogs here.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.480
There'll be anywhere usually from five cogs
to now there's 11 cogs and you need a special

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.859
chain for each size.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.950
Basically a chain width is different for each
size.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.060
So you find your box that says a nine speed
chain and you take out the chain.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.900
We'll just use the old chain just as an example
here and you're going to shift your gears

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:54.530
all the way up to the largest or lowest gear
in the back and all the way up to your highest

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.830
and largest gear in the front.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.280
So this is how you're going to size your chain
to make sure that it's the proper length and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.780
that you're not going to have too much slack
or not enough.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.670
So you want to make sure that you're weaving
the chain through just the way that it came

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.670
out.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:32.730
Make sure it's going along these rollers and
through the proper way.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.140
So now that you're on the two largest cogs,
so the largest in the back and the largest

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.380
in the front, you're going to stretch your
chain all the way so the derailer can't stretch

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.760
anymore.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.810
So that's where you're going to break your
chain.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.310
You're going to add one link.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.280
So one full link is right here.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.230
That size right there.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.100
You add that and cut off the rest and that's
the length of your chain so it would look

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.740
like this when it's put together.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.780
So the way to put together this chain is they
use a pin.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.390
So it comes in these little packets here.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.690
Different chains require different installation.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.759
This chain requires a pin which you'd have
to get at a bike shop according to whichever

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.489
size chain you have and this is a Shimano
specific pin.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.079
They also have quick links which I demonstrated
before so these are the quick links.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.409
Or the chain may all ready have the pin installed
on one side and it's just coming out of one

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:28.340
side of the chain and then you can just push
it through to connect properly.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.340
So now that you have the sizing correct and
you have your pin, make sure that you're shifting

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.840
down to whatever is the smallest cog in the
front and whatever the smallest cog in that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.409
back so you have a lot of slack and you can
actually even take it off your chain ring

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.850
in the front so it's nice and loose.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.609
And then you're going to take the basically
the male and female side, put them together

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.539
and then put the pin through and that holds
them together.
