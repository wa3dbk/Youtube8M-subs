Welcome to how to cook that.net I am Ann Reardon

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.900
Today we are going to make chocolate coated oreos three different 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.490
ways of doing that

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.180
If you want a pattern on top buy some chocolate transfer sheets

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.250
They have a thin layer of coloured cocoa butter on them in a 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.869
pattern

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.609
Then take a round object and trace around it onto the back of the transfer sheet 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.230
and then cut it out.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.050
The first method is using a metal muffin tin, for this 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.050
you will need to line your tin with cupcake wrappers.  

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.290
Place your transfer sheet circles the rough side facing up 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.780
into the base of the cupcake wrappers

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.430
Take an oreo, drop it into the the melted chocolate make sure it is completely covered 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.250
Then using two forks take it out and place it into the cupcake wrapper.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.550
Take a spoonful of extra chocolate 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.790
and top up each one to just cover the oreo.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.020
Allow them to set and then take off the papers and peel off the chocolate transfer sheets.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.390
The second way of making them gives a thinner coat of chocolate and is good 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.530
for mini oreos or if you are in a hurry.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.490
Place your oreo in the melted chocolate and make sure it is completely covered. 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.950
Remove it from the chocolate and place on either a chocolate transfer sheet or a

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.460
sheet of baking paper to set.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.750
Allow them to set and then peel them off the transfer sheet  and you're done.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.970
The last method is my favourite one because I think they look the best

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.120
we are going to use white chocolate and colour it using oil based colour. 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.180
.  Just take a small amount and stir it through.  

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.810
Again if you want a pattern on them cut out circles from a chocolate transfer sheet 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.590
and put in the base of a silicone cupcake tray.  

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.940
Place a couple of spoons of chocolate into the mold, top with an 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.110
oreo, gently push it down and top with more chocolate.  Spread it around until it is 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.010
smooth.  

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.600
Once you have filled them all you can bang the tray on the bench a few times just to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.450
smooth the top.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.870
Allow them to set 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.250
and then pop them out of the silicone mold and peel off the transfer sheet.  They look great

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.190
on candy buffets and dessert tables.  Make sure you watch the video on how to temper chocolate and what chocolate to use 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.060
so that they will not melt at room temperature.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.869
