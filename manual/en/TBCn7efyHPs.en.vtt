00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.700
Summoners, how's your week been?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.500
I bet we can make it better.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.700
Sounds like you're looking for a dose of community content from League of Legends, right?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.500
It's crazy! But it might work.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.800
We're just going to fast forward to the part where you get your socks knocked off by Nauo's graphite drawings.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.800
You start watching and you're just like "oh this is gonna be - OH MY GOD how is that even possible?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.800
There's a shocking amount of them, like I think that they just keep being added whenever I'm not looking.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.800
You are a graphite machine!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.800
Dark Matter is your friend.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.800
In retrospect it only seems obvious that someone like Hakkenshi would come up with "Darth Veigar" the jedi master of evil.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.800
Clearer still is the knowledge that he's still too short to be taken seriously.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.500
Like me.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.500
I am powerful, and funny.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.800
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, as is re-writing pop songs to talk about video game characters.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.800
Also considered an upgrade!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Gluglug has made a couple songs, whether original or parody, that are clever and catchy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700
That song is just so good for parodies though.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Next we have another parody.  You guys are just being way too witty!

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.500
This is actually Ember Isolte's version of Keep Feeding.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.500
Feeder's unite!  For an enemy pentakill.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.133
This one hits pretty close to the heart for me.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.800
It's like a parade of bodies.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.800
You celebrate by having a grey screen.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Fun fact:  being a great photographer gets you talking to the ladies.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.700
AveryTingWong went to Fanime and took some great pictures of cosplayers like jennaaaayyyy as Lux.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.800
It's a match made in heaven.  Cosplayers and cameras.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Having a trade skill is so sexy.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.800
Confession time:  This entire video has been a rouse to prevent you from playing Phase's new game.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.900
It's no use.  You'll play it, you'll love it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
Patch day will be that much easier.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.900
So now you know.  So, just go.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I won't keep you any longer but remember to send in your submissions to Summoner_Showcase@riotgames.com

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Click the like button.  Did that work?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Until next time,  get your LoL fix nana na na.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And we'll see you next week.
