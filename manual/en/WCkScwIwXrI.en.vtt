00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:07.399
Hi.

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.480
I’m Lorie Marrero, creator of the Clutter
Diet book and on-line program, and today we’re

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.080
going to talk about seven ways to be smart
with your smart phone.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.140
Now, this is in response to an “Ask Lorie”
question that we got.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.830
We’ve asked you guys, the viewers, to send
in your questions for me to answer, so this

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.830
is one of those.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.000
And you can submit your questions here in
the “comments,” that would be great.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.119
(POP) I’m certainly going to share with
you today some of my favorite apps, and that

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.980
is always fun, but I also want you to think
about how to consider your phone in a different

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.980
way.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.460
So how to be smarter about your phone.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.900
Obviously, it is a phone (POP), it is a camera,
we love that, we love our phones.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.860
But I want you to realize that instead of
hauling around clipboards and checklists and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.560
whole filing cabinets worth of stuff, we have
so much available at our fingertips now that

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.150
we can track, we can refer to, we can solve
problems that we could never solve before,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.400
with these little devices.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.640
So there’s a reason that Apple says, “There’s
an app for that.”

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.670
There really is.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.350
If you think of something that you need to
solve, go look it up in the app store (POP)

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.750
because I bet you someone did write an app
for that.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.490
That’s happened to me a whole bunch of times.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.390
I’m going to share a couple of those with
you today.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.510
So I want to share with you these seven different
categories of ways that you can be smarter.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.310
So the first category is Financial.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.820
You can keep track of your spending in real
time with your on-line banking app.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.570
Also with Mint, you can check your budget.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.620
I have recently gotten much better about budgeting
in my own life and it has really changed the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.270
way I think about my money.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.270
It’s very interesting.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.970
So Mint is a fantastic app that shows you
color-coded how you’re doing on your budget

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.950
– red, green, and yellow.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.740
All right, so number two.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.740
Health.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.770
You can do symptom tracking.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.260
So, “How many times a day is my arm itching?”

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.270
Or, “How many times a day am I coughing?”
or something.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.260
You can track those with an app like Simple,
and that will even send a report to your doctor.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.470
You can also track other things that we won’t
mention in polite company here, but, for example,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.400
if your Aunt Flo is coming to visit, you can
anticipate her visiting and you can figure

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.170
out the frequency and duration of her visits.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.480
And that would be another good thing to track.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.650
And there’s many apps for doing that.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.260
The third category is Fitness.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.269
So we have talked about this in another video.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.599
I love using My Fitness Pal to track my eating
intake.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.150
And, you know, you can look at calories and
different kinds of nutrients that way.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.049
Also I love my Fit Bit.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.580
Unfortunately, I’ve had to retire my Fit
Bit for the last few months because I’ve

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.079
been injured and I’m really bummed out about
it.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.340
But you can track how many steps you do in
a day.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.700
So that’s a really cool thing to do for
your health and for your motivation for your

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.180
health.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.180
Number four.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180
Reference.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.230
Okay, this is a big category.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.739
Favorite app in the reference category is
Evernote.

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.849
We’ve talked about this many times.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.930
Hi, Evernote guys.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.469
And also Dropbox.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.981
So I have all of my files with me on my phone
all the time.

00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:19.230
I can’t tell you how many times that has
saved my bacon.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.870
I have been out somewhere, someone needs something,
and I can send them a link directly to that

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.870
file.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.430
So, number five.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.430
Lists.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.769
So, obviously, grocery lists are fantastic.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.559
We have a whole video about tracking your
grocery lists too.

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.409
I use Grocery IQ.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.040
That’s my favorite grocery app.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.209
And then there are other lists that you might
want to have.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.010
There’s a really good one called Toodle
Do, and app that does mostly “to do” lists,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.909
but you can do a lot of different kinds of
lists in it.

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.900
And Evernote also does checklists, so you
can keep packing lists and things like that

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.919
in your phone, and that is always with you
everywhere you go.

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.719
All right, category number six.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.839
Entertainment.

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:06.659
So this category is where we have solved some
problems here that we could never solve before.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.230
This just blows my mind.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.049
So I was trying to find a movie the other
day on Netflicks, because I like to stream

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.939
my movies on the Internet.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.350
So I have a Roku.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.430
And I couldn’t find this movie on Netflicks,
and I thought, “Well, is it on Amazon?”

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.120
It wasn’t on Amazon either.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120
I couldn’t believe it.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.540
It was a really popular movie.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.479
I found this app, again thinking “Somebody
must have written an app for this.”

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.919
There’s an app called “Can I Stream It?”

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.509
And you just search the movie and it searches
all of the movie databases and it found that,

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:41.540
“Yeah, there was a channel called Vudu that
had this movie I wanted.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.610
And it tells you how much it costs and everything.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.360
There’s another app called Open Table where
it eliminates the problem of making a reservation

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.889
at a restaurant when you’re guessing who
might have an open reservation.

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.930
You can just find who’s got one tonight
instead of calling around and getting rejected.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:02.001
Then, of course, we’ve all wondered, “What
is that song?” and we’ve used Shazam to

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:06.680
find out and it listens to the song coming
out of whatever speaker you’re hearing it

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.930
from and it tells you what the song is.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.830
How great is that?

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.400
So the last category I want to call Fly Swatting.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.990
And the reason I say that is, it just smacks
a problem down like nothing ever has before.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.980
It is its own category, I don’t know, I
just like the name.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.979
So Fly Swatting, it has just smacked down
the problem of trying to unsubscribe to publications

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.560
that come in the mail.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.810
This is an app called Paper Karma.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.300
I love this app.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.250
You take a picture of the mailing label on
the catalog that you got in the mail and you’re

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.250
done.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.250
And they unsubscribe you.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.250
It’s fantastic.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.830
It doesn’t cost anything.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.629
Another thing that has just smacked down a
huge problem is Uber and some of the other

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:50.610
ride-share apps.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.199
I can summon a vehicle for me whenever I want
to.

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.280
So I love that.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.590
I travel a lot.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.419
I can always get a nice friendly driver.

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.710
Another thing that has smacked down a problem,
fly-swatted a problem for me, is an app called

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.900
Skitch that is related to Evernote.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.310
And Skitch allows me to take a picture or
upload a picture and mark all over it.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.509
So think about what I do for a living and
what I help people with – closets and spaces

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:22.599
where I need to measure – I can just take
a picture of the space and draw the measurements

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:27.030
all over it instead of trying to hand-draw
something else on graph paper.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.570
That has saved me tons of time and confusion.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.659
And finally, my last little Fly Swatter app
is called White Noise Light.

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:40.860
I have actually slept in a hotel suite with
a party going on in the living room of the

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.389
suite with this app.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.190
It plays – I don’t even know how many
different noises.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:53.340
From trains to rain to airplane noise and
fans and fires and all kinds of lovely white

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.319
noise sounds that will mask the other noise
around you and allow you to sleep or concentrate

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.469
or whatever you need to do.

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:04.449
So those are my seven ways to be smart with
your smart phone.

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:07.300
I know you have some that you want to share.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.310
We would love to hear that, whether it’s
for Android or Iphone.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.190
Please let us know in the “comments.”

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.490
We love your comments.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.300
We enjoy working with you here on the YouTube
Channel.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.509
Love hearing from you.

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.210
So also remember to subscribe to our channel
at http://www.clutterdiet.tv.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.680
And we’ll see you next time.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.990
May you always be happy and grateful for having
more than enough.
