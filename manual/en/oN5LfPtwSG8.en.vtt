&gt;&gt; Larry: HERE'S WHY.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.639 size:81% position:41% line:91%
YOU HAVE TO NAME SOMEONE

WHY THEY ARE THE GREATEST,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME WHY THEY'D

&gt;&gt; JOE LOUIS.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.259 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHY WOULD HE BEAT
TYSON.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:07.900 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK BECAUSE HE WAS

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.970 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I DON'T --

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:16.309 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:18.978 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND I SAY THAT HE WOULD
BEAT MIKE TYSON BECAUSE HE

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:20.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS A HELL OF A HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMP.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.149 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THERE YOU GO.

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:24.851 line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A LOT OF STUTTERING.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:25.852 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, I GET IT.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:26.653 align:start position:0% line:85%
LZ.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:31.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WAS GOING TO GO WITH
JOE LOUIS.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.259 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I GUESS I WILL GO WITH ALI.

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:36.896 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHY WHAT HE BEAT
MIKE TYSON.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:37.897 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BETTER REACH.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.133 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.501 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BETTER REACH.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.302 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: AUDIENCE?
(APPLAUSE)

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:46.272 align:start position:0% line:91%
DID HE BELIEVE THAT?
(BOOING)

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:49.075 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:50.109 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT? BETTER REACH.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.945 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE AUDIENCE WANTS
YOU TO HAVE WEAK TEA

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:54.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO SAY MORE THAN
THAT.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.884 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, KEITH, KEEP IT A 100.
WHO'S THE GREATEST?

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:01.787 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW I WILL. IT'S ALI,
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.523 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE TYSON SAID HE WOULD
BEAT HIM.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:11.898 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WATCHED ONE OF YOUR
INTERVIEWS.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:12.899 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.067 align:start position:0% line:91%
MIKE, I'M GOING TO DO A
DIFFERENT ONE WITH YOU.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.169 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I WANT YOUR HONEST OPINION.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.870 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH
THESE VERY FAST.

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:19.305 align:start position:0% line:85%

BEAT THEM, THEY BEAT YOU OR

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:22.542 align:start position:0% line:85%

&gt;&gt; ALI.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:26.345 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ALI WINS.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:27.380 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ALI WINS.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:27.813 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; JOE LOUIS.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.322 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GEORGE FOREMAN.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.658 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THIS MIGHT BE CLOSE.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.127 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MILLION DOLLAR BABY.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.195 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SHE MAY WIN.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:42.762 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; APOLLO CREED.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:45.498 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.600 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; JAKE LAMOTTA
&gt;&gt; HE WINS.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.235 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ROBERT DE NIRO

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:50.570 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I WILL GET HIM GOOD.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.105 size:75% position:38% line:85%
HE DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:58.211 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ROBERT DE NIRO AS FAT JAKE
LAMOTTA.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.613 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF I'M FAT TOO, HE HAS A
CHANCE.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:03.282 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ROBERT DE NIRO AS A YOUNG
GODFATHER.

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:07.620 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE MIGHT WIN BECAUSE HE
HAS THE GUNS AND STUFF.

00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:11.824 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SODA POP PENSKI
FROM MIKE TYSON'S PUNCHOUT

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.025 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU KNOW SODA.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:13.793 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE BEAT ME BEFORE.

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.094 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE BEAT YOU

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:18.731 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PAUL SIMON WHILE HE IS
SINGING THE BOXER.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:22.368 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU COULD TAKE HIM.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.269 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ROCKY THREE.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:24.971 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt;  THAT MIGHT BE CLOSE TOO.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.172 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ROCKY ONE.

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:28.908 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD GET HIM.

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:30.176 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ROCKY SIX.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.145 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD WIN.

00:03:33.178 --> 00:03:34.013 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ROCKY FOUR?

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:37.984 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WAS I IN THAT ONE.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:41.487 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT, MIKE,
ROCKY FOUR.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.788 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DID HE FIGHT THE RUSSIAN.

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.790 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO WAY YOU ARE
BEATING ROCKY FOUR.

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:46.492 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DID HE FIGHT THE RUSSIAN
GUY.

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:47.593 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT WAS THREE.

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:48.561 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE BEAT THE RUSSIAN IN ROCKY
FOUR.

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:50.763 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE WOULD WIN.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.265 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT IS KEEPING IT 100.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:55.301 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
