00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.280
(piano playing)

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.510
Female voiceover: We're
in the National Gallery,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.773
in London, looking at
one of the most curious,

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:13.224
puzzling paintings in all of art history.

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:15.032
Male voiceover: One of the
most disturbing paintings.

00:00:15.032 --> 00:00:17.898
It's by a Mannerist painter, Bronzino,

00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:19.894
who worked in the Medici Court.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:20.934
Female voiceover: In Florence.

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:22.224
Male voiceover: It goes by the title,

00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:24.472
"Allegory of Venus and Cupid."

00:00:24.472 --> 00:00:26.195
Female voiceover: Sometimes it's called,

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:28.808
"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time."

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:30.169
It's interesting that the National Gallery

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.506
label only mentions Venus and Cupid,

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:34.555
because really, those
are the only two figures

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.163
we can identify with any certainty.

00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:38.381
Male voiceover: This
painting is a great reminder

00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:40.777
that art history has a
lot of work ahead of it.

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:44.004
You can see the primary
figure, the largest figure,

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:45.817
the female nude that faces us.

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:49.088
That's Veuns. Her son, the
figure that wraps around her,

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:50.916
that kisses her, is Cupid.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:55.592
Female voiceover: I find it
disturbingly erotic and incestuous.

00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:58.416
The two figures embrace and kiss,

00:00:58.416 --> 00:01:03.091
but in a way that is also
emptied of any overt eroticism.

00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:06.715
There's a kind of icy coolness
here at the same time.

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:08.492
Male voiceover: The coolness
that you're speaking of,

00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:12.619
the aloofness of those figures,
is made even more powerful

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.756
because her ear and their
cheeks are the only things

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:17.495
that have any warmth.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.773
The rest of the figures are
a kind of cool, gray-white.

00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:22.654
Female voiceover: But
the other figures aren't.

00:01:22.654 --> 00:01:26.317
They all seem to express an
idea to stand for something.

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:28.326
Male voiceover: Well,
that's why this must be

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:29.918
a kind of visual poetry.

00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:31.454
Female voiceover: Or a pun, or a riddle.

00:01:31.454 --> 00:01:34.857
Male voiceover: We know that the
Court of Cosimo de' Medici loved that.

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:36.855
Female voiceover: We
think that this was likely

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:41.191
a present from Cosimo de' Medici
to King Francis I of France,

00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.516
a great art collector and patron.

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:44.797
Male voicover: Okay, so we've established

00:01:44.797 --> 00:01:46.601
that we have no idea what
this painting is about,

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:48.435
but let's spend a moment really looking

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:51.637
at the painting carefully, and
describing what we do understand.

00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:53.607
We know this is Venus, in part,

00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:56.111
because she's a nude
female, front and center.

00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:59.230
But also by the fact that
she holds in her left hand,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.530
a golden apple.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.667
This was a prize that
she had won from Paris,

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:07.943
that is a part of the great Ancient
Greek myth of the Trojan War.

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:09.060
Female voiceover: In her right hand,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.902
she holds an arrow that
she's stolen from Cupid,

00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:14.454
as though disarming him, a subject
that we often see in Art History.

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:16.108
Male voiceover: These are typical traits.

00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:18.668
These are two figures
that are easy to identify.

00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:20.517
Female voiceover: Although,
I've never seen them shown

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:21.568
embracing like this.

00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:23.991
Male voiceover: No. If
you follow the zig-zag

00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:25.989
of Cupid's body, you end at his foot.

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.298
Just below that, in the
very corner of the painting,

00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:31.856
is a Dove, which is another
attribute or symbol of Venus.

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:33.487
Female voiceover: Now, you
used the word "zig-zag"

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.796
for Cupid's body. I
think that's also a term

00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:38.389
that we could use for Venus' body.

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.353
We go from her right hand,
holding that [quiver],

00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:45.635
across her shoulder, down her
torso, and then across her legs.

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:48.110
Maybe that's a metaphor
for this whole painting,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.856
this zig-zagging, this back-and-forth
of what does this mean,

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.109
and how do these things
relate to each other?

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.349
Male voiceover: Oppositions
that construct this painting,

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.019
if we follow that
zig-zag down Venus' body,

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:03.136
and we move across the legs
to the bottom right corner

00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:05.587
of the painting, we find two masks.

00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:08.240
We have no idea what they're there for.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.250
Female voiceover: But
masks generally refer

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.776
to deception, a kind of hiding.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.813
Male voiceover: Just above the masks,

00:03:14.813 --> 00:03:17.336
we see another nude figure, a young child,

00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:21.416
who seems as if he's about to
throw blossoms on the couple.

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:23.210
Female voiceover: Art
historians have speculated

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.547
that this figure represents
pleasure or folly.

00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:28.966
Male voiceover: Well he looks
incredibly mischievous, doesn't it?

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:31.439
Female voiceover: He does. He
has bells on his left ankle.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.135
Male voiceover: More
troubling, just behind him

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:37.531
is the head of a girl, but
on the body of a serpent,

00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:41.716
with the legs of a lion, and
with the tail of a scorpion.

00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:43.876
Female voiceover: Her face is in shadow.

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:46.253
In her right hand, she holds a honeycomb.

00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:49.275
Her left hand, which is
illuminated, tilts back

00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:53.210
away from us in this way that looks
almost anatomically distorted.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.872
She seems to hold her tail that
has, at the tip of it, a stinger.

00:03:57.872 --> 00:04:01.063
Male voiceover: So, on the one
hand, she's holding a honeycomb,

00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:03.666
which is a traditional symbol
of pleasure, and of course ...

00:04:03.666 --> 00:04:04.373
Female voiceover: Of temptation.

00:04:04.373 --> 00:04:05.570
Male voiceover: Of sweetness.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.872
But then, there's the price.

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:08.632
Female voiceover:
Exactly. Then, above this,

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:14.170
a figure who seems to be Father
Time, or Cronus in ancient mythology.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.255
He's identifiable by the
hourglass that's on his back.

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:19.965
Male voiceover: You can actually see

00:04:19.965 --> 00:04:21.960
that there is sand pouring
through that hourglass,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.061
if you look very closely. You
can also just make out a wing

00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:26.925
that's coming out from his body.

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:30.085
He helps to frame the
upper part of this canvas.

00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:33.250
At the bottom, Venus' legs.
Then, at the top, his arm.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.476
I'm interested in the way that
his right hand is bent around,

00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:42.516
so that we see the back of his hand
very much like the young girl serpent.

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.671
Female voiceover: It's hard to tell
what he's doing with that hand.

00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:48.137
Is he pulling this blue cloth away,

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:52.317
or is he seeking to hide it from
that figure in the upper left,

00:04:52.317 --> 00:04:54.584
who he's looking anxiously toward?

00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:56.061
Male voiceover: The
figure in the upper left

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:57.517
is one of the most contentious.

00:04:57.517 --> 00:05:00.813
In other words, we really
don't know what that figure is.

00:05:00.813 --> 00:05:03.838
That figure seems to be painted as a mask.

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:06.164
Some people have described
that figure as oblivion.

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:08.329
Some people have described
that figure as night.

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:11.421
Some people have described
that figure as fraud.

00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:13.529
Female voiceover: Below
that, we have a figure

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.135
who is grasping its head with its hands.

00:05:16.135 --> 00:05:16.915
Male voiceover: And screaming.

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:19.510
Female voiceover: Art historians think

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.940
this perhaps could represent
syphilis, the venereal disease.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.878
So, is this some kind of [maul]
about the cost of pleasure, perhaps,

00:05:29.878 --> 00:05:32.840
that time reveals? Hard to know.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.864
Male voiceover: So, on
one side we have folly.

00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:37.468
Perhaps, on the other, insane regret.

00:05:37.468 --> 00:05:42.092
There is this series of
oppositions, this lasciviousness,

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:45.519
this crossing of boundaries,
deeply uncomfortable.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.840
Female voiceover: We feel uncomfortable.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.235
It's hard to know what
Cosimo de' Medici thought

00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:53.604
of the Medici Court, or Francis
I, for whom it was likely a gift.

00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:57.828
But, it does seem as though it's
a kind of intellectual puzzle,

00:05:57.828 --> 00:06:01.858
something that had multiple meanings,
unlike the Renaissance paintings,

00:06:01.858 --> 00:06:05.101
that have a sense of balance,
and harmony, and structure.

00:06:05.101 --> 00:06:08.191
This painting doesn't give
us any one thing to look at,

00:06:08.191 --> 00:06:11.601
but gives us many things, so
our eye moves around the edges,

00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.353
and one thing leads to another.
There's never a conclusion.

00:06:14.353 --> 00:06:16.995
Male voiceover: For me,
this painting is a reminder

00:06:16.995 --> 00:06:21.640
that the conceit that we have,
the technology that our society,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.187
that our culture, gains more and
more, that we learn more and more.

00:06:25.187 --> 00:06:29.082
It's a reminder that we've
also lost, that we've forgotten

00:06:29.082 --> 00:06:32.603
that the past and its meanings
have slipped out of our grasp.

00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:35.234
Female voiceover: It's quite
likely that we'll never recover

00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:36.830
what this painting really means.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.830
(piano playing)
