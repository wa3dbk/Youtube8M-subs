00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.320
from time to time and why my
administration our minds a solid

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.030
trousers ballpark aptos that we only
part of the militants amount data pokes

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.099
uh... yeah we've executed three u_s_
citizens without a trial or any due

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.029
process but

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.629
anyways

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.779
as an attorney general holder was
famously said

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.339
uh... due process is not necessarily
judicial process due process could be a

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.779
us hanging out the baseman deciding that
it's been a couple of nights

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.130
not latter part was imply

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.279
so john o john brennan who is ahead
president wallace top counter-terrorism

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.560
adviser said quote

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.300
if we have a high degree of confidence
that innocent civilians will not be

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.059
injured

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.120
or killed

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.770
isn't seen where

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.559
rare

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.430
but it has happened

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.230
another words don't sweat it do we
almost never kill civilians now now we

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.950
got this thing for your

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.100
except for when they don't have it
figured out

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.620
as it turns out there's a new study done
by uh...

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.740
blockbusters a staffer new york
university then she went

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.320
and talk to people on the ground in
northwestern paxton

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.860
and we have killed since two thousand
and four

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.470
eight hundred eighty-four civilians

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.000
in just a little less than pakistan

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.940
including wonder

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.500
hundred and seventy six

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.930
what i have no we don't kill civilians

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.130
i didn't work out too well right

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.390
so this is disastrous for distributor
props i'm not against

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.980
all-girl strike since president obama so
it was said about wars

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.720
dom drone strikes

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.870
first of all we can do signature strikes
that's what we do have someone and we

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.170
don't know who it is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.410
at personality strike is when we know
who it is a signature strike is adan ula

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.560
looks like there's guns on their was a
skeleton figure out a how who they are

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.509
later in fact

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.299
lorena bobbitt and with a really when
you kill hundreds every sixty million

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.800
children

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.630
this substance you made enemies out of a
on earned six families

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.930
who hate you for the rest of their lives

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.020
and will try to events them in anyway
possible let alone the eight hundred

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.210
eighty four civilians let alone

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.939
all the places where were doing

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.199
drones trucks

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.369
so you are no draws tried yes the top
al-qaeda leader i hear you

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.059
that makes sense

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.490
you i don't mean discriminating like
through signature strikes is crazy

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.519
sailing this craze is a double tap

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.139
double tap is we do a drone strike it

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.179
first responders rescuers

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:29.169
medical professional sometimes right in

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.769
we get there

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.219
hideous man

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.549
what right thing he american what person
with any shred of morality

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.549
agrees with that that's crazy

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.779
so now look uh... brave new foundation
they're great job of

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.769
finding these you searchers and talking
to them about what is happening in

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.939
pakistan because of this

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.319
bradenton herald

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.719
deserter higher communities

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.560
who live in areas were drawn to the
following overhead

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.439
twenty four hours a day seven days a
week at times

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.639
in these people who don't know when
those roles will strike they don't know

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.479
were they will strike result is symptoms

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.609
of psychological disorder

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.199
of trauma

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:19.189
of severe anxiety ended this
functionality

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.999
we heard stories of people who won't
leave their houses

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:28.749
now republics will look at them think
that fall have read terrorize them cold

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:29.700
for them

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.630
now but wait

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.989
these are things yeltsin

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.609
pegasus post an ally these are civilians
were talking about why would we do that

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.909
if we terrorize them like that what
would it make us

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.299
if you got the bad guys everybody's on
your side

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.000
utilising interest rates

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.679
it killed all the civilians

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.849
and your terrorizing the rest of the
population

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.129
you know just cover us why they hate us
they hate us because they hate us

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.339
or could it be that if they had rolled
over your head and your family instead

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:03.489
the whole time you know they would have
been guilty or innocent

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.119
you might not like that situation either
especially

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:07.639
and they did wide open

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.279
hitting members of your family

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.269
now how about the double taps let's hear
about that

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.899
people with whom we spoke

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:19.010
in the communities affected almost
without exception told us

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.380
when there's a joint right

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.360
we welcome your afterwards

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.169
and we even heard this from some medical
professional

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.569
well they're not going to go by draws
strike if they think they're gonna get

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.290
ahead

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.650
and now again knuckle head conservancy
yeah that's right yeah we have again

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.150
but and about a man

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.729
if there was a catastrophe here and
people were hurt it was in your

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:39.680
neighborhood

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.020
what would you do

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.159
the most humane people wouldn't rushing
in and try to help those people

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.409
and then get hurt it

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.759
how's that for more hours

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.919
i love this country i'd believe an idea
of america

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.210
that's why i became a citizen here

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.189
and maybe that's my problem that i
really believe it

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.080
and as i see this i think

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.120
what do you doing that america

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.889
what one of the guys who wind up killing
first responders

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.760
why would we does that and think about
how

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.179
credibly counterproductive it is

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:19.270
this wasn't deterrent terrorism missiles
and let terrorism

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.349
this if anything it increases that

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.350
has all these

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.949
people windup

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.790
letting us and pinky

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.219
infancy e how can i get revenge on these
guys

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.009
we were the city on a hill we created
the united nations

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.780
we did the marshall plan we went over
enemies

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.669
we spread human rights across the world
we weren't along but we were only there

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.269
in that category alexa what they've done
knots

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:47.139
and look at what their perception of
tags and in this area is

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:47.860
of america
