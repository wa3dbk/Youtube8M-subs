00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:06.266
[1 John 4:3] "Every spirit that does not confess Jesus

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:10.200
is not from God.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.914
This is the spirit of the antichrist..."

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:20.493
Not an outright denial that Jesus was
a historical figure.

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:24.047
But if you don't confess the Jesus

00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:27.190
of the Bible

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.371
you see what's said.

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:30.042
Look,

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:35.794
to deny aspects of the person of Christ,

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.239
the teaching,

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.142
(that's doctrine, doctrine is 'teaching'),

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.700
to deny the doctrine of Christ,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.579
the teaching of Christ

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.328
concerning His person and His work;

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:56.119
every spirit that does not confess the biblical Jesus,

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.475
this is the spirit of antichrist.

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.771
To deny a fact about Christ is to be

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:06.421
seduced by the spirit of antichrist

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:07.731
and to be an antichrist.

00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.491
You are an antichrist

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:15.423
if you are denying the Jesus of the Bible.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.042
Now,

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:21.499
notice this,

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.938
1 John 2:22

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:37.222
"Who is the liar, but he who denies that 
Jesus is the Christ?"

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:43.005
Undoubtedly, there were some specific
errors,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.494
I am broadening it out to talk about
any attack on His person,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.741
there were specific ones in that day.

00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:55.768
In 1 John 4:3 it just talks about,

00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:58.403
if you don't confess Jesus,

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:00.538
you are not from God;

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:01.930
this is antichrist.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.462
Here, [ 1 John 2:22]

00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:06.535
to deny that Jesus is the Christ.

00:02:06.873 --> 00:02:09.618
Well again it says, "This is
the antichrist."

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:12.076
"He who denies the Father and the Son."

00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:13.367
Notice this.

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:17.100
[1 John 2:23] "No one who denies the Son has the Father."

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:20.182
Here is what I want you to see from this.

00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:25.834
To deny a fact about Christ, is to deny
Christ.

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:28.232
You need to see that.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.636
Because people don't admit that.

00:02:31.662 --> 00:02:34.655
"Jesus is not God! He is the Son of God!"

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.741
You just denied Christ.

00:02:39.237 --> 00:02:41.172
"No! I didn't deny Christ."

00:02:41.172 --> 00:02:42.597
But see,

00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:45.042
God says you did.

00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:50.808
And ultimately, it is not what we think that counts or matters.

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:54.727
There is a denial here, of Christ himself.

00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:56.742
Notice this.

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.228
They did not raise their fist.

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:03.242
They did not just defy Christ.

00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:05.917
They did not curse His Name.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:10.765
They did not deny that Jesus actually
lived.

00:03:11.262 --> 00:03:14.709
They just set forth something about Christ that was not true.

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.648
To alter the person or work of Jesus
Christ is to attack Christ,

00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:21.834
it's to be antichrist.

00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:25.521
Now notice this.

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:34.100
In verse 23 it says, "No one who denies
the Son has the Father.

00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:40.404
Whoever confesses the Son has the 
Father also."

00:03:41.904 --> 00:03:43.697
Here's the thing,

00:03:47.497 --> 00:03:49.821
I've had Catholics tell me,

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.304
"It is the same God."

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.840
There are Muslims that want to say,

00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:04.798
"Well we've got our differences but it is the same God."

00:04:05.548 --> 00:04:07.135
Ok.

00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:17.342
I read over here that Jesus Christ is
called the Mighty God.

00:04:19.763 --> 00:04:23.867
I read over here that Jesus Christ was
crucified.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:29.536
That He made propitiation for sins and He rose from the dead.

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:34.540
Is that the Christ you believe in?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.288
They are going to say, "No way!"

00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:38.181
You don't have the Father.

00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:39.493
Not the same God.

00:04:39.493 --> 00:04:41.963
No way! No how!

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:44.526
To deny Christ.

00:04:45.587 --> 00:04:49.260
They'll say, "We don't deny Christ. He was a prophet."

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.647
He was a prophet. But He was much more than that.

00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:58.988
And they deny essential facts about Him,
which means they deny Christ.

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:02.385
Which means they are antichrist, which
means they don't have the Father.

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:05.709
They deny the Father in denying the Son.

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:08.826
Do you recognize us going to God?

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:12.207
He is the Way, He is the Truth, He is the 
Life.

00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:18.167
We don't go to the Father except through 
this Christ, as revealed in Scripture.

00:05:18.244 --> 00:05:19.468
There is no way to God,

00:05:19.468 --> 00:05:22.012
there is no way to be on safe terms with God,

00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:23.739
there is no way to be right with God,

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.393
there is no way to be saved from the wrath of God,

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:30.010
unless we embrace the true Christ.

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.208
And then you can see from verse 25,

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:39.904
"This is the promise that He made to us â€“eternal life."

00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:41.396
And who is the "us"?

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:42.611
It is those with the anointing.

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.424
It is those who embrace the truth.

00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:46.994
To deny Christ is to be without the Father

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:49.666
and to deny Christ is to be without
eternal life!

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.185
Make no mistake about it!

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:55.032
This is life and death,

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:57.165
to go wrong on Christ!
