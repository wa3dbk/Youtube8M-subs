00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.420
Today we are going to talk about oral squamous
cell carcinoma in cats. This is a cancer that

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.080
is very serious and early detection is critical.
To learn more about oral squamous cell carcinoma

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.760
in cats, we are going to meet with Dr. Mona
Rosenberg who is board certified in veterinary

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.899
oncology.
A very common form of oral cancer in cats

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.590
is called squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous
cells are the cells that line our skin and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.820
our oral cavity. Unfortunately, in cats, and
in dogs too, but in cats much more commonly,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.600
one of those normal skin cells or oral lining
cells actually has the ability to become cancerous.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.100
We really aren't sure why cats develop this
particular form of cancer so commonly, but

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.479
some of the thoughts include that when you
look at the behavior of cats, with how fastidious

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.560
they are, licking themselves and cleaning
themselves all the time, that their oral cavity

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.960
becomes exposed to foreign objects on an ongoing
basis. We know that cancer can be caused by

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.300
chronic inflammatory processes, so if the
mouth of a cat is always being exposed to

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.700
these external, foreign objects, that can
set up a genetic mutation within the normal

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.270
oral cell, and that cell can become cancerous.
Typically, these cancers can occur anywhere

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.450
in the mouth. We can see them on the upper
jaw, on the lower jaw, or even associated

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.170
with the tongue, in particular underneath
the tongue. The most common presenting signs

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.730
of a cat with oral squamous cell carcinoma
is drooling, weight loss, loss of appetite,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.030
and sometimes even a little blood tinged in
the water bowl or in the saliva, and the reason

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.420
that this occurs is because the cats start
to develop difficulty in eating, the tongues

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.280
don't work as well as they should, so instead
of being able to swallow their saliva, it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.819
tends to drip out. The other sign that we
can sometimes see is bad breath or halitosis,

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.569
and that's because the tumor itself can become
infected with all of the bacteria that occur

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.750
within the mouth. So should you notice any
of these signs, such as bad breath or drooling

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.670
or decreased appetite, please take your cat
right away to your family veterinarian to

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.120
be checked out. This cancer, like many other
cancers that we are aware of, with early detection

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.330
we have a much better chance of providing
good quality of life to your pet. If your

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.450
family veterinarian finds a mass in the mouth
of your cat, the first thing that he or she

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.920
will likely do is get some blood work and
a urinalysis to make sure that your pet is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.990
healthy. Additionally, chest x-rays and perhaps
even an aspiration of the draining lymph node

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.630
is warranted to make sure that the cancer
has not spread.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.290
Then your veterinarian will put your cat under
anesthesia to get a surgical biopsy and possibly

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.720
even some dental x-rays, in order to determine
how invasive the tumor may be. Only with a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.110
biopsy can we determine whether or not your
pet has cancer, and the type of cancer.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.240
Once the diagnosis is confirmed, likely a
cat scan of the mass and the mouth will be

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.300
performed in order to identify whether a wide
surgical excision is possible for your cat.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.880
If it is, then a surgeon will likely go in
and remove as much of that tumor and normal

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.010
tissue surrounding it, because if we can achieve
complete surgical margins, then likely the

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.900
cancer is not going to come back. If we find
out that your cat is not a good surgical candidate,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.610
then we've found that radiation therapy is
very effective at controlling the disease,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.850
either shrinking it, so that we have improved
the quality of life, or in some cases actually

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.920
making the tumor go away completely. Your
oncologist may also decide to use chemotherapy,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.620
as a radiation sensitizer. Sometimes chemotherapy
low doses will actually increase the sensitivity

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.479
of cancer cells to the effects of radiation,
making the radiation much more successful.

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.800
Chemotherapy in cats, as well as radiation,
has very few side effects, and in fact 95

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.350
percent of the cats that we treat with chemotherapy
actually have no side effects whatsoever.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.000
The main reason for that is that cats don't
know they have cancer and so they don't psychologically

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.900
have the same baggage that a person would
have if they were going through the same treatment.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.740
Our goal is always about quality of life.
Dr. Rosenberg gave us an excellent overview

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.370
of oral squamous cell carcinoma in cats. If
you think you notice a tumor on your cats

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.300
mouth OR under the tongue... you should bring
it to the attention of your veterinarian immediately.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.180
If found early; surgery, radiation and/or
chemotherapy may actually provide a cure for

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.230
the cancer. If a cure is not possible, additional
therapy may include antibiotics and pain medicine

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.630
to help provide the best quality of life possible
for your pet. I am Dr. Mike, I hope this information

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.409
is helpful and thanks for watching.
