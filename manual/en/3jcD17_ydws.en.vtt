00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.230
Hi, my name's Andrew Wheeler.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.310
I'm the Product Manager for Abu Garcia.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.380
We're here at ICIS 2012 and I'd like to introduce
the new Revo series of reels.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.970
We've done some major changes on the Revo
family.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.970
As you can see, it's much more compact in
design.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.400
It really fits in your hand really comfortable
with a lot lower profile, so it's really much

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.030
more comfortable to fish with all day.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.779
Also, we've lightened up these reels.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.529
Some of them are up to 30% weight savings.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.880
So, again, it makes it just much more comfortable
to fish with.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.690
We also have a new gear system, so, again
these are a more powerful reel.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.530
This D2 gear system is much more efficient
than the previous gear system, so it's easier

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.640
to wind in baits or big fish.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.300
Also, it gives us a much wider range of gear
ratios we have available.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.809
This is the new Premier.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.649
As you can see, it's a very, very compact
reel.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.940
It's extremely lightweight at under six ounces.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.980
It features our UBCD4 braking system, which
is an externally adjustable braking system.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.630
It's very, very easy to use and adjust on
the water.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.589
It has a carbon handle and the EVA knobs,
again, to reduce that weight, but it gives

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.589
you a lot of strength.

00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:09.299
This is our carbon matrix drag system, like
all of our Revo reels.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.710
It's very smooth drag performance with very
low start-up inertia.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.020
The next one in the family is the Revo STX.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.590
This reel has undergone the most radical weight
saving, close to 30% weight saving from the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.590
previous STX.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.680
So, it's very, very lightweight in the hands.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.139
It features our Infini brake design.

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:33.969
This brake design uses a combination of a
centrifugal and a magnetic brake, so it's

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.619
extremely adjustable.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.659
You can really adjust it on the fly on the
water, especially with a magnetic brake, so

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.619
you can fine tune your cast to any style of
bait or any type of fishing condition.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.869
The new SX, again, is extremely comfortable
to fish wish.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.630
It saves up to 25% of the weight savings from
the previous SX.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.849
So, again, it's very, very comfortable to
fish with all day.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.079
It comes in two gear ratios, 6:4 and a 7:1.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.069
The new Revo S comes in one gear ratio and
it's 6:4:1 and features our Pitch Centrifugal

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.069
Brake system.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.960
This Pitch Centrifugal Brake system is extremely
adjustable.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.720
As you can see, we have three brake locks
which are spring loaded.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.120
So if you want maximum distance, you use those
and they turn themselves off halfway through

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.370
the path so you can really improve that distance
casting.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.450
If you want a lot of control, you use the
Pitch Centrifugal Brakes, and those Pitch

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.510
brakes will stay on through the entire cast
and allow you to get maximum control.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.250
The last one in the Revo family in the casting
reels is our Revo Winch.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.739
This is a crankbait specific or resistance-based
specific reel.

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.040
As you can see, that big gear system is very,
very efficient.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.560
When combined with a 5:4:1 gear ratio, it
makes winding in large crankbaits extremely

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560
easy.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.670
It has an oversized bent handle and large
EVA knobs, again, to give you a lot more torque

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.069
on the reel and allow you to wind in those
larger crankbaits much easier.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.319
It features our Infini brake system as well,
similar to the STX reel, a combination of

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.840
the centrifugal and the magnetic brake, and
this really helps you cast those large DD22s,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.739
especially into the wind where you need to
really fine tune that casting brake.

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.569
Also new in the Revo family, we have two spinning
reels.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.599
We have the Revo SX.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.829
As you can see, a perfect match for the casting
reel.

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.400
This reel features our C6 carbon standard.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.250
It's extremely stiff.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.969
It's extremely lightweight and has a braid-ready
spool.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.349
As you can see, there are some really fine
regions on that spool to help bite the braid

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.540
into the spool.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.180
You don't need to under fill it with mono-filament.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.349
It features our Hybrid Carbon Matrix Drag
System for really smooth drag performance.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.940
It also features our EVA knob, again, just
for a lot of comfort on the water.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.530
The last one is our Revo S spinning reel.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.810
This features our advanced polymeric body.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.420
This is, again, a very lightweight material
and a very, very durable material.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.510
It features, also, a braid-ready spool and
a Hybrid Carbon Matrix drag design.
