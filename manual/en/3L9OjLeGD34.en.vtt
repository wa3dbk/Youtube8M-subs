[Intro]

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.220
Hello, my name is iPugsieHD, and just before we start I ask that you could SLAP

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.690
that like button as it helps me out so much as well as subscribing so I can show you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.060
the most newest glitching content as
well as people in the comments sharing

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
sharing their glitches with me and how to do them so they can share their fun with us.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.070
For this part, what you're going to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.899
need to do is basically just head to
team and pants and when your at pants

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.430
you want to put on like these gray-ish ones that I actually do, it'll be exactly the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.899
same for male, they're both the same
because they came out both editions like

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.160
male female and then you're going to
want to head over to the tops and when

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.969
you're at tops it did take me quite a
while to actually find what I was

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.550
looking for, so I did speed it up a bit but I
was actually making this when I was

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.510
going along and it was quite tricky to
make but you are going to need to put on the same

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.270
color of the trousers I've got. Now you
want to head to body armor and put show armour onto the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.030
black one (standard armour) and once you've done that
you're gonna head over to mask shop and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.860
when your at a mask shop you want to buy like this
balaclava and also by the same gray

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.390
color bulletproof helmet, once you've bought
that you're going to want to set the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.170
bulletproof helmet as your default a
helmet when you get into like quadbikes

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.590
bear-in-mind and you will actually like a
quad back or a four-by-four like

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.280
ride-on, but once you've um set the up with

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.659
helmet as you like get-on default
helmet you're going to want to get onto

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.200
the bike and quickly, very quickly switch
to the balaclava that you just bought, so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.380
once you've done this you're going to
quickly want to run to the mask shop

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.700
press square and whatever it is on Xbox and save as quick as

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.610
possible and if you don't really understand this - I'll upload the same method or an easier way of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.400
explaining how to do this glitch on
Friday so just stay tuned and I will

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.140
bring out Friday - but I did make this video because there isn't actually a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.440
possible way of getting the cop outfit and I'm still trying to work on that

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.340
as well as the Bugstar outfit which a
lot of people keep wanting the Bugstar

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.670
as well as the cop outfit, the Bugstar is quite
hard as it removes the logos or stickers

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.780
as soon as you die or something like a
event happens - I did find a way we

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.780
could go to apartment and actually save it, but it removes it so I think

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.190
there may be another way as there is for everything

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.350
as well as the Cop one which should be out soon, but have actually got this one right

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.130
here which is like kind of one till I
actually find a method but as always

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.739
like the video, and I'll see you, in the next one.
