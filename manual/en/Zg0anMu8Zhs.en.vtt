00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.680
Vanish in the world around me, leaving ash
and bone

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.300
My crown of thorns it shows no mercy but it's
my own

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.700
I grace these walls with all my failures
What have i become?

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.300
I think it's time for my forgiveness lick
these wounds to heal

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.200
I'm losing faith, a silent poison, pain I'd
like to feel

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.800
I know it's time lay down surrender, someone
take control.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:30.500
Cuz I'm afraid to love
Cuz I'm afraid I'll leave

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:40.800
I'm living with these lies
That only I believe

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.700
And I don't want to walk
And I don't wanna run

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.200
Cuz I'm afraid of failing
In front of everyone.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.500
Hold me down and hurt my feelings, I won't
do the same

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.200
I'll cry inside with disappointment, taking
all the blame

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.500
The darkest hour always finds me, pulling
far away.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.100
Cuz I'm afraid to win
Cuz I don't wanna lose

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.500
And I'm afraid of falling
Under harsh review

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.700
And I'm afraid to live
And I'm too tired to try

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.500
I hide behind these shadows
Turn off all the lights.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.500
This never-ending longing feeling, waiting
to be loved

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:35.000
I'm still believing in forever but it never
comes.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:03.500
I'm afraid to love
Cuz I'm afraid I'll leave

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:13.200
I'm living with these lies
That only I believe

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.700
And I'm afraid to walk
And i don't wanna run

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.600
And I'm afraid of hurting
myself and everyone.
