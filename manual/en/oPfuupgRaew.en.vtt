00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.549
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to replace your engine's

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.250
timing belt, and water pump. In this step,
we're going to talk about the proper service

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.450
procedure for removing an engine idler pulley,
and your timing belt cover, and motor mount

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.789
bracket. This is one of your idler pulleys,
and it has to come off, in order to sneak

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:34.020
this belt cover out of the way. You're just
going to remove the bolt on the front of it.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.430
Once your have it broken loose, most of the
time, you can spin them out by hand. You're

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.620
going to want to pay particular attention
to the way the washers are on the bolt. Some

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.170
of them are there for spacing, and some of
them are actually seals, to keep dirt and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.420
road debris out of the bearing. It's a good
idea not to fully disassemble it, when you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:08.051
have it off,
and there you go. That is how you pull one

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:13.350
of those out. As you can see, you have the
seal inside here, and a washer and seal here.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.320
You're going to want to make sure to keep
the same bolt, with the same pulley. You're

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.250
going to set this in your magnetic tray assembled,
for later re-installation. Once you have the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.530
pulleys and any other components that have
to come off out of the way, you can go ahead

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:39.140
and begin removing timing belt cover bolts.
You can see we have one here. All right, we

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.490
got one there, and they're going to work their
way around the front of the motor, in a relatively

00:01:44.490 --> 00:02:03.180
evenly spaced pattern.We're just going to
continue.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.640
All right, we're going to set this aside in
our magnetic tray, for later re-installation.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.100
Now, we have a bunch more, and they're going
to go all the way around the timing belt cover,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.031
at a relatively evenly spaced interval. My
next one is right here, and I'm going to go

00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:32.190
ahead a slip my ratchet on there, and undo
the bolt, and go ahead and put that in the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.830
magnetic tray as well, and we're going to
get the last one, that you guys can see. That's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.220
going to be right here. We can go ahead and
unscrew this one, and like I said, this will

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.620
be the last one that you guys can really see.
You're going to want to make sure to be real

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.360
careful with these covers. They do have to
go back on the vehicle, and they break very

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:08.190
easily. I think that's by design. I'll go
ahead and finish off my last bolt there, so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.349
you can see the cover is beginning to get
loose, and you're going to want to wiggle

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:18.210
it around, until you can get it all the way
out. Like I said, take very careful care of

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.560
this kind of stuff. It's expensive, and very
brittle. You may have to manipulate the engine

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.780
up and down, in order to slip it in and out,
of it's location, and there you go. That is

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.330
the proper service procedure for removing
your idler pulley, and the upper timing belt

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.400
cover.
