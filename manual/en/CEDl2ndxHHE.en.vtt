00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.600
So the guy says "you know my car has some
dents and dings, but hey I love my car." So

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.920
how do you know if a man loves you? This is
Dr. Paul, author of Boomer Girls, a Boomer

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.260
Woman's Guide to Men and Dating, and host
of Ask Dr. Paul. Well, let me tell you how

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.610
that works. Men are visual, we've said that
before, and we know that men don't look at

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.560
the same things that you happen to notice.
Alright? I had a caller once, a guy, who called

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.720
and said "you know, I really like this girl,
I was in college and one day she said to me

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.700
by the way have you noticed my nose is little
bit off?" And he said from then on that's

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:59.100
all I could see. OK? He will overlook what
you feel may be a major flaw. That's one way

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.980
to tell how a man loves you that he is overlooking
the things that you feel are outrageously

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.030
important. He doesn't care. He cares about
you. He loves you. That's how you tell. If

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.930
he starts to pick on hey, do you know have
a bump or this or what. That's, then that's

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.710
your answer. But if he overlooks it he doesn't
care. If you happen to say did you notice,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.811
and never say this, my legs are too skinny?
Don't ever say that, he'll never notice. If

00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:32.470
he loves you he doesn't see it. I know that
sounds strange, but please believe me, men

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.100
are visual and they choose to see what they
want to see and don't see what they don't

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.400
want to see. I know it may sound strange,
but please believe that. That's why I open

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.200
by saying "hey, my car may have, or truck
may have, a few dents and dings, but I, I

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.860
love that truck, I love that car." OK? My
team may lose a few games but I love my team.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.380
That's how men are. OK? So, don't be bothered
with the trivia. They don't care. Please believe

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.299
me. This is Dr. Paul. May your fantasies of
today be your realities of tomorrow.
