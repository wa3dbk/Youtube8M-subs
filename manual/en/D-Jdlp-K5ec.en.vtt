Hey, my name is Chipp Marshal.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.920
In this video; I want to talk about how to
get rid of dandruff.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.160
In the United States, 1 out of every 5 people
are dealing with dandruff.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.990
So this is an issue that affects over 50 million
people in this country alone.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.890
I've dealt with it myself on and off for my
entire adult life.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.730
So I wanted to share with the rest of the
world how I was finally able to get rid of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.370
it quickly, naturally and permanently.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.120

Your support allows me to continue doing what
I love and making videos like this to help

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.180
people solve their everyday problems.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.219
Dealing with dandruff was always the same
exact process for me.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.430
I would notice flakes on my scalp and then
I would pick up a bottle of "Head and Shoulders"

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.740
or "Nizoral" and use it until the flakes were
gone.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.069
The problem was that the dandruff always came
back.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:11.090
It got to the point where I was permanently
using anti-dandruff shampoo with every shower

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.679
I took.

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.090
I didn't realize it at the time but there
is a huge problem with that.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.890
The chemicals in these products are relatively
safe when used for short periods of time,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.530
but these are not ingredients that you want
to expose your body to on an ongoing or permanent

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.530
basis.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.029
And that is exactly what was happening to
me.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:37.029
The truth is that there are natural remedies
that will get rid of dandruff much more quickly

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:41.399
and effectively than the chemicals that are
being forced on us.

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.661
The only reason we resort to these chemicals
in the first place is because they are the

00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:50.990
cheapest way for a company to make a product
that actually works.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.780
It doesn't mean it is the best way to get
rid of dandruff.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.770
It's just the best way for companies to increase
their profits.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.319
OK, so let's jump right into this.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.729
The 4 natural ingredients that are best for
getting rid of dandruff are Sage, tea tree,

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.030
Spikenard, and rosemary essential oils.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.820
You have 2 options here.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.960
First, you can purchase the ingredients and
mix your own shampoo.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.180
That is the way I started out.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.400
It is very cost effective and actually pretty
fun to do.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.690
Or, I recently found an organic shampoo made
by company that specializes in holistic products.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.560
It contains each of those essential oils plus
other fantastic ingredients such as jojoba

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.090
oil that will help to get rid of dandruff
permanently.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.830
Also, if age is catching up to you like it
is to me, these are also the same exact ingredients

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.260
that are used to reverse thinning hair and
hair loss.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.800
So this is an all-around amazing shampoo that
will have many positive effects on your health

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.290
and your life.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.450
Now I don't want to mention specific products
in this video and make it sound like an advertisement.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.540
So if you want more information about that
shampoo, just visit my blog at www.chipptips.com/dandruff.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.260
There are also a bunch of other fantastic
tips on that page about getting rid of dandruff

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.340
naturally as well as a recipe for the do it
yourselfers that would like to mix their own

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.340
shampoo.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.319
Again, that is chipptips.com/dandruff.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.020
