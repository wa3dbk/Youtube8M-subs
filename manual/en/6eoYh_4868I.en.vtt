00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.370
Doosan is an industry leader in the

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.410
engineering, manufacturing, and marketing

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.569
of construction equipments, including

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.150
excavators, wheel loaders, and articulated

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.759
dump trucks. But while Doosan may seem

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.589
to be a relatively young brand in North

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.810
America, the organization has a global

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.119
manufacturing history going back more

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.199
than 75 years. Offering 14 tract, and

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.019
4 wheel models, Doosan excavators

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.039
range from 5.5 to 72 metric tons, with an

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.920
ever-growing list of attachments. Doosan

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.110
excavators provide a versatile addition

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.600
to any fleet. The reduced tail-swing

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.550
models offer the ability to work in

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.829
tight spaces, and on roadway maintenance

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.230
projects, while larger, conventional tail-

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.300
swing excavators have the power and

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.030
performance to handle various tasks, such

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.969
as site-prep, general excavation, and even

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.670
mining and quarry work. Cost to ownership is

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.280
a huge part of a contractor's life, and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.559
Doosan looking at trying to find ways

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.600
to maximize fuel economy, so with four

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.090
working modes, the operator's actually

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.090
able to select the working mode which

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.530
gives him the performance he needs to

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.830
complete the job or do the job, and also

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.000
maximize the fuel economy for that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.030
application. A continuous commitment to

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.920
operator comfort means some of the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.590
lowest noise levels in the industry. We

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.300
understand that a comfortable operator

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.110
is a productive operator, so large cab,

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.420
plenty of room, and then also, not only a

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.120
large cab, but being able to get a profile

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.700
inside the cab that fits operator. So

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.620
being able to adjust the seat in many

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.200
different ways, the control stands going

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.600
up and down, and then visibility, that's a

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.100
comfort thing too, don't have to move

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.500
around a lot inside the cab to see all

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.120
those key areas you need to see outside

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.950
the excavator while you performing the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.920
job. With Doosan, operators will be more

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.410
productive and efficient, packing more

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.010
work into the average workday. Ranging

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.400
from 2.6 to 7.2 cubic yard buckets,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.190
Doosan offers 10 wheel loaders to handle

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.530
a wide variety of material handling

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.420
tasks. Doosan wheel loaders offer

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.340
360-degree visibility, impressive digging

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.350
power, and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.570
high-tractive power to provide easy loading

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.200
of jobsite material. Designed to dig, dump,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.140
load, lift, and carry, Doosan wheel

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.510
loaders move mountains of rock, gravel,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.400
coal, grain, fertilizer, snow, and more.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.870
Tool carriers and high lift

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.610
configurations provide additional

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.070
performance in high-lift and lift-and-

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.010
carry applications. When Doosan builds a

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.130
machine, we really look at durability, so

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.740
we take a lot of pride in the way we

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.810
build our machines, they're built heavy,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.330
and it's all steel. You look across the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.000
board, all fenders, all doors, are made out

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.400
of durable steel. When it comes to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.380
performance and fuel efficiency, it's

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.420
very important to the customer, and we've

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.280
just done a nice job laying out the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.480
design of our machine with the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.640
hydraulics and the engine performance to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.620
help increase, get the best fuel economy,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.340
without sacrificing performance. Offering

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.440
two models in the Doosan articulated

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.710
dump truck line, the DA 0 and DA40

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.550
feature payloads of 28.1 and 39.9 metric

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.280
tons, respectively. My first impression

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.620
was, we got it right. The low end torque

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.400
and the power on this new DA30, DA40

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.220
were right on par what we needed to, to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.180
be a top-tier player in the ADT market.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.390
Doosan has put a lot of R&amp;D effort into

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.270
this ADT, this is a new, redesigned

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.520
machine. Put a lot of time and effort

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.410
inside that cab, making sure there's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.330
plenty of room, a lot of adjustability,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.940
givin' a lot of the features to the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.270
operator, owner. This Doosan truck has a

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.760
unique rear bogie system, and this is

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.850
truly a six-wheel drive ADT. You're just

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.740
going to get better traction and better

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.900
stability with this machine because all

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.760
the tires are going to stay in contact

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.040
with ground.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.989
Onboard diagnostic systems and easy

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.299
component access make maintenance about

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.450
as simple as it can be. From coast to

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.549
coast, there's a solid dealer network

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.590
that includes a 48-hour parts delivery

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.970
guarantee, helping to maximize uptime.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.580
Since its inception, Doosan has grown and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.380
changed as the world around them has,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.470
