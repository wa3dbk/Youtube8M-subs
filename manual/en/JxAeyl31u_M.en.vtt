00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.080
AS WE ALL KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED
TO CHANGE JOBS AND EVEN CAREERS EVER SINCE

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.830
THE 2008 RECESSION.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.139
AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO CHANGE, TODAY'S
JOB MARKET IN THE ARTS CONTINUES TO THRIVE.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.760
JOINING ME THIS MORNING IS DR.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.910
ELISA STEVENS, PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMY OF
ART UNIVERSITY, WHO IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.300
CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN TODAY'S WORLD.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.300
GOOD MORNING.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.300
OLGA, GOOD TO BE HERE.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.300
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.390
ARE YOU KIDDING I AM THRILLED YOU ARE HERE
BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.710
TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.040
ABOUT MAYBE CHANGING THEIR CAREERS.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.900
NOW MORE THAN EVER I ACTUALLY TELL MY FRIENDS
YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE TWO OPTIONS, NOT ONE

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.900
ANYMORE.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.900
AGREED?

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.900
AGREED.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.900
AND LET'S TALK ABOUT HAVING OPTIONS BECAUSE
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TODAY ARE LOOKING FOR

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.700
THAT FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR JOB
AND EDUCATION.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.700
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.430
BECAUSE IT REALLY IS ABOUT FLEXIBILITY AND
CONVENIENCE.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.111
MHM.
AND NOW PEOPLE CAN TAKE CLASSES ONLINE, THEY

00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:59.190
CAN HAVE A FULL TIME JOB, TEND TO THEIR FAMILIES,
AND STILL BE TAKING CLASSES.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.890
AND IT'S SUCH A WIN WIN SITUATION FOR EVERYONE
AT THAT POINT.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.869
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE EDUCATION AND THE
ONLINE CLASSES.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.140
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SO MUCH WITH YOU, BUT
I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE I LOVE FAMILY

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.470
HISTORY I REALLY DO. AND I KNOW THAT AND I
WAS READING HERE THE SCHOOL THAT YOU ARE GOING

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.120
TO BE TALKING ABOUT WAS FOUNDED 84 YEARS AGO
BY YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.120
AH!

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.280
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.280
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.900
MY GRANDFATHER FOUNDED THE ACADEMY OF ART
UNIVERSITY 84 YEARS AGO AND HE WAS THE PAINTER...

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.900
(GASP).

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.380
...HE PAINTED LANDSCAPES, HE DID PORTRAITS
AND MY GRANDMOTHER RAN THE SCHOOL AND TOOK

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.380
CARE OF THE BOOKS.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.380
AH!

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.380
HOW LOVELY.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.270
AND I AM THIRD GENERATION FAMILY THEY HAVE
ENTRUSTED ME WITH THIS SCHOOL.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.700
AND YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB WITH IT.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.659
YEAH AND YOU KNOW I AM A WORKING MOM.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:42.659
I AM MARRIED.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.840
I HAVE AN EIGHT YEAR OLD SON AND I FEEL LIKE
I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES WE ALL FACE AS

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.090
WORKING PARENTS.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.760
AND IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE YOU KIND OF FEEL YOU
CAN'T DO EVERYTHING, BUT AT THE END OF THE

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.500
DAY AND I TELL MY GIRLS BECAUSE I HAVE AN
EIGHT YEAR OLD TOO THAT YOU CAN DO IT ALL

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.500
IF YOU WANT.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.080
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT ONLINE ASPECT.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.450
IT'S SO APPEALING TO STUDENTS TO HEAR 'ONLINE.'

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.830
HOW DOES THE PROGRAM WORK?

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
YOU KNOW AT THE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE 18,000
STUDENTS.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.709
AND 2/3 OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY TAKING CLASSES
ONLINE.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:10.709
REALLY?

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.709
THAT MANY?

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.380
WE HAVE TWENTY TWO DEGREES ONLINE.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.940
FULLY ACCREDITED.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.840
AND IT REALLY IS ANYTIME ANYWHERE.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.530
AND THIS IS HOW IT WORKS: IT'S INTERACTIVE.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.740
THERE IS DEMONSTRATION VIDEO.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.740
THERE IS AUDIO.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.740
IT'S WRITTEN.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.340
WE HAVE PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTORS WHO GIVE
FEEDBACK TO THE STUDENTS.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.750
IT'S 24/7 HELP DESK.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.069
THEY CAN GET THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED...

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.660
WOW.
...AND IF YOU ARE UP AT 3 AM IN THE MORNING

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.980
WITH THE BABY, YOU CAN POST YOUR ASSIGNMENT.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.080
YOU'RE KIDDING!

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080
(LAUGHTER).

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.270
24/7!
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.440
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT MAY BE AFTER YOU GRADUATE
JOB AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.430
THERE ARE. AND WHAT WE ARE REALLY DOING IS
TEACHING OUR STUDENTS A SKILL SO THEY CAN

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.590
BE MORE VALUABLE ON THE JOB MARKET.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.640
AND LET ME ASK YOU THIS BECAUSE THIS HAPPENS
TO ME A LOT.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.410
WITH MY FRIENDS AND WITH MYSELF.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.819
I HAVE A BACHELOR'S, BUT OFTENTIMES I WILL
TELL MYSELF, "YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO BACK.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.340
I WANT TO MAYBE GET THAT MASTERS.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.920
I WANT TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE AND THEN I'LL
SAY IT'S TOO LATE."

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.680
YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT LIFETIME LEARNING AND
FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS AND PASSIONS AND WE'VE

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.130
GOT EXAMPLES.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.690
HEATHER CROSBY FOR EXAMPLE.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.069
SHE'S A MOM, A VETERAN, AND SHE'S GOT HER
DEGREE.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.500
100 PERCENT ONLINE...

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.500
REALLY?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500
...IN PHOTOGRAPHY.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.500
HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.620
AND SHE WAS ABLE TO DO IT.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.489
SO IT REALLY DOES NOT MATTER WHAT AGE WHETHER
YOU EVEN FINISHED OR NOT, THE POINT IS TO

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.629
GET OUT THERE AND DO MORE OR EVEN FINISH AT
THE END OF THE DAY.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.629
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.880
BECAUSE YOU KNOW STUDIES SHOW THAT IF YOU
HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE, YOUR EARNING CAPACITY

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.310
ACTUALLY INCREASES.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.270
AND I THINK IF YOU DON'T GET ONE, YOU WILL
HAVE SUCH REGRET AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHICH

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.030
I TELL MY CHILDREN EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.030
(LAUGHTER).

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.890
TELL ME SOME MORE SUCCESS STORIES THAT YOU
HAVE HAD WITH STUDENTS WHO MAYBE DIDN'T FINISH

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.030
OR WANTED TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.690
WELL ONE OF MY FAVORITE ONES IS A STUDENT.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.769
ALLY KAHN WHO GOT HIS DEGREE IN 2008 IN FASHION
DESIGN AND HE WAS 100 PERCENT ONLINE, HE LIVES

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.300
IN PAKISTAN.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.800
AND WE PRESENT IN A COMPETITIVE MANNER OUR
STUDENTS WORK IN NEW YORK CITY AT THE MERCEDES

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.250
BENZ FASHION WEEK.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.440
SO HE WAS SELECTED, WHICH WAS A HUGE HONOR
TO SHOW HIS COLLECTION IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.319
HE APPLIED FOR A VISA, A GUEST VISA AND WAS
DENIED SO HE COULDN'T EVEN COME IN AND SEE

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.319
HIS COLLECTION...

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:29.319
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.130
...BUT THE CLOTHES MADE IT ON THE RUNWAY.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.710
AND THAT'S A GREAT STORY.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.930
AND WHAT KIND OF CAREERS DO YOU OFFER?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.789
WE OFFER CAREERS ALL THE WAY FROM FASHION
DESGIN, CAR DESIGN.

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.160
WE HAVE MUSIC FOR VISUAL MEDIA.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160
WE HAVE...

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.160
THEATRE.

...ARCHITECTURE.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160
