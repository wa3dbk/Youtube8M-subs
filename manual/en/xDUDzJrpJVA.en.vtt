00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:05.494
The President:
I came here earlier this
morning and planted it!

00:00:05.494 --> 00:00:06.795
(laughter)

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.361
Ambassador Bleich:
It's doing very well today.

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:09.728
It must be the weather.

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:12.961
Well, I was going to say
that this is a very special

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.328
residence, I mean to tell
'ya, everything about it,

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:18.961
but one of the, one of the
special things is Jackie Chan

00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:20.328
grew up here.

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:22.561
He actually learned
how to kick box here.

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:23.961
His parents were
on the MC staff.

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.561
The President:
Who knew? There 'ya go!

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.227
Ambassador Bleich:
They actually have Jackie's
kickboxing bag up there.

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:31.728
And the other thing is what I
mentioned before which was,

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:35.061
you know, at the time they laid
the foundation here there had

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:39.294
been an unbroken set of
victories by the Imperial Forces

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:42.161
coming down the Peninsula;
they'd bombed Darwin, you know,

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:43.428
Pearl Harbor is in ruins.

00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:46.628
And there wasn't really a lot of
thought that we were just about

00:00:46.628 --> 00:00:48.494
to take the pivot
point in that war.

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:50.728
And that was the moment when
they laid a foundation on the

00:00:50.728 --> 00:00:53.961
highest hill, built the biggest
house, first on the sea.

00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:57.594
And I think that is a testament
to who we were and our faith in

00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:58.594
each other.

00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:01.728
And so the very first tree,
when they finished the house,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.361
they plant a tree, and Eleanor
Roosevelt came over and she put

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.428
a tree right over there,
it's a huge oak, a "pin oak,

00:01:08.428 --> 00:01:10.461
" and then ever since then
we have been planting trees.

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.795
So we've had 28 trees
planted, all by Presidents,

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:15.561
Chief Justices,
Associate Justices,

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.828
Warren Ginsberg's tree,
he passed away this year.

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:19.761
And --

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:25.695
The President:
Well, I'm honored and this is a
"white oak" from Illinois that

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:30.561
was supposed to be planted by
me on the previous trip but I

00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:32.394
had to cancel.

00:01:32.394 --> 00:01:34.795
We didn't want to leave it out.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.161
So it went ahead and got
planted but now I have a

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:39.328
chance to dedicate it.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:41.695
Ambassador Bleich:
Well, we appreciate your taking
some time because when we first

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:43.194
planted it it looked a
little like that Charlie

00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:44.461
Brown Christmas tree.

00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:45.828
It was a little sad.

00:01:45.828 --> 00:01:46.795
But it's really
grown up beautifully.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:47.695
So thanks for giving us --

00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:48.561
The President:
It looks great.

00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:50.861
Ambassador Bleich:
-- for giving us some
time to grow up now.

00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:54.328
You know, normally we have a
lawn nome that we dedicate,

00:01:54.328 --> 00:01:56.027
but here we have got
a plaque for you.

00:01:56.027 --> 00:01:57.428
Do you want me to
lift it up for you?"

00:01:57.428 --> 00:01:59.428
The President:
Absolutely. Come on,
let's take a look.

00:01:59.428 --> 00:02:01.928
There we go!

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:09.227
"This white oak tree dedicated
by" me to commemorate my visit

00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:10.261
to Australia.

00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.428
And, Jeffrey, thank you
for the outstanding work

00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:13.227
that you're doing.

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:14.094
Ambassador Bleich:
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:02:14.094 --> 00:02:14.895
Thank you.

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:15.828
The President:
All right.

00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:18.227
I hope to come back and
see it nice and tall.

00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:20.061
Ambassador Bleich:
Yeah, well, we're looking
forward to having you back.

00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.795
I think people kind of
like you around here.

00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:23.761
The President:
Thank you, everybody.

00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:25.561
Crowd Member:
Bye. Thank you!
