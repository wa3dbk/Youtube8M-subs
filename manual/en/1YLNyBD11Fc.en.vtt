00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.000
Ever wanted to carry your team to victory and to have way more gold than anybody else in every game?

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:15.000
Ever wanted to get your full item build in less than 37 minutes while Zyra, Janna, Leona, Diana, Fiora and Mama can't even afford a gatorade to fill up their empty slot?

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.600
Well GG (guys and girls), today's your lucky day because I'll show you how to play...

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.100
Here are the runes, masteries, skill distribution and items that you'll need to be the most greedy fuckabish in all the League.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.000
You need to open the game with a great firework by sending your suicidal bird right in the enemies' faces.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.000
Then, your job is to finish off any fuckabish that Alistar carefully headbutted to you.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.600
Notice that early game, you won't deal a lot of damage because you bought this, that and that for more gold income instead of other items that deal damage.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.000
However, you'll deal enough damage to kill your twin sister or a Leeroy Jenkins Leona with ease, no problem!

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:06.000
By sacrificing a bit of damage early, you'll be rewarded late game because you'll have no problem to kill a stunned Diana and to shoot 4 arrows to Ezreal's knee for a successful solo threesome.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.800
You will also be able to have a one night stand with that Yorick without moving from your spot.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.000
You will also even be able to send Zyra back to your garden without letting her make a single move.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.100
You will also even as well be able to warn that girly fox to never leave Naruto's manga ever again.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.700
You will also even as well no problem be able to kill Ezreal once again before he escapes to a safe spot.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.000
And let that kiddo live because he only knows how to run away.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.000
Since this kiddo is back for more, you can easily kill him without even trying.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.050
What's more? You can harass that alien without killing her so you can shoot even more arrows to her knee later on.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.000
Your Suicidal Bird's first ability lets you gain bonus gold for EVERY kill you make and it must be maxed first.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.800
This skill is great because it works on minions,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.100
on the golem's offspring,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.150
on the kids that the red lizard babysit for 1G/hour,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.000
on the blue golem's cousin

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.000
and even on enemy champions.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.900
And that is why you should KS your team by last hitting a greedy Graves,  

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.800
a poking Fiora,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.000
a Leona in a lane,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.000
a fail ninja Leona in the brush,

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.050
a dancing Katarina giving a freeshow,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.800
an underwear man,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.000
a blind fuckabish,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.000
a Diana chased by What-The-Shit monsters,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.100
a running Draven

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.000
and Garen's best friend.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.000
If you do that, you can send that underwear man flying to heaven, no problem!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Your Suicidal Bird's second ability lets you send your pet to scout an area to spot any fuckabish trying to ambush you while you're taking down the enemy's tower.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.000
It can also be used to jungle faster than ever if you're lazy to walk in every camp to smack these guys.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:47.500
If that skill is on cooldown, don't hesitate to Flash here and there to (WHY HELLO THERE) without losing a single second to walk here.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.000
If that's not enough, you can take Clairvoyance and use Frodo's stalker to (ARE YOU READING THIS?) even more.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.800
Given that your Supersized Arrow gives you vision when you use it,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.700
you could waste it to gain a brief vision on the enemy's jungle camps to make more pocket money.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.000
Your Lucky 7 skill is awesome to piss off your team even more because you can KS anyone from far away.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.800
Be it a greedy Graves,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.000
a running Ezreal,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.800
a graciously kicked Diana in the ass by that perverted monk,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.900
a weed that doesn't know that Ashe's arrows can penetrate the wall

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.500
and a Chinese Spear that didn't see Ashe attack him with his small eyes.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.300
If you want to finish off an enemy like a boss, Flash-Lucky 7-Ignite combo that fuckabish and go back to farming.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.950
Speaking of farming, your Lucky 7 can be used to shoot several minions at the same time to farm faster than ever.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.950
Your Supersized Arrow is the best skill you have to get assists and it should always be used on a fail counter jungle Zyra to let Jax savagely jump on her,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.750
on a far away teamfight to help your teammates finish off a dying fuckabish

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.900
and on a dying kiddo by doing an ultimate combo.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.800
But, if you're a jerk like me, you will use it to KS a teammate when she's about to die or on your twin sister enjoying a hot foursome.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.000
Don't hesitate to use it on a dashing girly fox trying to towerdive you, 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.000
on a Ponyta to save your beloved rock solid dude

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.700
and on a Yorick spamming master just when he's about to respawn from death to piss him off.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
If you want a sure-kill, hide there and Slow-Lucky 7-Supersized Arrow combo that Zyra to have a quickie with her.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:28.000
Use your Supersized Arrow on a Diana hiding in a brush, Ghost to catch-up with her, Lucky 7 to damage her, Flash there to dodge a grab from Blitzcrank and kill that wild woman.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:37.000
Buttfuck the brush with your Buttfucking Friend until Veigar facecheck this brush to Lucky 7-Supersized Arrow-Slow combo him to send him back to the Final Fantasy world.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.100
Stun that shitty rat in the brush that doesn't want to recall and finish your dirty foursome in beauty.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.500
Do not let that Diana walk off because if she's able to farm even a tiny little bit, you can say goodbye to your victory for this match.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.000
In early teamfights, you won't deal any mega damage, but it's more than enough to kill some greedy fuckabishes trying to towerdive a dying flying woman

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.900
without letting any enemy survive to have an easy Triple Kill.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.900
That's right! To kill the enemies, you must shoot a lot of arrows to the knee before they fall in the battlefield.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.300
And that is why you must stick with your Buttfucking Friend to be able to kill them, no problem!

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:23.000
Don't worry! If you think you need some mega damage early on, you're mistaken because you can ninja the enemies from the back to save your poisonous pet. 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:35.000
Now that you made enough golds with these three awesome items and with your Suicidal Bird skill, you can finally sell them to buy The Bloodthirster, a Last Whisper and a Guardian Angel...

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.900
Hmmm...never mind.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.000
Let's party with a Trinity Force to deal tons of damage, right Phreak?

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:51.000
Now that you have your full item build in less than 37 minutes, you can easily kill anyone in a teamfight, chase after a running cutie to not let her escape from your one night stand

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.000
and to catch-up with your twin sister to have a Double Kill.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:04.000
You can also Supersized Arrow the enemies, Ghost to catch-up to them, target that kiddo that obviously wants to Flash out of the base and have a solo one night stand with Diana

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.600
while pirate boy walks off to an unknown destination.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:16.150
If your Buttfucking Friend plays that blind champion, back off a bit while attacking the enemies to save him, finish off that greedy Fiora, move on to greedy Fiora's girlfriend 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:25.000
to save your Buttfu...to revenge your Buttfucking Friend, damage that yellow Super Saiyan and switch your target to that faker trying so hard to kill you.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.700
Shoot your Supersized Arrow on the enemies to help your team catch-up with them	and turn back to kill that alien that tries to ninja you from the back.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.750
If you follow everything demonstrated in this video, you will have so much spare gold that you'll be able to switch end-game items whenever you want.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.000
And, when you're winning your games, don't forget to shoot a firework to celebrate your victory.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.800
That's it for today, people!

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.000
Don't forget to check out my channel for more boring League of Legends videos.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:03.000
Feel free to leave a comment in any language you want, but I'll only answer those in English and in French because I'm a racist fuckabish.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.300
Ciaossu!
