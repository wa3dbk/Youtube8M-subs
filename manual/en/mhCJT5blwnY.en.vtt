00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.280
Hey Summoners, Shakarez or Kayle Bot here
and welcome to the 3rd installment of the

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280
Analysis corner.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.190
Today I’m going to talk about sOAZ’s Renekton.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.450
Before I start I wanted to thank Neryth, a
diamond 1 renekton main and the TheDarkTongo

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.039
a fellow Youtuber, for helping me out with
this video.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.330
Now the first thing that might come to mind
is: Renekton?

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.330
Why Renekton?

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.210
He always does the same build!

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.980
Well sOAZ is quite the innovator, not only
he tends to bring out different picks once

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.940
in a while, he also sometimes builds different
items from the rest of the top laners.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.700
On Renekton we saw him build Blade of the
Ruined King, both versus Alliance and Millennium,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.150
why did he build it though?

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.280
Is there any specific reason?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.610
Now then, there are 4 reasons for sOAZ’s
reasoning behind getting Blade of the Ruined

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.030
King on Renekton, two being general reasons
that apply for any champion and the other

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.790
two being related to Renekton’s Kit

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.309
Let’s start then.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.309
1.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.150
It’s a great standalone item

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.650
In the current meta in competitive play, you’ll
usually have 1 or even 2 super-tanks.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.630
This means Blade of the Ruined King is a perfect
counter to the health stacking meta.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.560
The passive makes all of your attacks deal
5% of a target’s current health, which is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.810
obviously a lot of extra damage when your
target is over 2000hp (extra 100 damage at

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.970
2000 hp and 150 damage at 3000).

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.620
One thing worthy of a mention, in both games
you dont see sOAZ with a standalone dagger,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.800
this is because it’s not really a worthy
purchase.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.120
Blade of the Ruined King has a weird build
path, you’ll mostly see people going straight

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.710
for cutlass but only completing the item when
they have enough money to finish the whole

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.710
item.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.720
2.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.300
The active lets you catch carries with more
ease.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.350
Not only does the Blade active slow your target,
it also speeds you up, making it much easier

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.640
to catch targets you want to stick to.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.950
Paired with Slice and Dice and a very strong
stun it should be very easy to lock down a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.840
target or in a worst case scenario to force
a flash.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.220
It also does tons of damage because it deals
15% of a champions maximum Health.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.370
Used on an ADC mid to late game it will mean
an extra 200 damage or more, on a tankier

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.420
target with say, 3000 hp, it’ll translate
into 450 damage dealt instantly.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.020
So those are general reasons to pick up Blade
of the Ruined King.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.140
What about for Renekton?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.970
3.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.840
Renekton generates fury with auto-attacks

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.160
Ok I’ll admit this one is not as important
or relevant as the other ones, but it’s

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.690
a plus of grabbing Blade.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.430
You gain 5 Fury per auto, if you auto 40%
faster you’ll obviously get to the red zone

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.020
of the fury faster, despite Renekton being
mainly looked at as an AD Caster.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.190
Ok last but not least, probably something
that people haven’t realized yet.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.190
4.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.480
Renekton’s Ruthless Predator applies on-hit
effects more than once!

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.170
So let’s take a look at his tooltip on Ruthless
Predator:

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:32.099
Active: Renekton’s next basic attack will
hit twice, stunning his target for 0.75 seconds

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.440
and dealing physical damage equal to a base
amount plus a percentage of his attack damage.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.220
Each hit applies on-hit effects and grants
Fury.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.220
Fury Bonus: Ruthless Predator will strike
his opponent 3 times, dealing 50% additional

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.410
damage and increasing the stun duration to
1.5 seconds.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.739
Each hit still applies on-hit effects, but
does not grant Fury.

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.540
So a normal stun will apply the Blade of the
Ruined King passive twice, and when he has

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.910
his fury bonus, it’ll apply Thrice!

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.300
That’s 10% or 15% current health taken immediately
from a target.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300
Not only that, since the hits are dealt in
a single instant, it actually is 10 or 15%

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.300
current HP in physical damage instead of the
slightly lower % from 3 Blade of the Ruined

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.510
King hits spread out over a longer time frame,
If you chain it properly with autoattacks,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:22.580
it can vary from 20% to 25% in a short period
of time, which is kind of ridiculous.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.759
Unfortunately, sOAZ hasn’t had many opportunities
of doing this but I tried to showcase the

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:38.439
best ones.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:05:02.080
I hope you guys enjoyed this episode of the
