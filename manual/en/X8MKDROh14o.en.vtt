00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.330
Hi There, this is Ross again at Woodfirepower.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.400
This is day fourteen update on
progress on the new four by sixteen foot 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.139
Aquaponics System.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.329
So, pretty amazing progress happening.  Let me take you through just to show you

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.019
how the plants are doing.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.070
Here are

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.719
the various lettuce varieties

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.890
ranging from arrugula, to different

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.060
mixes of lettuce

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.110
and then some larger romaine lettuce

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.690
all down the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.590
back run again we have snow peas

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.510
as I said before.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.480
Now this is progress,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.320
I should mention,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.630
that we haven't really added the fish to
the system yet we've

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.060
just been cycling it

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.040
and getting the bacteria colonies
built-up and so now day fourteen, so that's just

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.850
two weeks

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.480
the bacteria are in.  The water testing
today

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.580
showed that the

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.720
ammonia levels were down to zero

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.260
meaning bacteria is eating everything
it's being fed

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.260
the nitrite levels are down to zero.... so
second bacteria colony is in and

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.160
consuming the nitrites,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.090
and nitrate levels which is what the
plants consume are up to forty parts per

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.060
million in climbing so

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.200
it's now time to load the system with
the fish

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.110
and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.360
because now the plants are in and
consuming the bacteria are transforming

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.930
the ammonia

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.200
and so the plants can cleanse the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.229
water for the fish so

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.570
now that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.050
those colonies are in the fish are
hopefully coming in tomorrow

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.700
at least some if not all of them.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.480
To show you the growth,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.200
here

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.640
are the onions.  They're

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.530
getting larger

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.580
definitely larger.  The

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.640
bok choi is taking off

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.639
the kale, red Russian and Winter Bore

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.869
are still a bit slow

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:14.549
the

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.599
Napa cabbage are really taking off look
at these guys

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.709
they're doing great

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.500
and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.529
the broccoli starts

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.839
are just

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.579
jumping up

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.369
quite a bit of growth

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.509
since last week

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.149
and over here in the wicking bin, it's

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.709
working great

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.209
the top of the

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.329
soil is dry and about a half an inch to an inch under it, it's all moist.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.939
And, again you can see here the rock is all

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.089
damp because it just finished fully filling

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.289
and so the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.699
water comes up

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:01.079
to above the bottom of this wicking bin, and it has holes in the bottom

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.459
and those holes are 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.549
where

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.329
the nutrient filled water comes up and
in.

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.939
Out over here is the fish pond just
about ready to receive some beautiful

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.409
big koi

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.299
that I showed in an earlier film.

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.779
You can you can see that right now it's in the

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.289
drain cycle

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:29.749
with the water draining.

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.439
The color in the water is kelp

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.779
which is not harmful to the fish

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.099
and

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.629
let me just show you

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.029
something else that's really amazing
 we have

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.129
flowers but not only do we have

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.789
flowers

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:50.539
we have

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.619
our first snow peas already

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:55.689
look at that

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.339
fourteen days, these are just babies.  They
have hardly started climbing

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.079
and were all really getting

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:03.769
our first

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.179
peas.

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:09.089
I don't know how many have them on them
but I noticed those two when I was

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:11.859
filming

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.499
Everything is looking great

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:15.849
and

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.619
yeah, look at that guy, that needs to get 

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:21.010
up.  So we need to

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.620
finish the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.439
greenhouse so we can keep the deer
out.  This would be a deer smorgasbord.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.350
and then we will

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.449
get the climbing run for

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.419
those snow peas hopefully tomorrow or
the next day

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.550
so that's day fourteen update.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.520
The bacteria colonies are in full force

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.979
the plants are taking off the

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.550
uh... nitrate levels are coming up the
wicking basket is working great

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.720
and we already have our first

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.079
snow peas

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.899
so stay tuned for the next update
