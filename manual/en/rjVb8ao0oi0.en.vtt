00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.720
Hi, my name is Marieta. I'm an
independent consultant for Jamberry

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.299
Nails!

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.799
I wanted to show you quickly how to
apply your wraps.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.370
You're going to wash your nails with dishwashing
soap. Make sure it doesn't have any moisturizers in it,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.150
 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.180
or you can wipe your nail surfaces

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.699
down with rubbing alcohol.  This is just to
cut down on

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.119
your natural oils. Make sure you don't
have any nail polish

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.970
residue or old wrap residue on

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.300
your nails. Push back your cuticles
with a cuticle stick.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.700
Make sure your tools are oil free, and you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.730
have a heat source. You could use a rice
bag. You could use a blow dryer

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.079
or a mini-heater. Jamberry offers these mini-heaters. These are great because

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.850
they're quieter. It's easier to just work in front of it instead of

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.420
trying to figure out how to use your blow dryer.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.039
So I have my wrap sheet here. This is good for at least

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.629
2 full manicure applications. I've done

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.170
some accent nails off of these. I'm going to size
up my

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.750
nail by

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.240
choosing which wrap is going to fit

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.580
the width.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.540
I think I'm going to choose this one. (Make sure wrap is slightly skinnier than your nail width.)

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.910
So each wrap is good for at

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.910
least 2 nails  (for my nail length). Cut it in half.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.520
I'm going to touch just the corner of the wrap. I don't want to touch the adhesive,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.590
and redistribute oils from my hands. In front of my heat source,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.370
I'm going to just prepare my wrap by applying

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.380
heat for approximately three to four seconds. It's going to become soft and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.560
pliable.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.729
Close to the cuticle but not touching
the skin,

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.399
you'll want to adhere the wrap to

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.360
the bottom of the nail.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.200
Once I have it centered (if you have
to reposition,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.900
reposition it gently because the adhesive is strong.). I'm just going to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.650
work with my finger

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.010
back and forth across the wrap.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.239
If you've got curvy nails, you'll

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.560
want to PULL and STRETCH any potential wrinkles

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.380
on the sides and the top.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.739
and fold it over the edge of your nail.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.739
It's okay if your wrap is slightly

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.480
smaller than your nail size ...just as long as it's not

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.890
hitting the skin. So..

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.890
I will take a sandwich baggie.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.650
(I didn't have it prepared.)

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.120
Pull it down over the top of my nail. This is going to create a lot of even pressure

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.780
on the top of my wrap.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.939
I heat it up in front of my heat source for approximately

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.769
4 to 5 seconds.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.579
(A little bit less for metallics/glimmers. A little bit more for the sparkle wraps.)

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.400
Make sure to focus on the tips. .....And it's bonded to the nail. I'm going to take my rubber cuticle stick.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.769
I don't have one readily available right now.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.629
So I'm going to use this tool

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.209
and reinforce

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.319
my edges and tips to make sure I

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.890
form a watertight seal. Shut off my heater.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.890
Now if you've got any wrinkles...

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.599
if it still doesn't fit the way you want it
to,

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.670
you could turn on your heater and smooth them out.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.840
When you're ready to file

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.980
the excess off the tip (You can see with the
heat, it had folded it over

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.000
the tip of my nail. I am going to apply a little
bit of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.569
ice to cool that edge down because it's like
shrink wrap.  It will recede

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.130
and show a little bit of your natural nail

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.509
if you file a too early when it's warm.

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:27.000
So the best file that I would recommend
is a glass file.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.520
Any fine grit nail file will do. In a
downward (only) motion at a

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.620
ninety degree angle, you will file

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.990
that excess off.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.849
I'm using my non-dominant hand. So it's a little bit awkward.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:48.849
But we'll get there.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.620
and there you have it!

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.349
Now I would refrain from showering for

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.990
at least a few hours after your wrap application.  You want some time

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.419
for your wrap to bond to your nail.

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.800
You can get your hands wet. I just wouldn't
use excessive

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.190
water. I like to do my wrap application
in the evening time and just go to bed.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.680
Also if you want to reinforce the tips. Let's say
you

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.800
use your index fingers to pick up things
or

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.139
open soda cans... I would reinforce with a
little bit of brush nail

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.770
glue or top coat at the tips.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.240
A day later or a few hours later... if you
notice some small

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.360
bubbles or wrinkles that you didn't
notice

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.530
earlier, you could smooth them out again

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.930
in front of your heater using your baggie

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.159
or your rubber cuticle stick

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:07.159
or you could use a rice bag.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.580
Here, I just used an old cotton sock and fill it up with

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.820
uncooked rice. Tie it in a knot. You could microwave this for close to a minute.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.590
and this is also a good way to just
apply pressure and heat.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.830
