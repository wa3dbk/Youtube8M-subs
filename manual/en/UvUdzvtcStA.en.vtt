00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:06.120
Yo what´s up? My name is Robeat! 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.172
Most of you probably know me from the RTL TV-show "Das Supertalent".

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:02.006
I´m 19 years old 

00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.595
and I am beatboxing now for about 4 or 5 years.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.966
Its a cool thing and I guess my specialty is 

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.883
that I not only stand there and do Beatbox like this...

00:01:14.814 --> 00:01:17.363
...But instead doing it the funny way, with a bit of comedy.

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.025
 Just simple entertainment like for example...

00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:30.009
There are a lot of crazy sounds, for instance...

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:34.866
So here we have the beat.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:38.810
sound! 

00:01:40.057 --> 00:01:40.767
now both together

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:47.268
or the windscreen wiper

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.884
I would consider myself a new-school Beatboxer

00:01:56.084 --> 00:02:00.280
I first competed at the Southern German Championchip

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.738
where I made the first place. I didn´t expect that.

00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:07.288
Then I moved on to the German Championchip

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:10.078
where I got vice-champion. That was awesome!

00:02:10.248 --> 00:02:13.554
Then I went on television to "Tigerentenclub" [a show for small childreen]

00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:17.611
Since this 5th german BeatboxBattle Championchip everything went crazy

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.069
straight afterwards, we have been to "Stern TV" 

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:23.184
with BeeLow and Mando. At "Günni" [famous german Talkmaster]

00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:37.593
Its not only Hip Hop, but also Drum´n´Base, Techno, Salsa, Jazz

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:40.211
You are totally free, you only have to be creative.

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:45.198
above all, I want to make Beatboxing famous in Germany. I give Workshops too.

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:48.958
I sell the first Tutorial DVD in german.

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:52.889
Many people lern to Beatbox from Youtube as well.

00:02:53.196 --> 00:02:56.844
Or on the "Beatbox-Schule" with "Teamspeak". 

00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:00.619
I guess you know it, otherwise have a look on www.beatbox-schule.de

00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:16.950
Michael Winslow! "Police Academy"! A pioneer!

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:18.778
Michael Winslow I love you!
