*ENGLISH SUBS BY HanallaIsHere*

00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.100
Man, what a good day!

00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:05.200
I prefer being here...

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.033
E.T. home...

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:07.901
Bummer...

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:08.968
I think you mean MY home.

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:11.000
Don't call me bummer,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.567
fucking dick.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:13.067
Dude...

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.534
I'm going to smack your face so bad...

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:17.067
...the blast will reach Uranus.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.234
You won't, pussy.

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:24.334
*LAUGH*

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:25.133
Oooooohhhhhh!

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:25.934
Oh no, dude!

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:27.200
It's the Trench-Coat Guy!

00:00:27.334 --> 00:00:29.500
Fuck, it's the Trench-Coat Guy!

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:32.434
I'M THE TRENCH-COAT GUY!

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:37.634
*SCREAMING*

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:39.067
Look, we found your spaceship!

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.033
Escape already, dude!

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.209
I'll miss you.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:43.500
I won't.

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.113
Ooooooohhhhhh!

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:50.601
Shit, the screen changed again...

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.267
...we're in France.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.868
France? More like the planet of the huge letters.

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:56.167
Ha, ha.

00:00:56.868 --> 00:00:58.968
Hey, E.T.,  do you know what would be your name in Star Wars?

00:00:59.167 --> 00:00:59.734
What?

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:01.033
ET-ET!

00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:05.534
Not even funny...

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:07.701
THE TRENCH-COAT GUY!

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.167
Man, it's the Trench-Coat Guy!

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:10.067
Ow!

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:13.067
Trench-Coat Guy!

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:15.934
Wake up, E.T.!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.367
Oh, it was a dream... Where am I?

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:23.116
You just fell inside my weed stash and smoked it all!

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.067
Get the fuck out of there!

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:26.367
I don't want to!

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.824
Oh, I can fly stretching my neck!

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:32.567
How bad are drugs...

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:34.995
I can't stop flying!

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:37.301
Ow!

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:38.200
Willy!

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:39.767
I just had a nightmare!

00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:42.400
I dreamt I was E.T. the Extraterrestrial in an awfully programmed...

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.133
...Atari 2600 game.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.300
*LAUGHS*

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.367
Thank god we live in an awfully programmed Master System game, huh?

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:51.367
*MORE LAUGHS*

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:52.500
Yeah, Willy.

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:54.701
No problem!

00:01:58.667 --> 00:01:59.868
Well, family...

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.300
I'm going back to Melmac...

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.234
They are waiting for me in Master Chef,

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:05.367
and they're going to freak out when I show them...

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:06.801
...my Siamese Cat...

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.667
...Ã  l'orange...

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:09.934
*EVEN MORE LAUGHS*

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:11.067
Will you come back some day?

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:12.200
Of course!

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:13.934
Tell NASA...

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.234
...to notify me when the create the internet.

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:16.901
*LAUGH*

00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:19.133
Something's telling me it will be full of videos...

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.701
...about tasty cats everyday!

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:23.934
*LAUGHS*

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.133
Trench-Coat Guy!

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.767
Trench-Coat Guy!

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:29.901
No, Willy!

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.834
Damn it, Trench-Coat Guy!

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:34.901
Trench-Coat Guy!

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:36.567
Fuck man...

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:37.934
This can't go on like this...

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:40.400
...I have to leave this shit for real!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.100
My Hippie!

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.133
Good morning, Hippie and E.T.!

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.801
Would you want a dog sandwitch?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.970
I've seen no cats in this house...

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.133
And you already know I'm open-minded!

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.067
*EVERYBODY LAUGHS*

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.801
Fucking 80's, man...

00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:59.379
Fucking 80's!

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:05.067
Dude...

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:07.067
Why are your balls holding like that?

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:08.367
Da fuck?

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.100
That's my other arm, you dick!

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.293
It's all about perspective!

00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:14.534
Wow, sorry!

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:18.667
Fuck you, nobody laughs at my extreme graphics!

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.133
I'm going back to the desert!

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.000
And this time I'm not coming back!

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:24.500
*All of them* Trench-Coat Guy!

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:26.801
Trench-Coat Guy!
