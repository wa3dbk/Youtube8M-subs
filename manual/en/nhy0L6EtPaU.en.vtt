You're trying to make a decision. Do I breastfeed
my baby or do I use formula? My name is Beverly

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.530

So, obviously, there are pros to breast milk

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.810
because that's what nature intended for babies
to drink. It's convenient. It's always with

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.390
you. It's always available and the other nice
thing about breast milk is that it helps to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.619
impart some immunity to your baby so when
your baby is a young infant and it hasn't

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.150
had time to develop much immunity of their
own, it's actually able to borrow some from

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.100
you. So, that's an advantage to breast milk.
It also has got the right kinds of proteins

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.330
and fat and ingredients that help your baby
grow just right. The difficulty with breast

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.369
milk can be if you're going back to work or
if you're in a situation where you're spending

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:02.620
several hours a day away from your baby because
you do kind of have to be by your baby to

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.360
breastfeed. That doesn't mean that you can't
still breastfeed, however, if you work because

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.070
there are breast pumps available that you
can express your milk during the day. You

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.100
can save it, you can freeze it and you can
use it later. La Leche League is an organization

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.840
that can support you and give you more information
on breastfeeding. For those who prefer bottle-feeding

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.480
for convenience or breastfeeding just isn't
working out, there's certainly good products

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.140
on the market. They are based on cow's milk
and you can find them on your grocery shelf.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.140
You then need to make the decision about whether
to use powdered, whether to use concentrate

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.740
or ready-made formulas. And I listed those
in increasing expense. The least expensive

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.870
is powdered. It does take quite a little bit
more work, however the can will last quite

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.030
a while and you can carry the can with you.
You can use powdered if you're traveling on

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.799
the air, etc. So, those are some options for
you and plenty of people grow up just fine

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.470
either way so once you make your choice just
feel confident that you're giving your child

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.010
the very best nutrition that you can. I'm
