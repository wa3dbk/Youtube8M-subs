00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.950
Welcome back. We have put on our first coat
successfully and it has finally dried. Now

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.420
that we got the first coat on and before we
put our second coat on, we want to knock down

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.030
all our bumps so that when we go to put our
second coat on we don't bounce over anything

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.580
and leave a bunch of big chunks in our drywall.
So take a 6" to 8" spackle knife and you just

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:34.800
kind of run it over it. It will take off all
the bumps so your next coat will be applied

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.089
smoothly and not be bouncing off a bunch of
bumps. You will get places like this, a little

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.789
line in there from the old one, it'll come
right off with the knife and leaves it nice

00:00:48.789 --> 00:01:02.859
and smooth. This is much better than sanding
folks. If any of you out there are doing a

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.960
home for somebody then you know the first
thing that your going to talk about with them

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.780
is there is going to be a bunch of dust. This
is usually why. Drywall when you sand it creates

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.830
a whole lot of dust. So you don't have to
worry about the dust as much. You'll have

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.780
to worry about one big sand at the end. This
is a much better way to go then sanding. So

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:34.210
go ahead and knock off all the extra bumps.
Make it nice and smooth. This is what I meant

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:45.850
once it's set you can knock off the big chunks
up there and get that ready for a coat. It

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.090
is always good to get these lines as flush
to the wall as you can. Whenever you are putting

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.950
on mud, there is a technique, it is called
feathering. So once you hit your main in the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.990
middle, your main swipe and you've got it
nice and smooth, you will have a little extra

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.739
on the edges. You push the side furthest away
from the mud in so you have it tweaked the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.760
way this is hitting the dry wall and this
part is not and it kind of feathers it. Then

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.209
you rub that over your edge like that. That
will smooth out all of this and bring it to

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.430
nothing.
