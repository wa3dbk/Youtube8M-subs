00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.150
It's my first time here in Pikes Peak,
so I discovered the road yersterday.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.150
But I saw some videos before.
The road is nice: it's very wide and fast,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.160
and there are some hairpins and twisty sections.
We have a bit of everything: it's quite deep

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.780
on the side
in some places, so we need to avoid mistakes.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.070
For sure it's a long time I have it on my
mind doing Pikes Peak. It's a mythic race

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.350
and I have a proposition this year with Peugeot
and Red Bull to have an official car, so I

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.770
hope we will deliver.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.920
Peugeot is back in Pikes Peak because we were
looking for a programme which was a mix of

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.110
our history, victories and future. Considering
all these elements, it was just obvious to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.950
comeback to Pikes Peak and to try to win again
this fabulous race. Tomorrow first test on the real road: the target is not

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.950
to do the best time. The idea is rather to
set up the car

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.479
in order to give SÃ©bastien the best one,
to make sure

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.479
he has confidence and that he can push close
to the limit.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.040
It was a good weekend: I was very happy with
the handling of my car. I found good confidence in it.
It is what I wanted

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.140
because we didn't do so much tests in Europe:
we really start testing here.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.349
I don't think I will go much faster, even
next week or

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.650
in the race, because I am close to the limit
everywhere.
