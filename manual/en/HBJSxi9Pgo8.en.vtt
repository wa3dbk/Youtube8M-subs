00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:08.155
- Conservation is an overarching term

00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:12.183
which refers to all of
the activities that we do,

00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:14.535
including the preventive work,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.098
the analysis, the authentication,

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:21.915
the study of conditions of display,

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.627
and the control of those conditions,

00:00:24.627 --> 00:00:27.352
and it also includes restoration.

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:31.071
Restoration is really
the piece of conservation

00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:35.992
that involves actual physical
changes to an object.

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:39.216
One of the most interesting
restoration projects

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:42.081
that we have undertaken here at the Getty

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:45.667
in the past few years
has been the restoration

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:50.547
of the Neoclassical French
"Lit Ã  la Polonaise."

00:00:50.547 --> 00:00:55.491
I first saw this bed in
1981, and I had gone to Paris

00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:58.999
to find a gilding conservation workshop

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.037
in which I could learn their techniques.

00:01:02.037 --> 00:01:04.843
In the workshop of Monsieur Goujon,

00:01:04.843 --> 00:01:07.558
I stumbled across this
bed, which was actually

00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:10.452
sent there at the time for restoration,

00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:13.879
and I was immediately

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:18.324
enraptured by the quality
and the refinement of it.

00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:20.082
and it wasn't until 1994

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:23.405
that we acquired it here at the Getty.

00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:27.893
Beds of this type were
made for the high nobility,

00:01:27.893 --> 00:01:31.433
people of extravagant wealth,

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:36.409
and with a sumptuous taste
for luxurious living.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.428
And so we knew that we had to restore it

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:43.577
to a very high level.

00:01:43.577 --> 00:01:46.765
In the space of two and a half years,

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:49.496
we did extensive treatments on it

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:53.384
involving over 10 different specialists

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:56.786
who restored the carving of the bed,

00:01:56.786 --> 00:01:58.775
the gilding, the painting,

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:01.704
replaced some of the hardware on it,

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:04.633
we had silk lampas woven,

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.839
we had tassels and trimmings made,

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:11.470
and then we finally had it upholstered.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.352
In the 18th century,
the upholstery of a bed

00:02:14.352 --> 00:02:18.346
like this was of paramount importance.

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:21.975
Fabrics had an extremely prestigious place

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:26.157
in the hierarchy of interior architecture.

00:02:26.157 --> 00:02:30.496
People invested huge sums
of money in their textiles.

00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:33.236
We knew about the original
upholstery of the bed,

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.944
and we had an estimate done

00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:39.043
for the reweaving of that fabric.

00:02:39.043 --> 00:02:42.086
In the end, the cost far
exceeded what we thought

00:02:42.086 --> 00:02:44.849
we could justify spending on the project,

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.702
and so we decided to
de-emphasize the upholstery,

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.918
and choose an appropriate lampas,

00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:56.667
but one that was really not approaching

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:00.267
a recreation of what had
originally been on the bed.

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:03.563
We had engaged Prelle in Lyons

00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:07.510
to reweave the lampas,
and we engaged a firm

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.807
called La Passementerie
Nouvelle to recreate

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:14.858
the fringes and tassels
and trimmings of the bed.

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:17.901
The making of passementerie
is really fascinating.

00:03:17.901 --> 00:03:21.636
It is basically the term applied to

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:24.785
all of the garnishings on an upholstery,

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:28.734
such as fringe, tassels, trimmings,

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:32.255
rosettes, buttons.

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:34.654
They are all basically made by wrapping

00:03:34.654 --> 00:03:37.606
very fine silk thread

00:03:37.606 --> 00:03:40.142
around core foundations,

00:03:40.142 --> 00:03:44.064
which in the eighteenth
century were made of catgut.

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:47.037
The silk threads around
the foundation are then

00:03:47.037 --> 00:03:50.850
wrapped around each other,
twisted in various ways.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.087
It's a fascinating process,

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:57.592
and one that is done
almost entirely by hand.

00:03:57.592 --> 00:03:59.837
The restoration of the carving and gilding

00:03:59.837 --> 00:04:03.255
was a process of moving
the bed back and forth

00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:06.792
between the carver's and
the gilder's workshops.

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:09.473
Each piece went to the carver's studio,

00:04:09.473 --> 00:04:13.735
where he glued any loose pieces of wood,

00:04:13.735 --> 00:04:17.530
replaced most, but not
all, of the lost details

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.371
from the carving, and he waited
until the end of the project

00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:23.913
to replace the central trophy

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:26.640
and one of the side trophies.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.614
We were tremendously aided in
this process by the discovery

00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:34.734
of early 20th-century
photographs of the bed.

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.239
I don't know that we would have endeavored

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:40.081
to replace the lost trophy
on the top of the bed

00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:42.577
had we not had this photograph,

00:04:42.577 --> 00:04:44.718
because we really didn't know what it was,

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.573
so that was really the biggest challenge

00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:49.514
of the entire project.

00:04:49.514 --> 00:04:52.170
When I show this bed to
people who are not familiar

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.145
with French 18th-century decorative arts,

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:58.489
it really is like a textbook
in the whole subject.

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:02.424
It certainly says a great
deal about the importance

00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:07.092
of the decorative arts in
their standing in society.

00:05:07.092 --> 00:05:09.068
These, after all, were status symbols.

00:05:09.068 --> 00:05:13.370
These weren't just about
having a good night's sleep.
