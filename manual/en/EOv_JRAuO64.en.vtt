00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.580
These are questions submitted
from my coworkers anonymously,

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.240
and we're going to try and
help solve their sex problems.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.310
(upbeat music)

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.220
What do you do if you want to
have anal with your girlfriend

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.350
and she isn't taking you seriously?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.890
- I think you need to make
it really clear to her that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.230
this is a serious request for you.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.020
She might be laughing it off
just because she's nervous

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.270
or she's not sure if you're
actually being serious,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.730
so talk to her and let her know

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.730
that this is genuinely an
interest that you have.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.650
- What's a good way to
start that conversation?

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.450
- I wanna have anal sex. (laughs)

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.240
- Should you do that cute
little giggle you're doing

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.950
while you say it?
- Yes, definitely.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.910
Giggling always helps
when it comes to anal sex.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.250
- This one, definitely from
someone in the LA office.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.210
Is it unhealthy to sleep with a celebrity

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.920
if you are not famous?

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.790
(laughs) Only if that celebrity has

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.290
a sexually transmitted infection.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.510
- So, this person writes,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.550
we've been trying to
get pregnant for a while

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.010
and it's taking the sexy out of sex.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.680
How do we bring sexy back?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.840
- I think the most important thing

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.060
when you're trying to get pregnant,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.300
is to not make all of the
sex that you're having

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.480
entirely goal-oriented
because it really does

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.060
suck all the fun out of it.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480
So, even though you might
have specific schedules

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.150
of when you're supposed to be having sex

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.190
and what are the most
optimal times for that?,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.730
try to also leave some
room in your sex life

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.780
for just having sex
that's not for the purpose

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.160
of trying to get pregnant.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.160
- This one I love.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.080
My partner and I are
pretty into group sex.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.910
Is that bad for our relationship?

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.160
- No, not at all.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.200
If you guys have talked about
what your boundaries are,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.000
and you're both willing
participants, go for it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.550
- What percent of gay men do you think

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.260
are actually into anal sex?

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.590
- Ooh, that's a good question.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.130
I don't have any specific
numbers on that one,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.210
but definitely not every gay man.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.890
- How do you slow down your libido

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.600
when you are not having sex?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.770
- You can't really slow down your libido.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230
I mean, you can try to do things

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.940
like get yourself stressed out

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.510
or develop a health problem,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.180
but I don't think you really
wanna do any of those things.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.610
It's great to have a high
libido when you're single,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.150
so take care of yourself.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.240
Masturbate, find a couple
of different sex toys

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.950
to play with.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.030
There's no need to try
to slow down your libido.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.160
- Am I a sex addict?

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.500
- Probably not.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.660
There's conflicting evidence

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.460
about whether or not sex
addiction actually exists.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.380
- Are there any numbers...

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.800
If you're having sex 50 times a week,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.590
are you a sex addict?

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.120
- There aren't any specific numbers.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.720
It really boils down to,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.790
is your desire for sex getting in the way

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.170
of your day-to-day life,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.370
so if you're able to hold up your job

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.420
and have social connections,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.560
and have some alone time,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.890
you're probably doing okay.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.400
- Is it necessary for foreskin

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.680
to pull back behind the head of the penis?

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.350
- For it to pull back on its own

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.400
or for you to pull it back?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.900
- I don't know. There's no pronoun.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.280
- It's not necessary.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.200
It'll probably feel
better for a lot of men

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.080
because uncircumcised men,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.870
the heads of their penis aren't exposed

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.540
on a day-to-day basis
like circumcised men are,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.620
so when they do pull that foreskin back

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.790
or it comes back on its own,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.920
it's gonna feel a lot
more sensitive there.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.040
- Alright, person with a
really specific question,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.800
that one was for you.
- (laughs)

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.877
(upbeat music)
