This is Chris from Aquatic Central, here in
San Fransisco, and on the web at aquatic-central.com,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.269
and today I'd like to tell you how to breed
a goldfish. first thing is to gather the required

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.139
materials, which would be, preferably at least
a 20 gallon tank, you'll need a filtration

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.140
system, preferably a sponge filter, and a
heating system, providing that you can maintain

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.490
the water temperature at about 72 degrees
Fahrenheit, you'll need some sort of plants,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.110
preferably live or a spawning mop, which is
basically just a household mop, a clean one

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.130
at that, anywhere the eggs can stick and you
can easily remove them after they've been

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:49.860
released. You'll probably want a separate
5 to 10 gallon tank after the eggs have hatched

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.590
so that you can rear them. You'll need some
food for the eggs, possibly micro worms or

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.399
freshly hatched brine shrimp. What you'll
do is, you'll cycle your fish tank, condition

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.460
it for chlorine, chloramine first, cycle it
for about 2 to 3 weeks, make sure that it's

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.229
run through the nitrogen cycle. Then you can
add a male and a female goldfish, approximately

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.340
at least 3 years old, it don't need to be
adults, and they are hard to distinguish.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.789
And the most important thing is you'll need
to plan ahead as they only mate once a year,

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.560
in spring. As they near spawning, as they're
almost ready, the female will plumpen up quite

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.609
large, and the male will develop these white
spots around his gill plate. A female will

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:43.770
release eggs, they will stick to the surfaces
of whatever you have placed inside. Then a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.880
male will fertilize the eggs, and you'll notice
this is happening by the water becoming quite

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.649
cloudy. At this time it'll be ideal to remove
the parents from the eggs, either by replacing

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.919
the eggs into the separate 5 gallon tank,
or by removing the male and female into the

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:04.380
separate 5 gallon tank. Regardless which tank
the fry are in, that's the tank where you'll

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.200
want the sponge filter. And you'll want to
lower the water level to about 5 to 6 inches,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.780
so that the weight of the water doesn't crush
them, and so they can come up for air. It's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.950
pretty much all that's required to breed a
goldfish. Again, my name is Chris from Aquatic
