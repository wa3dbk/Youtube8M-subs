00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.659
It's something great. 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.550
I'm very happy to be here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.499
in Tijuana with a club that opened its doors to me

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.910
So I can showcase myself 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.610
as a player from Mexico and fortunately,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.210
things are going well and I am very grateful for all the opportunities they have 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.680
given me. 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.040
12 Goals with Club Tijuana 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.030
It's something 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.820
that's very motivating to score goals 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.710
on this team knowing that 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.780
things are going well for everyone 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.210
and, yes, I've studied goals from Pepe

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.299
I have to try to beat his mark and continue to try and keep scoring 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.299
which is important to me. 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.450
From the first day you get here it is instilled in each player 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.010
it is stressed

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.480
to be as humble as you can be as humble of a person 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.080
that's given us a spectacular rhythm. We have a great group

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.670
we are all shooting for the same things and we are happy things are going 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.670
well thanks to that. 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.589
Liguilla, Libertadores, Tilte, Duvier shares Club Tijuana's dreams 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.380
That would be something huge

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.919
Let's hope things go well

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.449
as individuals and as a team 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:35.449
and that will come with time. 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.049
To all Xolos fans...

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.539
We are thankful for all the support they have given us 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.879
and that they should continue doing that 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:00.049
supporting us until the end.
