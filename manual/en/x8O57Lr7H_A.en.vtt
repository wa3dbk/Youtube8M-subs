MITCH WALDEN, CABINS IN BRANSON RENTAL MANAGER&gt;&gt;
Today we're going to tour one of our 2 bedroom,

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.610
2 bath log cabins at the Cabins at Grand Mountain,
part of Thousand Hills Resort.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.890
As you can see first thing when you come into
one of our cabins is that they're very unique.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.250
There's no one size fits all cookie cutter
decor at any of our units at Thousand Hills

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.920
because each owner has the ability to decorate
their condo or cabin to their specific likes

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.480
and tastes. That means that each time you
come back you'll get a unique unit that you'll

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.660
love in a different way than the last one
that still meets the same standards.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.190
Each one of our cabins features a full kitchen
equipped with a full-sized refrigerator and

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.249
freezer, oven and microwave, dishwasher, all
your silverware, glassware, basic cookware,

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:54.589
dishware as well as the small kitchen appliances
that you'll need to enjoy your stay.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:03.440
Heading here into the master bedroom. It has
it's own TV, king sized bed, nice space, lofted

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:13.750
area, and then the master bathroom which has
a whirlpool tub, toilet and vanity and also

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.350
opens up into the living room area for access
from the rest of the cabin as well.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.620
Stepping through to the living room we have
the queen sized sleeper sofa allowing this

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.460
unit to sleep up to 6 people, large TV, gas
fireplace for those cozy nights in the fall

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.670
and winter months and then your dining area
with plenty of seating for the maximum occupancy

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.490
in the unit.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.250
This cabin has a screened in patio out the
back, some nice rustic furniture overlooking

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.501
a quiet, wooded area. Now the neat thing about
our cabins is that looking out here you would

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:55.280
think that you're in the middle of the forest
somewhere; but these cabins sit just two blocks

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.220
from Highway 76, right in the heart of Branson
so you can have this peaceful quiet secluded

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.550
feeling and still be convenient to everything
that you want to do including the shows, shopping

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.349
and attractions of Branson.

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.640
This cabin is actually a 2 level 2 bedroom
two bath log cabin, meaning that the 2nd bedroom

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.709
and second bath is upstairs. For guests that
want that space, this is perfect. For guests

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.249
who don't we also offer a second floor plan
that has both bedrooms and bathrooms on the

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:31.219
same level. Coming up this flight of stairs
we go into this second bedroom, second king

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:43.310
sized bed, nice lofted ceiling and then the
built-in vanity, dual headed rain shower with

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:53.599
those great big copper rain shower head and
toilet. Plenty of closet space and plenty

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.120
of room for everybody to relax and enjoy.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.680
Coming back out here to look down over the
cabin from the aeriel view, the dining room

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.989
and kitchen area, and you can see how much
space these cabins really do have for you

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.419
to relax and enjoy. All that natural light
and secluded feel of the cabins. We hope that

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.879
you'll come check out one of our two bedroom
two bath cabins in Branson with your family

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.299

and see why the Cabins at Grand Mountain are

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.739
