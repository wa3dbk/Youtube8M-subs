Hello everybody, this is Rapid.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.800
Today I'm going to show you how to set
up your User Interface as a healer.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.750
There's a few important things that
every need healer needs to have

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.699
on their user interface, so I'm gonna go
ahead and show those to you. First we're

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.820
gonna go to our Preferences

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.570
go over to User Interface right here,
scroll down

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.920
to this operations frames we want to
make sure that use operation frames as

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.380
group frames is checked

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.399
that's important so we're gonna go and
hit OK

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.250
now we're going to open up our interface
editor and by default

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.000
we see people's names here and they're
tiny little health bar in this little corner

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.840
it's not really easy to see and as a Healer
we need to see more here

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.930
so first I'm going to buff up the scale
these things

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.030
here to 1.25 now I'm gonna scroll down
and this is very important here

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.370
we want to make sure that we have show
health text, that's

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.539
the main meat that we want to focus
on as a healer. So

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.659
we can barely see the text there it's
small so let's go and make it bigger

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.820
and increase the Health Height up

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.409
to say 25. Now we can see people's actual

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.229
health and then the percentage of Health
which is very useful especially if

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.000
you're scoundrel the other since you
need to be paying attention to when they're

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.159
30 percent below when increased with
just a little bit too

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:33.500
it a little easier to see. Perfect. And now by default the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:41.300
Debuff scale and Buff scale is 3 on both those so as a healer

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.399
right now since we have no debuffs us we
see four buffs, the class buffs,

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.460
as a healer week don't care at all about
buffs, we care about debuffs

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.720
because those are the things that we
need to cleanse, so we're gonna lower

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.610
the scale of our buffs because that's not really
important to us so we are gonna make sure

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.180
that the debuffs are nice and big.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.430
So I'm gonna save that like this and I'll
show you why it's useful

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.780
See.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.819
Now when we look here we can see that
debuff, it's very visible stands out

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.629
and now we can go ahead and cleanse it, so when you have say eight to sixteen people in

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.739
a big raid group and you're trying to find
out who you need to cleanse,

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.620
having that's very useful because they
can easily pick out who has the debuff and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.670
here you can cleanse.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.440
And that's pretty much it for this video, hope that helps.
