00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.170
One of the greatest flowers for any xeriscape
garden is the iris.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.100
There are also known as flags.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.060
The bearded iris has been around for many,
many years and have been shared among friends

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.580
and sold everywhere for many years.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.780
They love our alkaline soil, so they're quite
happy in a xeric garden and an alkaline soil.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.430
So, they're not particularly fussy about soil.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.040
Deer do sometimes eat the blooms; typically
don't eat the foliage so it is something you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.050
can grow in the Hill Country.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.040
They come in almost every color from yellows
to oranges to reds to blues and purples.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.860
They really can give you quite a color show.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.680
Some of them are quite small and others are
larger and they do make a wonderful cut flower

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.409
and many of them have wonderful fragrances
as well.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.640
So, there is really a lot to recommend with
irises.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.220
They do, however, need to be pruned and divided
every couple of years because if you let them

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.640
grow into very large crowded clumps, they
just won't bloom as well.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.560
So, every couple of years you'll want to do
that and, with most perennials, you'll want

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.050
to divide and do your work with them in the
season opposite their bloom.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.890
So, since they bloom in the spring, we do
that in early fall.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.750
That gives them a chance to adjust and grow
and put on new roots and set blooms again

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.220
for the following spring.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.530
Plus, it's easier on the gardener.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.670
It's a little bit cooler, we hope.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.360
So, you'll want to take a spading fork and
go around the clump very gently and just lift

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.250
them and loosen them.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.240
Once you get those clumps out, set them aside,
prepare the soil well.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.409
Now, they don't need a very rich soil—a
little compost is great or a little balanced

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.420
organic fertilizer—but they just don't need
the same fertility as daylilies to get going

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.420
and do well.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.500
So, you'll end up with rhizomes that look
like that this and the rhizome that has bloomed

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.340
the previous spring is not going to bloom
again.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.730
You'll know those because they're the ones
that look kind of old and leathery.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.170
They may be kind of corky-looking, and those
you'll just cut away and discard.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.120
You can put those in a compost pile.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.239
Do look for iris rhizomes that are kind of
soft because that may indicate a bacterial

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.760
disease, and if they have holes that look
like burrow holes, you'll definitely want

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.530
to discard those—not in the compost, but
in the trash.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.950
Just cut off any of the new shoots of the
rhizomes and those will be the ones that you

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.950
plant again.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:58.379
So, just take a short pair of shears and cut
those away and discard this old part.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.599
If you have any roots that are torn or ragged
or shriveled, you'll want to cut those away.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.889
Now, you do want to keep these moist until
you get a chance to get them in the soil so

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:14.639
do cover these up with a wet sheet—put them
in the shade as you are preparing them.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.409
They can stay out of the soil for a while,
but it's best not to let them dry out completely

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.109
because it's very difficult to get them re-hydrated
again.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:30.389
If your roots do dry out just soak them in
a water solution, just barely cover the rhizome

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:35.489
with water and let those roots plump up again
before you're going to water them.

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.140
If you need to store them or if you're shipping
them to some one, you can wrap them in wet

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.680
excelsior or moss and keep them damp that
way.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.260
So, when you cut these ends of the rhizomes,
one of the things that's great to do is just

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.280
take a little dusting sulfur and dab that
cut end in the dusting sulfur.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.139
That can help cut down on fungal and bacterial
problems in the rhizomes and keep them nice

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.430
and healthy.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.129
So, you'll cut away the foliage—some of
this foliage looks a little brown and discolored—so

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.879
take some very sharp scissors, and like to
cut them in a chevron so that the upper leaves

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.880
are more pointed.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.609
Then you want to plant them—not terribly
deeply.

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.960
I think that's one of the main reasons people
have problems with their irises.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.790
They try to plant them too deeply.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.670
You really want the surface of the rhizome
to be right at the surface of the soil.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.820
So, you'll want to make a little hill and
press those roots into the side and you'll

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.900
pull the soil up, and really compact it around
the soil.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.280
I like to line the rhizomes up in the same
direction, but plant them in little triangles

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.720
of the same color.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.250
You can see here that rhizome is really showing
at the surface of the soil.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.970
I don't mulch the iris.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.040
They just don't need a lot of mulch, but if
you plant them properly, divide them occasionally,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.750
share them with your friends, you will have
displays of color that are just show-stopping.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:14.250
So, do give all of the beautiful colors of
iris a try and you will have a dramatic spring

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.711
accent for your yard.
