00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.200
The President:
I want you all to meet
Charlotte Randolph,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.900
who's the parish
president in this parish.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.934
And what I just heard from Thad
Allen was that this parish has

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:15.900
been as effective as any in
coordinating and working to make

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.700
sure that they respond quickly.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.266
You've got about seven miles of
beach here where two types of

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.834
boom have already been laid.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:27.633
This is new boom, so
what you're seeing here,

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.367
if I'm not mistaken
-- right, Thad?

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:31.667
Admiral Allen:
The old boom was
picked up yesterday.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.066
The President:
The old boom was
picked up yesterday,

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.700
but this will just soak
up the oil as it comes up.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
And if you guys want to get a
little bit closer and get dirty,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.767
you can see -- you might want
to stop right around here --

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:49.467
you can see these
little balls --

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:53.000
these are the tar balls
that they're talking about.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.500
So, Madam President, these you
can actually send out teams to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.667
pick up as they wash onshore.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.934
Ms. Randolph:
And is picked up by the booms.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:11.600
The President:
So either the boom soaks stuff up or manually you can pick up

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.967
these tar balls as
they're coming ashore.

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:19.133
But obviously the concern is, is
that until we actually stop the

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.867
flow, we've got problems.

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:26.333
And it may be that there's
some additional strategies,

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.400
Madam President, that you're
interested in pursuing.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.300
So, Thad, you want to just talk
a little bit about how the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.834
parish, Coast Guard, has been -- and the cleanup teams have been

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:41.900
working together?

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.934
Admiral Allen:
Yes, Mr. President.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.100
I was here yesterday meeting
with the parish president --

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.533
The President:
Yes, that stick is --

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.600
Admiral Allen:
An oil stick there.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.934
The unified command center they
have here is one of the best

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:53.467
examples I've seen in the region
where you have Coast Guard,

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:55.900
the responsible party, and the
local responders both from the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.567
parish and the state and the
other federal stakeholders that are there.

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.000
They sit in a room every
day; they work together;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.100
they've got everything up on
a screen in front of them;

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.133
they know where the boom
is at; they track it.

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.467
They're using modern technology
to do that and they've got a

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:08.900
real sound booming strategy.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.734
If oil were to get into the
bay over here, which is very,

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:13.500
very sensitive, they'd have to
have local shrimp boats that are

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.233
standing by to
deploy the boom --

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.367
a lot of good integration among
state and local and federal and

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:18.734
the contractors.

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:19.867
The President:
Good.

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:23.467
Ms. Randolph:
Plus we're concerned about
the port being closed by oil.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:26.667
The Coast Guard has been very
vigilant over that and the oil

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.533
that has attempted
to get into the port,

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.300
the Coast Guard is on top of.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.667
We can't close that port.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:33.633
The President:
Right.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:35.967
Admiral Allen:
The other thing is we have -- if a ship comes through and it hits

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:38.433
oil before it hits the port,
we try to establish a cleaning

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:42.533
station so we can manage that so we can keep the commerce going

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.934
-- unless it's an
accident situation.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:48.400
The President:
Now, I was -- they were also saying that a day like today is

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.834
actually ideal for in-situ
burning and skimming.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:58.767
It's hot and it's calm, which
means that a lot of boats are

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:01.967
out there right now and they're
in a position where they can

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:05.600
help prevent it from
getting close to shore.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.200
Some of you guys may have
noticed when we were walking up,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.000
by the way, there were a
couple of dolphins right --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.734
just about 50 feet out,
maybe 100 yards out.

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:20.266
So obviously there's precious
wildlife in this area even

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.033
though you see a whole bunch
of oil rigs in the background.

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:25.433
The parish president said she
used to come out here and do a

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.900
lot of fishing, so we want to
make sure that she comes back

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.000
and can fish again.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.367
All right, thank you, everybody.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:32.500
Speaker:
Thank you, sir.
