00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.550
Now we have traced around all the edges, and
now I'm going to take the pattern off the

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.590
paper, or the T-shirt that is the pattern
off the paper, and I'm going to true up my

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:24.180
original lines. They're a basic thing that
we have to take in account when we're truing

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.210
things up, and I'll go into those. So, I want
to start by labeling this with an F or the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.620
word front, so I know on my pattern that this
is the front, and basically we need right

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.570
angles at the folds, we're going to need a
right angle at the top and we're just going

00:00:44.570 --> 00:01:01.200
to make sure that?s a right angle, and then
we are going to go ahead and take these dotted

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:16.799
lines and connect them into a straight line,
or a more precise line. And we're carving

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:32.259
out the shape with this new line here. Little
by little and connecting these lines into

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:39.999
a shape, and then we can just kind of erase
where the lines meet each other so it becomes

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:49.539
one thin line. And
here we're going to want to, I think, true

00:01:49.539 --> 00:02:00.380
that up into a straight line. I'm just going
to blend it, this is a good example of truing.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:10.440
So we just kind of made that, because we don't
want, we don't want this line to come out

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.800
like this, because then at the side seam it's
going to be a point, like we definitely want

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.960
it to be straight like a right angle, so this
line stays straight all the way around, and

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.840
then we do the same to the back, and then
we're going to move on to the next step.
