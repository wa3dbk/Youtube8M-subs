00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.870
Hi! This is Eric with Spin City Cycling here
in Austin, Texas and I am talking to you on

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.700
behalf of Expert Village. Today we are going
to talk about wheels. As you can imagine,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.469
you can't ride a bike without wheels. They
are very important to the functioning of the

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.810
bike but there is also a lot of variety and
types of wheels and you need to try to get

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.780
the best type of wheels for the riding that
you are going to be doing. Wheels come in

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.690
different sizes depending on your bike and
the frame. In general, mountain bikes have

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.039
26 inch wheels. In general, road bikes have
something called a 700 wheel which is a little

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:42.820
bit bigger than a mountain bike wheel. There
are also bikes these days called 29er's that

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.109
are mountain bikes that have more of a road
bike sized wheel but you still have a knobby

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:57.559
wider tire on there. Wheel construction is
generally going to be aluminum or alloy wheel

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.170
in terms of the rim. You've got the hub that
sits in the middle of the wheel and the spokes

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.570
attach the hub to the rim. All 3 of those
components go into the make up of a wheel

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.010
and there are different levels of quality
in each of those. So you can get very low

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.060
quality hubs, spokes and rims and get very
high quality. Mountain bike rims are for obvious

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.340
reasons much stronger, much stiffer and wider
than a road bike wheel. Road bike wheels tend

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.860
to be very narrow, very light and again, just
adding to the overall low weight of a road

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.920
bike. You also see fewer spokes on road bikes
because they don't need to stand up to the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.241
same abuse you find on a mountain bike. In
terms of hub design, the more expensive you

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:53.340
go, the more sophisticated the bearing system
gets. So on an expensive wheel you may have

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.860
cartridge bearings that are pressed into the
hub which are much more efficient and last

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.310
longer and are sealed and are more resistant
to water and corrosive elements that might

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.989
damage your hub. Lower end wheels are going
to have what you call loose ball hubs which

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.909
have ball bearings with grease there that
work well but are a little more likely to

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.590
get damaged or corroded by the elements. So
hopefully you've learned a little bit about

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.959
bicycle wheels. Thanks for watching.
