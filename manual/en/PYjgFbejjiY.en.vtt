00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:03.670
I came to Canada from Wales
when I was six, 

00:00:03.684 --> 00:00:06.825
and I didn't know
how to read or write in English, 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.797
so I was naturally
a very shy child. 

00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.821
But my grade seven teacher
told me that I should audition

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:15.729
for the school play.

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:19.597
That was kind of the start of my life
in theatre and acting. 

00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:21.255
My name is Carys Lewis,

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.598
and I went to George Brown Theatre School
and I studied Theatre Arts, 

00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:26.687
and I graduated in 2010.

00:00:27.078 --> 00:00:30.446
I had a second
theatre teacher in high school 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.282
and she really believed in me
and was really encouraging. 

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:35.487
So she helped me
with all my auditions 

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.413
and suggested really great
theatre schools to go to 

00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:40.557
and I applied to a few,

00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:43.227
but George Brown
was the theatre school 

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:47.093
that professionals in the industry
in Calgary said was the best school.

00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:52.027
My sister was living in Toronto,
so I decided to come and visit her,

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.866
and Larry toured me
around George Brown,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.686
and after I finished my tour
I sat in the atrium,  

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.544
and I realized
that this was the place for me.

00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:04.122
The program is very intensive
and very demanding. 

00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:07.283
In second and third year
you're at the school for six days a week

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:11.074
and sometimes twelve hours a day,
so it's a lot of work. 

00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:13.457
After studying at George Brown
for three years, 

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:16.601
I graduated with
15 other colleagues. 

00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:19.439
By the time you're finished here.
you are a family. 

00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:22.107
I've made some lifelong friends,

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:25.111
and I'm so lucky 
to have those people in my life 

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:27.378
who I can lean on
and they can lean on me. 

00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:29.599
The facilities
at George Brown Theatre School

00:01:29.613 --> 00:01:31.150
are state-of-the-art.

00:01:31.164 --> 00:01:35.769
The Young Centre is a really beautiful
and inspiring place to work. 

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:40.057
You have Soulpepper Theatre Company
across the atrium there, 

00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:43.079
and they're a professional company
doing amazing work, 

00:01:43.093 --> 00:01:47.928
and there's continually actors
and directors and writers 

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.095
coming into the Young Centre,

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.306
and they're working, 
so it's very inspiring. 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.094
Since I graduated
from George Brown,

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:58.071
I was lucky enough to get hired
in a show called The Corpse Bride,

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:01.586
and that was wonderful
because it was movement-based theatre.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.486
And I've done some voice-over work
and done some independent films, 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.130
and then I wrote and starred in a-
my play, called Beyond the Pail. 

00:02:10.144 --> 00:02:12.320
I'm really excited
about my future 

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:16.024
and about the possibility
of working with amazing directors 

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:17.869
and actors in the industry,

00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:21.853
and having the ability
to tell people stories, 

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.851
and to tell stories
that are important to me 

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:28.683
but also stories 
that deserve to be told.
