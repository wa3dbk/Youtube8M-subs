&gt;&gt;Dr. Ketchum: So we’re going to start with
the salivary glands. We have three major types

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.999
of salivary glands. We have sublingual. If
you think about sub, what sub means, sub means

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:19.800
“below.” So the sublingual gland is below
the tongue. Submandibular, so that would be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.199
below the mandible, and then there’s the
parotid gland. So if you look here, this is

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.109
the gland that would be associated with the
jawline—just above the jawline, but in front

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.520
of the ear.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.220
So they all secrete saliva, but let’s look
at what saliva contains. Saliva contains these

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.800
bicarbonate ions. Bicarbonate ions will attempt
to make the saliva alkaline. Anywhere from

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.030
slightly acidic to neutral to alkaline is
the pH of the saliva. Some of the things that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.500
we eat and the various bacteria in our mouth
can alter the pH. So these bicarbonate ions

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.160
serve to make our mouth a little more neutral
to somewhat alkaline. The saliva also contains

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.200
mucus. The mucus lubricates the food, because
when you chew or you masticate your food,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.130
you don’t want to cause abrasions in the
lining of your mouth. So for example: I don’t

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.600
know if you’ve eaten some toast that you’ve
over-toasted and it’s practically burnt,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.320
and it forms those abrasions that you get or that rough
texture on the roof of your mouth and it’s

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.200
pretty sore for a few days? The mucus is there
to help protect things like that from happening.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.320
You also have enzymes associated with the
saliva. These include salivary amylase and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.000
lingual lipase. Salivary amylase is going
to break down starch; starch digestion begins

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.200
in the mouth. Lingual lipase will break down
fats. However, lingual lipase is not activated

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.000
until it reaches the stomach. The saliva also
contains lysozymes—not lysosomes. Don’t

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.920
confuse the two. Lysozymes are antibacterial,
so those are going to kill any bacteria that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.010
may have come into your mouth with your food.
They can also help prevent tooth decay.
