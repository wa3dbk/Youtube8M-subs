00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.100
John McAllister with Las Vegas morning news reporting live from Henderson Nevada

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.820
The Zappos.com headquarters

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.940
When you hear the phrase "the happiest place on earth", you may be tempted to think

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.989
Disneyland, but here Zappos.com, they say, not so fast

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.730
Welcome to Zappos everybody! Zappos.com, where pigs fly

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.990
And all your corporate dreams come true, but the happiest place on earth

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.460
That may be a little far-fetched. Tony this morning Zappos.com filed sues

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.419
Against Disneyland for the trademark of the happiest place on earth

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.000
Is it true? It is true. You know Zappos, we've made the Fortune "best companies

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.660
To work for"

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.420
Two years in a row. We've just made it again this year and we just think

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.560
It's fundamentally wrong that Disneyland
can call itself the happiest place on earth

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.360
Mr. Hsieh is so confident that Zappos would win this case. He's even had T-shirts printed up that say

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.660
Zappos.com, the new happiest place on earth

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.220
There’s a cheerful myth around the office. That’s undeniable

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.430
That can be found in most office in corporate America, but can you really say it's the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.620
Happiest place on earth, Tony?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.559
Yeah, just ask our employees. It really is the happiest place on earth

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.909
Well, I used to work for Disney and the
company was actually great

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.800
But nothing compares as Zappos. I've never been happier in my life

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.940
I work in Zappos.com. I'm almost as happy as I can be

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.380
It's shocking. I would rejoice this. Really the happiest place on earth.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.680
Representatives from Walt Disney were physically distraught during proceedings

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560
As seen here in this courtroom sketch

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.770
Though they could not be reached for common. Now that you've seen it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.440
And I've felt it

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.840
It's clear that Zappos is the happiest place on earth

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.340
John McAllister reporting you live

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.110
Zoop

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.320
What's new? Just a little travel research

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.520
All right. Got it

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.820
Ava, we are going to the happiest place on earth

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.280
Zappos?

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.560
No. Disneyland

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.780
Yeah, just ask our employees. Are we not the happiest place on earth?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.320
Yes

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.400
So can you not see it? Feel the joy?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.630
It is shocking. I would rejoice this. Really is the happiest place on earth
