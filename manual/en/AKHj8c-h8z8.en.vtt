00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.070
HOST: We've been talking 
about how Big Budah is

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.140
taking part in a 90-day
weight-loss challenge.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.320
Part of his regime is actually 
learning how to stabilize 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.460
his blood sugar.
Host: For this week's "Workout Wednesday" 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.550
we're joined by Jody Winterton from Gold's
Gym and fitness coach Mark MacDonald.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.730
to tell us all the factors that go into

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.860
stabilizing our blood sugar. 
Good morning guys.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.920
Is that the key, Mark? Stabilizing 
blood sugar? What does that mean?

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.100
Mark MacDonald: When most people 
want to diet or lose wait, 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.180
they cut their calories and carbohydrates. 
They get results, 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
and then life pushes back 
and they regain their weight. 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.230
Rather than using food to lose weight,
use it to create internal balance.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.260
Stabilizing your blood sugar 
is simple if you do three things: 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.430
you have to eat every 3-4 hours.
Host: I like that! Mark: That's the key!

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.550
Everytime you miss a meal

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.610
your body is burning muscle. 
When you miss a meal, 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.790
you slow down your metabolism

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.850
and then when you go into lunch, 
you're starving. You overeat

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.030
and then you store fat. By eating 5-6 meals
 a day, you keep your blood sugar stable.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.180
You have to eat the right balance of protein,
fat, and carbohydrates.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.180
Host: Can we do cheesecake
 for those meals?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.350
Host: And do calories still matter?

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.390
Mark: They do. It's just like a baby.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.450
Breast milk is protein, fat, and carbs, 
and they eat every three to four hours.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.630
They eat a certain amount of milk per
sitting. That's how our body works.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.670
If you eat too many calories, you're going to
spike your blood sugar and store fat.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.730
If you don't eat enough, you're going to burn muscle. You have to eat the right amount

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.850
per meal, not per day.
Host: If we have been weaned, 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.880
what should we be eating?

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.940
Mark: In the morning, 
a lot of people have an apple,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.990
but you could do Greek yogurt, 
an apple, and nuts.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.170
the yogurt is your protein, the apple is your
carbs, and the nuts are your fat

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.240
You have to have a balance of all three
at every single meal.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.310
Host: So meal size matters.
Mark: Meal size matters,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
and the right ratio of protein/fat/carbs 
matters. Not just carbs,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.390
not just fat, not just protein. 
You need all of them.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.570
Host: Ok, so we're looking at this food 
right now. Vegetables, fruits, 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.590
nuts, and whatever is in those containers.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.630
Host: Greek yogurt and cottage cheese.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.800
Host: We love that stuff. Jodi has 
actually showed us some great ways to cook

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.830
with those ingredients 
over the last little while,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.850
and how to make good stuff with it.
Host: You have good recipes.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.020
How do you find those?
Jodi: Search online.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.070
You can search by type of ingredient.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.240
If you try to find recipes with Greek yogurt,
or something like that,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.410
it will pop up and generate lots of things

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.440
that you can find those good ratios with. 
Just experiment.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.610
Host: Where does it say the ratio 
on the food label? How do I know?

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.720
Mark: That's what we're doing

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.790
with Big Budah. It's a whole program,
so you become educated.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.980
Nobody is educated about food. 
People know that they need to eat healthy

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.020
and that they should be exercising, 
but nobody knows how to eat correctly.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.070
Once you understand how much protein, 
fat, and carbs you need at every meal,

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.100
you can eat anywhere, anyplace, anytime.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.270
That's what what we need to do. 
We need to educate

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.290
people on how to do it. 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.460
When you know the protein, carbs,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.500
and fat of the food, you can

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.600
quickly put together a meal. 
You can eat in a restaurant,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.680
you can eat when you travel. 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.730
That's what we want to help people with.
Host: Easier said than done, though.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.900
A lot of us just don't know exactly

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.960
what to do or what foods to eat.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.080
I went on a 5000 calories-a-day diet

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.150
for a while,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.220
just trying to put some 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.400
meat on my bones for once.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.430
That is really hard to do.
 Knowing what you're

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.500
actually supposed to eat is hard. 
Let's talk about the meal

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.620
size here. 
What are we supposed to be getting? 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.730
How much should we be eating?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.800
Mark: Depending on the goal,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.850
if you're doing it right,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.020
it's based on blood sugar. 
It works for everybody.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.050
Whether you want to 
gain weight or lose weight.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.090
For a female who wants 
to lose weight, 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.250
about 250 calories per meal,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.350
about 40% protein, 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.530
35% carb, 25% fat. 
What that means

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.550
is ithat a meal could be 
eight ounces of cottage cheese

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.700
with a handful of nuts

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.710
and an apple. 
That would be a meal

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.830
for a female.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.000
Host: So that's eight meals a day, 
250 calories each?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.040
Mark: Six meals. Five to six meals.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.230
250 calories for the women.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.260
Host: So that's about 1600 calories.
That's not very many.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.420
Mark: This is the cool thing
about blood sugar.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.470
Check it out.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.590
The leaner you get,
the more meals you need,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.760
because every pound of stored fat

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.810
has 3500 calories.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.990
So when your blood sugar is stable,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.020
and let's say you're burning 2500 calories

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.170
but you're taking in 1600, those additional

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.260
calories are taken from your stored fat.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.330
The leaner you get,
the less stored fat you have.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.500
You need to add another meal.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.540
Diets make you eat less the leaner you get,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.550
and once you hit a plateau,
you can't break through.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.590
We're teaching pure physiology. 
That's a fun thing.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.690
It's not about what people think,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.770
like "cutting calories"

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.800
or "calories in versus calories out."
That's all outdated.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.830
It's all about stabilizing your blood sugar.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.860
All research shows that.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.970
Host: I heard I get to eat more

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.000
if I lose weight.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.060
Mark: You do! You get to eat more and lose.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.210
Host: You're sticking around, we have 
another segment coming up.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.250
You have given us good information,

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.370
and it's going to be fun
to track Budah's progress.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.550
We get to actually see his progress.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.660
Host: We're watching from the sidelines.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.840
Mark: You two look fantastic.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.880
 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.406
