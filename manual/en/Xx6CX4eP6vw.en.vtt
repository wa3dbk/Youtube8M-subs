00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
No! Please! No!

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.000
You're new here aren't you?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600
Are you my tour guide?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.520
Could be.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.520
I think I got it covered.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.810
You sure about that?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.340
So, how was school?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.869
You make any friends?

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.020
Something like that.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.199
I really think you're gonna like it here,
Sammy.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500
Excuse me, do you know what happened?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.500
Kid killed his girlfriend.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.800
How could somebody do that?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.000
Desperation. Fear.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.500
Necessity.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.210
Many of you have asked why we are moving ahead 
with today's festivities in light of the recent tragedy.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.000
We are here today to show that we
cannot and will not give power to evil.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.270
Guys, he's out!

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.700
What are you talking about?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.500
Rob. I just saw him!

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Think about it. They're wrong.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
Whoever did it...

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.000
...is still out there.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Today and everyday,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.800
we must stand together against adversity.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.100
We must find strength in ourselves and one another.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.800
And as a community,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
we must move forward.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Out of the darkness...

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.400
...and into the light.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.300
Welcome to Founders Day.
