00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.970
Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com and
today I want to show you how to use Lillypilly

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.880
stamping blanks. I've got some here that
are twenty five-millimeter, so an inch

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.539
I have smaller ones as well

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.109
so how do you use these in conjunction with
the epoxy stickers,

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.140
glass domes and resin

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.689
so it's really a great way of altering
these

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.119
components to use in your various jewelry
design projects

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.280
I'm going to start with what the easiest
technique is and that is a epoxy sticker

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.080
so I have one that has already been applied

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.770
this is what it looks like

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.200
it's fairly easy to do

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.270
I have a sheet here of very conveniently one inch
epoxy stickers

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.160
so I'm going to peel it off. I'm going to be
really careful to only touch the sides

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.230
not touch the stick um

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.880
and pull this

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.810
directly

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.110
onto my Lillypilly blank

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.770
you will notice the Lillypilly blanks are
just ever so slightly larger than the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.630
glass domes and the epoxy stickers

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.710
just make sure that

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.560
the stickers are centered when you put it down

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.180
You're only going to get one try at this
because you don't want to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.010
pull up that stick um once you've applied it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.320
there we go

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.690
it's on

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.790
press it down with our fingers and pressing from both sides

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.130
all the way around

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.080
and that sticker is on there very good
and here's one that I did a while

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.430
back

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.730
You see

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.670
it's not coming off so they apply really
well

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.660
what's very nice about the stickers is
you can actually hole punch right

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.020
through them

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.240
if you're familiar with this, this is
actually a hole punch that works really

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.250
well on metal. So we have aluminum here that we need to punch through

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.390
so you're not going to want to go through this way  because it's actually going to mar

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.700
the sticker. We want to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.570
turn our pliers upside down

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.520
decide where you want to punch

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.520
and squeeze

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.619
just release it a little

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.639
you see a little bit of the sticker stick up

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:18.420
you actually have a hole now both the
the sticker and the aluminum blank which

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.099
it's very handy and there's a little bit
of extra sticker in there

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.299
I'm going to take a head pin

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.299
push that through

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.199
and there you have the hole

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.509
so that's the easiest method

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.329
and that's what that looks like. Now the second method I want to show you is using a glass

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.609
dome. So with glass domes you'll often have the choice

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:42.609
of your height. You can see this one has the lowest profile, medium and highest

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.239
so depending upon which one you choose
is how magnified your images will be

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.219
this one will probably be pretty dramatic

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:57.249
so here's with the lower profile one

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.489
here is with

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.579
the medium

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.269
see how that image just got a lot bigger

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.209
and here's the high profile

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.079
I want to show you with one more color
just so you can see again

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.459
so low profile

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.879
medium profile

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.929
and high profile

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.139
so I'm going to go with the low profile
one

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.789
and to apply that I've got my Diamond Glaze

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:35.169
I'm just going to put a dab in the
middle

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.219
you don't need a lot

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.179
I'm

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:39.990
flip this over

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.109
and press it onto place

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.209
on top of

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.430
your Lillypilly blank and press it down so that Diamond Glaze runs out

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.449
all over

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.809
you're just going to leave that undisturbed

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.329
while it dries and then it's going to dry. It's going to be like this

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.439
and you'll see that this is not going
anywhere

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.459
and that is a glass dome on top of the Lillypilly. I'm just not going to touch that one

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.499
I'm going to let it dry

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.879
and then a third way you can alter these

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.589
blanks and create a domed appearance is
with resin and I've done that with this

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.859
one. I actually ahead of time colored

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.919
the Lillypilly blank with permanent
sharpie markers and now we have another

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.419
video on Beadaholique.com showing you how to do that

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.800
and you can use any type of resin for
this. For the purpose of the video I'm using

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.710
 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.610
UV resin. This is Lisa Pavelka UV Magic-Glos and it cures with a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.619
UV light

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:35.699
or direct sunlight actually. I have a UV lamp right here I'm going to be using

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.619
you could do this very easily with
two part resin as well

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:43.019
and I might actually recommend that just
because we need doming it and then we

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:44.569
actually have to pick it up

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.149
and put it into the UV light whereas
if you've just got two part resin and you

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:51.630
don't have to move it so every time
you move it you do risk

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.050
it

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.439
spilling over

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:59.459
so I've taken a little posted note, I folded it in half
and it's going to be my tray

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:00.720
 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.030
I want to put my Lillypilly

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.139
on top of my post it

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.830
I've got my

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.599
resin and I'm dripping it in the middle

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.019
try not to do too much all at once

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.139
I have

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.379
head pin here that I'm using

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.830
you could use a toothpick as well

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.110
I'm going to use it to spread

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:35.110
the resin to the edges

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.039
and surface tension is actually what keeps it

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:50.039
from spilling over, actually creating an nice little dome shape

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:56.499
be patient don't go too quickly with this

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:02.499
because you don't want to break that surface tension

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.649
now actually feel like I can get a
little higher dome on this one

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:09.639
put another drop in the middle

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.590
another two

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.360
I'm happy with that

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.219
now I have a couple little air bubbles so
what I'm going to do

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.939
is I have a micro torch

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.599
I'm going to remove my fingers so they don't get
in the way here. I'm just going to hit it really

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.449
quick with the micro torch

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.019
you saw how quickly that was. You don't want
your work surface to burn up

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.020
so now I'm going to turn on my UV light

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.059
and I'm just going to go ahead

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.099
and stick it

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:42.069
in there

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:46.439
and that looks pretty flat to me. If yours
doesn't look flat. If your surface here

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:51.029
is a little wobbled but I can actually see that the
Lillypilly itself is flat

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:56.039
if it's not flat try to make it so or try to very 
carefully use your fingernail

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.459
without touching the resin and scoot the Lillypilly around

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:00.240
so thats

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.020
completely leveled otherwise you'll have a dip in your resin

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.680
I'm going to put this in the light fifteen minutes

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.990
and it's going to come out and it's going to be
solid like this one

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.719
so there's three different options for
you on using the Lillypilly aluminum

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:13.769
blanks

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:17.759
and using them in conjunction the epoxy
sticker which is very quick an easy

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:19.419
the

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:23.629
glass tiles which is very easy as well
and then a little bit more work is the

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:25.619
resin but it has a really nice

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:27.939
effect and finish to it

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:31.809
So let your creativity flow and have fun with these various mixed media

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:32.209
components. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
