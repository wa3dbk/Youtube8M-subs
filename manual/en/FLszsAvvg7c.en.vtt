bjbj Mike Chang: Hey, what s up guys! This
is Mike Chang over here and Daniel Rose. So

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.090
Six Pack Shortcuts. Daniel Rose: What s up!
Mike Chang: Today, we re going to talk about

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.340
topic, can you get six pack abs through dieting
alone. We have a lot of people ask us this,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.560
because dieting is really popular when it
comes to getting abs. Some of the measure

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.820
factors of dieting is it lowers your metabolism.
Dan, why don t you tell us something about

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.779
how it affects your metabolism so this way
people really understand between healthy eating

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.579
and really dieting? Daniel Rose: Yeah, so
a lot of people what they ll do, especially

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.050
we re getting more women watching this channel
now and I ve seen a lot of women doing this

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.260
to where they don t really want to workout
or they ve been told by usually nutritionist

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.499
and dieticians that working out is not that
important. So they don t workout, but what

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.770
they do is they follow a diet, they re pretty
strict on it, and they cut the calories a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.780
lot. ve seen a lot of people like this and
what happens to you is like you said before

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.420
you might lose some weight. It s better than
doing nothing, but your shape is not really

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.000
going to change. It s going to be like a small
version of what you already are. Mike Chang:

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.830
And if you look if you don t have any muscles
on your body, because you re just dieting

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.930
then what you re doing is you re basically
just dropping all of your calories down and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.530
your body is going to look like you know a
skeleton and the skin, and that s really it,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.010
because it doesn t have any shape. Because
remember guys a shape is made from muscles.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.250
Like imagine that if we didn t have any muscles
we ll just be skeletons, skins, and organs.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.060
And that s why the type of look people get
when they only diet and they don t stimulate

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.630
their muscles to produce that nice shape.
If you want to have nice shoulders, if you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.400
want to have tonal chest, or if you re going
to have legs or things like that, back. All

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.340
the stuff is shaping your body. Daniel Rose:
Most definitely. So what will be your suggestion

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.120
for someone to start working out if they were
trying to only do with the diet? What s like

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.350
a good first step they can take? Mike Chang:
Well, first step they can take is if you want

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.450
to go ahead and diet, just know that if this
is something you re not very experienced in,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.319
which is working out, which is why you re
going to take the dieting approach, it is

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.180
better than not doing anything at all. Daniel
Rose: Hmm. Mike Chang: Right, you might as

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.370
well at least diet instead of not diet and
just eat fast food or something like that,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.940
but try to go ahead and incorporate a little
bit of resistant training. One easy way to

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.230
do it is we have a lot of videos on our channel
for you all to go ahead and start seeing some

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.590
of the workouts and just kind of the work
with the videos. So this way you can start

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.932
really developing some muscle and a lot of
this stuff is really basic. So this way it

00:02:37.932 --> 00:02:44.050
doesn t take any prior experience and that
s really good way to start. But as you progress

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.219
and you want to get to our next level, you
definitely need something that s a lot more

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.600
structured that can go from a beginning point
all the way to beyond the end where you totally

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.909
can transfer in body and you have the body
that you want, and you can definitely find

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.730
that in our program. Daniel Rose: Most definitely.
And one more thing which I think a lot of

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.260
people have in their head while they re only
doing the diet is because they think it will

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.829
be easier to just diet than to diet and work
out. Mike Chang: Yeah. Daniel Rose: But as

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.939
I found out that it is actually lot easier
to do the workouts, because you don t have

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.999
to be anywhere near strict on the diet and
you don t have to cut your calories by anywhere

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.719
near as much. Mike Chang: Exactly, because
working out actually increases your metabolism

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.010
and for some people that actually start our
program. They actually didn t change much

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.140
of the diets at all and they really ate about
the same. All they did was just burn more

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.280
calories throughout the day, because they
started doing the workouts in our program

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.700
and what happened was they started seeing
results right away and their body and their

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.400
shape on the body started to change. But as
they progress they still have to start eating

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.719
more healthy, but that s another thing like
you said it s a good point. Dieting seem to

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:52.209
be a little easier but it s not really that
much easier. Here s something that s really

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.319
interesting. When someone is dieting, basically
what you re doing is you re restricting calories

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.129
and your body is getting hungry and you re
not feeding any of food. So you re cutting

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.189
your calories down. This is very important,
because when you diet and your body is hungry,

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.579
our bodies were meant to survive. It wasn
t meant to look like fitness models. We weren

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.950
t meant to have nice muscles and six pack
abs and anything. We are just meant to survive

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.120
and when your body starts to get hungry, your
brain automatically switches from eating healthy

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.000
and having a nice body to survival mode. Let
me get some food myself, because that s how

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.780
you think. You know you ever heard the term
survival mode. It goes for a lot of different

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.759
things. So when you re out there and your
body is starving and you have food around,

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.220
you re going to eat whatever is in front of
you, because your body is switching into that

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.710
mode. Your brain is switching into that mode
to where you need to eat to now survive. So

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.520
dieting is out of the window. That s a really
big reason why people stay on diets for a

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.520
week, sometimes only three, four days. Daniel
Rose: Yeah. Mike Chang: We hear a lot of people,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.240
they ll diet, they ll just start on diet on
Monday and by Wednesday they taper off and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.830
on quit on Thursday and then they take Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday, and they binge eat on

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.680
and all that stuff. Daniel Rose: Cheat days.
Mike Chang: Cheat days. You can have cheat

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.720
meals, but not cheat days. Then they diet
again on Monday. So yeah, it just you can

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.260
t starve yourself. Your body wasn t meant
to starve. Our bodies are meant to eat healthy

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.389
food and to stay active and that s just how
we re built. Daniel Rose: Yeah, almost definitely

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.159
and I think that if you got in your head that
the diet is going to be the easy way like

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.919
even if you started -- we have a video up
there right now of the M-100s cardio workout

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.160
out, the home cardio work out. Even that,
plus the diet is going to be better, but best

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.140
of all is obviously going to be the full workout.
Mike Chang: Definitely! So you go ahead and

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.780
find out more about the workouts, and not
dieting, but to how to really eat healthy

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.539
and how to incorporate healthy eating into
your lifestyle to where you don t starve at

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:59.960
all. You may have seen other videos before
me and Dan we really eat a lot of food. We

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.180
never starve, we re always scarfing ourselves.
So if you want to go ahead and learn how to

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.419
eat as much as you want and really still have
the body that you want as you always wanted,
