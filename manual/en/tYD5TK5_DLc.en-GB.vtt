Welcome to Japatalk. It's me, Chihiro again.
こんにちわ(Ko-n-ni-chi-wa) = Hello.

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:16.200
Today's Japatalk is about Masks in Japan. By the way, the Japanese pronunciation of mask is

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.300
"マスク(Ma-su-ku)"

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.000
I think you might be surprised if you come to Japan,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.500
because there are so many Japanese people wearing masks.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.439
Why? Does everyone have diseases? No.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.000
Is the air not clean in Japan? I don't think so.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, why do I, and many other Japanese people, wear masks?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The reason I wear masks
is simple - I have hay fever.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I can't even take it off indoors. It's that bad. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.100
A lot of people wear masks for the same reason as me during the spring, but not everyone.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.100
Another reason people wear masks is because they have a cold and they don't want to give it to anyone else,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.000
or they are busy and can't afford to catch a cold.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.200
It's hard to get a day off in
busy Japanese society. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.000
Another reason for women is that they can't be bothered putting their makeup on

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.900
or they just don't have confidence in their looks.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.200
 I sometime get that way, depending
on my mood. 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.500
I heard that up to 30% of girls wear masks for this reason.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.500
And we also wear masks when it's cold outside, just to keep our faces warm.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.000
There are a lot of people wearing masks in Japan recently,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.500
so there are also many companies making masks, too.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.000
It's slowly becoming popular among young people to use a mask as a fashion statement.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.000
A lot of people think it makes their eyes look bigger, but I don't think so. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.100
See? still small.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.600
You can get all sorts of weird masks like the one I'm wearing today from novelty shops like 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.100
Village/Vanguard.

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.000
You can get normal white masks from the pharmacy, convenience store,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.280
or even the supermarket.

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.000
The Japanese pronunciation of convenience store is 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
"コンビニエンスストア(ko-n-bi-ni-en-su-su-to-a),

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:36.659
but we usually just say "コンビニ(ko-n-bi-ni)". 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.300
The supermarket is 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.300
"スーパーマーケット(suu-paa-maa-ketto),

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.300
but we just say "スーパー(suu-paa)". 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.329
Japanese people like to borrow words from English,

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.900
and make them shorter, so they are easier to say.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.100
I know it might seem weird, at first, to say your language with Japanese pronunciation.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.300
But, when you get used to it, it can be a fun part of learning Japanese. 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.200
Alright, I'm gonna go and play "バスケ(ba-su-ke)" with my friends now.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.200
What do you think "バスケ(ba-su-ke)"
is? 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.000
Hint: it's a sport. Check the video description for the answer.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Anyway, see you in the next Japatalk.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
"バイバイ！(bye-bye!)"
