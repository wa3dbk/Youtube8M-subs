00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
Hello boys and girls, it's Nursery Rhyme Time!

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
This is a rhyme about sleep,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.600
but I need you to be wide awake to hear this one!

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.820
Cocka-doodle-doo!

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.500
Okay, sit up straight, get comfy--

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.340
well, not too comfy or you could fall asleep.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.680
Okay, let's begin!

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.540
Say hello to William.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.140
Hello!

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.460
Yes, hello!

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.720
William here goes by the name of "Will" or "Wills."

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.880
But for this particular nursery rhyme, he's going with the name "Willie."

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.120
Hello, Willie!

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.840
Hi there!

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.040
Willie's a rather small boy,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.800
a bit tiny...

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540
Not as tiny as an ant.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.340
AH!

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.400
But he is a wee fellow!

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.060
Yes friends, this is Wee Willie Winkie.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.860
When the sun sets,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.840
and families across the town are finishing their dinner,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.260
Mmm... good dinner. Thanks hun!

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.260
Glad you enjoyed it. High in protein, that was!

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.260
And once the whole town has brushed their teeth,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.780
Goodnight Mary Mary!

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.140
Goodnight Little Bo Peep!

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.280
Willie here puts on his nightgown.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.720
Yes... Quite odd that Willie here wears a nightgown.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
But since his pajamas are getting washed in the laundry machine,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.620
Wee Willie Winkie has to wear his sister's nightgown!

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.820
Seriously mom! Why do I have to wear Wendy's nightgown??

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.940
Oh don't worry Willie! It's nighttime. Nobody will see you!

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.580
And as it happens, at 10 o'clock--

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.180
which is way past Willie's bedtime--

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.140
Willie is not fast asleep, or even turning down his sheets,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.480
or sipping a cup of hot cocoa before bedtime.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.040
No... Wee Willie Winkie does the most peculiar thing...

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.700
With a candle in his hand, Willie runs around the town.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.540
He runs upstairs.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.160
He runs downstairs.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.960
He's knocking on doors.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.640
Tapping on windows.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.960
And checking to make sure that all the children are fast asleep.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.260
Willie's basically the town sleep monitor.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.420
Hey... Are you asleep?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.800
Yeah I sure am!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.500
Okay. Awesome!

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.260
He makes sure iPads are put away.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.100
Books on their night tables.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.700
And lights a-switched off.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.660
Why, you may ask.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.640
Why does Willie do this?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.000
Well, too many children are coming to school late

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.440
because they were watching TV or playing video games at night,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.000
when they should've been asleep getting ready for the next great day!

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.220
So, as it happens,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.420
this important job has been given to Wee Willie Winkie

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420
by his very own school!

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.560
He double checks that the children are sleeping,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.620
so they're well-rested for class the next morning.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.720
And all the children are doing much better in school.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.380
And now for the Nursey-Rhyme part!

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.200
Hope you enjoyed that nursery rhyme!

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.180
Toodle-doo and buh-bye until next time!

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.180
