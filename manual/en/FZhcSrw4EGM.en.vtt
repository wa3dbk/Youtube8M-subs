00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:09.480
[Introduction slides to background music]

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.320
[PAUSE]

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.980
&gt;&gt;Voiceover: The Gold Coast is playing host
to the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.150
But while the actual event is still six years
away, the benefits are already being felt.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.660
&gt;&gt;Andrew Woodward: There is a tremendous body
of knowledge that you just don’t use once.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.800
It’s something that you continue on you
know, from Games to Games.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.680
And in an Australian context, we’ve had
this tremendous ability with the Sydney Olympic

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.450
Games knowledge, to take that through to Rugby
World Cup, the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.480
but also to people who are confirmed hosts,
like in Russia, like in Brazil and like in

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.950
South Korea for the future.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.190
&gt;&gt;Voiceover: The Commonwealth Games will no
doubt be very beneficial for the Gold Coast

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.850
and will bring new vitality to the area.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.410
But there is still a lot of work to be done
before the Games in 2018.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.680
&gt;&gt;Andrew Woodward: We’re looking upon this
as 11 days of sport and a decade of opportunity.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.320
And that decade of opportunity will come you
know, starting before the Games.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.420
And what we’re looking at is across the
board.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.659
We can see benefits for trade and investment,
we can see benefits for tourism, we can see

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.300
benefits for the education community in terms
of know how, but also too we can see benefits

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.340
when it comes to sport.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.020
&gt;&gt;Voiceover: One of the challenges faced by
Commonwealth Games organisers is how to use

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.820
and integrate new technology, particularly
when forecasting for an event.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.720
&gt;&gt;Andrew Woodward: One of the things that
we’re going to be doing here in the next

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.829
few years is doing a massive amount of thinking
about how the media will broadcast the 2018

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.249
Commonwealth Games and how people, for the
want of a better phrase, consume those Games.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.159
I mean, do they do it in the grandstand, do
they do it in live sites, do they do it you

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.740
know, on their hand held or tablet devices.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.189
So we’re going to be doing a lot of thinking
about how these major events are actually,

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.960
you know, people participate in them and actually
people consume them.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.310
And that’s knowledge that you know, we’ll
be able to share with future event organisers

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.890
right around the world.
