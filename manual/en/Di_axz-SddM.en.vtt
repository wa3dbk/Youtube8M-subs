00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.140
-Advice for students who want
to go into postgraduate study,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.570
it's like speed dating.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.852
You have a limited
amount of time, a limited

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:18.310
amount of information,
and you have

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.090
to make very important choices.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.490
I think there are
a couple things

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.740
you want to be thinking about.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.280
The first thing
is, am I interested

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.640
in what the faculty is teaching?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.240
Do they seem to act as
mentors to their students?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.700
Is there a sense of community?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.684
Is it an interesting mix
of students and faculty?

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:40.350
-I think if you're
choosing where you're

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560
going to study as
a postgraduate,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.240
you really need to focus
on your own interests.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.290
And that means you need
to reflect internally

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.900
on what is important
to you, whether it

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.390
be the particulars
of the subject.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.300
And so that would direct
you towards a few places

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.690
where they're providing
interesting things that really

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.020
match your desire in terms
of what you want to study.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.730
But more broadly
than that, you want

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.540
to find a place which is
conducive to a year of very

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.320
focused effort.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.520
If you're studying
for a taught Master's,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.780
or several years if
you're a Ph.D. student.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.200
-Your postgraduate studies
are a really big investment

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.390
in your intellectual development
your career potential.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.810
And there's lots
of different ways

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.000
you can fund your
postgraduate study.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.060
And so it's really
important you take the time

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.010
to investigate as many
of these as possible.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.866
-Postgraduate life
at York is very full.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.740
I would say, don't
underestimate your course.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.570
It is not going to be
that easy, but it's not

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.960
going to be that hard either.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.650
What you have to
remember is that there

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.960
are loads of things you can
do alongside your course,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.280
such as engage in society,
sports activities,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.210
or even get involved in
a representational role--

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.360
like I did.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.590
And remember that it's up to
you to make those choices while

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.440
you're here .
