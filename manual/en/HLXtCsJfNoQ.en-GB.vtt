Good day! Welcome to Charlis Crafty Kitchen.
Today, we're making Pigs in Mud Cake.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.170
And welcome to My Cupcake Addiction. We're
guest starring today on Charlis Crafty Kitchen

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.470
and we're helping her make her Pigs in Mud
Cake.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.779
So this is a little bit of a different look
for My Cupcake Addiction. This week's Mixed

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.340
Up Monday is a collaboration that I've done
with my beautiful niece Charli from Charlis

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.571
Crafty Kitchen. Yes, she has her own YouTube
Channel and it's doing fairly well. She's

00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:35.680
rivaling me for subscribers at the moment
and I keep telling her she's very close.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.390
Between you and I, she's got a little way
to go. So if you want to head over to her

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.460
channel and hit the Subscribe button, I know
she would be forever grateful.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.500
We've themed up to do this great Kit Kat Pigs
in Mud Cake. Now, you might have seen the

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.610
Kit Kat Rainbow M&amp;M cakes that have been going
around for a little while. There's certainly

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.300
plenty of tutorials on YouTube and Charli
has in fact done one of those before. She

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.070
found this Pigs in Mud Cake and she asked
me to help. She didn't think she was quite

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.059
up there in the cake decorating skills to
actually get it done all by herself but I

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.440
was surprised by how much of it she got done.
This is a fantastic cake to make with your

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.649
kids, for your kids, or just because. And
look, it is really easy and so effective.

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.920
Unfortunately, this picture wasn't watermarked
so we have no idea who the original creator

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.969
was but it has gone viral. And I have seen
it popped up on so many different cake decorating

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.049
blogs and websites. It's just crazy.
I really hope that you enjoy this tutorial.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.619
You will have to head over to Charlis Crafty
Kitchen to view the full tutorial. But I hope

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.929
that you like what you see when you get there.
She's got heaps of tutorials and they're great

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.130
for kids, great school holiday fun. And look,
if you've got little kids, they just love

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.869
watching them. I don't know what it is.
Make sure that you subscribe to Charlis Crafty

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.310
Kitchen for more great kid's tutorial and
potentially more collaborations with My Cupcake

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.169
Addiction.
And as always, thank you very much for watching.
