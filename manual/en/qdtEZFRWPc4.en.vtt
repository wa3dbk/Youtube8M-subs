00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:08.867
It can’t be that hard to get lots of credits from a battle, right?

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.367
Actually it’s not so simple.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.567
Collecting credits requires knowledge and special tactics.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.300
You need to be well prepared if you hope to earn a lot.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.467
There are some nuances in the strategy.

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:33.400
For example, selecting the right vehicle is important.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.400
The biggest profit is not brought by top-tier tanks.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.133
Yes, the Tier X gameplay is unmatched.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.567
However, it can be an expensive luxury.

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.467
Shells, repairs…

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:46.200
… it’s like buying a Humvee to save on gas.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.267
If your goal is getting credits – you have to find a balance between tanks which generate a good income and are still cheap to maintain.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.233
The perfect balance is usually found on Tier 8.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:03.600
You don’t need any special consumables, just the essentials: a repair kit, first aid kit, HEAT and APCR rounds.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.100
However, think twice before using them in battle needlessly.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.333
If you don’t use something then you don’t have to buy it next time.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.367
Cost-cutting!

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.267
The most important part starts in battle.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Here are the basics of what you get for any battle:

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.900
•	Credits for participation

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.933
•	Multiplied by vehicle tier

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:23.700
•	Multiplied in case of victory

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.167
The rest depends on your actions.

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:29.000
Everything is based on multipliers and formulas.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.267
They aren’t difficult to understand. Have a look.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.267
The first multiplier is the credits amount per hit point.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.800
It’s easy: more damage dealt – more credits earned.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.700
Setting enemies on fire and blowing up ammo racks bring the most profit –

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.433
just one shot and the damage is tenfold.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.700
There are some nuances to these tactics.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.333
Firstly, destroying an enemy provides no bonus whatsoever, only damage dealt matters.

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:58.967
Secondly, if you shoot with someone spotting for you the profits drop by a quarter.

00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:03.833
However when you provide targets for your allies you get half of the profits for the damage

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:06.133
without spending any shells at all.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:11.267
Sometimes being a good scout is even more profitable than being a veteran tank skirmisher.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:14.367
The first one to spot an enemy gets a fixed bonus.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:18.667
However if there are many scouts, you’ll have to split the profits.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.300
This is the main income source that totally depends on your skills.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.600
Damage plus reconnaissance, but that’s not all.

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:30.700
Capturing the base provides an additional bonus.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.133
The profit will be split among the capturers no matter how much they contributed, if the base is captured.

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:39.767
Just capturing for a few moments and rolling on won’t do anything.

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:43.233
The next time you decide to finish off all enemies just for fun,

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:47.400
think, “won’t it be more profitable if I capture their base instead?”

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.867
At the end of the battle, the credits earned for damaging and scouting

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:54.233
are multiplied by a factor that is unique for every tank.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:03:01.233
In addition, a third multiplier is provided by Premium Account, it multiplies the resulting credits by 1.5.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.767
Of course, you won’t get an enormous amount of credits for one battle.

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:08.567
A systematic approach is required. Combat missions are helpful here.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:13.700
If you set yourself a goal to complete all daily missions and keep the profit factors in mind,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.400
you’ll have more than enough credits before you know it.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:32.267
Well, getting lots of credits in battle isn’t that hard, is it?

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:35.333
Join the battle and earn your victory!
