00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.264
- What's up guys, it's Collins Key,

00:00:01.264 --> 00:00:02.972
and happy Thanksgiving hangover.

00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:05.461
Now I hope you guys had a
fantastic Thanksgiving holiday.

00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:07.616
And my favorite things about
Thanksgiving is of course,

00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:08.600
spending time with your family,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.578
and also being able to eat
as much food as you want

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.822
for one day and no one judges you,

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:15.053
it's absolutely amazing.

00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:17.543
So for today's video,
Thanksgiving kind of inspired me

00:00:17.543 --> 00:00:20.385
and I wanna actually do
a food eating contest.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.041
I want to make this extreme,
so to make it extreme,

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:25.053
I'm gonna bring along a
little someone with me.

00:00:25.053 --> 00:00:26.800
The destroyer of worlds!

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.154
(growling)

00:00:28.154 --> 00:00:30.344
(laughing)

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:31.473
Devan Key!

00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:32.306
- [Both] Hey!

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:33.264
- What up!

00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:34.097
How's it going?

00:00:34.097 --> 00:00:34.930
- That's probably the best intro

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.293
I've ever had.
- Destroyer of worlds.

00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:37.565
- Destroyer of worlds!

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:38.977
(growling)

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:40.126
- Turn up.
- Yes.

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:40.993
- Come on, let's scoot over here

00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:41.826
we'll look better.
- Okay.

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:42.659
- Alright cool, hey!
- Hey what up!

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:43.492
- Now look normal.

00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:45.225
- For this pie eating
contest, I brought along.

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:46.058
(laughing)
In your face.

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:46.891
- A pie.

00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:47.724
- A pie!

00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:49.583
And I have to eat this pie in one minute.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.393
And the reason Devan is
here, is because Devan

00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:53.445
is going to be the pie defender.

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:54.288
His only job

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.391
is to make sure that I do not eat this pie

00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:57.326
in that amount of time.

00:00:57.326 --> 00:00:58.537
And the winner gets to
slap the other person

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.629
with some whipped cream in the face.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.544
(laughing)

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:02.377
Let's do it.

00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:03.210
- Give him some whipped cream.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.733
- Oh no!

00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.566
(can spurts)

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.785
(laughing)

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:07.841
It's like, oh shoot!

00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:09.410
Dude it's like diarrhea.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.530
Yo this is really necessary?

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.399
(voice track speeds up)

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.375
Yo!

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:17.269
Look at this!

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:19.048
There's no way I can eat this in a minute.

00:01:19.048 --> 00:01:20.206
(laughing)

00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:21.332
There's no way!

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:22.450
- I'm so gonna win!

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.317
- Pie eating contest starts
in three, two, one, go!

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:27.150
(grunting)

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.170
- [Devan] Okay.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.003
(exclaims)

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.098
(Nerf gun shooting)

00:01:31.098 --> 00:01:32.705
- You hit my eye!

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:35.122
(exclaiming)

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:37.906
Oh!

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:40.156
(laughing)

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.013
My eye!

00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:48.263
(grunting)

00:01:49.352 --> 00:01:51.602
(laughing)

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:55.952
- You laughed, you laughed!

00:02:06.928 --> 00:02:07.761
- No!

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:09.763
No!

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:12.394
- Can't leave you alone!

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:14.561
(squeals)

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.719
(shouts)

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:25.469
- Okay, here let's see if we can get.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:26.514
(laughing)

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.014
(toy singing)

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:32.619
That doesn't work!

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.869
(laughing)

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:36.956
Okay.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.766
(exclaiming)

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:43.336
Oh!

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:44.392
I think we hit a minute.

00:02:44.392 --> 00:02:45.562
I think it's been a minute.

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:46.667
- Alright, let's do it!

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.537
- It's been a minute.

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:49.768
- It's in my nose!

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:51.352
It's in my nose!

00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:52.275
(gags)

00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:53.555
- No, it's done!

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:54.388
It's a minute!

00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:55.810
- That was disgusting!

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.273
Alright so Devan won this challenge

00:02:57.273 --> 00:02:59.746
and now he gets to do a smack
hand with some whipped cream.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.634
(sighs) I'm not excited about this.

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:03.046
I don't know how I was ever
supposed to win this challenge

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:04.845
in the first place, this was impossible.

00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:05.870
First of all!

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.920
That Nerf bullet!

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.065
It literally hit me right in the eye!

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:12.104
Like right in the eye!

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:13.222
(exclaiming)

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:14.745
And then you hit me with
a sock right in the eye

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:16.603
right after that!

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:19.181
I couldn't see out of this
eye for like a couple seconds!

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.881
Yo it's in my sock.

00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:21.723
It's like in my sock.

00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:22.941
This is worse than wet socks.

00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:24.396
Look at, scroll down to all the mess.

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:25.644
Look at this.

00:03:25.644 --> 00:03:26.477
- [Devan] Look at that.

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:27.807
- That's disgusting!

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.176
Look at those freaking apples.

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:30.009
- Here we go.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.842
- Yeah!

00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:32.550
(laughing)

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.626
- Look at all that loveliness.

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:34.938
- You guys please give
me a thumbs up for this

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:36.247
because this is, this is like a smack hand

00:03:36.247 --> 00:03:37.080
this is gonna hurt.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.913
- Three, two.

00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:38.746
(smacks)

00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:40.014
- Oh!

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:41.669
You got it in my ear!

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.502
(laughing)

00:03:42.502 --> 00:03:44.240
It's like all in my ear!

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.305
What the frick!

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:46.891
Like I can't hear out of this ear,

00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:49.105
I'm gonna get a yeast
infection in my ear, bro!

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:50.884
- We are going for a smack hand part two,

00:03:50.884 --> 00:03:51.900
because that one sucked.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.297
Three, two, one.

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:54.130
(smacks)

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.990
(yells)

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.072
It got in my eye!

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:57.641
Oh gaw it's in my eye.

00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:58.634
Oh!

00:03:58.634 --> 00:03:59.598

No way!
