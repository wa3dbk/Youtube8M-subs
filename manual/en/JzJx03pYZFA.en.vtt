00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:11.060
Today I’m going to show you how a simple
color can change your image completely.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.190
Today we’re going to do some awesome stuff
with color, but before we get into it, I want

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.019
to show you guys this Lensbaby ProEffects
Kit.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.050
We just got it in the studio.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.619
We’ve been playing around with this awesome
one.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.519
They’re really great for creating out of
focus areas and we decided we’re going to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.669
do an entire photo shoot based around shooting
just with this Lens Babies.

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.289
I cannot wait for these images.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.300
They’re going to be amazing.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.860
It’s going to be in two weeks so look forward
to that.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.140
Really, really excited about these things,
they’re actually way … they’re really

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.140
nice.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.290
So, I’m really excited about it.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.580
We’re going to do some great stuff with
color today.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.360
We’re going to use one predominant color.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.370
Then mask it off to show you guys how you
can really create a lot of interest in your

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.720
photo while simplifying it at the same time.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.230
Let’s get into it.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.560
This image that we’re using today is Jason’s
image.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.800
It’s an awesome image.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.650
He won the PHLearn contest last week.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.060
If you guys want to enter it, be sure to search
for the contest.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.540
It’s just one episode ago, and you can have
your images edited on PHLearn as well and

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.540
get a PHLearn Pro.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.050
Very, very cool image here today.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.890
What we’re doing is looking at the image
as a whole and maybe some things that we can

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.890
do with it.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.590
Our subject is right here in the middle and
she’s wearing this really nice like magenta

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.220
colored dress here, and have a green throughout
the rest of the image.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.190
Whenever you have this play with complimentary
colors, we’ll just bring up a color wheel.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.970
&nbsp;I use this color wheel all the time.&nbsp;

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.970
I really do.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.060
I have one here at my desk and we’re looking
here at yellow, green and green and that is

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.700
complimented with red, violent and red.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.630
Really looking at complimentary colors and
how to play those back and forth and if you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.210
do have those in your images, I’m going
to show you a great way to simplify it.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.670
We already have that in this image.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.580
What we’re going to do, I’m going to create
an adjustment layer and we’re going to go

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.430
over here to solid color.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.159
We’ve got a solid color adjustment layer
and I’m going to choose a green that’s

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.790
relatively similar to the green that’s actually
in the photo.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.520
Don’t worry about it if you don’t get
it exactly right just now.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.210
Let’s hit OK, and what we’re going to
do is change that from normal down here to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.210
color.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.410
Alright, now I know it doesn’t look that
great right now but what we’re going to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.020
do is change our opacity right here down to
20%.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.560
Hit V and hit the number 2 on your keyboard
and that’s going to bring you down to about

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.599
20%.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.930
Let’s just turn this off and on and see
if it’s what we like.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.010
If it’s not, you can just double click right
over here and you can change your saturation.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.480
You can change your color a little bit and
see how it’s coloring the background here.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.099
If we went up to reds and things like that,
it would add a little bit more red.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.310
Let’s go right over here towards green and
I think that looks great.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.080
What we’re doing is bringing down the opacity
of this and let me just turn this off and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.459
on so you can see.

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.500
It really limits the kind of color in your
image.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.140
It brings almost everything towards that green
spectrum which it doesn’t look weird but

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.320
it simplifies everything.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.520
Now what we’re going to do is let’s just
go ahead and zoom in to or main subject.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.590
We’re going to go to our layer mask and
I’m going to paint black on our layer mask

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.819
where our subject is.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.670
This is using … you can see … let me just
zoom in a little bit so you actually can see.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.580
It’s making this green layer not visible
where our subject is.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.849
It’s going to not really affect skin tones
too much and it’s going to get this nice

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.959
magenta color popping out a little bit better.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.020
I’m painting black on a layer mask which
just makes this layer invisible wherever I’m

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.020
painting.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.340
There we go.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.730
We’ll just hold alter option, you can see
what from my layer mask looks like.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.760
It’s really not that great but it doesn’t
matter for the most part but it gets the job

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760
done.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.900
Let’s just zoom out and we can see now how
well she really does standout of that background

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.660
and you could crop this in any number of ways.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.670
Let’s just turn this layer off and on.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.920
You can see with it off, she does stand out
but the tree color and the background color,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.750
they all … it creates a lot of not distraction,
but it could be a little bit simplified.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.860
By bringing that one color throughout, it
really does help to simplify the image and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.620
she does standout quite a bit more.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.060
It’s something you guys can do in two seconds.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.459
Just pick the background color predominant
and just mask that out wherever your subjects

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.459
are.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.780
It’s going to make them really pop out a
lot more.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.930
Now, because it’s PHLearn and I want to
do a little bit more to this, what we’re

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.780
going to do is we’re going to bring her
out a little bit more using a really cool

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.780
vignette technique.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.070
Let’s grab an adjustment layer and I’m
going to here to curves.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.970
We’re just going to click right here in
the middle and just drag that guy up.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.220
Now, oftentimes when you’re creating curves
layer and you bring this up, what happens

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.610
is your highlights become too bright.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.610
They get blown out.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.580
So, I’m going to show you how to fix that.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.840
We’re going to bring that up just right
about there, and now we’re going to go click

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.440
on your layer mask and go to image and then
down here to Apply Image.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.240
All you have to do is it’s … by default
it’s going to say ‘Merged’, ‘RGB’,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240
‘Multiply’.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240
All that’s correct.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.460
By default, this ‘Invert’ is not going
to be checked.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.940
What I want you to do is click on that invert
and what it does is it makes anywhere that’s

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.729
bright not visible on this layer mask and
anywhere that’s dark visible.

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.580
We’ll hit okay and let’s just look at
what our layer mask looks like.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.650
Hold alter-option to look at it.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.660
I know it looks really weird but basically
it’s masking out the light areas and it’s

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.040
making sure it’s visible where everything
is darker.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.490
It’s taking all the darks and bringing those
up in brightness.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.410
You’ve seen those great images where the
shadows really aren’t that dark.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.699
This is how they do that.Let’s make that
visible and not visible you can see you almost

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.250
have like a painterly effect going on with
your image which is great.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.340
Let’s just lower the opacity to that a little
bit.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.820
Then just to draw a little bit more attention
to our subject, let’s drop our curves adjustment

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.820
layer.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.820
There we go.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.669
I’m going to bring the mid-tone down a little
bit and then we’re just going to choose

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.330
a marquee tool, make a big selection, something
like that, and this is going to be our vignette.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.340
Here on our layer, let’s just hit Shift+Delete
and fill the middle of the selection with

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.340
black.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.340
There we go.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.350
Command+D to deselect and then go to filter,
blur and to Gaussian blur and just choose

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.370
nice big Gaussian blur.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.449
If it’s too small, you can still see the
edges so make sure you go really big and it’s

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.229
going to look quite a bit more natural.

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.560
There you can see guys, it really didn’t
take too long to get this effect done.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.810
Let’s just group those together.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.090
Shift click them all and hit Command+G to
group them together.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.730
Here’s the before and the after.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.360
A really simple effect that can make your
image look like a painting and really draw

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.640
a lot of attention to your subject.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.720
You guys can do this in a couple of minutes.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720
Awesome!

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.590
Guys, thanks so much for watching PHLearn.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.150
If you guys use this technique for one of
your images, be sure to submit it in the comment

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.150
down below.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.580
I would love to see how this can really help
your bring subject out of your images.Hope

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.010
you enjoy this tutorial.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.550
I’ll PHLearn you guys later.&nbsp;

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:49.180
Bye everyone
I want to introduce you guys to Jamie, our

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.080
awesome hairstylist and producer.
