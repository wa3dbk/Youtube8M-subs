00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Hey there Juggies, it's your ol' pal McJuggerNuggets here,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.980
and if you have not seen the video of my father

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.760
chainsawing and sledgehammering my Xbox One,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.420
check that out right down there.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.960
Because this is an update video to let you know what's been happening since that time, and what I plan to do.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.240
Here it is. Here is my Xbox One, "The Prince" I like to call it.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.560
You can see where he smashed it with the sledgehammer.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.820
It does not work.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.180
The metal caging is completely, there is plastic everywhere, I try not to cut myself on this shit.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.740
You can see where he chainsawed parts of it.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.400
So it is dead, it is dead. Microsoft said they would not repair it.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.280
I don't know of any places that would repair an Xbox One, I have not been able to find any,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.520
so I'm just going to have to buy a new one.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.900
People have been offering money, but I don't want to do donations or a charity thing.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.700
Hopefully I can get my mother to lend me some money so I can buy a new one,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.000
or I will just use the money I've been saving up to buy my new car windows and windshield, to purchase this Xbox One.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.820
I hope to get one within the next week or two, so I can get back to streaming on twitch.tv/mcjuggernuggets,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.480
and so I can get the RiDGiD GAMiNG channel back up and running with new content for you guys.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.160
As far as family life, things are, things have been, things have been awkward. There has been some tension,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.700
but at the end of the day, the blades were still on. That was my mistake.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.380
I could have very easily have killed my parents...

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.860
had my brother not turned on the light before he should have.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.100
So I guess, I guess it's justified.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.480
I don't see how the video games had anything to do with that, the blades still being on.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.860
I missed the Master Chief Collection launch, which was very upsetting,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.180
but I heard that it's already getting matches online,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.540
and they have been having a lot of server issues, and they have been working non-stop to fix that,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.540
so I guess I did not miss much.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.620
It still would have been nice though, to at least play a campaign.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.480
All my friends have been saying they had a lot of fun, custom games and stuff.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.640
I miss you guys in the stream, I will still be active on this channel, it has just been a lot of bullshit.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.480
Rest in peace, "The Prince".

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.640
And, yeah, keep it RiDGiD guys.
