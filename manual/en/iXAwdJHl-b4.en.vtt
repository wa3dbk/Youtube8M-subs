00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:13.400
How to play jazz rub notes. Which are what
separates jazz music from other types of music.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.570
They are not unique to jazz music but certainly
one of the most important and critical elements

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:29.400
to jazz music. When you are playing your rub
notes, its one of those notes that doesn't

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:39.950
fit into a chord on its own. If we are playing
an F major chord here, we'll drop it down

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:49.500
to a seventh.
And now we are playing something that could

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.840
be classified as jazz simply because of the
rub note. Let's throw something else in there,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:12.110
a slip note, sort of a cousin to a rub note
that?s basically a stylistic thing but its

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.869
equally used in jazz in the very important
parts. Let's run some rub notes and slip notes

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.439
together. I'll show one quick slip note it
would be going from what would be a major

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:38.580
and dropping into a seventh or a minor. There
would be that F chord, its slipping off the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:57.600
top key or bottom key and giving it that feel.
And there is the basic introduction of rub

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.170
notes and slip notes when playing the jazz
piano.
