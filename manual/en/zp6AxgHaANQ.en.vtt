00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.238
"Tell Your Doctor If You Eat Grapefruit"

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:11.158
If you have people eat half 
a grapefruit 3 times a day

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:12.677
before each meal for 
a couple months, 

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:15.676
they may lose 
about 2 pounds, 

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:20.556
but that's no more than if they 
ate 3 apples or pears a day.

00:00:20.556 --> 00:00:22.477
In this study the 
grapefruit eaters 

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:24.556
not only saw their 
weight go down,

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:25.728
but their waist 
get slimmer, 

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:27.917
and their body 
fat melt away. 

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:29.629
But if you repeat 
the experiment

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.158
and instead just ask 
people to drink

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:33.878
a half cup of water 
before each meal, 

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:35.958
you get the 
same result. 

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.863
So this belief that 
grapefruit has some special

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:43.100
fat burning quality appears 
to be just a long-held myth. 
 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.115
Here's the latest, 

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:47.197
showing grapefruit consumers 
had a drop in weight,

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:48.761
significant drop 
in cholesterol, 

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:50.398
significant drop 
in blood pressure.

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:53.989
Conclusion: This study suggests that 
consumption of grapefruit daily

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.429
or 6 weeks does NOT significantly 
decrease body weight, 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.477
cholesterol, or blood pressure. 
What?! 

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:01.828
That made me do a 
little double take, 

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:06.819
but again, it's because the grapefruit 
just didn't do any better than placebo.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:11.469
Other studies have found a legitimate 
cholesterol lowering benefit, 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.657
especially eating red as 
opposed to white grapefruits, 

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:17.280
and even a little dip 
in triglycerides. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.618
This was one grapefruit 
a day for 30 days, 

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:21.140
but as you can 
see though, 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.406
they went from one life-threatening 
cholesterol level 

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:26.260
to another life-threatening 
cholesterol level. 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.044
To prevent heart disease, 
you really have to get down 

00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:33.902
to a total cholesterol 
of around 150, 

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:35.501
the average cholesterol of those

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:39.108
eating diets composed
exclusively of plant foods,

00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:42.070
not just grapefruits.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.990
Even though grapefruits 
alone don't do much, 

00:01:44.998 --> 00:01:47.270
the researchers suggest that 
people might be more likely 

00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:49.880
to stick with them than 
cholesterol lowering drugs,

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:51.990
noting that most people 
with heart disease 

00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:54.360
stop taking their statin drugs
 within a couple years 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.230
because of the adverse
 side effects. 

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:59.900
Whereas grapefruit alone 
don't have any side-effects,

00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:03.250
but, ironically, combine 
grapefruits and drugs together 

00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:08.080
and you can make drug 
side-effects even worse.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.360
Now, hopefully if you eat lots 
of fruits and veggies

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:12.080
you won't need a 
lot of drugs, 

00:02:12.085 --> 00:02:14.590
but certain phytochemicals 
in plants 

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:18.190
can affect the metabolism 
of drugs in the body,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.160
and grapefruit is 
the poster child, 

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:24.120
described as a pharmacologist's 
nightmare. 

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:27.560
Natural phytochemicals in 
grapefruit suppress 

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.110
the enzymes that help 
clear more than half 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.560
of commonly 
prescribed drugs, 

00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:36.920
and so less drug clearance means 
higher drug levels in the body.

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:41.470
Now, this may be good if you 
want a better caffeine buzz 

00:02:41.474 --> 00:02:42.990
from your 
morning coffee, 

00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:45.530
or your doctor wants 
to help you save 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.070
thousands of dollars boosting the 
effects of expensive drugs, 

00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:51.520
instead of just peeing 
them down the toilet. 

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:56.670
But higher drug levels may mean 
higher risk of side effects. 

00:02:56.674 --> 00:03:00.960
Women taking the pill are at 
higher risk of blood clots,

00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:04.910
particularly, perhaps if they 
have been consuming grapefruit. 

00:03:04.914 --> 00:03:06.900
Taking the pill with 
grapefruit may

00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:10.270
increase blood 
concentrations by 137%. 

00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:14.110
If suppressing our drug 
clearance enzymes

00:03:14.114 --> 00:03:18.830
with grapefruit juice elevates 
level of ingested estrogen,

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:21.470
what might it be doing to 
our own estrogen levels?

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.390
This study, associating 
grapefruit consumption

00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:27.750
with breast cancer freaked 
out the medical community, 

00:03:27.753 --> 00:03:30.550
but subsequent studies on 
even larger groups of women 

00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:33.030
found no evidence 
of a link, 

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:35.620
and in fact if anything, 
the Harvard Nurse's Study

00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:39.610
a decreased risk of the 
scariest breast cancer type, 

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:41.700
so it doesn't look 
like one has to worry 

00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:44.220
about grapefruit affecting 
our natural chemistry, 

00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:47.240
but for those prescribed 
unnatural chemistries,

00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:51.050
it may be a good idea to discontinue 
grapefruit consumption 

00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:55.060
for 72 hours before use of a 
drug that may interact with it. 

00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:57.500
If you don't want to give 
up your grapefruit, 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.520
you can ask your 
doctor about switching 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.080
from one of the grapefruit 
affected drugs like Lipitor 

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:10.160
to one of the citrus-proof 
alternatives.
