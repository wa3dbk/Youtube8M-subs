00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Welcome back, Internet people.
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Hi!

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.180
&gt;&gt; RYAN: It's Mario Party.
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: 2.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.399
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Right here, right here. Listen to
the music.

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:15.360
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Look at that fat bastard.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.100
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Isn't this awesome?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.870
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Oh my god, he's going to take my
star!

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.551
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Oh, he stole your item.
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Oh my god, he took my item AND

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:25.551
my star!

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:31.480
&gt;&gt; RYAN: That asshole.
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: I was right in front! Oh my fucking

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480
god!

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.389
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Ohh! Total Mario Party syndrome.
Seriously.

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:41.370
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Oh my god. I can't believe that
happened. On the last turn.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.249
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Of all the turns. But it's OK because
we get to see, uh...

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:51.990
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: The cock knocker. He cocks knocks.
Or knocks cocks. That's what that means. I

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.870
just got that just now.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.510
[laughs]

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:05.010
Oh no. This is too much Mario Party.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.420
I'm just having a blast.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.570
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Mario Party is the greatest way to
spend a Friday night.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:22.170
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Oh boy, I got a 10. It's sure going
to help me get that star that's nowhere near

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.530
here. Come up short. Ooh, we get to battle
for more coins. Great.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.530
[laughs]

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.320
That's what I need right now.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:38.869
&gt;&gt; RYAN: You can battle for all 14 of his
coins. Look at that. 10, seriously? You're

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.560
such a wuss.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.060
Geez, you raped him.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.110
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Aw, yeah. Donkey Kong.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.659
&gt;&gt; RYAN: He always seems really happy and
he has this face when he like wins something,

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.579
he gets this face and he looks kind of like
a really happy dog.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.700
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: That what he is to you. A dog.
Don't you know that monkeys are people too?

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.270
&gt;&gt; RYAN: No, I don't think that they are.
Ehh.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.190
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: You have just had no luck on that
bridge.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.850
&gt;&gt; RYAN: This is like the fourth time I've
gotten knocked off this bridge and there's

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.850
video evidence.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:30.209
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: I know the first time I did it
to you as well as me.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.020
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Seriously.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.650
Bob-omb Barrage.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.410
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: So what do you think we should
do for our next Let's Play?

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.130
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I don't know. Pickles. We should
do pickles.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.030
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Pickles.
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Yes. I don't know how to play this.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.530
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Maybe we should let the people
in the comments section decide.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.251
&gt;&gt; RYAN: How do I throw it?
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: I don't know.

00:02:55.251 --> 00:03:00.361
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Oh, OK. It's the stick. You pull
back.

00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:04.180
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Oh, wow. I wish I had known that.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.340
&gt;&gt; RYAN: It's OK. Wario'll probably get her.
Oh no, I did!

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.960
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Nice.
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I rule.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.180
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Oh boy! More coins.
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Yeah! I totally needed those.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.620
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: I am the coin baron.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.200
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Jesus Christ.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.870
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: 254. Do you know how much stars
I could buy? Oh, look at this. Drumrolls.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.530
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Drumrolls. You guys all suck except
for-

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.530
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: We got to read these! This is important.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.530
&gt;&gt; RYAN: OK, "Now, I'll award the BONUS stars!
The following players shall receive one star

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.790
for extra performance."

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.140
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: And now I'll go. "First is the
mini game star. This award goes to the player

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.460
that collects the most coins in mini games."

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.560
&gt;&gt; RYAN: "The mini game star award goes to...
WARIOOOOO!"

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:06.400
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Aw haw haw haw. "Next is the coin
star award-"

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Oh god. Who cares?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.450
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: OK, I got it.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.860
&gt;&gt; RYAN: OK, so for the people who haven't
played Mario Party: 1. You just need to go

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.870
redo your childhood from scratch, but yeah
we get stars for bullshit.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.680
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: I don't know what you're talking
about. Mario Party's the worst part of my

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680
life.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.950
&gt;&gt; RYAN: No. Uh oh! The big secret treasure
has been found. See, this is why this game

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.420
was awesome. It had, like stuff like this.
None of the other games had stuff like this.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.100
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Didn't... Mario Party 2 didn't?

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.410
&gt;&gt; RYAN: No, Mario Party 3 had that thing
where you like stood on stars and you like

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.410
flew into the sky.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.880
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Oh, well we know that the only
three... Like, these three were average games,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.880
one, two and three and the rest were horrible.
Wario! Tally-ho, Wario.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.350
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Does that mean he won? I think that
means he won.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.460
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: He won. How did you not know that?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.250
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I wasn't... I haven't been paying
any attention whatsoever. Oh, he's an impertinent

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.250
fool.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.380
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Arrgh, impertent fool. I'm Wario!

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.700
Ouch.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.840
&gt;&gt; RYAN: That smarts. That's pretty violent,
actually.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.000
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Did you see how big the sword in
the background was? Just how drastically bigger

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.740
than Wario it was?

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.130
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I did not.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.620
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Wario is the superstar of pirate
land. Jesus Christ.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.940
And the rest.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.120
&gt;&gt; RYAN: You know...

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.800
You know, it's funny. These pirate outfits
make everyone look really, really gay. Including

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.610
Peach. Seriously. Look at her, she's like
a raging lesbian.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.210
Oh, we got coins.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.940
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Yeah, I wonder where those came
from.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.780
You should thank me for that.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.639
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Gee, thanks. We can use them for
the powers of evil.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.310
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: And pirates.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.770
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Did we just convert all- Did we just
melt down our stars into coins?

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.310
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Yeah, like the bank.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:36.980
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Because, seriously think about that.
OK? Those stars can talk and they have eyes,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.750
so that's...

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.750
Yeah.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.750
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Yeah.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.699
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Anyway, Internet people, that was
Let's Play Mario Party 2.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:56.310
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Mario Party 2. I hope you... were
tortured as much as I was.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.860
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I enjoyed myself inappropriately.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:08.990
So now I've got video footage of Toad raping
a boat, I'm going to go... do something. We'll

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.490
see you guys later, Internet people.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.780
&gt;&gt; CHIPPS: Adios.
