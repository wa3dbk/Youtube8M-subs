Hi, my name is Kip and I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village. In this clip we are going

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.170
to see how we mix and create the proper consistency
for our cinnamon roll dough. With all of our

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.220
ingredients in our bowl we would start the
kitchen aide just slow. Then let the liquid

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.410
portion and the dry portion start to combine.
If we start off too fast then we would have

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:48.870
an explosion of flour and we don't want that.
(mixing ingredients in the mixture) Sometimes

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.990
I lift the bowl just a little bit to help
it pick up a little bit more because the dough

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:04.809
hook does not come in contact with the bottom
of the bowl.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.580
Once the dough starts to pick up then it will
clean down to the bottom of our bowl. As you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:23.700
can see there it is beginning to pick up nicely.
You can now see that it is starting to pick

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:36.520
up.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:50.310
At this point I would speed up to may be a
four settings and let it pick up the rest

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.810
to sling the dough out. You don't want it
really hard the dough very long. Then I would

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:15.709
bring it back down to two and let it just
knead the dough for a while. If we stop the

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:26.889
machine and feel the dough it is still a little
bit cool but it is not tacky. So in that we

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:34.329
are looking for is a dough that does not stick
to our skin but it is still pliable. So not

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.739
too firm. If it is was sticky then we would
add a little bit more flour but it looks like

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:47.670
we probably got about the right amount of
flour first time around. We would go ahead

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.410
and let that knead for a little longer until
it has cleaned up a good portion of the dough

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.609
on the sides. That is another way that you
can tell that if it is too wet the dough would

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:03.180
continue to stick to the side and will not
start to clean up. It will not also be added

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:13.400
to the dough. I will just let it knead, the
dough with this dough hook for about five

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:23.000
minutes or so it is very well mixed and the
yeast will begin to warm. Because the friction

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.989
of the hook and the dough will begin to rise.
