00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.740
Hey everybody, so today I am reviewing Lenny
Kravitz new album called Strut.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.230
I wasn't a huge fan of Black and White America,
it wasn't my favourite Lenny album, but it

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.429
did have one or two songs i really liked,
so I was a little skeptical when this album

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.429
was coming out.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.950
But I just want to say that overall it's actually
a really good.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.950
album.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.950
It's really quite well varied.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.789
There's quite a bit of variation from stuff
like the 70's it feels like to some songs

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.800
that feel like they've got an 80s vibe.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.449
To some stuff that's a bit slower and a little
more ballady like we've heard from a lot of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.449
other songs.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.180
So what I am going to do is break down each
track.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.380
There's about 11 or 12 tracks.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.920
I am just going to go track by track and tell
you what my thoughts are on those tracks.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.570
So the first track is sex, which i think is
one of the tracks he teased and put on the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.630
internet before the album came out.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.950
Its actually a pretty good track, it's got
an 80s vibe to it.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.950
The next song is the lead single off the album
and I think he performed it on America's Got

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.920
Talent yesterday.And it's called the Chamber
and it wasn't really my favourite song when

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.920
I first heard it.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.780
It took me a little more listening to it quite
a few more times before I started liking the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.190
song, but you know what I really like the
song after listening to it quite a few times

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.100
and after seeing him perform it live.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.230
It's got this really great bass line to it,
which is the most memorable part of the song.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.890
The lyrics are a little repetitive and there's
really not much going on with the drums.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.159
That bass line is really great.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.020
The next song is Dirty White Boots.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.520
It's got a really cool drum beat throughout
the whole song.It's sort of the same drum

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.990
beat that's played throughout the whole song.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.659
It's like a tom fill they are doing.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.920
There's also some really cool guitar work
and the harmonies are really good too.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.350
I think it can't be stated enough that Lenny's
guitarist Craig Ross I think is one of the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.140
most underrated guitarists out there.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.740
I am a huge fan of his work and I think the
more we can hear of him on Lenny's albums

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.340
the better because he really brings that emotional
vibe when you listen to Slash play the slower

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.460
songs in Guns N' Roses.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.729
His guitar playing sort of reminds me of that.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.520
The next song is called New York City.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.520
New York City pretty much pays homage to New
York City.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.900
It kind of reminds me of the song that Alicia
Keys and Jay-Z did a couple years ago Empire

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.900
State of Mind.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.900
It's a really great song.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.340
It's got a great funky kind of vibe to it
and don't be surprised if you start seeing

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.069
this song in tourism ad's for New York City
because really that's what the song feels

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.389
like when you're listening to it.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.049
The next song is Pleasure and Pain.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:37.400
I think overall it's an okay song, it's got
an interesting horn section to it, and really

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.799
what's quite interesting is that for some
reason this song reminds me of certain parts

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.549
of the Led Zepplin song Kashmir.

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.249
I dunno what it is, but there's a certain
part of the song that reminds me of the song.

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:55.790
And then probably my favourite song on the
whole album is Strut, which is also the name

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.439
of the album.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.150
but it's probably my favourite song on the
album it's got this really great funky instrumental

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.200
vibe to it, the lyrics are really good and
I feel like this should have been the lead

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200
single released off the album.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.909
That being said it'll probably be the second
or third single, I wouldn't be surprised.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.349
The next song after that is a song called
She's a Beast.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.739
It's a more chilled, much more relaxed kind
of song.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.700
I feel like the first half of the album is
much more up-tempo music, a little more funky

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.480
and more faster paced, and the second half
of the album is a little more slower, a little

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.309
more chilled and I'd say it's a little more
stripped down.

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.370
She's a beast is a really good song.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.639
There's a great mix of acoustic and electric
guitars on the album and I think this is another

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.400
song that shows how awesome Craig Ross is
as a guitarist.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.459
The next song is called Frankenstein and the
thing that's really this interesting with

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.669
this song and the one thing I couldn't get
off my mind when I was listening to it is

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.079
that it's got a Red Hot Chili Peppers funky
vibe to it.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.409
Now I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers so this
is another really good song off the album.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.620
And also it's got a really good sax solo on
it.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.659
It's one of my other favourite songs off the
album

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.169
The song after that is called I'm a Believer.

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.319
And I keep saying this there's always comparisons
to other songs.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.610
You can tell this albums been inspired by
a number of different bands whether it's Zepplin

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.669
or the Chili Peppers.

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.699
This song I'm a Believer reminds me a little
bit of the song Footloose by Kenny Loggins

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.400
if you've ever heard of that song.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.610
Just the riff in it for some reason they sound
very similar, although I think the riff for

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.620
the bass sounds like the guitar in footloose.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.620
But it's also one of the best songs on the
album as well.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.400
As you can see there's a lot of great songs
on this album.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.880
There's a couple of songs I didn't really
care for, but overall it's a great album.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.550
The next song is called Oh Baby baby.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.479
It reminds me a bit of a song called Since
I don't have you.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:05.020
Guns N' Roses covered this song on their 1993
covers album the Spaghetti Incident? but it

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.439
was originally sang by, I can't remember the
name of the band but they were a band from

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.260
the 50's it was a doo wap kind of song.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.919
It's got a similar kind of vibe to Since I
don't Have You.

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.760
It's another really good song.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.250
Happy Birthday is another song on the album.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.220
I don't know what it is with artists doing
birthday songs.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.940
You've got Katy Perry birthday songs, you've
got the Beatles doing birthday songs and now

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.550
Lenny Kravitz.is doing one.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.440
As an instrumental track it's really great,
but I just found the lyrics were a little

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.949
silly and not as good as the rest of the album.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.250
Although it'll be really interesting when
he goes on tour maybe he'll grab somebody

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.500
out of the audience and sing the song just
like Katy Perry does at her concerts.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500
And the last song is called I never Want to
Let You Down.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.909
It's a really good song.

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.629
It's got some really great horns on it and
you know that summarizes my review of Strut.

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.120
I thought it was a great album.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.340
I'd probably give it 4/5 stars.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.430
To me it was so much better than Black and
White America.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.570
And it's really so far one of my favourite
albums I've listened to this year.
