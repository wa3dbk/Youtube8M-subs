00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:18.045
It was a bit windy when I was leaving Glasgow, but this is crazy...

00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:40.607
I am going to stalk bottom of the plantation and edge of 
 the big trees that should be sheltered from the wind

00:00:48.605 --> 00:01:00.605
The plantation borders motorway on one side

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:11.507
I dont have much hope to see any deer today

00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:20.565
But at the last light I see two roe deer

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:31.355
I can see it is a buck and young doe, 
 but a bit too dark for the camera

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:42.010
Even after color grading cant see them on footage... 

00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:50.830
She was quartering away and shot behind the shoulder

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.870
Exit wound at the front

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:24.720
Minox binos and scope worked well at the last 
 light, very pleased with the glass quality
