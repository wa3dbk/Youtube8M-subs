Hello &amp; Welcome to Archana's Rasoi! Today I will show you how-to make garlic chutney.

00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:12.771
Earlier, I have shown you chutney's made from wet coconut.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.803
I have also shown you'll how-to make rice bhakris and the chutney that I am going to make today is best served with that. 

00:00:17.364 --> 00:00:21.604
Or even with bread. But to know how 
 it's made, keep watching Archana's Rasoi! 

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:27.164
So let's have a look at the ingredients required to make this chutney.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:41.773
1 cup dry grated coconut, 10-12 dry red chillies, 1 small cup sesame seeds, 4-5 onions of garlic and salt according to taste.    

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:43.603
Let's start making the chutney.

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:49.925
I am going to roast the dry grated coconut, 
 dry red chillies and sesame seeds. 

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:08.926
I am adding 1 cup dry grated coconut, taken from 
1 whole coconut. Then add, 1 cup sesame seeds.

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:17.045
And now I am adding dry red chillies, incase you 
 feel you want to add 2-3 more, you can.

00:01:18.643 --> 00:01:25.540
Now I am going to roast all these ingredients well together. After which I will put this in the mixer and grind it with garlic cloves. 

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:29.127
So let's roast these properly now.

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.680
Now that the ingredients are done roasting, I am turning off the gas, putting it in the mixer and grinding it.

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.480
While grinding it, I will add salt and garlic cloves.

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:49.010
Now I am putting this in a mixer. 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.890
I am adding garlic cloves and salt according to taste.

00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:09.840
Now I am going to grind the ingredients.

00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:24.030
Grind this, till it turns into a coarse powder. 

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.680
Let's check if it's done. 

00:02:37.604 --> 00:02:45.200
It's important to keep stirring the mixture in intervals because no water is being added to it.

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:57.320
Let's check if this is ready. 

00:03:00.334 --> 00:03:07.600
Remember, the chutney should be coarse. I am going to serve it now.

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:29.560
The garlic chutney is ready now. I have already made this at home today and the menu is going to be bhakri, pithla and onions teamed with this chutney.   

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:34.120
I know, my intelligent audience has already subscribed to India Food Network. 

00:03:34.575 --> 00:03:40.770
I am also aware, that there are many variations in this chutney, but I want you'll to give me your feedback, till the keep watching Archana's Rasoi!
