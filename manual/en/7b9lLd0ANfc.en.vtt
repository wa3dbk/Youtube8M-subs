this girl that i was soared into like a
sort of friendship sort of more

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.720
uh... and then we became friends on
facebook later on and i went back

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.760
through like the last week our senses of
the first it seemed that because what

also use social media smart way hang out
with a collection of god

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.040
whether women you had a really sinking
claim the better that donna right way

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.020
and they're roommates utter the words
that yeah they might notice that don't

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.580
do that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.180
exactly just

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.820
i've actually had people like moved
stuff around the dorm as i said freshman

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.260
year as a four people total

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.270
what more space that you got to talk
about other people think that we seek in

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.480
lego he's been gone for tendencies are
the missus beds upside of this on the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.270
road and dot

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.290
i think it like it's gonna have a
conversation with your lead to formulate

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.790
the girls element now are super chill
and we had a conversation and within

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.750
that was like honestly

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.570
use my stuff emai food move it around

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.520
and capitalism you've got any of that
time

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.230
so this is a good thing not just for a
tuition but you want to get there early

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.340
season claim the better side basically
yakima most people think about that

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.850
makes a deal introduce yourself to hold
it until it uses of this technical

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.140
trying to make absolutely nothing roads
even touristy but it's the itenary that

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.679
of but like this is the same for winner
did that but

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.739
faithfully one of the guys in my dorm
just came down and introduced himself to

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.669
our client basically and we all went and
played symbolic ball and that we made a

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:21.050
huge group it's certainly like dueled
over the course freshman year but

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.130
it seems to suggest going around
introducing yourself like most people

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.810
are

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.900
a little bit shy were there to do it for
the first time so whether you're going

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.339
to be sure are starting school like

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.750
beaches the it's been a cat president

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.980
everybody's in the same bell everybody
selling justice shy and awkward as you

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.020
probably are suggests

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.910
needle in a break i think if you look at
what i think you're we're having a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.059
communist what about the one that did
not know how the fumes

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:45.219
