00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.210
To clean a freshwater fish tank, when we say
cleaning, we probably mean maintaining.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.059
You want to clean your tank once a week, every
two weeks, once a month, depending on how

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.279
dirty it is, how many fish, and how much you
feed.

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.330
Every tank is going to be a little bit different,
but the cleaning methods are pretty much the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.330
same.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.320
The goal of cleaning an aquarium is to get
a lot of the waste out of the water with minimal

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.560
shock to the environment.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.440
Remember, there is bacteria that's growing
in the filter, on the sand bed, and even on

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.590
the glass and decorations in the aquarium.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.989
You want to minimize the shock to this bacteria
because this bacteria is what's responsible

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.579
for keeping your water safe for your fish.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.890
It's constantly growing and breaking down
waste.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.059
It's breaking down ammonia and nitrite and
keeping that water really, really clean and

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.059
safe for the fish.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.899
When we go in there, we clean it and we change
half the water and our filter, we're shocking

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:53.899
the system.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.859
We could almost do more harm than good by
cleaning our fish tanks.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.639
The key is really to do regular maintenance,
not to wait until the tank gets really, really

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:04.980
dirty, the filtration stops working, and the
water is really cloudy.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.090
That's when you're going to be setting yourself
up for a disaster after you clean the tank.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.149
I've seen many people when they clean their
aquarium, the water is cloudy for a week or

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.510
two after that because the bacteria is so
shocked.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.450
To clean your aquarium, you want to do regular
water changes.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.530
I recommend 15 to 20 percent every two to
four weeks, again, depending on the stocking

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.090
density of your aquarium.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.189
You want to invest in a good gravel cleaner,
a siphon, a bucket, a good algae pad, and

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.479
some test kits and dechlorinators.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.299
You want to change the water.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.340
As you're taking 15 to 20% of the water out,
you want to go through the sand bed or the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.229
gravel bed very, very slowly and remove a
lot of the waste that has been settled in

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.229
that gravel.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.539
You'd be amazed at what gets trapped in the
gravel.

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.979
It's really, in my opinion, your best filter,
your gravel bed.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.740
You want to free that up, get a lot of the
waste out.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.359
Flush it down the toilet.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.289
Make sure you don't dump any gravel down the
toilet or you're going to have to call a plumber.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.729
When you put new water back in the aquarium,
you want to make sure the pH and the temperature

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.729
is stable.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.369
It's good to let water sit overnight so it
has a change to degas.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.990
A pH test kit and some pH up, pH down, whether
in liquid or in dry powder form will be beneficial

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.070
to help getting the pH back to where it is.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.630
You want to match the pH to what it was in
the aquarium.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.270
The main thing is to not shock your aquarium.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.750
If you haven't done a water change in a while,
make sure your pH of the new water matches

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.110
your existing water.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.080
What that means is your pH could be as low
as 6.5 even though it's supposed to be at

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.080
7.0.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.610
The new water is probably going to be 7.4
to 7.6.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.320
You'll shock the aquarium by putting high
pH water, so you want to bring the pH down

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.300
in the new water before adding it.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.880
As far as your filtration, you want to clean
the filtration in a manner that's not going

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.310
to shock the bacteria, cleaning the filters
in water from the aquarium in a bucket.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.900
Even in the dirty water, you can squeeze out
your filtration and then put it back in.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.190
Replace the carbon, that's going to keep the
water free from getting a lot of organics

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.440
and yellow.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.910
Again, don't shock it and do it regularly.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.920
Those are the best practices.
