To finish with, let's test Photoshop CS4, as I've been asked to many times.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:19.722
Here is a big image of a very pretty Airbus A380.

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:30.555
I'm going to paste it in a new Photoshop document with a 300 dpi resolution.

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.322
Done, let's see what we have once in 100%,

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:55.458
and we'll see that there's a graphic acceleration offered by the GMA 3150.

00:00:56.665 --> 00:01:03.401
What do we have practically? The result is quite amazing ge such a processor.

00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:08.840
We can move on the quite big picture without problem.

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:13.832
Of course, it's not as if we had a specialized card,

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:23.016
but for such a device, we don't have any problem of display,

00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:27.904
we can resize it and manipulate it without problem.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:33.713
So we are really able to do amazing stuffs.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.082
Obviously, all the filters will be a bit slow.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:47.469
If I make a quite important radial blur, it will be calculated rather quickly

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:54.998
considering the size of the image and the integrated processor.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.213
It works quite well for a netbook.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:31.133
Let's see another program now: ArtRage. We've already presented it.

00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:36.122
It's the version 3, with some improvements.

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:58.544
Among its tools, there's one which enables to stretch again the line you've just drawn.

00:03:02.793 --> 00:03:21.470
It's generally something quite long to be calculated on a program, and it works very nicely here.

00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:32.308
Of course, the other tools can also be used, there's not much latency.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:50.763
But with other tools mixing colors, it's more delicate, you have to proceed by little touches.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:00.626
That's with the Atom N450. We can imagine what will happen with a 1.83-GHz Atom N470.

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:07.423
It shouldn't be much different.

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:17.595
There's a very good combination of performance and autonomy

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:20.844
with this new-generation Atom processor.
