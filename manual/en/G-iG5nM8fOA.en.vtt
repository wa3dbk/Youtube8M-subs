00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
Hello! Good to be back, it's lovely. I am
South African but I do live in New Zealand.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.780
I just got married to my
long-term girlfriend because it's legal now.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.119
We've got marriage equality, it's not
great. I'm against it. I didn't think we

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.399
should ever have gotten it, because it
takes away the great excuse.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.240
Because I never wanted to get married but I've been with my partner for seven years and that's gay years.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.540
You know in straight years it's
about 48.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.740
*crowd laughs*

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.860
It's a very long time and you know what women are like always nagging about something.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.740
So as soon as we started dating she would go we should get married and I'd go I'd love to but it's not legal.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.460
If you want me to do illegal shit why don't I just open a meth lab?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.040
*crowd laughs*

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.580
At least that way we'll make new friends, get some extra cash. I'll lose some weight.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.100
*crowd laughs*

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.870
See there's a silver lining to everything. Am I right? And I think the big thing why

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.300
I didn't want to get married is not
because you know I have commitment issues.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.640
It's just simply too expensive
and everything just goes up in price.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
Like you walk into a cake shop you see a
beautiful 3 tiered cake, you go that's nice I'll have that.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.600
They go that's fifty dollars. You
go that's amazing. For a wedding cake??

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.490
Oh a wedding cake, that's five hundred dollars.
So I ordered the cake.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.070
A three-tiered lemon cake, beautiful cake right? I sampled everything in that shop.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.150
Three weekends in a row. I ordered the cake but see this is the thing.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.830
You pay for stuff you didn't
even know were things.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.920
The little cake toppers that you get on top of the cake,  the little plastic bride and groom that sits on top

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.440
of a normal wedding that
Jesus approves of.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.880
So see there's a big gap in the market, you don't get the two brides or the two grooms.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.480
So I've been to gay weddings where they've gone we need two brides and then all those old b*tches do

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.400
is cut the groom's off two of those and then super glue the bride's together.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.580
Not so they line up just so they're together

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.780
And I thought I don't want that
for my wedding. I want something nice so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.900
I ordered the cake and didn't say anything
about my husband having a weird name like Julie.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.340
*crowd laughs*

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.000
And I went to another lady to make cake toppers for us but I didn't know how good this woman was.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.980
How much skill she has. When I went back to pick up the cake toppers

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.160
it was so realistic mine had back fat on it.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.980
*crowd laughs*

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.720
That thing weighed six kilograms!

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.580
Like I can't have this on my cake. When halfway through the ceremony I'm gonna look over and go

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.040
Oh where the f*ck am I? And it's
only when we go to cut the cake that we

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.129
realise I've sunken to the second tier.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.340
*crowd laughs*

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.780
So I said that to the cake topper lady. I said I'm worried about the lemon cakes.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.800
She says, go talk to your cake lady. Sort it out. Get her to make it strong.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.340
I said alright.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.030
I went back to the cake lady. I said
we're gonna have to fix this cake I

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.510
need a strong cake. There's a heavy cake
topper coming and that's just me the

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.200
wife's not even on it yet. So she looks at
me, she goes well we can always make it a fruitcake.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.580
We can't make it a fruitcake, because I
don't eat fruit cake cause I'm not a hundred years old.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.920
Because I don't know what
happens with old people but the older they get

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.120
the more their anus muscle relaxes, they go now I need the heaviest cake in the world.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.150
You guys have been amazing. Enjoy your
Festival. Thank you so much.
