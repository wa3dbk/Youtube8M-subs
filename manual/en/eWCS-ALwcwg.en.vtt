00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.200
First off we will go ahead and take off the
dust cap.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.380
In this case it is a bearing buddy.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.800
Next is taking out the locking pin, the cotter
pin that goes through the center here.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:29.090
Once you have that lock washer off, just go
ahead and take off the nut and pull your whole

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.090
hub off.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.610
Now we are going to go ahead and inspect the
hub and bearings here.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.280
Take off the bearings on the outside and just
wipe them down really good to clean them up.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.530
When you get down the the rollers here you
want to make sure there are not any chips

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.480
or discoloration.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.100
Wear marks are fine as long as they are slight,
but you do not want any discoloration what

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.100
so ever.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.180
When that is all good take a look at the outside
cage itself, make sure it is not dented up

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.239
or anything like that.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.659
When you them they can get dented up pretty
easy and you will need to get a new bearing.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.310
Clean them up really good, get all the grease
out of it, you do not want to mix two different

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.000
types of greases together.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.569
What happens is that the grease can deteriorate
faster than normal or not have the same wear

00:01:14.569 --> 00:02:45.349
properties as pure grease, so 
it is always good idea to get as much out

00:02:45.349 --> 00:03:57.269
of 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:11.049
there 
and 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:48.800
start 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:03.280
with 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:25.380
fresh grease.
