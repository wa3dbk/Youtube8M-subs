00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.240
The U.S. geological survey has done a study
into fecal matter human fecal matter raw sewage

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.820
and whether or not that raw sewage can become
profitable now it's profitable in a very unexpected

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.670
way apparently there are precious metal in
our poo and the researchers want to extract

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.030
those precious metals and possibly use them
as profit so let me give you an example it's

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.570
absolutely insane according to an eight year
study by the U.S. geological survey they found

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.870
that levels of precious metals in feces was
comparable with those found in some commercial

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.850
mines what holy crap OK you're the worse alright
trace amount of metals are found in cosmetics

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.149
shampoos and even clothes some food and drinks
also now contain flakes of gold and silver

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.400
so you consume these precious metals often
time unwittingly they are you know taken out

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.670
of your body by the natural process and then
they end up in the sewage systems and also

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.700
a lot of people lose jewelry when they accidently
throw it down the drain OK and so they're

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
thinking the researchers in this case are
thinking why are we just going to leave these

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.799
precious metals behind why don't we find a
way to exact them previous research estimated

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.829
the waste from one million Americans could
contain as much as 8.7 million pounds worth

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.829
of metals you sometimes they so oh well you're
shit don't stink like no no no you don't understand

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.259
my shit no only doesn't stink it's full of
gold full of gold I've got golden poo this

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.679
is amazing man you know you always hear the
stories about the dollar bills like 98% percent

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.869
have cocaine on them like how the hell did
that happen cause they just keep getting recirculated

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:56.509
etc. but I did and so this is amazing because
you know there's the oldest science was alchemy

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.719
where they tried to turn non-precious metals
into precious metals metal that isn't worth

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.989
that much and turn it into gold little did
they know they actually could turn shit into

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:14.660
gold yep we have mastered the greatest form
of alchemy so here's the question is there

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.190
a good way an efficient way to extract the
precious metals from the human waste and also

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.970
aside from the precious that you'll obtain
from doing this there's another upside you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.660
will be able to use the human waste as fertilizer
and it won't be harmful to the environment

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.360
cause the metals sometimes hurt whatever you
put the fertilizer in yeah so it's a win win

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.760
for everybody the question is can you do it
efficiently enough obviously you've got to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.430
do it on a mass scale so don't dig into tonight
I've found there's gold in these hills don't

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.560
do that so but maybe scientists can figure
out a way to actually just make things a little

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.900
bit more efficient and find a filtering process
where we get the gold and the better fertilizer

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.790
right and it's not just gold it's platinum
silver other precious metals so that's good

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.530
news often times when we talk about scientists
I get a little jealous because they're so

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.180
incredibly intelligent and a lot of them are
innovative and they do so many great things

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.090
for society but these researchers that I'm
not jealous of I have no interest in that

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.040
I have no interesting in looking for gold
in poop you're right cause all day long got

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.960
to be dealing with poop they've got to be
like hey Bob what'd you find OK you want to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.100
check this out like you know what they go
into work and they think it's alright shit

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.260
happens shit happens I feel like you already
did that joke no I didn't I had it my back

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.540
pocket well you nailed it Cenk
