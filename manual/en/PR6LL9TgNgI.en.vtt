00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.070
Here I am painting the bike. It had gold,
a lot of gold on it, and it didn't look really

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.320
cool. So I took everything off but the engine,
and the chain, and that's all inside this

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:26.320
bag here and the ignition box and some cords,
but, I took everything off, the wheels, fenders,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.840
cargo rack, didn't take off the chain guard
for the, the other side

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.840
the bike chain didn't come off, the pedals
were purple, so i'm painting those,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.370
um, and, there's something pretty cool, you
can see it's really shiny, i hope it dries

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.890
so it's shiny. Painted the handlebars and
everything. I just took the spray can, the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190
spray paint, and just went over the whole
thing, so

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.110
It's drying now, and i'm going to flip it,
and paint the other side,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.250
this is the seat from my mom's bike, it's
the comfy seat. I'll have to get a better

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.379
one that looks cool[laugh], and all the parts
are all over the place here i have a wheel

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:15.379
here, fenders here, parts up here, cargo rack
and a wheel here, so.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.709
 But this is going to look a lot better once I paint it.

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:25.700
Here's a little cool view of the bike. It's
going to be all black, which is cool, except

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:35.700
for the engine, and the seat, and the chrome,
like the wheels and the cargo rack and the fenders.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.000
It's pretty cool.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:47.170
Here's the bike, it's completely painted,
and I added a vinyl sticker to my gas tank,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.950
it's an "S" for Stevo, it's pretty cool, shiny
orange, I put the flame seat back on, cause

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.450
it looks pretty cool, and I painted the entire
bike black, which looks pretty cool

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.450
The top half of it was gold, which didn't
look to good, the handlebars were silver,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.360
and the pedals were purple, I don't know if
the paint is going to stick to the pedals

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:26.360
very good. But I painted a couple layers of
black paint on, painted the chain guard too,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:36.320
which was ugly. So now, it looks a lot better.
Everyting matches, which is good, except for

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.610
that blue sticker. And also it's a lot more
rust proof which will be nice

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.530
I've been driving it a lot, I'm almost on
my, almost finished my second gas tank, so

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:58.530
i'll be able to drive it really fast, cause
it's about broken in, and, there's my bike kit.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.200
