On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Libby
Caldwell and I'm here to tell you about watercolor

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:15.040
journaling. The next thing you might want
to add is a pencil. This is a retractable

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:23.340
pencil. And then after that you might want
to just add a few colors. Now, for easiness,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.150
I teach this class using watercolor pencils,
which is the same as this kind of watercolor,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.080
which is in a box with a brush and palette,
but it's in pencil form, so you can take your

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.460
brush--your watercolor brush here--take some
color off the end, and paint. You don't have

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.440
to worry about a palette. You can also just
sketch with this on the paper and add the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.690
water. If you have a bit more space, you might
want to start putting a few colors in something

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:04.070
like this, and so you can use... These are
Faber pastel pencils, and this is a set that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.409
I use. And I don't use it in a tin when I'm
on the go. I take the pencils out, and what

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:21.359
I've done is just cut away a little bit extra
of the wood so I have more of the color exposed,

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.020
because when you're using it you want to be
able to rub the end of the brush onto the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.259
color, and if there's more color exposed,
it's easier. So, these are typically put into

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:44.810
a pencil case with my little watercolor brush,
my pencil and my black pen. If I need extra

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.310
water I just use one of these, put water in
it, and it's great because you unscrew it

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.959
and you've got a little container here that
you can pour water into, to rinse your brush

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:04.279
or add extra water to your painting. So, I
can put one of those in there as well. And

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:14.079
then I can add one of these very fine Micron
pens. I use the black one and it's the 005,

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:21.990
and it's waterproof. And I'll add one of those.
So that would be the next size kit.
