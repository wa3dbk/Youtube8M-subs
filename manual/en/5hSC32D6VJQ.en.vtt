00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.599
How to Make Confetti.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:12.420
Make any occasion more festive with your own
homemade confetti.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.580
You will need Paper Scissors, a hole puncher,
or a paper shredder Anti-static spray Flower

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.500
petals Silica gel crystals Small glassine
bags Double-stick tape Noisemakers Balloons

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.980
A large fan A lint roller and a confetti cannon,
a blower, or a swirl fan.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.980
Step 1.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.019
Gather paper that can be shredded—old newspapers
and magazines, discarded copier paper, used

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.590
gift wrapping, or colored construction paper.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:53.640
If you work in an office, ask coworkers who
use hole punchers to save the little paper

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.709
circles.

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:55.769
Step 2.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.819
Turn paper into confetti with scissors, a
hole puncher, or a paper shredder.

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.699
Craft-supply stores offer decorative hole
punchers that create stars, sequins, hearts,

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.699
and other designs.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:10.590
If you use a paper shredder to make the confetti,
make sure it’s the crosscut kind, which

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.780
cuts paper both vertically and horizontally.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.780
Step 3.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.520
Scoop up the confetti, put it in a paper bag,
and mist it with anti-static spray.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.570
Close the bag, shake it up for a minute, then
open the top to let the confetti air-dry.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.810
This will prevent the confetti from clinging
to your guests’ hair and clothes.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.840
Step 4.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.479
Try making flower confetti: Sprinkle a layer
of silica gel crystals onto the bottom of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.520
an ovenproof dish, cover with flower petals,
and then alternate more layers of silica and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.520
petals.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.340
Heat in a 200-degree oven for about 30 minutes,
and then let cool before gently shaking off

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.200
any silica residue.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.710
If you’re sending party invitations, insert
a tablespoon or so of confetti inside the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.830
card.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.830
Step 5.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.189
Make individual party bags for New Year’s
Eve guests by pouring confetti into small

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:11.100
glassine bags, sealing, and taping a noisemaker
to the top of each.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.230
Step 6.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.940
Stuff some confetti into balloons that guests
can pop.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.290
Just funnel in the confetti before blowing
them up.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.290
Step 7.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.290
Spray confetti over party guests by turning
on a large fan and slowly pouring confetti

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.360
in front of it.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.560
Some party supply stores and websites rent
and sell confetti cannons, blowers, and swirl

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.690
fans.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.690
Step 8.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.000
After vacuuming your floors, pick up any stubborn
confetti with a lint roller.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:07.480
Did you know The largest collection of confetti
in the world contains 1,700 unique shapes,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.419
including pieces that look like Elvis Presley.
