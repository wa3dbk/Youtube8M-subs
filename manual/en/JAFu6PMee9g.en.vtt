00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.469
A Cheaper Xbox One, Macgyver video game, and
news about about the newest call of duty title,

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.469
and Watch Dogs release technical specs for
consoles.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.670
This now on the Curse Weekly Roundup.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.070
Hey everyone Andrew here filling in for Jess
who is currently stuck in traffic in gta 5,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.310
Xbox One will be seeing a price reduction
to $399 in June due to a new package available

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.010
that sell the console without Kinect.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.610
Microsoft says its reasons for the Kinect-less
xbox isn't just to boost says, and that the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.120
80 million plus xbox 360 owners would like
to upgrade but its an affordability issue,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.570
and this is an opportunity to really make
it easier for them to get there.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.820
Along with these chances microsoft has also
announced the removal of the paywall requirement

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.780
for access to streaming apps, meaning you
will no longer need a gold membership to xbox

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.050
live to use popular streaming services such
as Netflix or Hulu and others.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.360
Along with these chances in June comes Microsoft's
games for Gold program which is a program

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.100
that gifts two free games a month to xbox
live gold subscribers also included with the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.280
program are discounts and "a few other surprises."

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.190
The Official MacGyver game is coming out this
month.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.220
No, im not making this up, if you haven't
heard its full title is MacGyver: Deadly Descent

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.010
and will be available on both iOS and Android,
and will return us to his to MacGyvers young

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.030
roots as a problem solver.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.500
Anyone who purchases the game can feel good
about themselves too because a portion of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.490
all sales will go to support the MacGyver
foundation who "aim to encourage and support

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.510
individuals and organizations throughout the
world who utilize self-reliance, non-violence

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.110
and sustainability to improve people's lives."

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.700
Look forward to MacGyvers release on May 21st.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.610
If you missed it last week the official reveal
trailer for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.180
was release on the web and gave the community
a quarter 4 release date of November 4th this

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.180
year.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.730
What we know so far is that all DLC will come
to the Xbox first, the game is seeing an all

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.281
new game engine that will take advantage of
the newest generation of consoles and the

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.030
game is set in the year 2054.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.379
Other new features will we in the game as
well but we are expecting even more information

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.060
about the game in the next few weeks when
E3 arrives.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.660
Watch Dogs release more info about how the
game will run on your platform of choice earlier

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.720
this week.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:26.330
Ubisoft announced that the game will run at
900p at 30fps on PS4 and 792p at 30fps on

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.670
Xbox One.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.790
Creative Director Jonathan Morin stated "Resolution
is a number, just like framerate is a number.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.180
All those numbers are valid aspects of making
games, but you make choices about the experience

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.650
you want to deliver.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.730
In our case, dynamism is everything.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.860
Exploration and expression are everything.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.840
You want to have a steady framerate, but you
want to have dynamism at the core of the experience.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.900
The same goes with resolution."

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.570
Personally if you're super worried about fps
and resolution as a gamer you probably play

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.550
games on PC, where you can control those finitely.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.290
