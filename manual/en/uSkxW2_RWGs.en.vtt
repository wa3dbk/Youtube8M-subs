00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.167
Good morning.

00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.467
It's Kris Gethin speaking here.

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:04.967
I'm gonna show you some
recipes in my kitchen.

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:07.033
Here in India, the
power's just come back on.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.733
It knocks out for a few hours
here in the heat of the summer

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.967
in Hyderabad.

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:13.633
So what I like to do when
I get up in the morning,

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.900
I like to have a protein-packed
iced Americano.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.600
It only takes me about
a minute to do and I'll show you

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.400
how to do that right now.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.033
I've got a sashay
of Starbucks coffee here.

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.200
You can throw in anything
you want, though,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.433
any type of coffee.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.300
I put a little bit
of cinnamon in there.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.167
I love the cinnamon.

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:32.667
I put that on everything.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:35.833
It just adds to it.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:40.300
I put Stevia in
here to sweeten it.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.500
And then the secret ingredient,
instead of putting milk in here,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.767
I add some protein powder.

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.700
So I've got
vanilla protein powder.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.567
It can be casein, it can be
isolate, whatever you want,

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:54.333
but obviously the vanilla will
replace milk and it's obviously

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.100
adding a little bit
of protein in there.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.500
I'll just put a big teaspoon in
there 'cause I get my protein

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.400
requirements in anyway but if
you want to put in like a scoop

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.233
to make this a higher protein
shot, then you can do so.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.233
So here I'm gonna
put in some ice.

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:17.733
I'm gonna grab some cold
water from the fridge.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.967
Either half full or you can fill
it up however strong or weak you

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:27.867
want it and then you're
gonna blend this mother up.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.500
Just blend that for
20, 30 seconds or so.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.300
And that's that bad boy done.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.267
So what I'll normally do just
before I go over and train my

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:09.867
client, I'll just pop
this in and then take it

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:11.333
with me like so.

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.433
Protein-packed iced Americano.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.867
Enjoy.
