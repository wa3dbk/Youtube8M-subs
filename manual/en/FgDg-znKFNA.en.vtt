00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:05.432
- Hi there wig lover!

00:00:05.432 --> 00:00:07.187
This is Heather from Cysterwigs.com

00:00:07.187 --> 00:00:09.522
and today I'm bringing you a re-review

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:12.832
of one of my most popular wigs to date.

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:14.582
This is May by Noriko

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:19.235
and the color on May today
is one of my favorites,

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:20.936
Garnet Glaze.

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:23.064
So let me go ahead and
talk about the color

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:24.776
really quickly since
I have a lot of people

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:27.265
who ask me questions about it.

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:29.159
We've got a lot sunshine today

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.196
so I'm gonna dip my head
in the sunshine first

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:32.538
and foremost so you can see what

00:00:32.538 --> 00:00:35.071
that looks like with direct sunlight

00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.339
and non-direct light.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.906
It's very bright in here so

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:42.416
you should be able to see
it fairly well represented

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:44.083
in either situation.

00:00:45.732 --> 00:00:47.461
Very pretty color.

00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:50.427
The base color on Garnet Glaze

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:51.260
is the

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.930
Noriko/Amore Burgundy color

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.552
which the Burgundy in and of itself

00:00:56.552 --> 00:00:58.263
has been largely discontinued,

00:00:58.263 --> 00:00:59.763
but it's basically

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:03.046
it's not technically burgundy,

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:05.792
it's just a dark auburn color.

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:08.432
And then on top of that you've got a mix

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:12.933
of a medium auburn and
dark copper highlight,

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.215
so very pretty.

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:16.962
I do think that the name
is slightly misleading

00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:17.872
'cause when I think of garnets

00:01:17.872 --> 00:01:21.589
I think of more of like blue-based reds.

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:24.478
This is definitely not a blue-based red.

00:01:24.478 --> 00:01:27.532
It definitely has lots
of copper tones in it

00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:30.923
but overall it's very very pretty,

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:34.279
and it's highlighted without
being crazy highlighted.

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:36.536
It's just a very very beautiful color

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:38.406
and I think it works very well

00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:40.273
with this particular style.

00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:42.528
So if you're looking for a red

00:01:42.528 --> 00:01:46.695
that isn't too light, or
too coppery, or too intense,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.867
this is a great choice.

00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:52.877
It's also a good choice for anybody

00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:56.199
who's normally into brunette wigs

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.596
who wants to venture into reds.

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:00.723
I think that this would
be a very safe choice

00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:03.380
because it is quite dark as you can tell,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.261
unless the sunlight is
shining directly on it

00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:09.529
and that's really no
different than most wigs.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.484
So this wig sells like gangbusters.

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:13.475
I sell a ton of these.

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:17.267
They're often sold out
with the manufacturer too

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:19.496
so if you're thinking of ordering a May,

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:21.490
please contact me beforehand

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.564
and I can tell you if your
color is actually in stock

00:02:24.564 --> 00:02:27.102
with the manufacturer.

00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:31.309
Just like Paula Young and
basically every single wig brand

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.323
or wig store online,

00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:35.494
we drop-ship a lot of our merchandise,

00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:38.161
and so if it's not in our store,

00:02:39.628 --> 00:02:41.277
there's a pretty good chance

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:44.060
that it's basically sold
out everywhere (chuckles).

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.651
So

00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:47.016
you know,

00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:48.321
just food for thought.

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:50.248
We will definitely be able to tell you

00:02:50.248 --> 00:02:53.745
if your given color is in stock.

00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:56.578
This wig is a great mid-length bob

00:02:57.535 --> 00:02:59.637
with some layering towards the front.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.529
So you can see the layering
just kinda naturally

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:03.085
wants to swoop off to the side

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:05.303
making this wig pretty easy to wear.

00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:07.999
You can see that there's
quite a bit of layering

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:08.832
on the sides here

00:03:08.832 --> 00:03:13.499
and it just kinda wants to
flip like that off to the side,

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.833
and it's very pretty.

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.167
It does have these layers down here

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:19.238
that kinda wanna hug the
jaw and frame that out.

00:03:19.238 --> 00:03:20.988
It's very flattering.

00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:23.281
And then here is the back.

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:24.114
It is

00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:28.733
very very lightly stacked
down here towards the bottom

00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:30.005
and as you can see,

00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:33.922
the sides are dramatically
longer than the back

00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:35.938
or the front,

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:39.259
so the sides are definitely
the longest part of this wig.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.150
A similar style is the
Bryn that I reviewed

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.502
not too long ago.

00:03:43.502 --> 00:03:47.600
Bryn is very similar except
these sides are way longer.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.806
They go to like here instead

00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:52.695
and so this front part on
Bryn just kinda juts downward

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:55.612
but otherwise, almost the same cut.

00:03:57.307 --> 00:03:58.728
This is a very pretty wig,

00:03:58.728 --> 00:04:00.895
it has lots of volume here at the crown

00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:02.617
as you can see when I turn to the side;

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.573
that's from the permatease
as I've mentioned before.

00:04:04.573 --> 00:04:06.154
I'm a fan of permatease in wigs.

00:04:06.154 --> 00:04:10.626
I think that it tends to help
give it a little bit of boost

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:12.648
so that way it sort of evens out

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:14.607
the proportions of my face.

00:04:14.607 --> 00:04:16.906
However, this might be a lot of volume

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.723
for somebody who's got a small frame

00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:20.354
so just kinda keep that in mind.

00:04:20.354 --> 00:04:22.194
This does have built-in volume.

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:23.436
And now I'm gonna go
ahead and take May off

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:26.269
and show you the cap construction.

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:29.494
Okay.

00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:35.870
Completely permateased top.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.120
The entire top of this wig,

00:04:39.365 --> 00:04:42.264
this whole area here, all permateased.

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:43.537
So if you don't like permatease,

00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:45.868
this is a classic Noriko
permatease example

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.337
and you're not gonna dig it.

00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:48.982
But if you don't mind permatease,

00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:50.154
great little wig.

00:04:50.154 --> 00:04:52.448
Not as stretchy around the perimeter

00:04:52.448 --> 00:04:55.679
as a lot of open cap wigs are.

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.160
As I've mentioned before Noriko wigs

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.974
tend to fit a little small

00:04:58.974 --> 00:05:01.531
but they're surprisingly
stretchy here towards the back -

00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:02.364
go figure.

00:05:04.143 --> 00:05:08.284
The ear-tabs are pliable and
they're covered in lace -

00:05:08.284 --> 00:05:10.256
no fancy features there.

00:05:10.256 --> 00:05:13.368
The back is interesting because
it has a little bit of felt

00:05:13.368 --> 00:05:16.713
but it doesn't have the
velcro adjuster tabs.

00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:21.031
It has instead kind of
like a bra enclosure.

00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:23.203
And there's a little bit of felt here

00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:25.036
at the front hairline.

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:27.676
So

00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:33.042
let's see, I'm gonna go
ahead and invert this again,

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:36.799
and show you that color in the sunlight

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:39.161
while I'm gently combing it through

00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:40.994
to smooth it back out.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.994
You'll want to carry
a little comb with you

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:48.744
whenever you wear a wig
that's this straight.

00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:53.168
See how pretty that is in the sunlight?

00:05:53.168 --> 00:05:55.918
It's a very beautiful dark copper

00:05:57.778 --> 00:06:00.395
but it isn't like crazy orangy copper.

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.478
It's very very well done.

00:06:03.954 --> 00:06:06.265
And the top is permatease as I mentioned;

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.140
there's the permatease.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.694
So I'm gonna go ahead and put May back on

00:06:09.694 --> 00:06:11.541
so you can see what she looks like,

00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:14.874
and how easy it is to get it on and off.

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.092
Line up the hairline,
line up the ear-tabs,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.670
and because I already brushed it out,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.837
all I have to do really is
smooth it with my fingers.

00:06:30.943 --> 00:06:33.716
Very easy to wear mid-length bob.

00:06:33.716 --> 00:06:36.406
It's probably why she's
so popular in my store.

00:06:36.406 --> 00:06:40.630
So again, this has been
one of my bestselling wigs.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.297
This is May by Noriko

00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:45.983
and the color on my head
right now, Garnet Glaze.

00:06:45.983 --> 00:06:46.907
Thanks for watching

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:48.171
and I hope you have a great afternoon.

00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:49.004
Bye bye.
