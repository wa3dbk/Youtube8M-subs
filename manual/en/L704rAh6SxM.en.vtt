00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.820
So, we're going to begin our vegan dinner
party by preparing some vegan appetizers.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:14.849
We're going to be doing a favorite as my aunt's
as well; she loves chickpeas or garbanzo beans

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:24.249
as she calls them. We're going to drain all
of the liquid that they come in the can. I

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.619
know there are only three of us at this dinner
party, you're thinking, "two cans of chickpeas,

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.020
that's a lot!" but they shrink down in the
baking process. Try and get as much liquid

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:48.640
as you can off of that. To that, I'm going
to add two teaspoons of cumin; I'm going to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:57.040
put just a sprinkle of cinnamon. Cinnamon
is often used in even savory Indian dishes;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.120
it's just going to make a wonderful blend
of spices. And then, about a teaspoon of salt;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:16.799
it depends on how salty you like your snacks
and then, just a drizzle of olive oil. So

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.719
make sure each little chickpea is coated in
that spice mixture and then, just for easy

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:31.729
clean-up sake, I'm going to line my cookie
sheet - and also because they can stick sometimes

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:46.909
 - I'm going to line my cookie sheet.
Spread it out as evenly as you can, and these

00:01:46.909 --> 00:02:02.599
are ready to go in a 400 degree oven for 30
to 40 minutes. Alright, so these have cooled.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.759
You can see how much they've shrunk down;
look how tiny they are, the little chickpeas.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:15.190
And you'll see there are traces of where I
stirred them; I forgot to mention that. You

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:28.590
can remember to toss them during that baking
time, and then they'll be even crispier. I'm

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:42.640
just going to slide those all in there. We've
got a really sweet little appetizer ready

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.990
to nibble on for when they arrive.
