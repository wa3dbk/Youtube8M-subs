00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.100
To ensure that your base is protected from lost progress on your Android,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.000
you’ll need your own device, your base and your own Google account

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
to use in Google’s Play Games.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.000
Google Play Games is a versatile Android program

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.400
that allows you to save game progress,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.000
while letting you share your achievements

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.700
and experiences with friends who also play games.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.300
Here’s my base.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.000
I have a Google Play account, but my game is currently not attached to it.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
To ensure that my progress will always be saved,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.700
I’ll start by entering my game settings,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.900
Accounts and tapping on “Google Play sign in”

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.800
As you can see, there are a couple accounts currently in use on this device.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.800
So you really need to be sure that you’re selecting your own before proceeding.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That’s really important!

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.500
This is because in Boom Beach, your base can only be attached to a single Google account.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.800
Meaning it will permanently attach itself
to the first account selected that hasn’t

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.000
previously been attached to a base.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.200
It is your duty to protect your base, Commander!

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.000
So create an account by tapping on “Add account”

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.100
and following the steps required.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.940
Or sign in to your own Google account!

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.200
I already have an account, so I’ll select mine.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.000
A loading indicator will appear notifying
you with a “welcome text”.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.800
Be sure that this message contains your username.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.100
Now your base is primed for booming.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.800
Have a shiny, new Android device you’d like to Boom on?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.100
Or would you like to transfer your base to a working device?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.400
To move your base to this device, you will
first need to set up the device

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.030
with your Google account - as you should already have one.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.000
I’ll go ahead and sign in to my account,
then set up my device preferences.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000
Once your device has booted up,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.500
head over to the Play Store and download Boom Beach.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300
When you open the game, a pop up will appear

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.500
alerting you that a base is already attached

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
to the Google account you set up your device with .

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.900
Tap on “Load” to get the base, as it should be yours.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.300
If you did not see a pop-up from the start, don’t worry,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.200
as Android devices often work differently.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.599
Simply complete the beginner’s
tutorial and enter your game settings to connect

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.400
your Google account as shown previously in this video.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.100
Once again, make sure to verify that the “welcome text” has your name on it.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.800
So don’t forget, to safely destroy the Blackguard,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.900
have your own device, base and Google account.
