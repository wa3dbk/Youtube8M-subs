00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:12.309
NARRATOR:
From Joss Whedon, God of the nerds, comes

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.980
the movie blockbuster that finally unites
the world’s greatest superheroes... that

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.160
Marvel still has the rights to.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.810
The Avengers!

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.150
The ultimate two hour geek fantasy that blinds
all nerds from admitting any legitimate criticism.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.410
And put all of DC Comics on suicide watch.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.550
A villain, who inexplicably returns from the
dead, will vow vengeance on the planet where

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.059
his demigod brother’s sort-of-girlfriend
lives.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.679
Forcing this bluetooth obsessed government
agency to assemble the heroes from Marvel’s

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.089
greatest franchises, except Spider-Man, Fantastic
Four, and X-Men.

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.679
Suit up with Iron Man - everyone’s favorite
secondary Marvel character - who must redeem

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.030
himself from the god awful Iron Man 2.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.210
Thor - who sort of pulled off his own movie,
but who’s appearance here completely negates

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.320
its ending.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.119
Captain America - no one’s favorite character,
who just kinda has to be there.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.860
And The Incredible Hulk – who, for the sake
of the plot, can now suddenly control his

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.860
rage…

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.940
BRUCE BANNER:
I’m always angry.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.000
NARRATOR:
…without any explanation.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.270
Which doesn’t matter ‘cause that shot
was awesome!

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.060
Witness... the excitement...

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.830
IRON MAN:
I need you to get to that engine control panel…

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.609
NARRATOR:
…of Iron Man repairing a spaceship for twenty

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.619
minutes.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.119
The thrill of generic aliens on flying jet
skis.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.110
The confusing energy source of the Tesseract…

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.270
SELVIG:
The Tesseract can fight, but you can’t protect

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.270
against yourself…

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.829
NARRATOR:
…and its completely unjustified fail safe.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.829
The explosion that instantly kills every alien,
conveniently tying up all loose ends.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.070
The Bromance…

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.930
TONY STARK:
Hey.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.609
NARRATOR:
And the character in the middle of the credits,

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.590
who every nerd in the audience pretended to
know.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.830
A movie so fulfilling… you won’t remember
that the first 45 minutes are actually kind

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.050
of boring.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.700
A villain so determined...

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.597
LOKI:
You need the cube to bring me home, but I’ve

00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:25.597
sent it off I know not where.

00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:26.597
NARRATOR:
…you’ll wonder why he’s uniting the

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:30.250
only people who can stop him, in hopes of
getting them to dislike each other.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.360
TONY STARK:
Not a great plan.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.510
NARRATOR:
Battles so action packed...

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.340
HAWKEYE:
Stark, you’ve got a lot of strays stuck

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.340
on your tail.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.340
NARRATOR:
You won’t even ask yourself, “how are

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.080
they even all talking to each other without
ear pieces?”

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.270
BLACK WIDOW:
I can close it, can anybody copy?

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.680
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Do it.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.100
TONY STARK:
No, wait.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.930
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Stark, these things are still coming.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.930
NARRATOR:
Starring...

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.930
Bore.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.930
Pinkeye.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.930
Iron Man Pooping.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:56.930
Not Edward Norton.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.930
The Human Torch.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.580
Leather Boobs.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.290
Mace Windu.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.070
And Gay Bane.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.230
NARRATOR:
Marvel’s The Avengers!

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.900
If this doesn’t make your inner eight year
old self squeal in delight you’re likely

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.040
dead inside... or a girl.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.260
