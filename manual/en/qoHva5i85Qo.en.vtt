00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:02.758
(piano playing)

00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:08.914
Dr. Zucker: We're in Madrid at the
Prado and we're looking at a Velazquez.

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:11.566
A large painting, this
is the Vulcan Forge.

00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.714
It's been described by some
of our historian's as a
kind of burlesque actually.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:19.791
Dr. Harris: Here's Apollo, here we can see
the God of the Sun and the God of Poetry

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.126
with the halo on his head on the
left who's here telling Vulcan,

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:26.348
Dr. Zucker: A suit of armor.

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:30.480
Dr. Harris: ... and is very hard
at work all day and Apollo has just
come to tell him that his wife,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.857
Venus, has been having an affair
with Mars, the God of War.

00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:37.715
Dr. Zucker: Now, just look at
the attitudes of those two faces,

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.294
forget about the rest of the
painting for just a moment.

00:00:40.294 --> 00:00:45.374
Apollo, his back arches, his head is up,
he's rather full of himself actually.

00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:46.044
Dr. Harris: Yeah.

00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:51.085
Dr. Zucker: As he has this
very powerful message to, sort
of, almost scold Vulcan with.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:53.682
Vulcan looks horrified and dangerous.

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:59.083
He's holding this red hot metal in one
hand, he's got a hammer in the other

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:02.169
and it looks like he's ready
to just strike anything.

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:06.223
Dr. Harris: Look at his body,
he's got this beautiful torso,

00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:13.026
muscles, and these ripples and
his abdomen, but his face has
that kind of Carvaggio feel

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:14.799
Dr. Zucker: Of this world.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:15.309
Dr. Harris: ... beautiful.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:20.364
He's got this ideally beautiful
body, in fact all of the male
figures have ideal bodies

00:01:20.364 --> 00:01:24.223
as though Velazquez was looking at
Ancient Greek and Roman sculpture

00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:27.890
and looking at the artists of the
Renaissance, maybe Michelangelo

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.121
and also looking at the art of Carvaggio.

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:31.441
Dr. Zucker: But the hands
are different aren't they?

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:32.189
Dr. Harris: They are.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.597
Dr. Zucker: They're not so idealized ...

00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:36.291
Dr. Zucker: ... as you pointed out, in
fact the heads are incredibly naturalistic

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.993
even though they're painted
in a fairly loose manner.

00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:43.171
Dr. Harris: There's this conflict in this
painting between this kind of realism

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:46.367
and down to earthness in the
figures and what they're doing,

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:49.158
and their gestures and the
emotions that they convey,

00:01:49.158 --> 00:01:53.429
but also this sense of that they're kind
of standing like classical sculptures

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.388
and their bodies look
like classical sculptures.

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:58.768
Dr. Zucker: Here's the thing is that I
don't think the French or the Italian's

00:01:58.768 --> 00:02:03.233
would have rendered an important
mythological subject with this much,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.047
almost comedy involved, right?

00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:05.996
Dr. Harris: Yeah.

00:02:05.996 --> 00:02:08.104
Dr. Zucker: Look at the man
who is second from the right,

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:11.030
he looks sort of astonished,
literally absurd.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.532
There is this kind of direct
human, sort of sense of conflict

00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:18.949
and humor that seems very
debasing in some way,

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.759
really not treating the classical with
the honor that it's usually accorded.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.363
Dr. Harris: At the same time, though,
this looks like an academic exercise

00:02:27.363 --> 00:02:31.366
because we have the three male
figures in the center shown

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:33.022
from three different points of view.

00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:35.616
The one on the left,
Vulcan, shown frontal.

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:39.335
The next one shown from behind,
the third one shown in profile

00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:42.900
and the last figure on the right shown
foreshortened and coming out toward us.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.070
Dr. Zucker: Those first three
almost like ... if they were female
figures, like the three Graces.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.278
Dr. Harris: Exactly, it looks very
orderly and composed and balanced

00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:55.568
and a little bit like a performance
for maybe possible future patrons.

00:02:55.568 --> 00:02:59.534
I mean, here's Velazquez, he's still
relatively young, he's made a trip to Rome

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:03.448
at the urging of Rubens and
perhaps demonstrating his skill,

00:03:03.448 --> 00:03:06.256
as an artist who can paint the male nude.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:09.697
Dr. Zucker: It certainly shows an
artist who's willing to reinvent

00:03:09.697 --> 00:03:13.723
or push the boundaries of the
ways in which stories are told.

00:03:13.723 --> 00:03:16.685
