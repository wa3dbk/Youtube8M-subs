00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.440
The Crossrunner is well balanced

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.120
easily carves corners at very low speeds 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.320
is handy both in small towns and on twisty roads&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.200
Good handling and high precision when riding fast

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.940
But it is a touring motorcycle, rather than a sport bike

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.260
The engine has a dual personality: under 6500 rpm the response is brilliant but not amazing

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.480
then the sound changes and it becomes aggressive, until 10000 rpm (97 CV @ tyre)

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.420
Hi-level safety: great stability in any condition, ABS and traction control

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.400
Hi-level comfort, thanks to the natural riding position, the well balanced body and the crisp braking&nbsp;
