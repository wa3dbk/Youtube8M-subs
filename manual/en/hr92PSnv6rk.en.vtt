Welcome to Draw Tip Tuesday!

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.980
No inspiration? Take a look at you wardrobe.
You may find interesting stuff that you can

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.160
draw. For example, make a fun pattern of the
shoes you have, or draw the kind of shoes

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.390
that you’d like to have. You could make
a pattern of bags, coats, accessories… you

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.430
name it. Take a peek into your wardrobe and
you can get lots of ideas for a whole series

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.140
of patterns.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.550
Use a pencil to draw a thin frame first, so
you’ll know where your pattern needs to

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.550
fit in. Now, go ahead and draw shoes! You
can make the shapes as simple or as complicated

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.080
as you want, add little details like stitches
or laces and bows.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.820
Fill the frame completely, fitting the shapes
cleverly like pieces of a puzzle. Once you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.820
filled your frame, pick up a water resistant
pen - I’m using this uniball pen.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.979
Make sure the ink has dried before erasing
the pencil lines.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.060
Get your watercolors out, plus water and a
brush, and start coloring! No need to stay

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.519
perfectly inside of the lines. Actually, coloring
a little sloppy can give a great and playful

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.230
effect. Pick up enough paint to get vibrant
colors. Make a fun mix of color layout - divide

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.330
colors evenly - by that I mean don’t give
two shoes next to each other the same color

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.330
- try to bring some balance.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.599
Now dive into your wardrobe and see what you
