To add or fix a command you
will start by logging into your myharmony.com account.

your remote a new command with your original remote.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.840
On the pop out page, choose the "Buttons" menu.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.160
Now, choose the Activity you would like to
add or fix a command for.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.460
Now, from the activity, select the device you want to add or fix a command for as well.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.090
Click on "Add or Fix a Command."

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.960
Select what you would like to do: Fix a command
that doesn't work or "add a missing command."

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.250
If you are adding a missing command,
enter the name of the new command.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.270
Now, follow the instructions on the screen. 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.500
You will need your Harmony remote, original remote
and the USB cable to connect your Harmony to your computer.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.570

computer.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.140
Point the original remote to the IR sensor,
keeping it about 3 inches away.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.180
When prompted, press the command on the original remote.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.499
You have just successfully added or fixed
a new command.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:33.780
Click "Finish" to continue.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.110
