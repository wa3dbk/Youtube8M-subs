Welcome to Expert Village. I'm Mark Wenzel
and we're teaching you how to be a mime. Once

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:11.420
you've done the white makeup in a mask and
you've accented the eyes and the eyebrows

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.509
and the mustache, the lips are very important.
Once again, a real trick to putting on any

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.720
sort of makeup like this is too small and
then you can make it bigger. It's hard when

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.259
you make it real big and then to try to make
it smaller. It's hard to talk while you're

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:55.730
doing this at the same time, but you'll get
an idea. I use brush. You can just grab a

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.100
lipstick or something like that. You want
to make sure that the makeup stays on while

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:19.469
you're sweating. You want to make sure it's
on there good. You see once again, I've made

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:29.161
it a little bit smaller than my own lips,
but I can make it bigger. I don't want to

00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:36.590
have pie lips, unless that's what you do.
The mime has to look pretty much as you normally

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.369
look, except you've got makeup on and it's
amplified. Once again, that's the whole trick

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:51.090
to the makeup is to have it so it's amplified.
Now, this is how a standard makeup will look.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.189
It's not really exaggerated. I don't have
anything extra going on. No big red nose.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.579
This is how it looks, and you can see it.
These are the speaking parts of my face. Stay

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.380
tuned because we're going to teach you how
to do mime coming up.
