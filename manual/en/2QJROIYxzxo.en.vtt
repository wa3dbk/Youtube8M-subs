Hi, this is Shana Bethune on behalf of Expert
Village and I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:13.030
scraping the walls of your pumpkin. So once
you've scooped out all of the seeds and strings,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.160
it's time to scrape the walls. This is important
because you want to make sure that the skin

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.609
of your pumpkin is thin enough to carve into.
But make sure that it's not too thin because

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.890
if it's too thin, then your pumpkin is going
to collapse because the pressure from cutting

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.050
into it will just be too great. The best thing
to use for scraping the walls is a metal spoon.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:51.600
So dig into the pumpkin a little bit. Scoop
out pumpkin flesh like this. Now while you're

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.540
doing this, make sure that you keep your hands
relatively dry because if you're pushing down

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.681
really hard on the spoon and your hands are
wet, they're going to slide off and you're

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:07.240
going to end up hurting yourself. So if you
need to, take a break every once in a while

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:17.469
to dry your hands off on a paper towel.
And you should expect this process to take

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.009
at least fifteen or twenty minutes. So be
patient and it will pay off in the end because

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:32.200
while you're cutting, it will be much easier
to do. One thing that can make the process

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.130
much faster is scraping the walls into a pile
at the bottom of the pumpkin and then once

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:50.359
you have a large amount down there, you can
just reach in and take out handfuls at a time.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:57.820
Also, to make sure that you do a thorough
job, start at one side, scrape all the way

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.279
up, get everything off of that wall and then
turn the pumpkin a little bit and then scrape

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:09.440
the next part, this way you can make sure
that you don't miss a spot. Another thing

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.510
to remember is to scrape underneath the top
part. It's very easy to forget this part because

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.049
you can't see it, but that's where all the
smoke is going to go, so it's really important

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.980
that there's nothing hanging down. Once you
think you've gotten just about everything

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.260
out, if your pumpkin is small enough, you
can turn it upside down and shake out anything

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.309
that is still left in there.
