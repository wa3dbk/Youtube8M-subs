00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.109
Brikk Announces Diamond-Studded Apple Watches
Costing Up to $75,000

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.240
While the Apple Watch is not expected to be
released until April, luxury and couture product

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.190
design company Brikk today announced a line
of 30 luxury models for the upcoming smartwatch

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.210
that they claim, "will afford unmatched opulence
to an exclusive clientele worldwide."

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.900
Similar to the Apple Watch in terms of sizes,
the line of Lux Watches will be available

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:35.719
in 38mm and 42mm, with color options of 24-karat
yellow gold, 18-karat pink gold, and 950 platinum

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.679
alongside varying band options.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:44.429
There are also three editions to the line:
Standard, Deluxe, and Omni.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.539
All versions of the Lux Watch are prepared
through disassembling Apple Watches that the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.789
company then repurposes with their luxury
materials in a "state-of-the-art laboratory."

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.690
The basic Standard edition offers a single
row of diamonds (.50 carats) and a leather

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.070
strap, while the mid-tier Deluxe has multiple
rows of diamonds (2.3 carats), diamond encrusted

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.180
buttons, and a diamond studded clasp on its
leather strap.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.480
"For the ultimate in exclusivity," Brikk offers
the Lux Watch Omni edition with a fully diamond-emblazoned

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.740
case resulting in over 12 carats of jewels
on the device.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.320
The company promises only the highest end
of luxury and satisfaction in purchasing one

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.550
of their new line of high-end devices, which
they've done before with the iPhone 6 and

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.630
6 Plus.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:42.230
The line will set those interested back $7,495
for the Standard, $11,995 for the Deluxe,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:49.430
and $69,995 for the Omni, and all prices fluctuate
slightly higher for larger sizes.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.920
Brikk promises that each comes in a "Zero
Halliburton aluminum case with carbon fiber

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.680
interior", with a user manual, the expected
accessories, a 1-year warranty, and a diamond-studded

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.310
certificate of authenticity.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.569
While Apple has taken a decidedly fashion-skewed
angle in beginning to market the Apple Watch,

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.739
Brikk's new diamond-encrusted offerings appear
to be a more straightforward answer to those

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.349
looking for more of a statement with the new
wearable.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.379
Pricing guesses have jumped between $10,000
and $20,000 for the high-end Apple Watch Edition,

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.749
so while the Lux line's lower-end models could
fall in line with Apple's own mid-to-upper

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.939
tier models, the Omni edition offered by Brikk
may in fact be the most expensive version

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.879
of the Watch on the market when the device
launches this Spring.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.849
Those interested in the Lux Watch line can
visit Brikk's official website to place a

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.269
pre-order, which requires a deposit and is
expected to ship between 4-6 weeks following

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.899
the official Apple Watch launch in April.
