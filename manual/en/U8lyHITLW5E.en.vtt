00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.680
Next is the 3rd method to fix the loose joint

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.862
I'll use the same joint as the 1st method

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.140
This method is another way

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.460
to make the joint tighter than 1st method.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.340
the tool we will use is...

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.700
nippers/cutter

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.680
notch it with the cutter

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.939
all around the joint

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.719
randomly.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.340
make it out-surface marks all over.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.040
If your cutter is too small for the joint

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:22.200
You can use knife-cutter or art-knife to notch the joint

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.760
make the plastic split out-surface

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:36.457
I think it's enough now

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.440
OK, now when I'm moving it, I feel it is tighter like the 2nd method

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.760
It might because of this joint had added super glue before

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.327
and I notch the joint after that

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.480
Let's zoom in to take a look

00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:50.303
You can see that there are some break out-surfaces

00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:04.316
