00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:12.010
Sha Crystal you got the best of me and you
can keep on sellin for way too much.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.010
Wo-oo-ooo!

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:21.419
Hey guys, this is Reckles with WTBGold, and
today's video is about you guessed it Sha

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:22.560
Crystal farming.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.089
We're going over to the Timeless Isle, and
I'm going to be bringing my enchanter to be

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.710
disenchanting the 496 timeless gear I get
over there.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.200
At the end of the test we're going to be buying
anything we can with the Timeless Coins we

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.449
get from either the Timeless Vendor over by
all the Celestials or if we don't have enough

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.530
for any of that we're going to be going over
to the Bonker's vendor Northeast of Mossgreen

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.230
Lake and playing that game over there.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.870
Now, I don't really have a lot of bagspace
on my toon because this is my raiding toon,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.640
so I'm not really going to be focusing on
picking up all the cloth and all the greens

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.400
and all the rare stuff, but when you go out
there, these guys are pretty high level.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.930
These are the hardest just open world mobs
in the game, so they do drop a lot of really

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.120
good stuff.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.800
So, by all means pick up all that stuff when
you guys go out there.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.310
But we are just focusing on specifically testing
how many Sha Crystals you can get per hour.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.040
So let's go out there, and start the test.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.170
Now, the ideal way to kill these guys if to
down them before they get off any of their

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.170
abilities.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.310
If you're having trouble doing that, start
attacking them as soon as they start casting

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.770
their ability Forage.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.360
Umm, it's a five or ten second cast and they
don't do anything during the entire cast,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.290
they have to finish it.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.820
After that, you can stun them, or interrupt
them, charge them, do all that good stuff.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.979
As soon as they start casting their first
big AoE thing and then you can do the same

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.730
thing again when they start casting their
big Enrage ability.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:25.730
Um, here during my thirty minute test, I killed,
according to my Epoch stone counter, thirty

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.120
two of the Burning Berserkers, and it was
a little disappointing actually I only got

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.500
one Timeless Armor piece off of these.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
I got three in total because I also killed
Leafmender and the Black Yaungol rare.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.260
Two of the rares spawned during the thirty
minute test which got me three Timeless pieces

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.740
and I also got 4600 Timeless coins.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.400
Comes out to about 7 Timeless Armor pieces
over an hour farming session.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:07.700
Which, uh, total gold value with today's market
comes out to about 1,200 gold.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.890
Not very impressive.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.900
I also got three stacks of cloth, and a blue
rare piece, which would sell for about 1,500

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.209
gold, which is pretty nice, but overall I'm
not very impressed.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.360
According to WoWHead though, these results
are average.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.160
If you add up all the drop rates for the Timeless
Armor from the Burning Berserkers, you get

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:42.760
about a 3.3% drop rate for Timeless Armor,
which means killing 33 or 32 Burning Berserkers

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.070
will yield you one drop in thirty minutes.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.750
So, there you go!

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.170
The moral of the story; if you're going out
to the Timeless Isle, do it, not to farm Sha

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.870
Crystals, do it to farm rep, and any Sha Crystals
are going to be a bonus.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.980
One piece of advice I will say though, stock
up on Mogu Runes.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.200
Get a group together, and run Throne of Thunder.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.380
Coin every boss.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.720
Disenchant all of that gear, and then you'll
have not only 5 or 6 Sha Crystals, but you'll

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.169
also have 5 or 6 Haunting Spirits and then
you'll have 5,000 - 10,000 gold depending

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.190
on your server prices.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.610
And that'll be a much better use of your time.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.270
So, until next time, thank you for watching,
go ahead and comment if you like the video,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.430
comment if you didn't like the video, comment
if you're indifferent.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.229
And until next time, have a good day playing
WoW, and Search.

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.229
Craft.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.229
Post.

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.229
Every Day.

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:43.234
Have a good one, guys.
