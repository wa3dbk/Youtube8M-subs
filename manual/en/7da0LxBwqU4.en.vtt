00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:07.941
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
OH, YOU'RE--WHY ARE YOU BACK?

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.576
COOK IS JUST LIKE,
NOW AS YOUR GOD,

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.212
I DEMAND YOU TO FIX MY BOAT.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.814
MY BOAT GOT BROKE.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.916
NOW YOU GOT TO FIX MY BOAT.
FIX MY BROKE BOAT.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.087
AND SO EVERYBODY IN HAWAII
IS JUST LIKE, NO, BRAH.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.588
NOT EVEN.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:22.923
- LET'S DO A SHOT.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.959
- [laughs]

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:28.929
LAUGH WITH ME.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.831
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE
A FOOL OF ME.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.266
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE SHOW.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.501
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.537
- PERFECT.

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.476
- SO COOK IS SAYING,
THAT'S REALLY WEIRD

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.645
THAT THEY'RE NOT TREATING
THEIR GODS WITH RESPECT.

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.414
AND THEN SO THE HAWAIIAN PEOPLE,
JUST KIND OF UPSET,

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.882
STEAL SOME STUFF.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.318
CAPTAIN COOK
AND HIS MEN NOTICE IT.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.720
THEY'RE LIKE, HEY,
I THINK THIS STUFF WAS STOLEN.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.022
I THINK THEY STOLE IT.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.891
WE SHOULD PROBABLY,
UH, RETALIATE.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.527
AND CAPTAIN COOK GOES,
OH, NO, NO, NO.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.628
UNTIL YOU RETURN OUR STUFF

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.463
AND FIX OUR BOAT,

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.666
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR CHIEF.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.236
AND THEY KIDNAPPED
KING KALANI'OPU'U.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:12.506
AND THIS IS WHERE THINGS
TAKE A TURN FOR THE WORST.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:13.874
HE WAS SAYING--HE'S LIKE,
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.475
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS GUY
BACK TO THE BOAT.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:20.447
SHOW THEM HOW GNARLY
WE CAN GET.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:26.820
AT THAT POINT, ONE OF CAPTAIN
JAMES COOK'S MEN SHOOTS A KID,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.956
KALANI'OPU'U'S NEPHEW,

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.325
AND EVERYONE LOSES IT.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:34.761
EVERYONE'S JUST LIKE,
WHAT THE [bleep]?

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:38.098
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU, WHITE?

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.367
AND THEY START PICKING UP ROCKS
AND SPEARS

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.236
AND PUMMELING CAPTAIN COOK
AND HIS MEN.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:45.105
IT'S--IT'S LIKE A MOSH PIT.

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:50.511
COOK IS SAYING,
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.812
IT'S AT THIS MOMENT

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:53.447
THAT I REALIZE THAT THEY
DON'T THINK WE'RE GODS.

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:57.918
CLANK, CAPTAIN COOK GETS KILLED
IN THIS SITUATION.

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.854
COUPLE OTHER JAMES COOK'S
SHIPMATES--

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.523
- WHOOPSIE.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.857
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.527
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW COMBATIVE THIS WOULD GET.

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:07.561
- DEAL WITH IT.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:13.634
- AND THEN KALANI'OPU'U GOES,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.536
EVERYONE CHILL OUT.

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:16.770
EVERYONE'S LIKE,
ALL RIGHT, COOL.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.338
HE'S LIKE,
I LIKE THIS GUY.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.073
HE MESSED UP.
WE ALL DO.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.209
LET'S GIVE HIM
A PROPER HAWAIIAN BURIAL.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.944
WE'RE GONNA BURN HIS BODY,

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:24.945
TAKE SOME OF THE BONES

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.213
AND KEEP THEM FOR OURSELVES
BECAUSE,

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:27.581
YOU KNOW,
THIS GUY SEEMS TO BE--

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:29.516
HE HAS A LOT
OF STUFF GOING ON.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.952
BUT WE'RE GONNA GIVE THE REST
OF THE BODY BACK.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.121
AND SO THEY BURNED THE BODY,
AND HE SAYS, HERE.

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.325
HERE'S THIS SACK OF--

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:41.161
HERE'S THE SACK OF JAMES COOK.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.529
NO HARD FEELINGS.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.231
YOU UNDERSTOOD
HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.766
HAVE FUN BACK IN ENGLAND.

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:46.700
AFTER THAT,
HAWAII BECAME A PORT.
