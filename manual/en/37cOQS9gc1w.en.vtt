00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.660
 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.100
Self-driving cars are now being tested
in several places.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.150
The research of this small team is special

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.290
because it shows that it is possible to
develop an autonomous control system

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.849
that cost a few hundred dollars as
opposed to systems costing ten times

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.260
more.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.260
 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.180
This car which drives on Hungaroring,
the Hungarian Formula One

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.930
racetrack

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.200
has no PCs in the trunk, only a small unit 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.220
powered by an embedded application
processor similar to those used in

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.829
mobile devices.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.489
It is not competing against anyone.
Instead, it drives as safely as any human driver 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.489
who would drive here for the first time. 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.210
 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.119
 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.750
The carâ€™s control relies only on vision-based information 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.180
processed from one front-facing camera
without using any prerecorded 3d laser

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.960
scan maps of the road for its
surroundings.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.670
The intelligence is provided by a small
electronic control unit. This consists of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.289
a small

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.549
but high performance Nvidia Tegra K1 application processor

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.170
running AdasWorks software and a
watchdog safety system

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.470
developed by ThyssenKrupp Presta Hungary. This is revolutionary

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.159
because until today the functions
required for active safety

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.270
and automated driving were done by
separate units. That system is complex

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.310
and expensive. Since new embedded
processors are powerful enough to run

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.750
all these features,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.140
these systems will become much more
integrated and simpler.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.020
Because of this their costs can be
dramatically reduced,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.370
making it possible to install similar
features in mass-market cars as well.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.590
 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.640
As the complexity of hardware
decreases in cars,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.400
the importance of software grows. AdasWorks, the software on top of the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.470
electronic control unit is based on
computer vision and sensor fusion.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.400
The car drives using only vision data

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.780
so it acts like human drivers who don't
know the road in advance.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.370
For example after a bend a pedestrian could step suddenly on the road

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.379
so the car needs to drive carefully. Based on the data from the camera, our algorithms

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.409
calculate the center of the road,

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.420
the trajectory and the right speed.
This planning happens ten times in a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.040
second,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.569
so our car can react to unexpected events
much faster than human drivers.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.120
the AdasWorks software is created by a
small team of research engineers in

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.280
Budapest, Hungary.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.930
The startup's vision 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.709
is to revolutionize the car industry
with driver assistance

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.709
and automated driving software for
application processors.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.720
The support from ThyssenKrupp Presta Hungary

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.480
which has professional development
experience in the automotive industry

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.480
brings indispensable help in the job. 
On one hand, the Hungarian competence

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.680
center known for developing
electromechanical steering systems

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.769
has developed a special interface
suitable for the project for one of its

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.870
models already in serial production.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.099
On the other hand ThyssenKrupp Presta Hungary

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.500
has created the so-called trajectory
control, the software capable of

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.010
transforming the instructions given by
AdasWorks to execute commands for

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.590
the car.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.010
The international development experience
of ThyssenKrupp Presta Hungary 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.260
is also essential from the point of view
of safety compliance

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.400
for the worldwide accepted automotive
industry standards.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.569
Since 10 years ThyssenKrupp Presta Hungary develops successfully

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.659
electric power steering systems. We are
accepted

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.560
development partner for all big OEMs.
For us it's always a pleasure to work

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.319
together

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.810
with partners to realise innovative new ideas.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.169
I believe the fault tolerant steering system from ThyssenKrupp Presta steering combined

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.870
with AdasWorks is the first solution worldwide which enables self driving cars

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.870
because it could be realised for affordable price.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.470
