00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.340
everybody's been there where you have
allot of tests coming up a lot of papers

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.490
coming up and sometimes is a temptation
to resort to one of these exiting mills

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.210
these online services where you can tell
them how long does it have to be how

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.390
many situations which should be on and
open this one for you for profit

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.109
obviously and so to investigate whether
or not this can actually work to help

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.310
students although i'm sure he didn't
want to tough aggressive by the name of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.170
d_n_a_ really who's a professor of
psychology and behavioral economics at

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.410
duke university and specifically the
fuqua school of business

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.960
charge of that but will just go with it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.790
uh... heated uh... really interesting
research where he contacted for these

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.830
essay males they told them to write

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.490
uh... that kind of an erotic essay
actually on

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.440
when and why do people cheat uh... it
said that he paid between a hundred and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.040
fifty and two hundred and ten dollars at
the four different signal so significant

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.420
money for just one of the many
essentially to retrain yash uh...

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.520
a semester

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.440
and he found that unfortunately quality
work was pretty

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.339
city actually uh... without me give you
a quote just because it's so crazy i

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.140
love this

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.409
uh... so here's a quote from one of them
cheating by healers healing is different

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.190
there is harmless ceiling when he would
she be risen wizards offer omens lapels

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.490
damage to withdraw

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.160
the husband wife back and stuff

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.180
we read the newspaper in just smile

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.030
but these days fewer people believe in
wizards that last point i guess is true

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.459
but not really approaches for this

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.739
costly says that it doesn't even seem
like these are native speakers right has

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:29.270
nothing to do with teetering now and and
actually doesn't but in my mind this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.510
story is hilarious delegate-rich eight

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.860
gain it you know hundreds of dollars
cheap this is what you deserve to get

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.719
other people actually sitting in writing
a paper that home

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.979
and if you can just pay somebody i like
to do it i think it's hilarious thinking

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.159
about what he decides now obviously have
to bear in mind that he doesn't want

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.909
these to be used for political unit
earthworks in the works of the where

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.799
exactly that obviously a professor at
university in the night

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.399
um... but i have to imagine that if this
is the quality of the look of never used

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.800
one but if this is the quality why would
people continue to use it

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.030
or maybe they destroyed sydney is in one
scene that could be that could be i

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.349
think i think we've all taken those
classes where

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.839
you know you you need a specific read
and you don't really want to be there

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.720
and maybe that's the one time we're kind
of tempted like

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.799
i don't really want a rate that i want
to go out

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.199
couple accent i don't know at the menu
maybe happening every didn't return any

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.439
bears like perfect jack i would hope
that they had

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.870
portrayed in the incident

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.269
murphy says that much of this material
was actually played your eyes

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.359
i don't know why they were using this
nonsense quotes about wizards and

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.249
dealers or whatever but apparently today
from something else

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.279
confident underwriting and also i
could've played rising um... and so

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.579
because it was played rise to you
contact that signals they said look i

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.849
want my money back this is an even
original crap mrs

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.169
repurposed scrap

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.649
uh... any says that they refuse to give
the money saying that it had been copied

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:56.249
what we expect to meet me at the
appealing and i think you know that they

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.559
have a business intended to serial no
more of a venn threatened conferences

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:01.369
dean

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.989
because even pretending to be a student
actually can you imagine if they

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.709
actually did that i mean huh

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.379
i never got but i thought i think his
daily seven a couple years ago i'm no

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.310
asst mill has been legally prosecuted
bringing switch

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.730
i guess i mean it's didn't see act by
distance scared today actually do

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.580
anything else i was anything that you
could decide it's certainly in school

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.989
rules but that is it against long slow
animal out of the federal government at

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:26.469
this

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.929
