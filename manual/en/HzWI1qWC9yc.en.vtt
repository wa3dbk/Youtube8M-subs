00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.700
Today we're building a plant basket. We've
got our basket. We've lined it with four mill

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:17.600
plastic sheeting. We've added our plants after
we added a base of soil. And now we're adding

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:28.290
more soil so that we can pack our plants in.
It's very important to pack these plants in

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:37.770
very tight. Plenty of soil all the way up
to the neck of the plant and push that soil

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:52.879
down and get it packed in there. The plants
do really good that way and your water, if

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.969
you water them without packing them, all the
soil will pack anyway and then you'll have

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:05.210
to add more soil later. But I prefer to add
it right now and get it taken care of so that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.410
I don't have to go back and do any maintenance
on this basket. Okay so now we have got that

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:25.130
all packed nice and tight. And I'm going to
trim the plastic sheeting within just leaving

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:47.510
a one inch rim around the basket because we'll
use that rim of plastic to keep the water

00:01:47.510 --> 00:02:02.790
from leaking out when we water our plants.
We're going to, oops, got a leak, wasn't watching.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.080
And that should do it.
