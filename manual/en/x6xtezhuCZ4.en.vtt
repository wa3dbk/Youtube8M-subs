00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.840
Let's think about what it
means to multiply 2 over 3,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.904
or 2/3, times 4/5.

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:13.320
In a previous
video, we've already

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.070
seen how we can
actually compute this.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.490
This is going to be equal
to-- in the numerator,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.380
we just multiply the numerators.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.970
So it's going to be 2 times 4.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.880
And in the denominator, we
just multiply the denominator.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.130
So it's going to be 3 times 5.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.400
And so the numerator
is going to be 8,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.504
and the denominator
is going to be 15.

00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:42.420
And this is about as
simple as we can make it.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.490
8 and 15 don't have any factors
common to each other, than 1,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.490
so this is what it is.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.380
It's 8/15.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.880
But how, why does that
actually makes sense?

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.360
And to think about
it, we'll think

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.910
of two ways of visualizing it.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.966
So let's draw 2/3.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.430
I'll draw it relatively big.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.390
So I'm going to draw 2/3, and
I'm going to take 4/5 of it.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.440
So 2/3, and I'm going
to make it pretty big.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.590
Just like this.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.140
So this is 1/3.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.990
And then this would be 2/3.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.770
Which I could do a little bit
better job making those equal,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.330
or at least closer
to looking equal.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.170
So there you go.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.000
I have thirds.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.400
Let me do it one more time.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.910
So here I have drawn thirds.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.630
2/3 represents 2 of them.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.720
It represents 2 of them.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.880
One way to think about
this is 2/3 times 4/5

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.720
is 4/5 of this 2/3.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.630
So how do we divide
this 2/3 into fifths?

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.600
Well, what if we divided each
of these sections into 5.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.000
So let's do that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.512
So let's divide each into 5.

00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:05.958
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.430
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.800
And I could even divide
this into 5 if I want.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.180
And we want to take 4/5
of this section here.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.760
So how many fifths
do we have here?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.924
We have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:26.090
And we've got to be careful.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.520
These really aren't fifths.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.421
These are actually
15ths, because the whole

00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:30.420
is this thing over here.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.130
So I should really say
how many 15ths do we have?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.080
And that's where we
get this number from.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.965
But you see if 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:41.840
15.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.180
Where did that come from?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.219
I had 3, I had thirds.

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.760
And then I took each
of those thirds,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.410
and I split them into fifths.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.710
So then I have five
times as many sections.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.930
3 times 5 is 15.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.150
But now we want 4/5 of
this right over here.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.220
This is 10/15 right over here.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.530
Notice it's the
same thing as 2/3.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.730
Now if we want to
take 4/5 of that,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.700
if you have 10 of something,
that's going to be 8 of them.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.280
So we're going to
take 8 of them.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:18.440
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.310
We took 8 of the
15, so that is 8/15.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.220
You could have thought about
it the other way around.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.230
You could have
started with fifths.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.690
So let me draw it that way.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.250
So let me draw a whole.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.220
So this is a whole.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.860
Let me cut it into
five equal pieces,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.440
or as close as I can
draw five equal pieces.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.770
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.030
4/5, we're going to
shade in 4 of them.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.670
4 of the 5 equal pieces.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.660
3, 4.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.980
And now we want to
take 2/3 of that.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.500
Well, how can we do that?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.280
Well, let's split each
of these 5 into 3 pieces.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.650
So now we have
essentially 15ths again.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:19.610
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.580
We want to take 2/3
of this yellow area.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.330
We're not taking 2/3
of the whole section.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.910
We're taking 2/3 of the 4/5.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.440
So how many 15ths
do we have here?

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.660
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.610
So if you have 12 of
something, and you

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.040
want to take 2/3 of that, you're
going to be taking 8 of it.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:50.970
So you're going to be taking
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 8

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.940
of the fifteenths now.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.290
So either way, you get
to the same result.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.360
One way, you're thinking
of taking 4/5 of 2/3.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.143
Another way you could think of
it as you're taking 2/3 of 4/5.
