00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.390
Welcome to nugget number 15.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.539
So this is probably going to be a pretty controversial
video, just letting you know up front.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.809
By the end of it, some of you will either
love me or want to punch me in the face, though

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.000
you may already want to do that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.689
Today I'm going to address why animal lovers
suck the big one.

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.250
Now I'm talking specifically about animal
lovers that still consume animals and animal

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.250
products.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.559
How many people do you know who are just animal
lovers?

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:33.511
They rescue every homeless animal within a
10 mile radius of their home, and circulate

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:38.109
petitions to save the dolphins, adopt unwanted
dogs, and protect the endangered species.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.761
They post thousands of pictures of their hundreds
of cats on their Facebook profile, and in

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:47.530
between circulating leaflets of the destruction
of wildlife habitats and bringing food donations

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.489
to their local no-kill shelter, they sit down
for a nice big chicken salad.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.530
Now you may think that it is a clear conflict
of interest to love animals and yet eat them.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.410
This seems to be a familiar disconnect within
our society.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.269
The vast majority of animal lovers out there,
love to eat their animals.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.960
Now these individuals will be at your throat
if you leave your dog in your car when it's

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.250
hot outside, or if you don't spay or neuter
your cat.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.600
But invite them out to a barbecue that supports
their local animal shelter and they are all

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
for it.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560
And really, how logical are arbitrary species
distinctions?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.780
People get very up in arms about the killing
of dolphins and the eating of dogs in other

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.780
countries.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.780
You're comparing a pig, to a dog.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.840
Pigs are actually far more intelligent than
any dog breed, and have even outperformed

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.730
three-year-old human children.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.750
So why is our outrage over people eating canines,
when we continue to eat bovines and porcines?

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.590
Let's take a look at some similar dichotomous
beliefs that don't have the cloak of social

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.170
acceptability to hide behind.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.590
Say that I participate in racial protest.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.860
I advocate for the equality of all races.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.430
I probably voice my support for diversity
in politics, I always vote for the minority,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.049
and I have friends from various ethnic and
racial backgrounds.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.620
I love watching Oprah, I quote Martin Luther
King, and I think Taye Diggs is sexy as hell.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.359
And, I progressively allow my slaves to have
an education by providing them with tutors.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.359
Say I'm a feminist.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.990
I believe in the equality of the sexes.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.180
I think women deserve equal pay and respect.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.290
I participate in sit in's and protests, and
I storm the White House for women's rights.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.879
Hell I'm even a lesbian for God's sake, and
I keep my girlfriend in her place with lectures

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.360
and the occasional slap in the face.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.480
But it's for her own good.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.560
Too ridiculous, you say?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.230
How about a real example, NAMBLA.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.480
NAMBLA is the North American Man Boy Love
Association.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.720
They state that the love between a man and
boy is natural, and has its roots far back

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.720
in history.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.180
They point to a quote: "The great affection
of an elder for a younger man, such as Plato

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.450
made the very basis of his philosophy, is
that deep, spiritual affection that is as

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.020
pure as it is perfect."

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.580
NAMBLA states that "most man/boy relationships
are based on mutual respect and affection.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.590
Such relationships not harm anyone, and often
entail many benefits for both man and boy."

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.080
Here's an organization that says it's all
about promoting the well-being, freedom, and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.290
rights of young boys.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.750
Whose members dedicate their lives, identities,
and sometimes even lose their freedom, for

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.470
the cause of loving these boys.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.129
Now you may think it's absurd of me to compare
animal eating animal lovers, to grown men

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.870
advocating for the open love of young boys.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.050
Certainly, animal lovers that still eat animals
and animal bi-products aren't even in the

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.299
same league as socially active pedophiles,
right?

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.290
And I'd have to agree with you, in some minor
respects.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.690
First, the men of NAMBLA aren't saying that
it's okay to kill certain boys under certain

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.690
circumstances.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.879
Where as animal consuming animal lovers, draw
arbitrary distinctions between which animals

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.440
are to be rescued, cared for, advocated for
and loved, and which are to be tortured and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.549
killed for a meal.

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.470
In all fairness, both animal eating animal
lovers and NAMBLA members believe that they

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.959
are doing the best for those that they advocate
for.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.239
Only, animal eating animal lovers only take
this belief as far as their decided species

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.450
or circumstance determined line.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.450
Dog or Cat?

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.450
Rescue.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.450
Dolphin are endangered species?

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.450
Protect them.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.450
Cow, pig, or chicken?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.720
Torture, milk, kill, and eat them.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720
Potbelly pig?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720
Rescue.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720
Pet chicken?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.459
Love them, while eating their sisters for
dinner.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.860
Is this all too crazy for you?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.060
Do you have what you feel are some rational
or logic-based objections?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.531
You may be saying, well cats dogs are one
thing, but pigs and cows and chickens, they're

00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:14.049
here for us to eat right?

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.420
I'd like to refer you to this video to answer
that question.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.310
And what about the argument that we evolved
to eat meat, and it's just a natural thing?

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.340
Why don't you check this out, before making
that argument.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.949
And finally, maybe you're saying look, I'm
not for the torture of animals or any kind

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.360
of cruelty, I only eat animals and animal
products that had been humanely raised and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360
slaughtered.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.780
I'm sure you've guessed by now, but there's
a video that addresses that as well.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.280
Now if you enjoy the nuggets, and after this
