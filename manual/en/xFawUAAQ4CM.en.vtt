00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.870
Car chases, beautiful women, cool suits, explosions,
the life a spy can seem pretty glamorous.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.930
Today we’re going to focus on the first
one, I know sorry, that other ones are generally

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.970
more interesting, but we’re going to a look
at the 1987 Nintendo Entertainment System

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.860
release of Spy Hunter.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.019
Originally, Spy Hunter was an arcade game
released by Bally Midway.

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.980
The control was actually a steering wheel
too.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.400
Here on the Sunsoft developed NES port you’ll
be using the Nintendo controller with the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.930
D-Pad controlling steering and speed, one
button for your machine gun and another for

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.610
your special weapons, more on that later.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.909
Spy Hunter is very arcade in style.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.890
No plot, no ending, just a car, guns and a
high score.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.700
While avoiding civilians and taking down enemies
you’ll be cruising along in the G-6155 Interceptor

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.159
a suped up spy car with machine guns in the
front and fire boosters out the back!

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.530
Let’s see that one on CGR Garage sometime....

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.380
Anyway you’re not totally alone out there,
from time to time a big red truck will appear

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.109
giving you special weapons used to dispatch
foes.

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:43.920
There’s a smoke screen, making anything
behind you in a cone swerve off the road.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:53.579
My favorite, the oil slick that shoots out
the back of your car and surface-to-air missiles

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.689
for taking down helicopters that will show
up and start bombing you.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.179
It seems pretty rare that I ever actually
have missiles when the choppers show up, so

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.049
you have to just dodge their attacks.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.610
There are three other opponents that are much
more frequent however, the Switchblade car

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.770
that will come at you with wheel mounted tire
slashers instantly running you off the road

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.480
if that hit you, The Road Lord with armored
plating covering the entire vehicle making

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.340
them immune to your bullets, the only way
to deal with them is to use your spy-like

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.640
driving skill and sideswipe them off the road,
or just drive faster... and finally The Enforcer

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.400
which a limo that will pull up next to you
and shot your tire out sending you to the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.710
nearest side in fiery explosion.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.130
There are also civilian cars to avoid.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.600
Damage them and your score will freeze for
a few seconds.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.490
In my opinion, these guys are your worst enemy,
I think I ran into more motorcycles than anything

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.490
else...

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.060
The NES port of Spy Hunter is not known as
the best version by any means.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.360
I remember playing it a ton though when I
was very young.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.160
It was probably one of the few games I owned
and could actually grasp the concept of pretty

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.530
easily.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.210
Drive forward and don’t blow up.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.210
Pretty simple.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.540
The game also gives you a lead in time of
about 90 seconds where you can die as many

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.640
times as you want.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.610
I think the thing I remember the best is the
Peter Gunn theme that plays throughout the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.610
game.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.900
The developers wanted to use the James Bond
theme and I think some of the earliest versions

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.150
actually used it, but due to rights issues
it got switched and now in my head it’s

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.660
always what comes to mind when I think of
Spy Hunter.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.950
The game’s biggest criticism is the collision
detection.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.740
There’s a fairly well known glitch where
you can actually drive on the side of the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.580
road through the grass and trees and sometimes
water avoiding all the enemies.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.770
Your score won’t get any higher while you’re
doing this and there is no ending to the game,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.190
so it isn’t really that beneficial.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.180
The setting will change from time to time,
like beach and snow and there actually is

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.870
part where you can get in a boat and take
the fight to the seas so to speak.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.970
I’ve rarely reached that section, probably
because I’m not very good at Spy Hunter.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.909
Another criticism of the game is that the
game is pretty difficult.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.290
But that might be because it’s way more
fun to drive really fast and blow stuff up

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.320
rather than take it slow and get run off the
road eventually anyway.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.010
Spy Hunter was also ported to a bunch of other
older systems like Atari and Commodore 64.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.789
And there is also a newer 3D version released
in 2001 on PS2, Xbox, GameCube, and PC.

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.070
If you want the original, you can find a cartridge
or in a few different game collections like

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.570
Midway Arcade Treasures.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.639
However you do play it, pretend you’re a
secret agent and believe they are actually

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.860
hunting you...

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.590
Spy.
