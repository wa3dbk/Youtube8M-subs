00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.879
Today, we&amp;#39;ll be taking a quick look at
the gearup Lean Machine Gravity Bike Storage

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.500
Rack, with a two bike capacity, part number
GU40090.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.380
The Lean Machine Gravity Bike Stand holds
two bikes in your garage, apartment or studio.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.220
The term, Gravity Bike Stand, means that there&amp;#39;s
no drilling, no tools, or anything required

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.150
to mount the rack, or mount the stand to your
wall.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.820
All you need, is just the wall to lean it
up against, and the two pegs down at the bottom.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.700
When the bikes are in the cradles, the weight
is pushed down, and actually pushed down on

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.870
the legs of the stand, which makes the stand
hug against the wall, which is pretty nice.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:56.900
You don&amp;#39;t have to put any holes or any
drilling or anything like that to secure it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:06.369
to 
your wall.

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:23.100
If 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:55.130
you would 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:05.929
like 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:27.069
to install it on 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:46.159
your wall, there 
is 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:03:09.120
a 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:30.299
hardware 
kit 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:04:02.200
that comes 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:25.220
with it.
