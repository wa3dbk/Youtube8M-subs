Hello foodies,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.620
Today we're making these delicious fluffy
flaxseed pancakes. The flax makes sort of

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.110
healthy-ish with all them essential omega-3's
and such.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.429
To start, I have a cup of chilled all-purpose
flour in a chilled bowl. Then I'll add a tablespoon

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.040
of sugar, half a tablespoon of baking powder,
a pinch of salt and 4 tablespoons of organic

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.650
ground flax seed. This will give each serving
a good dose of omega-3, fiber, and antioxidants.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.770
Then, mix it all up with a whisk before we
add our secret ingredient to this super fluffy

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.350
recipe...which is shortening!

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.309
I'm using two tablespoons of Earth Balance
vegan shortening. You can also use either

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.800
refined or unrefined chilled coconut oil.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.219
Use a chilled pastry cutter to cut it in,
until the largest pieces are about the size

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.440
of a pea. You can also use two knives held
together if you don't have a pastry knife

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.249
like this one.

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.010
This in goes the plant-milk. I'm using soy
but you can use any kind you like. Don't forget

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.379
a quarter teaspoon of vanilla which makes
these extra nice.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.370
Stir so everything is combined. It'll look
a bit lumpy like this.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.370
Next, heat up your non-stick pan on medium
high heat. Test that it's hot enough by sprinkling

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.869
a little water. It'll evaporate right away
like this if it is.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.299
Then use a ladle to spoon out about a third
cup of batter on to your pan. I'm kinda spreading

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.130
it out a bit as I made a mess but you shouldn't
have to! It will spread out on its own.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.009
As you can see in this sped up footage, it
will spread as it cooks. The edges will start

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.899
to get dry looking and you'll see some bubbles
on the top. Takes about a minute or two.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.030
Then at this point, get your spatula under
there and you carefully flip it over. And

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.189
leave it alone for another minute.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.850
You can see the shortening melting and spitting
out those bubbles. When it stops spitting,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.009
you'll know that the pancake is ready to go.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.460
I like to put the done pancakes in the oven
with the oven light on to keep everything

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.039
hot while the rest get cooked.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.740
And that's it! Plate those fluffy pancakes,
add some Earth Balance butter which if you

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.859
didnt know tastes just like high quality butter
but it's vegan! And of course, I'm added some

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.210
Canadian maple syrup. Because, I'm Canadian!

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.080
So next time you want some freaking deliciousness
for breakfast, I hope you'll give these a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.840
try.
