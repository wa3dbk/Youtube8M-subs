00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.080
healing a broken heart is one of the hardest things to do

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.060
every girl knows that one of the best ways to pick yourself up after a difficult breakup

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.040
is a fresh makeover

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.060
for a new start, I'm going to show you how to create this

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.560
fresh-faced makeup look

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.560
you'll be ready to take on the world

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.910
start by using a CC cream and apply this 
product with your fingers

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.430
sponge or brush and blend away

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.420
CC cream is great to use because it will care and condition your skin

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.980
as it conceals these little imperfections

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.980
apply this salmon-colored concealer to 
brighten up your tired eyes

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.780
and gently blend with your ring finger

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.580
it will neutralize those blues

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.500
sweep powder all over your face to set your makeup

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.840
this is my favorite powder compact to use

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.140
because it's so light and it locks everything in place

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.480
without looking cakey

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.000
here I'm using my shade play eye
palette in "madagascar taupes"

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.800
dab the shimmering highlighting 
eyeshadow on the center of your lid

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.500
to help make your eyes pop

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.979
next dab a little bit of the shimmering peach color

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.860
on the outer corner of your eyes

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.180
and blend into the center of your lids

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.290
use a small brush to line the lower lash line

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.910
from the inner corner out

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.300
using the madagascar taupe color

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.020
line the outer half of your lower lash line

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.380
with the same color, sweep the eyeshadow over the outer corner of your lid

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.200
to create a soft natural shadow

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.250
and now just line your upper lash line

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.250
sweeping the shadow up and out

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.200
to intensify the definition

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.280
layer this soft black shadow over the existing liner 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.120
on your upper lash line

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.630
as always, sweep up and out

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.160
to open up your eyes, make sure to curl your lashes

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.460
and then apply mascara

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.000
stick to a waterproof mascara

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
just in case you have a sad moment

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.900
fill in your brows with your favorite brow pencil

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.340
and brush away any harsh marks to soften the lines

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.480
finally, give yourself a cute pout with this sorbet lip balm

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.760
now your look is complete

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.210
part of feeling good is looking good

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.400
wishing you the best 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.080
have fun and good luck
