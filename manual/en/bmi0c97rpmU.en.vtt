00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.350
wow! beautiful arn't they?

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.829
You ever wonder how candles became such an
important part of the church?

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:17.829
Why they are always around, what are they all
mean, and are they all used for?

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.660
and as the uh... church to discount buying in bulk?
buying in bulk

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.240
I've often wonder these things myself that's
why we're

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.309
talking about

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.309
candles on this episode of Chuck Knows Church [fun intro music]

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.089
[OWW!!] I'm good. Thank you. Flame retardant attire

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.000
uh... rough start

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.250
Okay, so

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.659
Christians started using oil lamps or
candles in worship

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.600
for the same reason we might use electric lights
electric lights

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.150
In order to see better

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.520
to learn more you can ask your pastor...

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.750
tell them, oh wait, sorry... There's more, I know there's more that's just the tip of the iceberg

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.500
Really um okay so right uh... so in the
early church by Sunday was a work day in

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.730
the roman empire so Christians had to
gather for worship very early in the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.250
morning or in the evening when there
wasn't that much light.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.800
Then when Christianity became a legal
religion in the early fourth century

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.600
they could worship more often while the
sun was shining

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.870
but they kept using the candles a for
another reason

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.820
they symbolize the presence of the light of Christ
light of christ

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.330
whenever they worshiped.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.130
That's why to begin worship service many
churches will use young members of the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.380
church called acolytes to light candles
around the altar

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.340
they are reminding us that the light of Christ

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.040
is with us.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.719
Then at the conclusion of worship

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.760
they take the. I'm good seriously, I'm fine.
thank you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.719
You light yourself on fire one time..

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.769
They take that light from the candle
with them, or with us, the light of

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.769
Christ out into the world symbolizing
the light of Christ that never goes out.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.239
So whether it's in the narthex, the native,
Paschal Candle at Easter, Advent candles

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.859
at Christmas time

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.079
it's about Christ

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.639
the light of the world and us the
followers of Christ also lights in the

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:43.499
world

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:50.499
all representing the eternal presence of God
of god

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.739
a light, that never goes out. Before I burn the place down.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.509
uh... if you'd like to learn more you
can ask a pastor

00:02:55.509 --> 00:03:02.509
It's the light of the Lord

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.530
What are you going to do? Can't blow it out.
