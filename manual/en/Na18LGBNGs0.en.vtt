00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.139
My name is Anna Santos. I am the director of the animal blood bank

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.800
and its was started just out of the
development need

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.550
for blood for patients here at Georgia so

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.829
it started small and has now expanded to where
it's at.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.029
The donors are pretty much in-house

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.110
what I mean by that is they are somewhat 
related to

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.640
vet school community which is a pretty big
pool. so there are other students staff

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.020
periodically they can be friends a

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.210
if they have a good understanding and
here

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.329
look for stalling need it me their size

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.430
that they have to be at least fifty
pounds and up

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.610
they need to be healthy course and they
need to have it

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.880
be somewhat behaviorally

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.570
tolerable they have to the it handle
quite a bit

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.810
we will sedate them if they're excited
they have to be comfortable in the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.430
environment

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.290
and so if they're not they showing signs
of aggression

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.420
don't use let there be is utilized in a
lot of different areas than a medicine

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.880
a it's not just day have a massive
hemorrhage

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.569
have lost a lot of blood there are
several other

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.670
a problems that they can have they would

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.499
you lies different products majority
that we do years whole blood

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.039
packed red blood cells and pressures and
plasma our store it

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.939
pretty expensive on the product it bears
obviously on the size

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.099
and can and in the product but it can go
from 100 to 500 dollars

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.729
her unit product using we use the

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.429
exact same banks that we will use in the
Hindu nation and there's a set amount of

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.219
blood you need to have in that bag

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.049
because there's a in to quell
preservative in there

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.060
he has had a great race use centrifuge
down and then we

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.899
divided now and sites that we want

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.220
for that nation I cannot keep up with

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.400
the demand for plasma the university
needs

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.670
can almost keep it was my red cells

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.990
depending on what comes in the biggest
challenges

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.090
would be of course to meet the demand
because we're all happen is we'll have a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.050
