00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.490
On the following day, all the junk is in the
bottom of the flask and the gold solution

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.170
is ready to be filtered.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.800
It is highly recommend using a proper laboratory
filters and not store bought coffee filters.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.970
I'm using medium-slow speed filters, which
will strain any solid particle over 5 microns.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.480
The fluted filter paper sets in the funnel
as soon as it gets wet.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.180
First, the bulk of the gold solution which
is free and clear of solid particles is poured

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.100
to the filter. This portion will run down
very fast.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.000
Here in the flask you can see the remaining
junk, I'll just wash it several times with

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
water and pour it down the filter. The bulk
of the solids are left in the flask.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.060
Please remember to wash the filter with plenty
of water so that all of the yellow gold bearing

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.850
solution will run down to the receiving flask.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.000
When you are done, the filter should be white
again.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.610
Our next step is to remove the gold from the
solution.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:46.000
This is done by using Sodium Meta-bisulfite
or in short S.M.B., The S.M.B is first dissolved

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.570
in water and then added to a stirred Gold
solution.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.219
The S.M.B will react with the Gold ions in
the solution and reduce it to metallic gold

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.500
powder. As a result,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.049
some Sulfur Dioxide gas will release... It's
pretty toxic so the reaction must be done

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:04.829
under a fume-hood.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.869
Btw, you don't really have to use a magnetic
stirrer like in this video, it is just my

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.010
personal favorite.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.000
The solution is again left to settle overnight

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.829
Here you can see the gold powder all settled
to the bottom of the flask and the supernatant

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.079
is practically colorless. This is a good indication
for purity.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:36.079
The bulk of the solution is slowly decanted
and the washing cycles begin.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:48.760
The washing cycles are extremely important
if commercially pure gold is wanted.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.579
Starting with simple tap water wash... The
Gold powder is covered with boiling hot water,

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.449
swirled for a while and left cool back down.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.000
This water wash is repeated two more times.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.300
Take note of the color of the Gold powder
prior to the acid wash.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Now for the acid wash, the powder is simply
covered with Hydrochloric acid 32% and brought

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.440
to a gentle boil.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.510
Take note of the color of the solution...
The acid dissolve traces of Copper, Nickel

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.260
and silver chloride and it will also dissolve
some Gold.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.030
The acid wash is left to cool down and later
decanted. The process is repeated until the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.000
acid wash doesn't gain any color anymore.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.590
It usually takes three to five washes.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.199
In between each acid wash, it will be a good
idea to do a quick water wash so that a better

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.030
indication of color change can be seen on
the next wash.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.910
I like to keep the acid washes in a separate
container and use it later to dissolve more

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.000
dirty Gold.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.500
Take a close look on the powder after the
acid washes... The color is clearly lighter.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.000
Which is another good indication for purity.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.120
The powder is later washed several times with
Distilled water and placed on a hot plated

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.560
to slowly dry out.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.000
And here's the result.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.400
I hope you found this demonstration useful
and interesting... Please comment, Share and
