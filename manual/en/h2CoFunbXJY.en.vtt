00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:09.447
(upbeat pop music)

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.257
- Hello, everyone!

00:00:18.257 --> 00:00:18.989
How's it going?

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.793
Anne here, and today I'm
going to share with you guys

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:24.596
some of my tips that I like to,

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:26.911
some of my tips and
products that I like to use

00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.811
to obtain nice, smooth, and soft skin.

00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:31.964
Now that summer is almost over,

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:35.907
and it's going to transition
into a new season, fall time,

00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:37.978
it's time that we take
good care of our skin

00:00:37.978 --> 00:00:39.481
because over the summertime

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:41.310
we tend to hang out in the sun,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.789
and it really dries up and
suck out all the moisture

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:44.865
from our skin.

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:47.039
And plus when the season changes,

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.010
your body needs to readjust.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.509
So it's time that you take
good care of yourself,

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:52.810
have some me time.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.211
I'm going to share with you guys

00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.898
different products that you can use,

00:00:55.898 --> 00:00:57.111
and that will enhance your whole

00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:59.041
overall bath experience.

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.850
And so the first thing I
want to share with you guys

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.267
is a dry body brush.

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:04.624
This one is by Bathery.

00:01:04.624 --> 00:01:06.331
I love this 'cause it has a handle.

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.241
All the Bathery products
that I will be showing

00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.658
you guys are from Target,
and you can find it there.

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:13.280
So what I love about a
dry brush is that you can

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.455
exfoliate before taking a bath

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:17.445
or before taking a shower.

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:19.457
The great thing about a dry body brush

00:01:19.457 --> 00:01:21.732
is that it improves blood circulation,

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:22.809
and at the same time,

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:25.776
you're brushing off all the
dead skin cells on your body.

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:28.477
So the way I use this is
that I just go in very

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:31.688
light motion, and I brush toward my heart.

00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:34.655
And this should really, really feel good,

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:37.194
especially if you are feeling itchy,

00:01:37.194 --> 00:01:38.392
you have dry itchy skin,

00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:40.647
it feels really, really good.

00:01:40.647 --> 00:01:43.594
So in the bathtub I also
like to mix in some salt.

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:45.909
And sometimes I would mix in epsom salt.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.332
It's very inexpensive.

00:01:47.332 --> 00:01:49.363
Or I would use a therapeutic salt

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:51.862
that has like a nice lavender scent to it

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:54.017
because it's nice and relaxing.

00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:56.982
It just really calms down the overall mood

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:58.323
in your bathtub.

00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:01.228
So after exfoliating with a dry brush,

00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:03.322
you want to use something that is soft

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.906
and gentle on your skin.

00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:08.685
Therefore, this delicate
bath bomb is, bath bomb?

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:09.763
I said, "Bath bomb."

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:13.034
Bath sponge is perfect for the job.

00:02:13.034 --> 00:02:15.979
And you just have to
squeeze in some body wash,

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.925
and just, you know, kind of massage it

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:21.241
onto your skin.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.333
So speaking of massage,

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.626
I also have this massager that you can use

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:28.170
in the bathtub.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.298
And if you want more of a deep massage,

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:33.655
and if you have an area on your body

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:36.585
that is tense, aside from the epsom salt

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.551
that will help you, this is also great.

00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:42.336
So the way you use this
is that you push this

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:43.716
on your problem area,

00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:46.561
and then you just go in
like circular motion,

00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.861
just like this.

00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:50.035
And it feels really, really good.

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:53.807
At the same time, it just
relieve all that tension on you.

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:57.252
Alright, it's also really important to

00:02:57.252 --> 00:02:59.710
take care of the skin on your feet.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.977
And I absolutely love this wand

00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:05.927
because it has like everything I need

00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:09.198
to give my feet a little pedicure.

00:03:09.198 --> 00:03:12.002
So it has a pumice, a
brush on the other side,

00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:13.810
and then down here
there's like two buffers

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.029
that you can use.

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:16.959
So I would use the pumice first.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.845
And then I would use either
one or the other buffer,

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:21.409
depending on how bad, you know,

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.542
my skin is, and how rough it is.

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:25.228
And then I would use the brush to like

00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:27.423
brush it off, and like
clean off all the dirt

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:29.251
that's stuck in between, you know,

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:32.014
the texture on my feet.

00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:34.330
If you want like smooth skin on your foot

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.134
then definitely get something like this.

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:39.369
It's so, so helpful.

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.685
Alright guys, another
great option for scrubbing

00:03:41.685 --> 00:03:44.733
and exfoliating are these bath gloves.

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:47.922
And they're just another
great way of cleaning.

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:50.218
If you don't want to use the bath sponge,

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:52.362
and if you want more of an exfoliation,

00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:54.375
then you can use these bath gloves.

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:56.669
I like to take these
with me while travelling

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.071
because it takes up less space,

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.911
and it fits in my shower
caddy a lot better.

00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:04.390
So, after your bath, make
sure to dry up nicely,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.535
and then moisturize yourself
with a deep moisturizer.

00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:10.790
Now if you have super dry hands

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.858
and super dry feet, then
you might want to use

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:17.576
some gloves and socks before bedtime,

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:19.465
and, well, during bedtime.

00:04:19.465 --> 00:04:21.396
So these are also from Bathery.

00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:24.057
And they're super cool
because you can wear them

00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:27.284
during bedtime, like
while you're sleeping.

00:04:27.284 --> 00:04:29.539
And then in the morning
time, when you wake up,

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.535
you can take them off,

00:04:30.535 --> 00:04:33.420
and your hands will
feel super moisturized,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.472
and your feet will feel super soft.

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:38.357
And you guys are going to
love, love the feeling of that.

00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:42.725
Alright guys, so that concludes
my ultimate bath me time.

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:44.655
