00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.770
Today in our 2010 Kawasaki Mule, we&amp;#39;ll
be installing the QuadGear Extreme All Weather

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:15.040
UTV Cab Enclosure, part number CA18031.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.730
To begin our install, with our cab enclosure
laid out, we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and identify

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.070
the rear by the tag that indicates the back.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.490
We can then take the enclosure and lay it
over top of the roll cage.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:41.550
We&amp;#39;ll go ahead and center the top roll
cage straps around the bars and then buckle

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.880
them into place.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.080
We&amp;#39;ll secure the back of the cab enclosure
with the lower buckle straps.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.670
To make this easier, we&amp;#39;re going to go
ahead and release the locks and lift up on

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.890
the dump end until it locks in position.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:02:00.569
Now, we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and take the buckle
straps, release them, feed the buckle around

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:53.739
the lower support 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:28.870
bar 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:47.290
and then resnap 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.470
the buckle.
