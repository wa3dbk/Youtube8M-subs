00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.250
Now the L is that simple. Just don't pull
this stroke at too far otherwise you are going

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:26.259
to end up with that big gaping space.
I sort of like it that there is an ever so

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.640
slight slant outward with that first stroke
on the M. Now I want to think in terms making

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.079
sure this is a symmetrical letter. Bilaterally
symmetrical. Just the way we are. Bilaterally

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:55.579
symmetrical. I am comfortable with that. The
N wants to have; this is going to be as fine

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.739
line a stroke as that first stroke on the
A. The N is not narrow. It's a one story letter.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:11.810
Tendency is to make it too narrow. Cross stoke
or diagonal. They call that the diagonal.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:26.150
Think. Think. Okay. Two strokes for the O
starting right about here. Thinking round.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:36.040
Thinking about the counter appearing. Creating
the counter. Here's our join. It thickens

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.680
and it thins and the join is a follow through.
You want to follow through. The same way that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:51.480
you would follow through with a stroke in
golf or in tennis or other things. Now I think

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.370
of the P as relating to the F in that we got
a bowl on top and nothing on the bottom. Remember

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:07.820
I told you about how often leave a space right
there. Think I will go and put the Q down

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:22.069
here. Now, if you are really good, you are
going to make the Q exactly like your O. Remember

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.109
there is an axis. There is an axis you want
to harmonize in all of your round strokes.I

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:34.879
am going to let that tail, the tail of the
Q, thats its distinguishing characteristic,

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.569
minimal. I would go into that counter personally.
