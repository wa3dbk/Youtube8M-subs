00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.600
The President:
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.533
For the last several months, I
have been urging Congress to

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.433
pass a jobs bill that will
do two big things for small

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:14.934
businesses -- cut their taxes and make loans more available.

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:18.433
I have been adamant about this
because small businesses are the

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.734
backbone of our economy.

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:24.967
They create two out of every
three new jobs in this country.

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:27.033
And while a lot of big
businesses and big banks have

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.300
started recovering
from this recession,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.100
small businesses and community
banks that loan to small

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.700
businesses have
been lagging behind.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.367
They need help.

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:42.233
And if we want this economy to
create more jobs more quickly,

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.300
we need to help them.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.633
A report yesterday from the
Labor Department underscores why

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:49.600
this is so critical.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.767
In the final few
months of last year,

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:55.033
small businesses with fewer than
50 employees accounted for more

00:00:55.033 --> 00:01:01.767
than 60% of the job losses in America -- more than 60%.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:04.567
These are the businesses that
usually create most of the jobs

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.266
in this country.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.400
And this report, combined
with this morning's news that

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.367
unemployment claims rose
again, compels us to act.

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:18.233
It compels us to stand with the
small businessmen and women who

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:21.000
are trying to grow their
companies and make payroll and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.233
hire new workers.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:26.100
The jobs bill that is stalled
in Congress would completely

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.567
eliminate taxes on key
investments in small businesses.

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:34.400
It would allow small business
owners to write off more expenses.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.433
And it would make it easier
for community banks to do more

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:40.800
lending to small businesses,
while allowing small firms to

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.767
take out larger SBA
loans with fewer fees,

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:46.633
which countless entrepreneurs
have told me would make a big

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:48.734
difference in their companies.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:52.367
I'd also like to point out this
legislation is fully paid for

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:56.934
and will not add one
single dime to our deficit.

00:01:56.934 --> 00:02:00.967
So this is a bill
that makes sense,

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:03.934
and normally we would expect
Democrats and Republicans to

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:05.967
join together.

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:09.033
Unfortunately, a partisan
minority in the Senate so far

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:13.500
has refused to allow this jobs
bill to come up for a vote.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.967
Now, I recognize that there
are times when Democrats and

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:19.200
Republicans have legitimate
differences rooted in different

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.734
views about what's
best for this country.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:28.166
There are times when good
people disagree in good faith.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.734
But this is not
one of those times.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:36.700
This small business jobs bill is
based on ideas both Democrat and Republican.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.100
In fact, many provisions in the
bill were actually authored by

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.400
Republican senators.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.767
It has been praised as being
good for small business by

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.633
groups like the Chamber of
Commerce and the National

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:50.300
Federation of
Independent Businesses.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.266
A majority of senators are in
favor of the bill and yet the

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:57.834
obstruction continues.

00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:00.900
It's obstruction that stands in
the way of small business owners

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.367
getting the loans and the tax
cuts that they need to prosper.

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.567
It's obstruction that
defies common sense.

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:10.600
So let me just make
this simple point.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.133
There will be plenty of time
between now and November to play politics.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:18.367
But the small business
owners I met with this week,

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:21.333
the ones that I've met with
across the country this year,

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.066
they don't have time
for political games.

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:27.333
They're not interested in what's
best for a political party.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:31.233
They're interested in what's
best for the country.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.633
When Congress reconvenes, this
jobs bill will be the first

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:36.867
business out of the gate.

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:39.233
And the Senate Republican
leadership needs to stop its

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:41.233
efforts to block it.

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:44.266
Let's put aside the partisanship
for awhile and work together for

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:47.633
small businesses, for employees,
and the communities that depend

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:49.967
on them across
this great country.

00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:51.100
Thank you very much.
