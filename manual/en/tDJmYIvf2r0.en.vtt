Today on our 2006 Chrysler 300c were going
to install part #: AR350-532, this is the

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.590
Power Aid throttle body spacer.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.450
To start off our install were going to go
ahead and remove the negative battery cable.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.410
Now well go ahead and remove the air intake
assembly.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.650
Well unsnap the air box, then well go over
to our clamp on the throttle body.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
Well go ahead and loosen up that clamp and
theres a small chamber off to the left hand

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.530
side that you can pop off from its rubber
fitting.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:01:54.770
Then we can go ahead and take the unit off
as one piece.
