Dr. Biden: I don't
really lecture a lot in

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.236
my classroom.

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:06.406
Maybe just a little, and
then we're on computers, and

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.342
then groups of (inaudible).

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.544
You know, we're
moving very fast.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.546
♪(piano music)♪

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:14.147
Hi.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:14.714
I'm Jill Biden.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:15.582
How are you?

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:21.087
(applause)

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.255
(laughter)

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:25.558
You know, we're
moving very fast.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.728
And, you know, because
they get bored.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.930
You know (laughs) right?

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.733
Right, and you don't want
to be boring, do you?

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.170
No, as teachers we want to
be dynamic and vibrant and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.639
exciting, and we want
them to want to be in

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:42.108
our classroom.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.710
And that's important.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.911
I mean, that's
important to me.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.045
It's important to you
as teacher, right?

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:50.617
And they are learning, but
they're excited to learn.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:55.388
That's -- like you said,
that's my philosophy.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.323
I taught high
school and college.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.391
I'm still teaching.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.227
In August 16th I think I go
back just like all of you

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.896
do, move in the classroom.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.933
The one thing as Second
Lady that I try to do is, I

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.336
travel around the United
States and also to other

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.238
countries like Vietnam.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:17.277
I try to celebrate teachers,
because I know how hard you

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:20.947
work, and I think people
don't understand what our

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:22.715
job is really like.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.285
It's not like we go home
at night and, you know, we

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:29.556
forget about it, and --
really have to work.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.824
That's exactly right.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.159
So you're preparing for the
next day's lesson, you're

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.596
grading papers; you might
be doing research,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:37.730
you're reading.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.934
It's like all-encompassing,
isn't it?

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.702
Thank you for
being teachers.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.437
I know who you are.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.372
I know what your jobs are.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.942
(applause)

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.211
Thank you for what
you do, really.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.879
You're just --
you're amazing.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.947
Thank you.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.849
(applause)

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.650
Thank you.
