"Hey everyone!

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.529
This is Sarah from SewingPartsOnline.com and
today we're going to be going over our 1/4"

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.890
feet and now we have a couple to choose from.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.480
This is a 1/4" foot with the guide, a 1/4"
foot without the guide, and this, the accessory

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.120
that goes with it, is our quilting guide.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:38.230
I'm going to show you exactly how to use all
three.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.980
We have two different 1/4" pressure feet,
one with the guide and one without.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.489
This one does not have the guide, you just
simply follow around the edge; and this one...

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.489
does have the guide.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.000
I prefer to use this one; it just...I think
it works better for me.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.120
But they're both simple snap-ons.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:09.550
All you have to do is remove the foot you
have on, slide it underneath the shank 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.990
and clamp it on.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.080
Same for the other one.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.590
Place it underneath the shank and clamp it
on.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.310
Now to use your quilting guide the most important
thing is to have a walking foot already installed

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.500
and if you need instructions for how to install
your walking foot you can check out our video,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.170
'How to Use a Walking Foot'.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.479
It has great instructions on how to install
your walking foot.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.149
So you can see here in the back of your walking
foot, depending on which brand you have, you

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.740
either have a large hole or a shelf.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.180
So mine has a hole, so what I'm going to do
is slide this in, and you can adjust this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.290
to be as close to the foot or as far away
from the foot as you like and that determines

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.299
the width of your quilting stitches.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.430
Now to install the quilting bar onto your
shank with your 1/4” foot already on, we're

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.619
going to go ahead and locate the hole right
here at the top of the shank.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.549
We just take the end of the bar and slide
it through.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:23.150
And you slide it in and out depending on what
width you need while sewing.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.340
First we're going to go over the 1/4” foot
with the built-in guide.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.099
I really like this one because I find it easier
to line up your fabrics so when you're doing

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:39.150
your quilt piecing this is really the foot
you need to make sure all the seams are perfect.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.550
Just line it up and sew along the edge.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.709
Couldn't be easier.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:53.400
When I get to the end, we can see that it
is completely even!

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400
Perfect!

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400
Perfect!

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400
Perfect!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400
Open it up.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.010
It looks great!

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.470
So now we're going to go ahead and demonstrate
the 1/4” foot without the guide on the side.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:17.420
All you do is line your seam up against this
outside toe right here...and we'll go ahead

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.170
and show both seams with the guide and without
and you'll see that both are exactly a 1/4”.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.080
Nice, neat, perfect!

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.660
So now that we have our walking foot installed
and we have our quilting guide installed,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.970
we can go ahead and start quilting.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.290
With this I have a single piece of fabric
over some batting.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.040
I've drawn one line that I'm going to follow.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.090
This is going to be the like guideline for
the whole rest of our quilting.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.180
So really...in other situations you would
have to draw all your lines with a chalk or

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.500
some kind of transfer.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.220
With this just draw one and we'll keep following
it consecutively and I'll show you how.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.050
So here we go; we're going to start and we're
just going to follow the one line as best

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:12.340
as we can.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:26.180
And we're going to start all over again...and
follow this line.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.909
And we'll just keep doing this over and over
and over again until your quilt is completely

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:31.909
finished.

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:38.339
Sot this is definitely a great time saver
and great for better accuracy.

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:43.790
Now this doesn’t have to be that width as
we said during the installation you can move

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.400
this quilting guide as far or as close as
you need for your project.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.100
So now that we have our 1/4” foot and our
quilting bar installed, I'm just going to

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.289
go ahead and show you how to use it.

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.219
The same as what we did with our walking foot;
just going to adjust it to wherever I want

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:02.219
the bar to guide me.

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:12.539
So, for instance I can put it up all the way
against the edge of the 1/4” foot and...just

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.169
use that as kind of a guide.

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.729
Similar to the 1/4” foot with the built-in
guide.

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.779
Or...I can extend it out all the way over
here and and it's going to help me make sure

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.640
that all of my quilting stitches are in even
intervals.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:39.570
This is really great for creating those cross-checkered
patterns and stuff on your quilts; like what

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.520
you see with pre-quilted fabric.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:06:02.210
Instead of drawing a million lines I can just
follow the same one!

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:21.320
And if I want to go across I've already got
it measure out to what I want.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:28.130
There we go!

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.010
Very, very easy!

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.800
So that was the 1/4” foot.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.529
