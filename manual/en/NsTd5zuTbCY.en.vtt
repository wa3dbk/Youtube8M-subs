00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.040
Hey everyone my name is Justin Jackrel and
I am the president here at citEcar Electric

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.700
Vehicles.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.760
Today I want to talk to you about out newest
model, the 6PR XLC.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.310
XLC stands for extra long charge.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.590
When we first came on to the scene it 2005
building our electric vehicles here in Gainesville

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.520
Florida, most of the other golf carts in the
industry were averaging between 25 and 35

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.830
miles per charge.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.230
We didn't think this was sufficient, so our
vehicles all get currently up to 50 miles

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.300
per charge.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.010
Now we are not one to rest on our morals,
so we are trying to get the largest range

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.070
out of any electric vehicle on the market
in this category, the low speed vehicles,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.730
so we put together this XLC model.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.360
It has the most powerful solar panel that
we can get on this roof.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.950
It has an upgraded AC motor to give us more
range, and we installed T145 Trojan batteries.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.660
With these three combined with the already
great system that these vehicles have, we

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.570
are looking to get the longest range out of
all low speed vehicles on the market.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.950
Now we will be doing a test of this later
today and will be documenting the results.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.470
Our goal is to be getting approximately 75
miles per charge.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.580
So what we are going to do now is I will come
in and zoom in on the odometer, show you what

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.610
we are currently at, and we will be driving
this around all day and at the end of the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.160
day we will be giving you a result of what
the range is.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.450
Okay, so as you can see here we are currently
at 5.3 miles on the odometer and we are about

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.670
to start the testing.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.300
Alright so Justin Jackrel here back with ya,
it is now five minutes till 5:00 and Devin

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.679
here has been doing the driving since 9:50
this morning.

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.130
I wanted to give you a recap of how many miles
we have gone but the vehicle is still going.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.140
We were hoping for 75 miles for this charge
but we are now at 95.5 miles and still going

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.140
strong.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.899
So now we are going to keep driving and see
how many miles we can get.

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.850
Now our goal is to get up to 100 miles to
the charge.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.710
Let's see if we can do it.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.580
96 miles without a single charge, and today
hasn't even been fully sunny.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.860
We have had partly cloudy almost the entire
day, so that is obviously going to make us

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.920
have less range coming from our solar panel.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.800
On a fully sunny day with some stop and go
throughout the day, you will easily get 100

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.860
miles to the charge.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.030
This vehicle has gone non stop since 9:50
this morning.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.150
Okay so we are at the end of day one are at
103.2 miles on the odometer.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.890
The vehicle is still driving, we will be putting
this vehicle away for the night, we will not

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.560
charge it up tonight and we will complete
the test in the morning.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.150
So here we are at the end of testing and you
see that the odometer reads 110.3, we started

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.900
at 5.3, so this cart just got 105 miles on
this a single charge!

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.090
You will see we still do have power, it is
just slowing down now though.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.240
The top speed isn't nearly what it used to
be so we are ending the test now at 105 miles

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.890
gained.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.520
Alright so we just completed the testing and
as i showed you we were able to get 105 miles

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.350
on a single charge of this vehicle.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.340
Most of the testing was done during a partly
cloudy day and the vehicle never stopped driving

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.970
from the beginning to the end.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.581
So if you were to use it in a more systematic
setting where you were actually stopping it

00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:28.950
throughout the day and allowing the solar
panel to charge the batteries up, you would

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.819
be able to get even more than that 105 miles.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.700
So once again remember barriers are always
meant to be broken.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.900
We here at citEcar Electric Vehicles are always
looking for a way to push it one step further.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.970
Everyone else says 30-40 miles is the standard,
now 105 miles has been achieved.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.190
We can get this vehicle for you.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.160
It is perfect for commercial applications,
residential uses, or even rental fleets.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.030
If you have any questions please feel free
to give us a call, the phone number and contact

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.200
information will be at the end of this vehicle.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.120
You can visit us online at citEcarEV.com.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.790
Once again I thank you for watching this video,
I look forward to working with you soon.
