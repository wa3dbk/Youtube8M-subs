00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.770
Intro Scope
We have previously learned about the formation

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.920
of ions.
Now, we will learn about ionic bonds.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.790
Ions, as you already know, are formed from
the loss or gain of electrons.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.330
Electrons, however, do not suddenly appear
or disappear.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.960
They are, in fact, transferred from one atom
to another.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.030
Let's look at NaCl as an example.
Na loses one electron to form a Na+ ion.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:42.160
The electron is not "lost", but transferred
to Cl to form a Cl- ion.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.210
So we have a Na+ ion and a Cl- ion.
They are oppositely charged ions and will

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.269
be electrostatically attracted to one another,
much like how opposite poles of a magnet are

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.429
attracted to one another.
This electrostatic attraction is an ionic

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:06.000
bond.
NaCl is an ionic compound because it is held

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.250
in tact by ionic bonds.
The same thing happens with Mg and O.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.820
Why don't you grab a piece of paper and a
pencil, and draw the resulting ionic compound,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.630
magnesium oxide?
Please pause the lesson and resume when you

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.730
are done.
Mg transfers its two valence electrons to

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:38.530
O, forming Mg2+ and O2-.
The resulting ions are electrostatically attracted

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.630
to one another, forming an ionic bond.
Did you get this right? Did you remember to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.220
include the charges on the ion?
Now, let's look at Ca and Cl.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.909
Ca loses two electrons to form a Ca2+ ion.
One of the electrons is transferred to one

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:09.259
Cl atom, and another is transferred to another
Cl atom, forming two Cl- ions.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:18.420
Ca2+ is electrostatically attracted to both
Cl- ions, because the opposite charges must

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.209
balance each other out.
In all three examples, the resulting ionic

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.069
compounds have an overall neutral charge because
all charges are balanced out.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.819
In summary, an ionic bond is defined as the
electrostatic attraction between oppositely

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.540
charged ions.
When an ionic compound is formed, the charges

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.090
must be balanced so that the resulting ionic
compound has an overall neutral charge.
