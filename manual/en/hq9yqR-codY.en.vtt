PAUL JAY: Welcome to The Real News Network.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.030
I'm Paul Jay.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.440
In an earlier interview, we talked about the
fire sale of European public assets that is

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.910
taking place during the current crisis.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.050
Now we're going to talk about some possible
alternatives to that strategy.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.510
Now joining us from Davis, California, is
Nick Buxton.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.419
He's communication manager for Transnational
Institute, which provides critical analysis

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.019
for movements working for social and environmental
justice.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.080
Thanks for joining us again, Nick.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.800
NICK BUXTON: Hi, Paul.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.500
JAY: So talk a little bit about your organization
and what you've been talking about in terms

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.250
of what might be an alternative strategy to
privatization.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.440
BUXTON: Well, we've been working for a number
of years particularly on water privatization

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.519
and supporting movements who are fighting
water privatization in the south.

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.850
But more recently, in more recent years, we've
been looking at a really interesting trend

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.850
that's happening.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.000
As cities across the whole world have been
experiencing the negative impacts of privatization,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.880
they've been--some cities have actually reclaimed
control over their water.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.020
And we've documented what have been some of
those experiences.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.500
Perhaps the most famous example is Paris.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.690
Now, Paris is the home of Suez and Veolia,
two of the biggest water multinationals in

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.330
the world, who privatized and took over privatized
water systems right across the globe.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.530
Their city decided, despite being the home
of these two multinationals, to take back,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.860
about two or three years ago, the water back
into public hands.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.020
Of course, it led to a lot of resistance from
those companies and a lot of attempts at sabotage.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.990
But when they took back control, they were
able to start to tackle some of those arguments

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.760
around efficiency and show that they were
rather fraudulent, and they found, rather,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.610
by putting it in public hands, they were able
to save, in their case--in the first year,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.660
they saved EUR 35 million, which led them
to reduce all the rates right across the board

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.600
by 8 percent for ordinary Parisians.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.650
So they showed that this--what was really
happening was that the state subsidies and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.260
the high water rates were really going towards
short-term profits and not being invested

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.230
in the network and not benefiting consumers.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.469
And they were also able to do things that
private companies wouldn't do, for example,

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:23.060
setting up very interesting public-public
partnerships with other water utilities, particularly

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.980
in the south, supporting developing countries,
creating whole issues around transparency,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.120
setting up a website where people could see
what was being repaired, what was being done

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.769
long-term, even having public participation
in some decisions about where priorities should

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.819
go in terms of future investments.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.150
So they not only showed that this idea that
private isn't always efficient is wrong; they

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.550
also showed that public can, especially if
it's been reinvented and include concepts

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.319
around participation, transparency, solidarity,
can play a much bigger social role.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.689
And that's not something that's just happening
in Paris.

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.569
We looked at communities in Tanzania, in Dar
es Salaam, where they reclaimed their water

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.920
and the benefits that that's brought to people
in Dar es Salaam.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.049
Again, in Canada, Hamilton, Canada, and Malaysia,
we looked at--right across the continent.

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.049
There were lessons.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.799
JAY: What was the Canadian example?

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.319
Because there you have a--.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.030
BUXTON: It was in Hamilton, Canada.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.969
They took back their water, and they managed
to save CAD 6 million and have also been able

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.819
to reduce their rates.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.579
So I know a bit less about the Hamilton example,
but they were one of the cities that has been

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.440
able to, again, have a bigger picture than
just one of saving money, which they've been

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.720
able to do, but also one of looking more socially
and have a--could be more of a public--in

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.780
the broad sense of a public good.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.040
JAY: And are there any cities now that are
sort of fighting that battle to either prevent

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.019
privatization or to publicize something that
has been privatized?

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.920
BUXTON: Yeah, there's many examples.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.939
Indonesia, in Jakarta, there are struggles
going on.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.019
And there are lots of struggles across the
world which are fighting around these issues.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.000
And some of the re-municipalizations haven't
been successful.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.100
And I was reading the other day of one in
Bolivia that's been reclaimed, but people

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.270
are really saying it hasn't lived up to the
expectations.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.310
So it's not a question that you re-municipalize,
you necessarily have success.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.160
But if--what we were trying to show are the
more successful case studies.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.640
And they have largely been successful.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.390
But what are the learning points?

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.010
How can we make sure this experience is universalized?

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.090
Because one of the things I think we're also
trying to show is that it's not a question

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.380
of returning.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.170
Ninety percent of the--in terms of water,
90 percent is still in public hands.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.280
It's a better solution than a private solution.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.430
But it also has in some cases serious problems.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.510
And we need to reinvent public and make sure
it brings in concepts around transparency,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.940
participation, to really ensure that it's
a dynamic public good that serves people and

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.960
serves communities.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.000
JAY: Is there a model of that somewhere?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.190
BUXTON: Well, that's--I think these are some
of the examples that we looked at, and in

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.190
particular Paris, Hamilton, Malaysia, in Dar
es Salaam.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.750
JAY: So in Paris, what is that transparency?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.440
How does the public interact?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.440
What's the dynamic?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.710
BUXTON: Well, they set up through using largely
web mechanisms in Paris.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.750
It works well there.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.310
They set up a whole--and they've set up a
whole citizens' water observatory, where everyone

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.160
has a role and is actually involved in some
of the running of the company and advising

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.340
the company.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.230
So that's--they've used something called,
yeah, an observatory, using various civil

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.440
society groups to really have a say in the
future of the company.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.130
And in Buenos Aires they've set up committees
to advise the company, and they're also involved

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.630
in very interesting public-public partnerships
with different cities in the south.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.960
So there are different examples, but they're
ones that do--they're not without their flaws,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.670
but they do provide some hope, and they show
that this idea that privatization is the answer

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.810
is not the case.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.810
JAY: Alright.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.810
Thanks for joining us, Nick.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.810
BUXTON: Thank you.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.740
JAY: And thank you for joining us on The Real
News Network.
