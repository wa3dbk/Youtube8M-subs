00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.060
Sheep!

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.399
Hey sheep-- Hey, everybody, look...,

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.310
I'm a shepherd boy and I am looking
for my sheep.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.019
They're supposed to meet me right here so that I
could feed them.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.270
Right here for some reason... Oh!

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.440
[Sheep noise: Baaaaa]

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.020
Did you guys get a real sheep?

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.060
You got a real sheep? I gotta go find my
real sheep.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.699
Here sheepy, sheepy, sheepy.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.380
Sheep! Sheep!

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.030
Sheep! Come on--

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.710
Hey, what's this?

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.080
Just minding my own business looking for my
sheep and I came across that...

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.160
Looks like a scroll of some sort.

00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:00.059
It looks to be of historical and
spiritual significance.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.180
We're talking about the Dead Sea
Scrolls on this episode of

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.600
Chuck Knows Church.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.730
Op, sorry.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.620
Got it --- all done-- sorry. Got a little out of hand, didn't it?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.240
The Dead Sea Scrolls is not a reference to sea scrolls that have shed their mortal coil.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.000
They're not dead... sea scrolls.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.260
It is, however, a reference to
scrolls affiliated with the Dead Sea, right?

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.530
The Dead Sea Scrolls. It refers to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.900
Hebrew scrolls, ancient writings that a
Bedouin boy stumbled across in 1947

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.440
in israel's Judean Desert. Now, little did
he know at the time

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.590
that he had uncovered an exciting piece
of history

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.790
from the Second Temple period, thought to be about

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.550
520 B.C. to 70 A.D.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.880
The Judean Desert is mostly barren, thought to have been of little historical significance

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.010
but instead it surprisingly revealed

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.710
an incredible treasure trove of
information.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.280
This young shepherd was certainly unaware
what was to follow when during his

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.920
innocent search for stray goat he
stumbled into a long uninhabited cave.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.460
Wait, a goat? Why'd you guys buy a sheep?

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.500
They're not -- it's not the same thing. Bet 
a goat's even cheaper.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.769
You're just wasting money on sheep now? That's what the Chuck Knows Church budget goes to?

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.760
Sheep?

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.930
The scrolls he found were of great
historical significance

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.140
because they were some the oldest
manuscripts

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.340
ever uncovered having religious and
linguistic significance.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.420
They reflected upon the biblical canon,
meaning the books of the Bible

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.280
that we now consider most sacred. Now one
excavation led to another

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.590
and eventually there were 11 caves in
with scrolls were found and since then

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.510
thousands of written fragments have been
upturned. Many of the larger

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.500
manuscripts have been damaged because I
both human handling

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.260
and natural causes so only a very small
portion

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.400
of the texts exist.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.060
But, there were a small number of manuscripts

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.970
that were well-preserved, fewer than a
dozen,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.360
found in the  Qumran caves and many
archaeologists consider those to be

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.180
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.120
There been so many excavations in that
region since 1947

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.420
that not much is left. No stone has been
left unturned so to speak.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.560
If you'd like to learn more, ask your pastor...

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.480
be sure to tell them Chuck
sent you.
