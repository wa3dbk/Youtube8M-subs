00:00:00.343 --> 00:00:04.865
"Sound Effects"!
Only Mario will play this game.

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:09.377
Our dear Mario will improvise
without using words,

00:00:09.377 --> 00:00:13.251
he'll only use the sound effects
provided by Anderson Bizzocchi.

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.471
I'll ask the audience to suggest a job...

00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:19.600
Raise your hands so I can choose...
Raise them first, so I can hear.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.580
Boy scout?

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:25.422
Boy scout is not a job,
but it's cool, right?

00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:31.066
So, we'll have a boy scout
on the "Sound Effects" game...

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:35.399
Just Mario and effects by Anderson.
Starting now!

00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:35.645
What medal would you give Mario
at the end of this scene?

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:38.197
The guy killed himself!

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:41.997
- A medal of honor, then!
- He's a suicide boy scout!

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:45.767
He's a boy scout who killed a bird,
chopped a tree...

00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:51.900
- You're amazing!
- He's a boy scout that, when feeling cold in the tent,

00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:56.791
he chops down a sequoia to make a fire!

00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:00.753
CIA. BARBIXAS DE HUMOR
presented

00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:07.045
IMPROV√ÅVEL
Probably a good show.
