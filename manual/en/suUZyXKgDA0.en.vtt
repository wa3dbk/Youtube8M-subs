00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.009
Wanna know one of the best ways to get
your video marketing campaigns

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.390
out of the hanger and into the clouds?
Hint:

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.390
to boldly go where no camera has gone
before.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.970
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.380
 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.940
 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.750
So last time we talked about why doing
video in a more compressed or

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.810
intensive time frame is so helpful for
your learning.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.960
For one thing, it ramps up your skill
level so that you can do things faster.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.080
Well, today I wanna share a tip with you

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.309
on how to do things insanely faster
using your cell phone.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.120
Hi, I'm Steven Washer with BrainyVideo.com. Back in 2009, my wife and I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.660
took a trip to Hawaii.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.790
We had one whole extra bag full of
video gear and it cost a lot of money

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.839
and time to take care of.

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.989
We got some great shots and we
put them into my book, The Video Brain,

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.489
which was really really nice,

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.540
but it was a chore to carry all that
stuff around

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.990
and would have been so nice not to have
to worry about that.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.470
Well, you no longer have that problem my friend.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.040
I've had mobile phones for years. I
even had mobile phones that could take

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.229
video, but it wasn't until I got the
iPhone

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.130
that I took video on a phone seriously.
The first reason is the audio,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.180
the second reason is that it's very easy
to use,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.960
and the third reason is that the image
quality is outstanding

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.549
in the most extreme circumstances. I'll show you that in just a minute.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.109
In February,

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.740
my wife and I went to Miami for a
long-anticipated getaway.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.240
I really wanted to see how the iPhone 5

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.689
would perform under different conditions.
The idea was to be

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.539
as opportunistic as possible. If I could
get some decent shots

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.320
and even do entire videos of acceptable
length and quality,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.960
than my system of video marketing would
get a nice

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.200
big boost. Why? Because when you have a publishing schedule,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.210
you're committing yourself to do a
certain amount of work

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.480
in a certain amount of time. And if you
can shoot a video with very minimal

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.460
preparation,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.660
even if you intend to
supplement it later,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.350
your audience will actually enjoy it
when you break up the format from time

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.940
to time.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.250
Those videos can add to the videos
on your schedule,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.050
helping you get ahead of the game. The
challenge is to get authentic results.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.560
In other words,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.800
results worth sharing. And as it

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.510
turns out, it really isn't very difficult to
do.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.570
I got the chance to test this theory far
above the Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.860
You know, it's a funny thing--

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.830
for a while, you're above all your
problems, all your cares, all your

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.640
troubles.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.540
And then there comes a time when you
have to come back down to earth.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.220
And maybe the trick is bringing the same
attitude with you that you had when you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.500
were above the earth,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.200
even though you can plainly see that
you're going down.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.880
We'll see if we can sustain that.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.910
Till next week, this is Steve Washer

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.540
with BrainyVideo.com. Even though that
video was just an experiment,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.890
it proved something very important: the
iPhone has an outstanding microphone

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.000
as long as you don't hold it further
away from you than about

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.620
arms-length. In fact, it's a little freaky
how good the audio is.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.550
The lens is very good and the auto
features work reasonably well,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.030
and with one small tweak, this camera
phone

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.040
can actually be the basis of your entire

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.280
video marketing system. The reason is
that it makes you

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.460
nimble--wherever you go, whatever you're
doing--even if you're hanging from a

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.090
swing a thousand feet in the air.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.700
If you get an idea, you can express it. If
you can express it authentically, and I

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.580
believe you can with the iPhone,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.250
then you can legitimately use it in your
video marketing.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.870
If you're going to use it in the
studio though,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.040
you'll need a huge infrastructure of
course.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.580
You're gunna need this: 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.699
it's called the Joby Grip. This attaches your phone to a tripod.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.359
No more shaky-cam and lots more
authentic footage.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.380
The way you use it is, you just

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.800
unfold it and then you grip it to your
camera like this

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.539
and then you simply attach it to your
tripod.

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.080
It's even got a little
hole here,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.240
up near the tripod hole, where you can
attach it to a keychain.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.310
This would have been so handy when we
took our trip to Hawaii

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.670
instead of lugging around a video camera
and supply of tapes

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.060
as we trudged up the mountains and down to the beaches,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.610
we could just stop
talking on the phone for a few minutes

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.970
and snap on this little dealey, and point
and

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.370
shoot. The other thing you'll want
if you're using the phone

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.220
farther than arms-length is this

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.610
microphone adapter. This lets you plug a
mic

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.910
just like this one into

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.500
the iPhone's headphone jack. If you
already have a really nice microphone

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.520
then you can get this adapter.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.660
This is for mics with an XLR connector.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.360
And finally, you'll want an app

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.470
called FiLMiC Pro that gives you manual
control over the exposure,

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.820
the focus and the zoom of your camera
phone.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.840
There really isn't much to pack, is there?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.060
I'm gunna shoot up in Toronto
this week--

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.930
guess what I'm taking? For putting your
video marketing into

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.170
warp-drive, I'm Steve Washer with BrainyVideo.com

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.420
