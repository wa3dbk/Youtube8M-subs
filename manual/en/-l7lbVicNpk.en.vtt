HI Gizmo Guy here.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.509
Today we will be showing you on how you can
get your music, podcast, youtube, pandora,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.650
from your iphone 4s to your car radio with
wire or any additional accessories.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.340
We will be using this gadget the fm transmitter,
the best fm transmitter from iphone fm transmitter

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.380
dot com.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:39.210
We will be using our iphone 4s to broadcast
music onto our car radio.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:52.940
so first we will have to set the car radio
to 89.7 fm, you can hear lots of static noise

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.940
in the background.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.350
That is because our transmitter is not plug
in yet.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:10.960
First we will have to remove the usb charger
and we will plug this into our iphone 4s.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.470
Set up youtube, plug this in and turn it on.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.740
Noticed that as soon as we turn the transmitter
on, the noise went away, that is because the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.020
transmitter is now working.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:50.440
We will just play something from Youtube.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.460
Now we will try something in Pandora.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:17.829
You can hear that the music is actually coming
out loud and clear without hissing sound or

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.090
distortion.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:32.989
Now let us turn this off, and turn it back
on.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.660
So that is how you get your music from your
iphone 4s onto car radio without wire or any

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.660
additional accessories.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.390
It is simply the best fm transmitter for iphone
