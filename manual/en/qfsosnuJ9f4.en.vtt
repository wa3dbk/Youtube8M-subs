00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:04.218
Welcome to the Retro Graveyard, a show where
each week we take a different piece of old

00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:08.138
discontented video game hardware back from
the grave to give it a retrospective, and

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:15.048
this week we're going to talk about Nintendo's
answer to the Tamagatchi: this thing.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:22.048
This is the Pokemon Pikachu 2 GS. It was released
in America in October of 2000 for about 20

00:00:25.988 --> 00:00:26.137
bucks.

00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:31.018
It's called the Pocket Pikachu Color in Japan,
which I think is a much less stupid name.

00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:35.718
It looks like a miniature Game Boy, but in
reality, it's a virtual pet, much like a Tamagatchi

00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:39.688
which were all the rage when this thing came
out. The difference is it's Pokemon branded,

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:42.308
which means kids went must have went apeshit
for it.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:46.518
But unlike a Tamagatchi, you don't have to
actually take care of anything. Pikachu just

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:50.477
sort of hangs out, and plays through various
animations occasionally.

00:00:50.477 --> 00:00:56.188
You can't kill him like you can a Tamagatchi
pet. You just piss him off by neglecting him.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:01:00.618
Instead, Nintendo put a pedometer, or step
counter in this thing. Every twenty steps

00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:05.548
you take Pikachu gains a watt, which is sort
of like the games currency. But lets be honest,

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:09.928
no kid was going to put walk around to gain
watts. You'd just shake the thing, which led

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:12.588
to this creepy commercial being made.

00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:19.588
Anyway, you can give the watts to the Pikachu
to make it like you more. He's pretty mad

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.238
at me right now.

00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:31.268
There's also a simple gambling game built
in, another way to earn watts.

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:36.348
It requires 5 watts to play a hand, which
goes into a pool. Pikachu holds up two cards,

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:40.088
and only lets you see what one of them is.
You have to guess if the hidden card is going

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:45.658
to be higher or lower. And that is the closest
thing to game play you will find on this device.

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:47.757
But what else can you do with watts?

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:52.528
Well, you see, the Pokemon Pikachu 2 GS had
an infrared port at the top, just like it's

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:56.967
big brother the Game Boy Color. This enables
you to transfer your watts to another Pikachu

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:01.378
system, or to your copy of Pokemon Gold, Silver
or Crystal. Once you get to a certain point

00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:05.188
in the game, the Mystery Gift menu is revealed
on the main screen, and you can choose to

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:10.188
transfer watts from your Pikachu to your Pokemon
game in exchange for a random item.

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:13.858
There really isn't a whole lot to this thing.
It does keep track of your steps broken down

00:02:13.858 --> 00:02:18.388
day by day for the past week, so thats pretty
cool. It also has a built in alarm clock,

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:22.708
which actually lets you compose your own little
tune, which I was surprised to see.

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:26.738
This is actually the second version of the
Pokemon Pikachu. There was one released in

00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:30.858
1998 that had a black and white screen and
no IR port, so there was no connectivity at

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:35.238
all. It must have still done pretty well to
warrant Nintendo making a sequel to it. This

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:40.998
thing is a pretty weird concept, even for
the time. There's no way Nintendo would release

00:02:40.998 --> 00:02:46.148
something like this in modern times, in this
age of smartphones and iPads or what have

00:02:46.148 --> 00:02:48.807
you... or would they.

00:02:48.807 --> 00:02:54.447
Yup, a decade later, Nintendo returned to
this exact concept and bundled the Pokewalker

00:02:54.447 --> 00:02:59.178
with a release of Pokemon for the Nintendo
DS. Like it's predecessors, it counts your

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:04.288
steps and give you a watt for every twenty
steps you take. It has an IR port and a monochrome

00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:09.848
screen this time around. The DS doesn't have
an IR port, though, so Nintendo came up with

00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:14.557
an interesting solution: they stuck one in
the Pokemon cartridge itself.

00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:17.998
Instead of being stuck with a Pikachu, you
can choose to take whatever monster you want

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:22.167
out of your in game party on a 'stroll,' which
gives them experience that translates back

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:27.378
to the main game. There's actually some surprisingly
deep gameplay on this device. There's multiple

00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:31.727
routes to take your guy on, each with different
items and monsters to come across. There's

00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:36.218
full on battle sequences, and you can catch
Pokemon you encounter and transfer them back

00:03:36.218 --> 00:03:41.938
to your game. At least there's some actually
practical functionality here. There's no gambling

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:45.458
anymore though, I guess that just doesn't
fly with kids toys nowadays.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:49.638
Instead of the Pokewalker having a ball inside
to count the steps, it actually has an accelerometer,

00:03:49.638 --> 00:03:54.408
just like a smartphone, so you don't feel
anything physically moving. Apparently it's

00:03:54.408 --> 00:03:59.507
a good one, too. Iowa State University did
a study on pedometers, and concluded that

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:02.787
the Pokewalker is one of the most accurate
ever made.

00:04:02.787 --> 00:04:06.528
So that about does it for these stand alone
Pokemon devices. If you had one, be sure to

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:09.458
let me know what you thought of it, and if
you liked this video be sure to check out
