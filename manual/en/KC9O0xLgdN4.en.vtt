00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.420
In March 2010, the University of Arkansas
announced its commitment to becoming an All-Steinway

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.340
School.
Jura Margulis, internationally renowned pianist

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.480
and University of Arkansas music professor,
traveled to New York with Steinway &amp; Sons

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.230
representatives to personally select the pianos
that would soon call Fayetteville, Arkansas

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.630
home.
Jura Margulis: Becoming an All-Steinway School

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.460
means that I think that over 90 percent of
all instruments on campus, of course mostly

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.660
in the music department, are made by Steinway.
What it means for the university to be an

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:50.199
All-Steinway School is the pursuit of excellence,
the admittance to strive for a higher ground

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.429
in the area of music.
Rozio Martinez: You just say to somebody,

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.760
hey ok I'm a student at the U of A and I have
this Steinway that's a privilege not any pianist

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.940
can have even in big schools of music. Yes
it may sound different. In your practicing

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.071
it makes a difference, in your performance.
Aurelien Boccard: I find something even this

00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:16.000
piano here is exceptional. So it's amazing
that we can have a piano like that because

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.140
I remember even in Geneva or all the music
schools that I visited they didn't have that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.510
many great pianos.
Jura Magulis: It's an honor. It's a privilege.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.250
It's a joy to be teaching on the best instruments
available. And of course, one of the most

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.000
important aspects of, from just from my perspective
from my area, is that the piano students at

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.610
the University of Arkansas are practicing,
when they're practicing in the practice rooms,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.730
they're practicing on the best instruments
available and that's a...that's a very strong

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.360
argument, you know. It's a strong argument
to come here actually as a student. This is

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.490
an All-Steinway campus. There are all students...all,
you know, people that are looking for a college,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.670
where to go study. They understand what it
means. It means that we, the university, are

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.150
devoted to excellence and we give the best
sort of circumstances, the best environment

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.209
for student to thrive, to learn and to grow
an experience.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.030
Rozio Martinez: Having a Steinway on the campus
makes like...first of all people will think

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.731
like, it must be a very prestigious school,
it must be a very good school and you know

00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:26.709
student has a great opportunity to practice
on a Steinway. Plus we are not like many pianists,

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.030
so everybody has its own piano.
Aurelien Boccard: We are very lucky to be,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.909
I'm thinking, in a school All-Steinway. It's...
I don't think the students of pianists in

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:46.739
a music school could dream better than that.
So I can't...couldn't be more happy.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.849
The first instruments arrived on May 11, 2010,
and were carefully transported, placed, tuned

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.319
and prepared.
The University of Arkansas now holds the honor

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.209
of being an All-Steinway School, which has
elevated the teaching and learning potential

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.019
at the university.
