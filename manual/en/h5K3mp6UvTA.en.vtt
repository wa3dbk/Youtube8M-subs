00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.000
Avery Healthcare is proud to bring to the
Cobham and Weybridge districts a residential

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
care home of real distinction.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.300
Silvermere care home is situated on the A245
Byfleet Road, overlooking Silvermere lake

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.619
and adjacent to Silvermere golf club.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.300
The home occupies a beautiful setting amongst
lakeside

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.340
woodlands and affords residents unique lifestyle
opportunities.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.750
At Silveremere we have 72 rooms all of which
are individually appointed with their own

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.820
en-suite shower.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.379
They all have three quater width beds.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.789
We have 8 companion suites in the home this
allows couples to move in and live together.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.980
One room can be converted into a lounge with
a small kitchenette and the other remains

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.500
the nedroon with en-suite shower room.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.600
All rooms have beautiful views some overlooking
Silvermere lake and others looking over the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.510
woodlands at the front of the building.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.060
Self-expression is important too and we encourage
all our residents to dress their rooms with

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.560
personal effects and keepsakes.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.299
Resident and family members help steer home
life through participation in our various

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.820
committees, whose feedback is invaluable to
us.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.140
People often comment on the vibrancy of the
homes that we develop and Silvermere is no

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.250
exception.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.360
Residents quickly settle into home life and
benefit from the peace of mind that our 24

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.520
hour care affords.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.540
Residents can get on with what they enjoy,
whether it’s making new acquaintance’s

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.229
and developing or sharing personal interests.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.460
I am the first person that people see when
they come in so it is really important, everyone

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.680
likes to see a smiling face and it is lovely
to get to know people and have a chat.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.640
Dining is of a high restaurant standard and
everyone is free to enjoy the best of our

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.430
carefully selected wines.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.659
The Chef and his team are always delighting
us with a choice of freshly prepared, locally

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.109
sourced dishes and there is always the choice
of more exotic food to supplement our more

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.720
traditional fare.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.410
At Silvermere we have a lovely chef who is
very skilled in five star quality dining.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.190
The food is very nutrious, it's very well
presented, very much as you would expect in

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.500
any of the very well known hotels.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.660
The dining experience is unquique to Silvermere
I would expect a very high level of service

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.620
not dissimilar to a resaurant service.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.140
Freshly baked cakes and biscuits are freely
available all day, every day from our Atrium

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.130
Café, and guests are always welcome to join
us in the serveries at mealtimes or in our

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.080
private dining area.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.160
At Silvermere we have the Atrium Cafe, which
is in the heart of the reception area.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.829
Its very much at the heart of the home.

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.860
I enviasge people will come here for morning
coffee, to meet and greet family and friends

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.020
but also maybe have pre-diner drinks and enjoy
the atmosphere of that bar.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.760
Silvermere is a home that encourages its residents
to try new things and live life to the full.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.430
Our programme of recreational activities is
intensive and varied, you can try as little

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.630
or as much as you like and there really is
something for everyone.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.330
We do a variety of activities, its important
to get to know the residents as they move

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.810
in find out their interests and their background,
what they enjoy doing.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.830
Silvermere is situated right next to Silvermere
golf course and as part of their moving in

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.730
to Silvermere residents can have the opportunity
to play golf and let their families play too

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.400
when they come and visit their relatives.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.620
I am very hot on sport I love physical activity
its very important for residents so we are

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.239
planning on having some tai chi and Zumba.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.500
Also to get residents onto the internet is
important.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.240
Skype is a great activity to do so that they
can keep in touch with families.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.310
There is lots of different places near Silvermere
so we are going to have regular outings to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.890
places like Wisley and the Brooklands museum.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.650
We have film appreciation groups, knitting
clubs and even a gentlemen’s club, who are

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.150
regular visitors to the local pub on a Sunday.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.910
We have five lounges, the lounge we are in
at the moment is the library, its on the ground

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.910
floor.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.440
Its a really pleasant space as you can see
and allows you to come in and privately read

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.110
a book or maybe privately use the computer.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.870
A good place to meet family and friends.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.550
As well as luxury residential care, Silvermere
offers a progressive approach to dementia

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.819
care, what we call our “Connect Communities”.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.569
Our Connect programme is based upon a thorough
understanding of our residents’ needs as

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.360
well as their life histories.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.340
We work closely with family members, devising
the best possible care and support, and ensuring

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.690
that each and every resident
enjoys rich and purposeful living.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.270
We are looking to very much have a busy programme
of activity in terms of what the resident

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.270
want.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.229
So the way we are doing that is finding out
where residents are before they come in but

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.669
also once they are here with us, what sort
of things have been their interests and past

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:16.430
hobbies and how we can make sure not only
continue those for them but also look at new

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.379
things that people can learn.

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.960
So for example computers and Skyping maybe
a new thing for someone.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:33.370
So I think that in terms of both their physical
and social wellbeing and their mental health

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.460
in terms of learning can still be fulfilled
here.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.789
We are particularly proud of our garden and
the peace and tranquillity it affords residents

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.530
and guests alike.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.319
There are paths and patios, raised beds and
a potting shed, and when the weather is fine

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.509
we all enjoy its ambience, shady spots and
lakeside views.

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.889
Silvermere enjoys excellent relations with
the local community, schools and other community

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.909
groups are regular visitors to the home.

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:05.199
When we introduced free iPads and wi-fi into
the home, we also encouraged some of our school

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.330
children to help mentor our residents in their
use.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.370
We’ve seen first-hand just how beneficial
internet based communications can be for family

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.099
and residents.

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:20.090
At Silvermere we take time to enjoy the finer
things in life, our therapy and hair salon

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.719
is popular and we regularly host popular musical
recitals.

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:28.449
Why not drop in yourself and see first-hand
how comfortable and vibrant a place Silvermere

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:29.449
is.

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.239
Perhaps stay awhile and join us for tea?
