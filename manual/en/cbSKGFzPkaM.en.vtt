00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.110
him

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.260
this involves the atlanta public school
system

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.480
they are under fire because it turns out
one hundred seventy eight teachers and

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.550
principals within the school system were
caught cheating on standardized tests

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.619
now what happens in atlanta is they have
something known as the criteria and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.560
referenced competency test and um...
they're is all water pressure

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.169
teachers to have the majority of
missions pass this test that's basically

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.869
wait we value a pen

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.609
and i mean some school districts where
they have similar tests teachers get a

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.699
twenty-five thousand dollar bonus if the
test scores are good yet so they did

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.999
their of their they've and hands paid
bid you know tied to

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.740
uh... student performance which is what

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.780
a lot of people want to see happen
educational over the country public

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.319
education you don't just get tenure and
you don't get moved down

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.289
but actually get rewarded for for doing
well well that you know you know it's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.549
interesting because i'm in favor of
teacher evaluations but using

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.269
standardized testing to do that is
obviously not going to go yeah okay

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.640
because then you have this happening
which teachers will take distance test

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.610
and review the answers and literally you
raise the answers that are incorrect and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.090
um... circle the correct answer other
ways on the crime yet to come in their

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.189
ways of doing a meter i mean

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.439
the sickness but they have a look

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.360
trust the teachers the principal but the
view trusted oversight in some way to do

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.090
it so that they come in

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.170
white balance

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.240
they get to put them through i mean it
just seems it's unbelievably can't trust

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.320
the teachers my favorite thing about
this will not my favorite thing but one

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.810
of my favorite things is that hundred
seventy eight teachers and principles

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.830
work is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.980
eighty two of them confessed right

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.579
what is it the ninety six

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.149
the greatest amid the eighty-two arlyne
there'd be no i mean the ninety six that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.189
are left

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.790
part clearly guilty

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.380
and now it's it's very obvious they

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.359
your indeed kinda reminds me of a story
to jane told about his childhood friend

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.440
who had this policy of deny deny deny

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.380
and i guess something happened with the
burned uh... a house-to-house train

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.560
burning down in their backyard uh... the
parents question both changes friend of

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.149
his friend than i did and was never
found guilty of it right solo friends

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.039
who started the fire yet

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.239
so uh... you know as i guess these
teachers think a final confess anything

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.679
maybe apaul somehow get off they have to
prove that guilty yet it's true is that

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:20.969
right

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.839
but these nineties active if it when all
unit eighty two of them are saying it

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.949
was only one person said one of four
saying that i love this test on is a

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.699
struck up a plea eighty two of them are
saying

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:36.129
uh... i don't see the ninety six the
willing to stand they get home made out

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.670
and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.560
i what i hear is about is what is gonna
happen to these teachers into these

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.859
principles in the atlanta at school

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:44.889
district and eat

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.770
right what's gonna happen i'd even a
fire all of them and then

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.550
then you're in you know ruled the
trouble because you need to hire new

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.530
teachers need to have more principles

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.240
uh... ultimately it's a lose lose for
the students like these issues are

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.240
getting cheated out of an education
because they're being taught to take a

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.430
standardized tests

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.990
and even when they fail that
standardized tests are having their

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.800
their promoted it and be back with their
promoted to another greatly needed to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.990
others and they need it helped actually
learn the material that's necessary to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.350
go on to the next right

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.880
and you know if these teachers get fired
understood because the class sizes are

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.540
gonna be larger it's gonna take time to
rehire you know or a higher different

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.060
teachers it's just a disaster so i feel
horrible for the students

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.250
by the way the superintendent of the
school district to serve the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.599
superintendent of the year into that was
not

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.109
the f_b_i_ of but they've been other
they were part of the story with a

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.969
twelve-year tenure it shouldn't have to
turn

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.989
like usc at the turn in their own
national championship
