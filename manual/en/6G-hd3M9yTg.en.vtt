00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.060
I'm old enough to remember magazines
that used to come

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.260
to the house when i was a boy, Popular
Science, Popular Mechanics and they had

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.019
plans and were

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.459
full of articles about how you could
make useful things that you couldn't buy

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.529
and that's really the spirit of what
I've tried to do here

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.270
About five years ago we were

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.840
faced with the prospect of replacing our

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.449
pool heater which turned out to be a fairly
expensive proposition

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.789
several thousands of dollars

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.789
I started to wonder about the possibility of providing solar heat with something that I would build

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990
After five years, five prototypes,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.980
much distress, agony and some

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.040
delightful times

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.780
I have come up with something that i'd like to
share with you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.480
that is working well for us and is a pretty
neat project

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.200
to have been involved in.
The unit that you're going to see

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.000
currently heats a swimming pool.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.070
It provides about fifty thousand BTUs
(British Thermal Units)  of energy

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.260
on a bright sunny day such as we have
today

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.250
It completely takes the place of
the propane heater that we were using before

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.440
the energy from the sun is essentially free

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.000
the cost of building the collectors
approximately a hundred and fifty

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.150
dollars US per section, you can build as many sections as you like

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.920
I have thirteen in my collector that you're
going to see

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.960
A person that is reasonably comfortable with
the tools

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.100
and the methods will probably spend
about a week to two weeks to make their first collector

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.370
The time after that after that once you get the
jigs worked out

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.940
and in place and you get comfortable with
the method you will probably cut that time in half

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.050
When I set out to design the
guidebook I had in mind the person that

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.490
had a basic set of skills, had learned to use a saw and a drill

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.640
perhaps taking care of things around the
house

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.439
and i tried to lead them through

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:16.459
possibly in greater details and
might be in some other books but I tried

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.120
to show step-by-step

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.920
what it would take

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.679
to successfully built the array

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.079
The manual contains step-by-step
directions

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.699
still a list of materials, a list of the
tools that you require

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.180
alignment procedures

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.219
electrical diagrams

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.549
for size templates

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.159
virtually everything you need

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.669
The person who builds this is going to
enjoy the

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.449
wonderful satisfaction of the project
being completed

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:55.309
enjoy an ongoing source of free heat

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:01.010
and will have knowledge that what they
have is

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.579
absolutely unique

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.189
You can't buy a product like this
You have to make it

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.829
It's a good thing to do.
Ecologically we have to get off fossil

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.689
fuels and if you are faced like i was with the
prospect of a five thousand dollar pool heater

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:22.689
and ongoing operating costs of one to two
thousand dollars a year for propane

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.109
plus the pollution that produces this is
much much better
