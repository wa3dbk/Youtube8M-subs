00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.930
Let's use some real bones as reference.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.201
It's good to have a full sized human skeleton,
one cast from real bones, so that you can

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.450
compare this to your actual body.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.270
But the problem is that these thing are riveted
so that it doesn't move like a human skeleton

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.270
moves.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.890
There is a spool in here that allows a foot
to go into dorsiflexion and plantar flexion

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.739
that we can't do on this because it's stuck
together.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.510
But we don't have that limitation when we
draw and when we have the 3D model.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.250
This is an extended foot.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.109
I like to begin with a rough something to
contain the proportions.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.070
It's okay if you take some time with that.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.649
But to make it look three dimensional, even
when I do that rough something, I'm thinking

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.020
of height, width, and depth.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.130
And we letter those systems as X, Y, and Z.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:21.180
And with just those coordinates, we can build
a Lego foot standing non-extended.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:30.050
Which, even if it doesn't look like a foot,
it looks 3D.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:38.430
Then when we put this cylinder in there, it
runs along X which helps us draw the ellipse,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.600
and we know that that is the fulcrum of the
foot.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.220
That means it's the center axle of the foot's
rotation.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.390
If I draw it from the side, you'll see that
we have the depth.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.700
That's the Z line.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.140
The height, that's the Y line.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.790
And then we're looking straight down on X
where that ankle joint is.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.360
And when that foot moves on that hinge joint
and makes an arc, goes into extension, we

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.340
can see that Z will not line up on Z.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.750
It will aim up.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.560
So when we do this refined foot, I'm going
to chisel some of the plane so it looks a

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.950
little bit more like a foot.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.829
It's not all right angles.

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.750
And the big foot, we'll put into an extended
position rather than a straight up and down

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.750
position.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.319
So let's get the ankle bones.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.700
That would be the tibia and the fibula.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.950
And they come down kind of like a wrench to
grip that spool bone of the talus.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.110
I'll refine this a bit, badly.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.030
Sorry about that, I'm a bad influence with
my hunt and scratch lines.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.430
I'll offer my excuse for it later.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.769
Right now, I just apologize for it.

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:07.310
Let's put that spool in there.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.170
Since it's extended, the Y lines won't point
straight up and down.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:22.569
They'll aim off in that direction.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.769
And cross contours make us sure of the form,
and we don't have all right angles there.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.409
We've got some beveled, slanted lines.

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.840
Before I turn this into an abomination, it
is so embarrassing to be seen in the privacy

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.810
of one's hesitations.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.430
I wish we could just speed it up.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.269
Segue into the ... There, that's better.

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:59.459
There we are, all dressed up for the debut
and no embarrassing personal scratching.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.969
Thank you very much, Marshall!

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.169
That was a great little demo.

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.349
