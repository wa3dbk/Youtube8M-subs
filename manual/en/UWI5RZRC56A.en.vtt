00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.083
Now here is our conductor, Leonard Bernstein,

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:13.083
coming on stage and leading
the New York Philharmonic in a performance.

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:19.833
The Philharmonic, since 1842, had accumulated
an amazing amount of material.

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:23.375
The score of the Beethoven 5th,
the first work we ever played,

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:27.125
that score that was on that stand in 1842
is still here.

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:31.250
We have the largest score collection
in private hands.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.208
We've acquired
the complete score collection

00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.750
of Leonard Bernstein, Erich Leinsdorf,
Andre Kostelanetz.

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:43.166
So we are a major repository in the world
for a conducting score collection.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.833
Hi. I'm Barbara Haws. I'm the Archivist/Historian
of the New York Philharmonic

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:52.875
and I've had the pleasure of holding this job
for the last 26 years.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:58.416
We're incorporating
many different aspects of technology

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.541
and best practices in the archival sense

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.625
to really complete this project.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:07.375
And so I really hope that,
as we move forward,

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:09.958
other repositories will look at us as a model

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:14.333
and want to find out how we're doing it
and learn from it.

00:01:14.416 --> 00:01:19.458
My name is Mitch Brodsky. I'm the Digital Archives
Project Manager here at the New York Philharmonic.

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:24.666
An important part of our mission of friendship
here in the Soviet Union

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.708
has been to play for you
a great deal of American music.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:36.291
But this mission must work both ways
in order to accomplish real friendship.

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:41.375
And so we are now going to play
for our American television audience

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:47.166
the entire, huge first movement
of the Seventh Symphony by Shostakovich.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.375
Up to this point,
a researcher had to come to us -

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.000
from Asia, South America, Europe -

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:59.458
come here to research a composer,
a conductor or just their family history.

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:05.541
And our desire was to make it easy for them
to do this research without coming here.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.750
Just before we play it for you now,

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:13.041
I would like, most humbly and respectfully,

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:18.125
to welcome to this audience
Mr Shostakovich himself,

00:02:18.208 --> 00:02:23.083
and I would like to thank him personally
and in the name of my country

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.916
for the wonderful music he has given us.

00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:34.458
We try to create an environment online
that is really conducive to research.

00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:36.041
That's really our goal.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.500
It's not just about looking at a single item.

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:44.041
It's about making connections between
Leonard Bernstein's debut performance

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:46.583
and looking at the programme
for that performance,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.208
looking at the score he used
in that performance,

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.583
and then hearing audio
of that performance.

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:55.416
Bruno Walter, who was to have conducted
this afternoon, is ill.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.208
His place will be taken by the young American-born
assistant conductor of the Philharmonic Symphony,

00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:01.791
Leonard Bernstein.

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:04.791
The main benefit
that I have seen from Alfresco

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.916
is that it's such a flexible architecture.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.916
We're able to communicate with Alfresco
using practically any other piece of software.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.916
Alfresco has been a great core to our system
that we've been able to build around,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.958
and we've never had to worry
about the stability of that core

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:25.250
in the centre of all of our processes
and workflows.

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:30.875
In the future,
we hope to have additional phases

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:36.750
to digitise all archive material
between 1842 and 1970.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:38.708
And once we're finished with that -

00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:43.041
and we're already beginning this process
to incorporate born-digital material -

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:47.291
at a certain point we would have
a single Alfresco repository

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:52.500
that would contain all the intellectual assets
of the organisation

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:56.375
from December 7, 1842 until yesterday.
