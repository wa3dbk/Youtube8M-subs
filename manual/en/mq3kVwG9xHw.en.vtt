00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.240
Te Matarae i Orehu celebrated
their 20th birthday

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.360
by winning Te Arawa's
kapa haka regionals.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.440
Te Arawa was the largest regional
competition held this year

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.040
and the region
will be sending six kapa haka

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.120
to Te Matatini next year.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.920
Our kapa haka reporter
Anzac Pikia has more.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.840
An awesome 20th birthday present
for Te Matarae i Orehu.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.240
They reign supreme as winners

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.120
of the Te Arawa kapa haka
regional competition.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.480
Many of our members

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.760
have passed on in the years -

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.760
our thoughts were with all of them.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.120
Nga Uri o Te Whanoa
are making a return to Te Matatini -

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.080
they came second.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.840
We've come off stage,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.160
we're happy,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.800
so that's the main thing.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.840
A very experienced group,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.880
Whakarewarewa penny divers
Tuhourangi Ngati Wahiao,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.040
came third.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.400
We've achieved all our goals.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.440
We've been practising for this event

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.960
for over 12 weeks.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.600
Descendants of Te Awahou
came fourth -

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.240
Ngati Rangiwewehi are returning
to Te Matatini.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.520
The main thing
is we stood as a whanau

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.800
to carry out the whanau's wishes.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.760
They're a relatively new group,
but with strong performers -

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.840
Kataore coming in at fifth.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.720
We're overjoyed - we stood

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.480
as a whanau and as Ngati Pikiao.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.120
Another Pikiao group,
newcomers Te Pikikotuku o Rongomai,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.640
came sixth.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.480
We believe in Maori customs

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.000
and in the language.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.240
All the regional competitions
are almost all done.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.880
At the end of the month Rangitane
will hold the final regional.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.040
Anzac Pikia, Te Karere.
