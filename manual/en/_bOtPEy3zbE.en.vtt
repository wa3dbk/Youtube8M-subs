Hi this is Josiah Owen with Expert Village
and today we're going to be talk about making

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.300
a cookie tree. Alright now we've added our
decorations and our red frosting and we'll

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.760
go ahead and add our green frosting. We have
our pipe bag here. I'm just going to follow

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:27.039
the edge of the tree. Start by making the
one triangle and then go around the other

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:48.170
one, stop there, because you can always use
a knife and fill it back in. Go in between

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.619
and a drop right there and a drop right there.
At this point I'm going to go ahead and smear

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:04.439
this out, so it gets all the way across. Take
the green frosting and fill in all the places

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:19.740
we missed, in some places you can also use
your fingers, it's up to you, different methods

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.020
for different things, it all depends on if
you like to use your hands when you cook,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.549
some people don't. I dated a girl one time
who refused to get her hands dirty in the

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:41.679
kitchen, which is fine because I'm a big cooker,
so. Push in here, get inside, separate these

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:52.249
two,
get some of the excess to fill around the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:02:04.060
edges. At this point we're going to also put
a couple of drops at the bottom for later.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:15.610
Go in and clean it up, make sure you get all
the edges out, so you can see that it's a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.930
tree, so run your fingers on the sides and
there you go.
