00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:05.069
The marine organism that we're going to identify
now is the Common Octopus. If you're diving

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.139
and you see an octopus out roaming on the
reefs or on the tropical waters of the Americas

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.170
during the day it's most likely a Common Octopus.
This is because this is the only indigenous

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:27.130
that is normally roaming the reef during daylight
hours. All the other octopi are nocturnal

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.632
hunters. The Common Octopus does not have
a dark ring around its eye unlike its close

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:33.640
relative the Columbia Reef Octopus which does.
The Common Octopus also has suckers with dark

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.480
edges but you're not likely to see this unless
you have one of their arms draped across your

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.510
dive mask and even then you'll probably be
too distracted by the octopus clinging to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.270
your face to notice this identifying feature.
The Common Octopus, like all octopi, live

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.840
in holes in the reef. Their home can often
be identified by a pile of shells outside

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:01.460
their opening. This is a result of their feeding.
Common Octopus eat a variety of shellfish,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.530
clams, kitans and other gastropods. They use
their suctions cups on their eight arms to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.800
slowly pry the tasty morsels from their shells.
They have also been reported feeding on various

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.060
fish species. Common Octopus exhibit a variety
of color schemes. They may be a brownish gray

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.090
to a mottled greenish white and brown to nearly
pure white. Which is the color they turn when

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.050
they are stressed or threatened. They can
quickly change their color pattern to better

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:28.290
blend into their surroundings and hide from
both predators and prey. The Common Octopus

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:50.250
can reach a maximum size of three feet but
most are fifteen inches to twenty eight inches

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.570
from head to arm tips. They are most commonly
found on or near coral reefs and may also

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.650
be seen hunting in sea grass beds and in coral
rubble areas. The Common Octopus is not a

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.940
long lived animal generally surviving only
a year or two. During its short life span

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.980
they will mate and lay as many as a hundred
thousand tiny eggs to propagate their species.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.049
That's the Common Octopus.
