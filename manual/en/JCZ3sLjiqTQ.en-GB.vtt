00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.314
Hello, sorry I've been away for so long.

00:00:02.314 --> 00:00:04.940
I have some vlogging notes, let's do this.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.040
So this month I've been living with my sister and working in London.

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:16.074
In terms of the location and amenities it's been great, but the whole move and working situation and stuff, has been quite triggering for my Trich.

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:19.160
Sharing a bathroom and kitchen with others has been a nightmare!

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.012
I had forgotten how stressful it is, living with non-Trichers and non-family members.

00:00:24.012 --> 00:00:28.694
Additionally, using my sisters room has made me realise how much hair I'm losing.

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:34.274
There was hair all over the desk, all over her pillows, there were eyebrows all over wall and mirror.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.320
Rawwwhhh!!  

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.814
See, I'm fine with losing hair, I'm used to it.

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:40.900
But when you're in someone else's space, it's a bit.... mmmm.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.494
And yes, I did tidy up before I left, but that's not the point. Whilst I was there, there was hair everywhere.

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:49.454
I don't know how I coped, living with people in the past.

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:53.940
For the last two years, I've been living on my own and right now I'm in my own room - so I can do what I want in here!

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.554
Yesterday, I moved back here into my own space and already I'm feeling better.

00:00:58.554 --> 00:01:02.194
There's hair all over the desk, all over my clothes. But I'm okay.

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:04.154
Right, let's change topic.

00:01:04.154 --> 00:01:08.094
In terms of damage, yes I do have tonnes of hair, but I'm still losing hair.

00:01:08.094 --> 00:01:12.640
I've got a big patch under my hair at the back here, which I'm not going to talk about.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.260
Something else that's stressing me is that the top portion of my hair, this bit...

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.720
...hasn't really grown in the last year and I'm nervous that its got to a point now where it won't grow, because it's so damaged.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.186
It will only grow to a certain length and then fall out. 

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:27.480
This bit continues to grow really well!

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.689
But the bit on top seems to be stuck. I'm not getting it cut short, it's staying short.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.400
I try not to think about it, but the anxiety of my hair not growing back, really scares me. It does scare me.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.798
I don't really want to go into depth about pressure right now, but I am feeling under lots of pressure...

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:43.907
...to grow out my hair. 

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:46.710
Not just for myself, but for you guys aswell.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.304
I suppose on some level, it's quite comforting to watch someone go through trauma and then "get better" and grow the hair again afterwards.

00:01:53.874 --> 00:01:55.554
But, I don't know if I can.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.720
Sorry if I'm not really filling that criteria, I don't know if I will.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.840
Saying all this, I would like to see my hair grow, in my P.E.D video. That would be ahh! :D.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.960
Changing topic again! Recently, my hair has been disgusting!

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.260
I finally figured out what the problem was. It's London's water.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.060
I've been doing lots of reading and it's the water... it's something to do with the metal and the mineral levels.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.074
Before, when I was living in Essex, I was getting to a point where I didn't have to wash my hair every day!

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:25.234
I could go two days without washing my hair, which is incredible for me.

00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:30.654
But when I moved to London, my hair was so disgusting, I needed to wash it every couple of hours!

00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:35.114
I'm just hoping that after a couple of weeks living back home, it will be normal again.

00:02:35.114 --> 00:02:38.314
The last thing I have to talk about is my Disney Audition!

00:02:38.314 --> 00:02:44.114
So I went to a Disneyland Paris Cast member Audition, which was held at Pineapple (Dance) Studios in London.

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:47.453
I didn't get cast, but I did make it through to the third round.

00:02:47.453 --> 00:02:53.454
I still would like to act, but I know deep down inside, it's never going to happen. I mean for starters, although actors can wear wigs...

00:02:53.454 --> 00:02:59.680
...having your own consistent hair is far more appealing to agents and casting directors and stuff.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.860
But one of the reasons I felt able to go this audition, was because "your" hair didn't matter!

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.100
Most cast members at Disney dress up as the Disney Princesses and characters.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.500
So they're either in fur costumes, or they have these huge wigs.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.933
So even if I was half bald, it wouldn't matter.

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:17.540
But talking about the audition, it was terrifying.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.740
They say do something every day that scares you, well if I did that, I'd have no hair left.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.040
I somehow did two plaits and they managed to stay in all day.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.860
At the end of the day, hundreds of girls came out with their dreams shattered and were crying and sobbing.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.400
But I came out smiling.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.460
Sure I was upset and I was disappointed, but at the end of the day, I went to an audition, I went in their knowing what I was getting myself into...

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.134
...and I competed against what I was met with.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.080
So I was and continue to be, really proud.... yes!

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.060
That's about it for me today. Erm, I'm losing my voice.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.060
There isn't really much else to say. 

00:03:51.374 --> 00:03:57.294
So (I) hope you're all well, I'm now gonna disappear and I'll see you soon. Oh yeah. (Rawr)
