00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.520
So far, we consist all the sentences in a
positive way. I am, this is, you are, and

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.760
the questions. And we are going to learn how
to make a negative sentence, using "not."

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:25.449
Ok? So let's look at the examples. The first
one is, ok, this is the core sentence: Watashi

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:34.699
wa isha desu means, "I am a doctor." And then
this part "desu" changes to "dewa arimasen."

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:47.690
There are many ways to make a negative sentence,
but so far we've learned a speech pattern.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:58.229
It's either ends desu, arimasu, imasu, so
let's just memorize all the form changes,

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:09.510
ok? So repeat after me: Watashi wa isha dewa
arimasen. Very good. Actually, the denying

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.610
part is right here. Masen. When you hear the
"-masen" at the end, pretty much it's denial.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:27.510
And I have another example using "there is,
there are." Let's say it was, Kuruma ga arimasu.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:38.290
That was, "There is a car." And now, you say,
"There isn't a car." You say, "Kuruma ga arimasen."

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.500
Yes, very similar. You use "arimasen" both
times. And actually, when you use "imasu,"

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:53.870
it's the same change. The "-su" part changes
to "imasen," so this end part is the denial.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:04.860
And also, we only use the verbs "is" "am"
"are" in English, so we're going to get into

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.060
the verb, then we'll learn more denials, but
so far, this is the form you have to know.
