Hi there everyone! It's Jennifer McGuire.
Today I have a video for you that shows how

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.810
to add color to vellum. This is a great technique,
because a lot of us have vellum and have markers

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.230
so it's easy to do. Also I'll be making a
shaker card from the vellum. I really like

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.009
vellum shaker cards, because they're so much
easier to do than regular shaker cards. I'm

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.619
using some products from Newton's Nook. This
is part of their Blog Hop celebrating these

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.310
new products. So let's go ahead and jump in.
I'm using two Newton's Nook stamp sets. One

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.660
is a snowflake. I love how fine and detailed
they are and then also the Blessings from

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.500
this leaf stamp set. I will be also using
the MISTI Stamping Tool. You do not have to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.260
have that for this card, but I'm just going
to show you how easy it is to use. You could

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.379
use a regular acrylic block or stamp press
if you want. I have a piece of vellum that

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.760
is cut to slightly smaller than 5.5x4.25 and
I'm putting .25 inch masking tape around the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.789
edges because I want to just mask the sides
off. You know why a little bit later. You

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.019
could skip this part if you wanted to. I really
like this narrow painters tape, you could

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.750
also use Washi tape if you wanted. Okay, so
now I'm going to take this and put this is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.500
in my MISTI stamping tool. Now, there are
many ways to use this tool. This is just one

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.909
of them. I found that this was easiest for
the card that I was doing. Just taping it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.619
right in place on the inside. Okay so now
I need to assemble my stamps. I'm just planning

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.869
where I want my stamps to be and I'm putting
them with the stamp side down, so the backside

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.009
of the stamp is facing up. This is a great
tool because I can position my stamps wherever

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.119
I want it, get them all figured out on my little piece of vellum here and then when I close

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.590
it, it will transfer all the stamps to the
perfect position and get ready to stamp. If

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.969
you just have an acrylic block or a stamp
press, you can lay your piece of paper on the table,

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.719
assemble your stamps on it and then press your large acrylic block or stamp press right on top

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.659
of it to grab the stamps, but I love being
able to lay them all out and position them.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.509
Okay, so once I have them exactly where I
want it, with this tool I just close this

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.820
like door or panel, press down and that transfers
all of the stamps onto the perfect place onto

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.310
the panel on the other side. So, now all I
have to do is ink this up and then close it

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.319
again and it will stamp perfectly where I
want it to. The nice thing about this is I could

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.900
mass-produce very easily or I could also,
let's say I stamp it and I don't stamp it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.930
completely I can stamp it again and it will
give me perfect perfect alignment. Okay, so

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.370
let's just go ahead and use it. I ink this
up with VersaMark Ink, just going to close

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.390
it right onto my vellum piece and press down and
that will do my stamping. Again, you could

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.150
do this with a regular acrylic block or a
stamp press if you wanted to. But a lot of

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.840
people were asking to see the MISTI tool in
use more. I just think it's a great great

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.530
product. Okay, so now I'm going to take this
off and I'm going to go a head and stamp some

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.849
more cards if I want to. Could even do different
designs of stamping if I wanted to also. Now,

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.060
I'm adding some Hero Arts white embossing
powder. This is my favorite white embossing

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.480
powder. I forgot to do my anti-static tool,
so I might get powder where I don't want it,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.870
but I thinks it's okay, because there's a
lot going on on this card and you probably

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.610
won't see it. To prevent warping when you
take a heat gun to vellum I suggest two things.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.090
One is to let your heat gun get
good and hot by turning on and pointing it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.610
away for about 10 seconds and then bringing
it to the paper and I also recommend getting

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.349
a very good quality heat gun, like this Milwaukee
heat gun, because it gets good and hot and

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.590
you don't have to keep the heat on too long,
so I didn't have any warping issues with this.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.099
So there we have our bright white embossed images
on the vellum background. So, I'm going to

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.019
remove the tape here and I noticed that because
I didn't use my anti-static tool I got some

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.939
powder where I didn't want it, so I'm just
using my craft knife to scrap that off. 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.420
Nobody will ever notice it, no big deal. Okay. Now this is the fun part of adding color

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.939
to vellum. You actually do it to the backside.
So, I'm going to flip this bad boy over, and

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.700
I decided to mask off the sides again. So
this is on the back of the vellum. I could

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.420
have used the thin strips from before, but
to be honest with you, I threw them away and I didn't

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.750
think about it. So I'm just going to tape
around the edges. I just wanted to have the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.180
vellum on the outside edges of this vellum
piece to be clean, not to be colored. So on

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.090
the back of the piece I am coloring with my
Copic Markers. However, you could use any

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.120
markers really for this that you want. I've
done this before with Tombow Markers. You

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.060
can use Sharpie, Bic Markers if you wanted
to. Anything that you have would be great.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.260
I find the darker the color the better. Because
when you flip it over it will look lighter

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.760
because it's showing through the vellum which
kind of mutes it. So, I'm using a few different

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.170
colors of Copic Markers here. I decided to
go with Royal Blue, a Hot Pink and a Teal.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.960
This will be fun, because when I flip it over
it will kind of stained glass like. You could

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.400
add the color to the front, but this is easier,
because look at it, I don't need to color

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.900
it perfectly, because the white blocks where
I don't color it perfect. So I don't like

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.800
to use my Copics on embossed surfaces. I also
decided to color the background with a light

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.700
blue marker, so that the background inside
the masked area actually has a blue tint to

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.530
it. You could leave this plain if you want
to. By the way if you’re doing this and

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.310
you’re not real happy with the color your
using just take an alcohol swab and you can

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.000
wipe some of the color off and you can start
all over. Now that I'm done adding my color

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.780
I'm just going to take my masking strips off
and it looks absolutely horrible from the backside, but

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.960
I noticed that some of my color kind of bled
through there so I am just using my colorless

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.270
blender. You could use an alcohol swab again
to clean that off. Check that out, front the

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.260
front side it's really soft and beautiful
and kind of has a stain glass look to it.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.410
Okay, I first thought I was going to put it
on a white note card; I changed my mind and

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:58.000
decided to put it on a pool colored note card that's
top folding. So this is a 4.25"x5.5" card.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.740
I'm putting some Pretty Pink Posh Silver Confetti;
those are those silver circles, towards the

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.830
center of the card. And also, just some old
chunky glitter that I have from Doodlebug.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.250
I recommend chunky glitter for this, because
they don't escape out the sides as much. So

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.620
I put some Lawn Fawn snowflake sequins in there
too. I need to seal the sides of the shaker

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.780
card now. The way I do that is, I use a sewing
machine. I have an inexpensive sewing machine,

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.430
I'll link to the one that I use, and it works
great on sewing on paper. I think it adds

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.130
the handmade feel of cards. If you don't have
a sewing making you could use a line of adhesive

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.920
around the outside of this and then cover
it with think strips of card stock, or you

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.520
could hand stitch if you really wanted to.
I use that tape to hold it all in place as

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.950
I ran it through my sewing machine. I actually
stitched with a silver thread twice around

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.250
the outside, because I really wanted to make
sure that none of that glitter kind of got

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.160
out of the sides of the stitching, so double
stitching around seems to keep it in more.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.200
So there you can see all the little bits and
pieces inside kind of shaking around and the

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.810
soft soft color that you get by adding color
to the back of vellum. This is a great technique

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.030
for any stamps that you may have. You could
silver embossing on the front and add touches

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.810
of color on the back. Just a great way to
stretch your stamps and create a fun somewhat

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.940
interactive card with the shaker bits inside.
