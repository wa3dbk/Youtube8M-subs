Hi, this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:08.500
On today's episode let's talk about iCloud
Photo Sharing in the new Photos app.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.599
So the new Photos app, in conjunction with
iCloud, makes it very easy for you to share

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.509
photos so others can see it.

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.550
They don't have to have the Photos app.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.580
They don't even have to be on the Mac.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.869
All they need is access to the web.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.150
Let's see how we can do this.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.319
Notice that on the left sidebar here you can
bring that up with View, Show or Hide Sidebar,

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.610
you've got your shared Activity.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.800
I can bring that up.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.890
I haven't started sharing yet.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.900
So I'm going to hit the Start Sharing button
and it is going to prompt me to share an Album.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.200
Let's create one called Test Share.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.130
I'm not going to invite any people right now
and I'm not going to add a comment.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.210
I'm just going to create it.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.850
You can see now I've got Test Share.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.570
This Activity tab here shows recent things
that I've done with Sharing.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.570
So let's go right to the Test Share here and
you can see that it is empty.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.260
Let's add photos and videos by clicking there.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.470
Now I can go and view all my photos.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.329
I'm going to select a couple and I'm going
to hit Add.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.759
Then it is going to add these to the Test
Share album.

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.759
Great.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.939
It took about 30 seconds and now these three
photos are listed as Shared here on the Test

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.460
Share album.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.700
Now look at this.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.439
I can go ahead and add more photos and videos
here.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.200
I can then use some buttons here at the top.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.679
So I can click here and I can change the album
name, I can invite some more people, and I

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:32.950
can set some options.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.130
So I can set Subscribers Can Post so when
I invite people they can actually post photos

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.130
of their own here.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.039
So you automatically created a Shared Album
that other people can post.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.979
A whole family can post photos of a vacation
to one shared album here.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.939
I can also have Notifications here sent to
me when people post and do things.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.130
I can check this off and now it is public
and it's on a website and I can actually use

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.380
this link here and I can send out an email
to friends and they can go ahead and view

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.380
it.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.530
So I'm going to copy that and then I'm going
to open it up in Safari.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.740
So here I am in Safari and I can see that
at this URL I can see the album here.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.740
Anybody can see this.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.980
They can be using any browser and can go in
here to this website and view it because I

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.980
have made it public.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.010
This is a great way to share photos with people
like while you are on trips and things like

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.010
that.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.140
You can select any photo to go directly to
it and then you can flip through them all.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.090
So it it kind of all like automatic here.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.180
You can also download individual photos to
full screen.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.820
A lot of functionality in this standardized
webpage here.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.800
So it is important to keep in mind there are
two types of people that will be viewing these

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800
when they are public.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.050
There are the people that are not invited
and they can just view them and download and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.050
do things.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.050
But they can't change it.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.050
They can't add photos.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.800
Then there are the people you've invited who
should also have the Photos app.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.490
They will actually be able to see it listed
here on the left under Shared and be able

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.840
to add their own photos.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.630
Or if you turn this off here then they will
just be able to see and they won't be able

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.000
to modify it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.190
You can also change the name of the album
any time you want and use this button here

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.340
to delete it.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.180
So the cool thing here is that it is so easy
to add to this.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.800
Let's say I'm looking through my photos collection
and decide I want to add this photo right

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.060
here to it.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.990
I can select it and I can hit the Share button
and say I want to use iCloud Photo Sharing

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.530
and there's that Test Share album I've created.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.880
I can tap on it right there and now it is
added to it.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.660
So now if I go to Test Share I can see that
fourth photo is there.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.011
Also while I'm here I can select and then
delete it.

00:03:49.011 --> 00:03:50.980
It is going to remove it from the Shared album.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.610
It doesn't delete it from my photos collection
and I can get rid of it.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.680
So it is very easy to change this.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.240
So iCloud Photo Sharing is very simple and
very easy and quick to use.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.870
The down side to that is that there are not
many options.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.980
For instance, there is no way to add captions
to these or anything for anybody to read.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.020
They just see the photos.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.800
There is no way beyond these options to further
customize it.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.120
For instance if you wanted to have it available
on the web but only to certain people there

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.480
is no option for that.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.840
They either have to be somebody invited and
they view it through Photos or they can be

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.670
publicly viewed by anybody that has this URL.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.000
So if you really want more options and more
things that you can do of course there are

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.570
other ways to share photos.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.420
You can select some photos and you can do
all sorts of stuff.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.630
You can share on Facebook and put them up
there.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.630
You can use Flicker.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.080
There is a lot of different options.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.830
Of course beyond the Photos app there are
more options as well.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.940
So if you want tons of control and very specific
things then iCloud Photo Sharing is not for

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.940
you.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.990
But if you want something quick and easy to
be able to share with anybody or have a shared

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.599
album that a group of people can add to then
iCloud Photo Sharing is a great option.
