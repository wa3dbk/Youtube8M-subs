00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
3 segment.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.250
Pretty short, but it's difficult as the 1 or 4 segment.

00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:26.980
Mostly cause of Evidence Dash mission.

00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:38.510
Car spawns at same location, but route is random.

00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:44.110
You can afford only 2 types - Car is heading to you, or Car is heading to you, then it turns right.

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:49.610
Otherwise, you can restart segment immediatly.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.650
Here, the car should go left too, otherwise you failed.

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:05.410
Left here too, or right and then left.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.550
Here, he goes left, which is wrong, but i continue, since i was able to pickup packages really fast.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.250
Now you must destroy your car, i was looking for good exchange.

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:31.780
Here it is.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.350
Pretty random mission too, but of course it's easier than previous.

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:28.610
Sometimes, you can't just find Columbian car.

00:02:48.783 --> 00:02:53.780
I use drive-by here, and suddenly for me, i kill one of those columbians.

00:02:56.617 --> 00:03:01.610
The garage, where the Oriental Man located is random too.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.750
It's pretty lucky to have him in the 1 garage.

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:11.910
Of course, shooting trough the floor, and watching at the blip, since 1 rocket isn't enough to kill him.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.350
Also, it's lucky about banshee here, because sometimes it isn't spawns here.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.550
Well, i must make at least 1 screw up, before finishing the segment, thats my style.
