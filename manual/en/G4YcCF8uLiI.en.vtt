00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:10.669
Don't look at me.

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:12.330
l want to look.

00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:28.086
You'll perfect the skin.

00:00:28.154 --> 00:00:29.587
You'll make it work.

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:31.055
lt doesn't matter.

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:32.819
Julie...

00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:36.561
don't you think
l told myself that,

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.062
night after sleepless night?

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:40.598
lt's just a burn.
Skin-deep.

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.226
lt doesn't matter.

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:45.270
And if l covered it,

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.736
hid behind a mask,

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:50.070
you could love me
for who l was inside.

00:00:50.142 --> 00:00:52.007
Without pity.

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:56.873
But a funny thing happened.

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.349
As l worked on the mask,

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:02.387
l found the man inside
was changing.

00:01:02.454 --> 00:01:04.614
He became wrong...

00:01:06.023 --> 00:01:08.321
a monster.

00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:10.860
l can live with it now,

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:12.589
but nobody else can.

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:31.112
l want our life back.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.882
Peyton!

00:01:46.997 --> 00:01:48.430
Peyton!

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.092
Peyton is gone.

00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:16.486
Peyt?

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:21.486
Hey!

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:24.592
l'm everyone...

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.293
and no one...

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:30.097
everywhere...

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.071
nowhere.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.904
Call me...
