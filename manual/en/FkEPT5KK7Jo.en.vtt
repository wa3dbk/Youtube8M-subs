Alright, well that's the snare in a nutshell.
And I say in a nutshell because there's, it's

00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:11.640
limitless to the amount of stuff you can do
with the snare. So just to recap what we went

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.910
over. We went over the basic components of
the snare. Remember when tuning, always tune

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.270
diagonal. You can pick whatever kind of head
you want. The drop clutch on the side here

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.400
loosens and tightens the snares. The snares
themselves are the metal springs on the bottom

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.410
of the actual snare drum, which gives it its
punch, its actual distinct sound. We went

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.860
over how to set up a snare. And again, you're
going to want to play with the angle and find

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.370
something you like. And after playing for
a while that should come to you naturally.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.200
We went over the rim shot. You use the reverse
side of your stick to get that sound out of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.830
the rim on the side here. We went over ghost
beats, which again are really cool. And really

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.790
try to incorporate that into a lot of the
beats you do, because it gives it it's own

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:01.079
character and it just sounds really neat.
And we went over the actual snare roll, which

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.560
is important. And also, not just limited to
the actual snare itself. The roll can be used

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.320
on toms. You can roll on the bell or the cymbal,
the ride or crash or high hat. So all these

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.670
things on the snare drum that we're learning,
almost all of them can be incorporated into

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.400
the rest of the kit. So at the very end, skipping
a couple of things. We just talk about getting

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.600
creative. You know, like how I meet at the
snare, did a kind of a snare rim roll, funk

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.590
groove. So just sit there and be unconventional.
Just really kind of mess with it and get your

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.220
own sound out of it. But most of all just
keep playing. And after a while, it'll all

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.590
come to you and you'll find something you
really enjoy. So my next session actually,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.650
we're going to be talking about using the
high hat. And kind of along the same lines

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.149
as the snare drum, really getting diverse
with it. Because of course, you use the high

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.880
hat almost as much as the snare, because it's
right there. You keep your time with it, very

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.340
important. So we're going to get diverse with
that. So I'd like to thank you for watching.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.420
Expert Village, again, my name is Mike Schminke
and tune in to my next clip when we talk about

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.769
the high hat. Thanks again.
