00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.330
I'm Kate, I'm from Top Hundred Acres

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.960
and we're 35 kilometers north of Melbourne.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.768
We're sort of in the heart of the Plenty Valley.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.240
So we are a free range farm,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.640
we've diversified recently

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.170
so that we have our Chicken Caravan

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.579
which is a wonderful invention.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.986
So we've had the chickens for three months, 

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:38.480
yeah, we got them in September:

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.320
that's when our Caravan was delivered.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.227
One of the big aims of our farm 

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.530
is we're wanting to improve the pasture,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.032
so the Caravan plays a big part in that, 

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:50.730
and obviously, you know,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.635
we can tow it around, 

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.170
our whole farm and yes, 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.472
it fertilizes the ground that we tow around the paddock 

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.908
and we have 400 chickens at the moment, 

00:00:57.908 --> 00:00:59.676
that are all free range, 

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:02.479
their feed doesn't have any 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.550
artificial coloring in it, it's all natural grains.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.621
We have some cows as well, 

00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:13.457
that's the main things we do at the moment, 

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:15.450
We also grow garlic,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.627
so yeah, we have a crop of garlic 

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:19.996
that we grow annually and it's all organic,

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.766
so we don't use any chemical pesticides.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.000
And that's why the Chicken Caravan is really good,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
because it can tow it around and fertilize

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.600
before we plant a new crop.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.680
Our chickens in the Caravan they're never locked up

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.940
so they are on fresh grass all the time.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.185
The Caravan is moved around and obviously 

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.154
the chickens are picking up grubs 

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:48.525
and eating the grass so it's making good nutritious eggs.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.698
So we have Bradley, is our alpaca and guardian, 

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.367
so he guards all our hens,

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.500
we also have a solar-powered electric fence

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.800
so that runs a huge area that we move all the time, 

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:07.500
and makes sure the foxes are kept out.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.850
So we have a large section of the paddock 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.619
that we basically plow up every year, 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.980
we plant a crop of garlic, 

00:02:17.988 --> 00:02:19.456
the main varieties we grow are 

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:21.758
Monaro Purple and Giant Russian.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.660
Sometimes we grow Australian white, at the same time,

00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:30.967
we grow without any use of chemicals so it's basically organic.

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.770
It's hand-weeded and watered directly 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.605
from our dam using rainwater.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.876
Yeah, and harvested by hand and hangs up in our shed.
