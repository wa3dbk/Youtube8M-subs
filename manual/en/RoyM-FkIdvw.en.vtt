00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.580
Freshman basketball player Willie
Clayton has burst onto the college

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.570
basketball landscape in his first season
with the 49ers.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.039
A gentle giant away from the hardwood,

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.319
let's find out what makes Willie flip
the switch for game time

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:22.699
I started playing basketball when I was
six years old

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.160
at Thomasville YMCA

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.529
and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.769
I found out about it when they
came to my elementary school. I went

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.859
to Scott Elementary School

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.300
and so they came to the elementary school
and they wanted some players

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.700
and so they left little forms for us 
to fill out

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.910
over and so I took one home to my mother

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.570
and I told her, you know, I was real 
about basketball

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.630
because she played basketball and so

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.120
that was my first time expressing myself 
to my mother that I wanted to play basketball.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.820
I actually did want to be a guard, but

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.300
but it turned around to be that, you know, I'd
start growing and growing and growing and then

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.110
I never worked on my like ball handling skills
and so all of sudden I was like bigger and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.390
stronger than all of the kids I grew
up with

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.190
and so you know I was just like, you know,
watching NBA and watching college

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.260
and like those guys are big just like I am

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.780
I'm physical just like they are so

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.210
I was just like I'm going to turn it big
I'm going to start playing big.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.119
I just try

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.670
to stay out of Willie's way and make sure
he knows which end we're shooting on

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.560
but Willie's being Willie

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.160
he's rebounded

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.780
probably when he was two years old he
was rebounding he's probably freshman year 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.290
in high school he could rebound.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810
What makes a good rebounder?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.720
A guy that knows the rim

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.070
like you've got to know where the ball
is at all times like the when point guard

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.560
shoots the ball, you've got to know
where it's going to land.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.270
Rebounding is one of those things that
really doesn't have a whole lot to do with

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.570
coaching. Guys have a nose for it.
He's got a gift

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.290
quite honestly and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.580
but he's a high character kid as well so 
what you see is this consistency

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.800
because of who he is as a person

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.890
and you're seeing some results in terms of what
he is as a player.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.739
There is no finesse, it's straight monster.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:18.739
It's like you don't want to play me on an
angry night, that's it.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.540
And then growing up I watched Dennis Rodman
a lot and there was just something

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.859
about him that I liked, like

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.559
he knew his role.

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:32.059
That's the same way I see myself on this
team I know my role. So

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:36.709
my role is to get rebounds and you know
if a couple of points fall my way, they fall

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.419
my way, that's just how it is. But I know
my role I like that.

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:47.419
Let's go. Game time! I think what they're 
learning that you didn't have in high school

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.199
in high school physically they could either
overpower someone or

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:55.679
they could just catch a ball against a 6'4"
guy and turn, jump up and dunk it and

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.299
I think it's a great learning experience
for them to have to now go through

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.069
the guy behind you that's a lot like you

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.779
and so it will encourage them to be

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:05.629
more crafty in what they're doing, which 
is I think will be nothing but a good thing.
