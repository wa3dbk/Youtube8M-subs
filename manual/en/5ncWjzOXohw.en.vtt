00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.379
Eco is an online world, shared by a group
of students, in which they are trying to build

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:14.440
a civilization. Everything they do in this
shared world affects their environment. So

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.820
it takes place inside of a simulated ecosystem.
They need to use resources that are available

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.210
in the environment, but if they do so in a
way that doesn't give much though to the consequences,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.630
they could have a negative effect on this
environment, and actually damage or destroy

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870
this world that they are all sharing together.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.660
So in Eco the goal isn't to save the environment or protect the environment, the goal is to
build. The goal is to create a civilization.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.140
But in order to do that, secondarily, the
ecosystem comes into play.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.520
The ecosystem simulation within the world is modeled after the biomes
in the Pacific Northwest. So as players are

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.160
hunting or logging, they are going to affect
the underlying simulation,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.080
and the ecosystem and those population dynamics are going to
respond in a realistic way.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.340
The world of Eco belongs to the whole group. Everybody sharing
this world together, and you have to make

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.390
decisions as a group as to what should happen
to this world. So in order to do that, we

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.220
built tools in Eco that allow players to propose
laws. So because Eco is based on a simulation

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.080
of plants and animals, we are generating tons
of data that we are able share with the players.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.720
The players can collect this data in the game,
and they can use that in their argumentation.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.550
So every law in Eco needs to be backed up
by scientific argumentation that is based

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.830
on the actual data that is coming from the
game.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.500
So once the law is proposed, players can have these really rich discussions online
as to what's the right way to go about this.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.460
It's official, the elks are extinct. Because
I just made a graph and looked at their population.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.950
Eco is a game that runs on a server in the
cloud, and that means that we're running the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.170
game simulation all the time, and the students
can sort of jump in and out whenever they

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.690
want. They can play in the classroom or at
home.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.560
The classroom time is kind of the chance to have the council meeting. That's where
you are discussing with your peers what should

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.850
be done in this world. And this is where we
see the role of the teacher becoming really

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.050
important. They are guiding this discussion.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:25.520
In order to support teachers as they integrate Eco into their class instruction, we're developing
a series of teacher tools. These tools will

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.910
allow teachers to see everything that's happening
in Eco, in real time. Teachers will be able

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.310
to use these tools to set specific scenarios,
so that specific learning objectives, aligned

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.430
to the different next generation science standards,
can be addressed.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.940
I see it as a game that we can start maybe at the beginning of an
ecology unit. But something that we could

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.340
come back to in the classroom and revisit
maybe once a week, and they can see how things

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.620
are changing. And definitely something that
ideally they would be able to access at home.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.800
And then, as a class, when we have a chance
to revisit it as a whole class later on again

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800
in the week, we can take a look at those changes
that were made, and maybe who made changes,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.640
and why and how that is impacting the environment.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.080
Another great advantage of games is that we can give this accelerated view of time and
consequences. So we can have an ecosystem

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.180
that runs fast forward from reality basically.
So you get many years worth of consequences

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.680
of human actions, within the time span of
a few days.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.580
Eco is a fragile world. It's a simulated ecosystem that can die if players
don't take care of it. Species can go extinct

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.260
in this game. You can loose access to food
and resources, which would destroy this world

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.730
that players have spent weeks building on.
There's just this ownership to this world.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.840
You care about this world, because it's important
to you, and to have this game set in a world

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.540
that can be damaged, that can be effected
by your decisions if you don't work together

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.940
to understand effect of the ecosystem. That
really just adds a lot of meaning to everything

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.660
that you are doing. It puts it in this context
that actually matters to you.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.060
It gives this view to the player that they wouldn't necessarily
have otherwise.
