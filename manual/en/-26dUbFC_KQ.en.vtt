00:00:02.977 --> 00:00:03.810
Hey, what's up guys?

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.690
I'm Alex Farnham, and
this "Animalist News."

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.470
Google Street View takes 360
degree images on locations

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.500
all around the world from the
tops of cars, bikes, trains,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.760
snowmobiles, canal boats,
and even backpacks.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.790
Now, Google is
capturing street views

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.400
of the Liwa Desert in
the United Arab Emirates.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.000
How?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.090
By using a camel, of course.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.290
Google has employed
Raffia, the first animal

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.197
to capture images
for Street View.

00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:29.655
They chose a camel
because they say

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:32.720
it minimizes the disruption
of the desert environment.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.940
Starting at 6:00 AM,
a guide walks Raffia

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.310
through the sand dunes,
reaching up to 131 feet high.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.487
The street view
covers 82 sand dunes.

00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:44.070
Aside from being
kinder to the desert,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220
camels are a good fit
in other ways too.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.500
Specifically, that
they are built

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.210
for the desert in the most
awesome and surprising way.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.800
They are experts
in storing water,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.730
and can consume around
30 gallons at once.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.680
And no, they don't
store it in their humps,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.980
despite what some people think.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.140
The hump stores fat which they
can metabolize into water.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.900
And according to research by
the University of Singapore,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.800
camels can live as long as six
months without food or water.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.300
What?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.210
To put that into
perspective, humans

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.290
can only survive a single
week without water.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.490
Camels are also unique because
their red blood cells are oval

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.700
shaped, which helps
with dehydration.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.030
They also rarely sweat.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.310
And when they urinate,
it's a very little amount;

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.670
so little that it appears
thick like a syrup-- ew.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.110
They have thick fur which
reflect sunlight, and also acts

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.570
as insulation from the heat.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.860
And as for all that
sand, camels have

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.870
two rows of the long eyelashes,
and a third clear eyelid

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.390
that will keep any grains
from getting into their eyes.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.050
So it makes sense that camels
would be the perfect fit

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.300
to help people explore the
desert while sitting at home.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.944
Wow, I feel like Aladdin!

00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:48.360
What do you think
the next carrier

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.280
will be for the
Google Street Cam?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.390
Is there an ideal
animal to explore

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.664
underwater or elsewhere?

00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.080
Let me know in the
comments below.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.160
And if you want to see how polar
bears are photobombing Google

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.070
