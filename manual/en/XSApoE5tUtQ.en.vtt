00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.880
Today I am going to show you how to fix your

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.380
ignition problems in the GMC or Chevy
vehicles. Now a lot of people have

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.210
this problem where you go to start the vehicle

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.210
and you get that familiar sound
of the vehicle trying to start

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.100
and it doesn't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.320
this all has to do with a security
feature built into the GMC

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.320
and Chevy vehicles. This little wire right here is one possible culprit. it becomes corroded

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.160
or loose and you can see with it unplugged
it does the exact same thing

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.900
and I'm going to plug it back and show you how it starts

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.580
normally you would have to wait 10 minutes for a security system
reset

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.250
there might be a way to do it, reset on
your own but I have done about everything from unplug

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.259
the battery to search around the fuses

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.149
and I've found nothing to reset the
security system automatically.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.520
and you can see that's what it's supposed to do

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.120
with the wire secured

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.049
and here's a fiction I just put a little
share them

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.330
made with the plastic toothpick and push
the done in there to keep the wire from

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.250
slipping or

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.250
becoming disconnected you can always
followed up by a little hot glue

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.920
to keep it extra secure but the killing
back on there you go and you shouldn't

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.979
have a problem anymore

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.310
