Hi my name is Alissa with Expert Village and
today i'm going to show you how to chrochet

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.450
a Beanie. Now that I've shown you how to do
a single chrochet in a spiral I'm going to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.510
show you how to do a double chrochet in a
spiral. And this will give a little bit of

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.730
a looser weave to your Beanie but it can make
for a nice interesting pattern. So we've just

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.710
done several stitches in a spiral with a single
crochet and to start our double chrochet you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.079
just want to get a good grip on your yarn
again and put your middle and thumb on your

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.290
knot and you're going to go to your next stitch,
you're going to put your hook through that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.090
next stitch, in front of the yarn, behind
the yarn, and pull it through once so now

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.880
you have two threads over your hook you're
going to pull the yarn through the first one

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.080
only agian and you want to keep your index
finger on this second loop so that you don't

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.000
accidentally pull it through there. So you've
just pulled it through again through that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.170
first hook and now you're going to pull the
yarn through both loops. So there's a double

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.530
chrochet. So I'll do that again and remember
we're doing two stitches per stitch here so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.500
that we get a nice wide curve on here. So
we're going to go through that same hole right

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.110
there, put the hook into the stitch, in front
of the yarn, behind the yarn and pull it through,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.430
and then you're going to pull the yarn through
just the first hook and then both of them.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.030
So there's your second double crochet. And
now we're moving on to the next stitch. So

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.440
you put your hook through the stitch, in front
of the yarn, behind the yarn and pull it through

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.170
once, pull it through a second time and then
pull it through both loops. And again, we're

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.110
going to do two stitches per stitch here.
So you're going to go through the same stitch

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.950
in front of the yarn, behind the yarn, and
pull it through, pull it through again and

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.450
then pull it through both. so there's your
double crochet. And as you notice when you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.220
continue on double chrocheting you're going
to get a much looser stitch here, and the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.720
work will go much faster because the stitch
is a little larger. And remember to put two

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.929
stitches in each hole so that you can get
a good shape for your Beanie. So as you can

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.280
see these stitches are going to be a little
bit bigger than the stitches around here and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.490
it might be a little bit easier to work with
because each hole will be a little bit bigger

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.650
and you can put more stitches in each one.
Ok, I'll show you it agian. Put your hook

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.700
through the stitch, in front of the yarn,
behind the yarn, and pull it through, pull

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.370
your yarn through the first loop, and then
the second loop. And then do a second stitch

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.550
in the same hole. And there's a double chrochet.
