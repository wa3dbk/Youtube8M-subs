00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.280
brain

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.340
how do you remember

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.880
the way to your friend's house

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.260
why do your eyes blink

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.120
without even thinking about it

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.980
where do dreams come from

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.320
your brain is in charge

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.000
of these things and a lot more

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.980
in fact

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380
your brain is the boss of your body

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.540
it runs the whole show

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.760
and controls just about everything

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.060
you do even when you're asleep

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.760
not bad for something that

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.280
looks like a big wrinkly gray sponge

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.720
and only weighs

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.680
about 1.3 kilograms

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.640
your brain contains billions

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.320
of nerve cells called

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.220
neurons that carry signals

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.840
to and from different

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.460
parts of your body

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200
through your central nervous system

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.400
your brain triples in weight

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.380
between birth and adulthood

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.240
as it grows it wrinkles up

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.200
to fit your skull which acts

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.920
like a protective crash helmet

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.020
if you could stretch it out

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.820
your brain would

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.560
cover an ironing board

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.380
shock absorbing liquids

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.540
fill the spaces

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.880
between the brain and the skull

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480
when you learn to do something

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.160
you create connections

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.420
between cells and your brains

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.020
next time you do it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.320
the connections are already there

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.360
so it's easier

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.260
the cerebrum is the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.080
main part of your brain

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.800
it gets in stores

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.140
information and controls your movements

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.660
the cerebellum is

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.360
also responsible for thinking

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.020
speaking and performing

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.560
complicated tasks such as sums

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.200
your cerebellum helps

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.240
you to balance and move your muscles

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.800
you use this bit of your brain

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.340
when you dance

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.620
whatever else you do the brain stems

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.080
make sure your heart

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.960
and breathing never stop

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.100
with all the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.980
other things it does

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.180
is it any surprise

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.160
that the brain runs your emotions

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.420
maybe you got the exact

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.680
toy you wanted for your birthday

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.580
and you're really happy

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.720
or your friend is sick

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.540
and you feel really sad

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.700
or your little brother messed up your room

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.660
and you're really angry

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.020
where do these feelings come from?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.620
your brain of course

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.360
so what can you do for your brain ?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.520
Plenty !!

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.140
eat healthy food that

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.880
contain potassium and calcium

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.940
to minerals that are

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.800
important for the nervous system

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.820
get a lot of playtime

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.777
or exercise

00:02:37.777 --> 00:02:38.860
wear a helmet

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.760
when you ride your bike

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.320
or play other sports that require

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.520
head protection

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.580
use your brain by doing challenging activities

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.660
such as puzzles reading

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.080
playing music making art or

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.020
anything else that gives

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.500
your brain a workout

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.340
mainly because the heart beats faster when a person

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.760
is scared or excited

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.300
now we know the emotions

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.240
come from the brain and in this

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.880
case the brain tells

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.500
the heart to speed up

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.780
so what's the heart up to then ?

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.800
how does it keep busy?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.260
what does it look?
