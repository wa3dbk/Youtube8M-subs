00:00:11.783 --> 00:00:16.990
In 1865 America was in ruins after civil war;

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.581
stuck in rubble, stranded, stagnant, and forever changed.

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:26.549
We needed leaders with the mastery and tenacity

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:33.898
to change tragedy into triumph, to unify a nation, 
and redefine the way the world would move forward together.

00:00:33.898 --> 00:00:35.868
 

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:38.179
So, Asa Packer founded Lehigh.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:38.946
 

00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:50.079
He wanted leaders poised to rise to their potential
and delve deep into complex problems,

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.035
leaders who could see the forest and the trees,

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:56.426
leaders with their heads in the clouds
and their feet on the ground,

00:00:56.426 --> 00:01:00.113
leaders who succeed because they're unafraid to fail,

00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:04.896
who work around the clock and around the world until it works.

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:06.274
And, it worked.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:12.337
Lehigh created leaders who forged the Industrial Revolution, 
cut a channel through Panama, engineered a Golden Gate,

00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:16.366
purified poisoned water, rebuilt bone from glass,

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:22.215
leaders who lead from research to reality
and from the classroom to the boardroom and beyond,

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:29.554
because when global problems arise our students 
and faculty don't just watch from afar, they rise to the challenge.

00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:37.230
They are everyday leaders, every level leaders, 
leaders who follow, leaders who compete against themselves,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.801
pay it forward leaders, one thing leads to another leaders,

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.256
leaders who are ahead of their time and right on time

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:46.953
who discuss, discover, debate,

00:01:46.953 --> 00:01:53.176
who question every question 
and don't stop asking until they find a new question,

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:59.169
leaders who radically redefine
the very essence of what it means to lead

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:06.573
because they are ready to roll up their sleeves 
and wrestle the problems of today, and ones that don't yet exist.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.861
Because even in 1865 
Asa Packer knew what's undeniably Lehigh;

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:24.878
that a changing world will always need
people who can change the world.
