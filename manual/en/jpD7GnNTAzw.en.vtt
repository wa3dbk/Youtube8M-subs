00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.230
The next combination we're going to work on,
it's a double left jab. The most important

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:12.490
punch for a right-handed orthodox boxer is
his left jab, is his left jab, left jab. Not

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.119
only is it a good single punch, but it's also
the lead punch on almost every combination

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.839
you're going to throw. But a lot of times
as you throw a left jab, if you get a little

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.890
bit better boxer in there, that boxer's going
to push your left jab out of the side. You

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.050
throw another left jab; he's going to brush
it down. You throw another left jab, he may

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.829
catch it with his right hand and continue
on with his own left jab. You throw another

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.580
left jab at him he may catch it with a left.
He may not do anything, but he may just catch

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.100
it, okay? He may not throw another punch at
you, but he'll just catch it. You throw another

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.590
jab, now you're getting frustrated, he might
bob. You throw another jab and he's going

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.100
to weave. No matter what he does and no matter
what you do, if you continue to throw one

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.660
jab, you may never get ahead. So now what
we're going to do is, instead of stepping

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.110
forward with a half a step and throwing one
jab and wasting what could be the only shot

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.780
you get at him for that particular instant,
what we're going to do is we're going to take

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.820
a quarter step with the first left jab, and
don't throw away all of your power. Use 10%

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.979
of your power because chances are he's going
to block it, he's going to catch it, he's

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.159
going to wave it out of the way, he's going
to do something to it. So just think of it

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.920
that way and just use 10% of your power. Then
bring it back to your face, arch your body

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.770
a little bit, and then fire a second left
jab, stepping another quarter step forward

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.140
at the same time, but this time throw 90%
of your power and mean it, okay? Smash him

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.060
with it the second time. What happens is as
he brushes that first one away, as he pushes

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.490
it down, as he bobs, as he weaves - whatever
he does to the first one, the chances are

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.570
he's going to be wide open for the second
one. So we're going to use 10% of our power

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.820
and then 90% of our power, okay? Two left
jabs, 10, 90. As you're moving around the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.020
bag, okay, one, two. Don't get in the habit
of throwing them both from here. One, two.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.130
One, two. We want to one and then two! Double
left jab. Hopefully it will work for you as

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.160
well as it does for us.
