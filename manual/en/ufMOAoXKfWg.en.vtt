Hi! My name is Adria. I am one of the professional
jugglers here at ExpertVillage.com and we

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.790
are now in the diabolo series. In the very
first section you learned what the diabolo

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.539
is. Now we are going to learn how to get this
thing started and how to keep it going. I

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.730
am going to describe to you how to get it
started and believe me the description of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.420
it lasts much longer than the actual motion.
I am going to start with the diabolo on the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.010
right side, drag it to the left and then dragging
on the floor gives it a spin in the correct

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.080
direction then lift it in the air gently and
jerk very fast with the right hand, which

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.110
keeps the spin going. If you drag it from
left to right and then try jerking with your

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.580
right hand you are going to be counteracting
the spin that you start and you are going

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.900
to end up with a twisted mess. So here we
are going to go. Start on the right, drag

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.970
to the left, lift and jerk. Very quick. I
will do it again. Start on the right, drag,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.620
lift and jerk. Nice fluid motion. That’s
how to get the diabolo started. Now as you

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.500
can see I am jerking with my right hand only.
I am not moving my left hand. The left stick

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.390
is moving just a little bit, but I keep my
left hand as still as possible. If you move

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.690
your left hand like you see some people doing
this, this is actually counteracting the spin

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.680
that you are putting on it with the right
hand. Now as you can see the diabolo is turning

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.440
a little. If you take the handle of your right
stick and place it in front of the diabolo

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.880
and just touch this front a little you will
turn it, the front to the left. If your diabolo

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.050
turns too far to left, then again you take
your right handed stick and you touch it to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.700
the back and it will turn to the right. So
now as a recap what we have. We have starting

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:21.189
the diabolo, we have turning it to the left,
we have turning it to the right and your goal

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:29.489
to stand with the diabolo is to always be
directly behind it. It will be perpendicular

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.249
to your body. And that’s how you start the
diabolo and that’s how you keep it going.
