Ok . It’s we are gonna be installing the screen guard now..

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:11.448
It is universal, so you can use it on any blackberries or anything  like that.

00:01:11.449 --> 00:01:14.397
Today we are gonna be putting it on your DS light.

00:01:14.398 --> 00:01:19.923
All you need is scissors and a pen to mark the universal screen guard with

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:24.753
It’s very slim. We got the package here.  

00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:34.830
Comes in three packs, see a plenty. It’ll do for 2 or 3 DS’s.

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:43.700
Also comes with a cool starting, you wipe it right here. 

00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:46.115
So you'll have a better install.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:55.241
Ya Here we go. Ok, We are gonna match this up on DS..

00:01:55.242 --> 00:01:59.095
Here guys, we are gonna quickly mark it.

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:05.991
We gonna mark this spot right  here, mark this spot right here. 

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:13.259
Mark the spot right there. So with those marks, I just wanna follow these lines.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.040
Let’s cut this straight. It's easy to do, anyone could do an install like this.

00:02:24.637 --> 00:02:29.885
Just cut.. do the line  that are provided already.

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.558
The things what you wanna do, kinda match up to see we got everything right here

00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:49.877
If everything is good, we trim this out a little, little bit more.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.780
I'm not a robot I do make mistakes.

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:09.243
I wanna trim this part a little, little bit.

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:16.812
Everything should be a perfect fit. Now wipe this out a little. 

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:22.292
Then at the point dim we are gonna peel off one of the protective cover side.

00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:28.353
Peel that off.

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:36.410
There is another start right here that you need to peel off.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:55.172
Put it right here, stick it on so you have no air bubbles.

00:03:55.173 --> 00:04:03.717
Stick it on, press really hard, so you can get out of the bubbles, you can see right here

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:12.819
Now it is protected.

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:20.481
Squeeze on the side.. Looks exactly the same. But now you won't have any scratches.

00:04:20.482 --> 00:04:25.242
Do the same thing on the other side, Just match it off.

00:04:25.243 --> 00:04:26.844
There is still  another one here.  

00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:31.882
What I’m gonna do with this DS is just to use same template I have around here.

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:39.452
Just really cut off the same line.

00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:46.116
we are cutting it

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:57.378
Really easy..

00:05:02.997 --> 00:05:06.759
Cut at the same size at the last one

00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:11.983
So again you just peel..

00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:25.033
And on the top you, peel, this is the protective cover sheet right here, very thin.

00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:40.985
You just match up, slides it on, so that the air bubbles are gone, there you have it.

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:46.790
DS like this is completely covered right now, the color like reflects, it’s really nice.

00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:52.131
So that was the installation  for the DS light screen protector.

00:05:52.132 --> 00:05:56.931
Again this is available at www.accessorygeeks.com. 

00:05:56.932 --> 00:06:01.256
