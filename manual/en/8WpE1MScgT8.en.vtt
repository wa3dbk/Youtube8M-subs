00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.580
What’s so funny about truth, justice, and the American way? That’s the question Superman once asked in Action Comics #775.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.640
The story was a response to the growing popularity of a series called The Authority,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.160
which had a group of superheroes who were willing to kill at the first sign of trouble and basically made lots and lots of morally questionable decisions.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.980
The story was a rejection of The Authority’s ethics and principles, and a reinforcement of Superman’s.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.800
It was about being a good person; trying to help people; and how maiming and killing are, in fact, wrong.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.560
You know, there are people out there who don’t like Superman - which is fine. You’re entitled to your opinion.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.360
The problem is that some of these arguments about why they don’t like him are crap.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.600
They say he’s too powerful. They say he’s too goody-goody.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.960
They say if someone had that kind of power, 
they’d be an evil asshole, or various other ridiculous assertions like that.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
But you know what? Screw that! He’s Superman! He’s the embodiment of how a superhero should be:

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.540
kind, compassionate, and able to take down his enemies without killing them.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:04.140
Hell, even Garth Ennis, whose work I really don’t like, has a soft spot for Superman - and this is the guy who writes a series about a world where superheroes are the worst assholes in the universe!

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.500
But apparently, 
there are comic creators who don’t like him.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.060
For example, Chuck Austin did a run on Action Comics, and was outspoken in his belief that Superman should kill and be a jerk.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.720
But we’re not talking about that annoying run today. 
No, we’re talking about a stupid book that is so not Superman that I feel uncomfortable even saying its name.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.900
As such, let’s dig into Superman at Earth’s End.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.460
I’m not gonna spend a lot of time on the cover for this one, since this is one of those prestige format books that’s bound like a small trade paperback.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.720
I’m not even sure how to describe what we’re looking at here. Looks like some sort of musclebound Santa Claus wearing Superman’s logo while carrying...

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.900
eh, hell, I don't even know what it is.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.840
It can’t be a gun, since it’s far too ridiculous to be a gun - with random wires hanging around it, multiple chain gun barrels, and bullet clips just hanging loosely from it.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.100
It looks more like a parody of a gun than a real gun!

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.780
On the title page we get an introductory text:

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.580
[September 26, 2102 A.D. In his 150 years on Earth, the man of steel has seen civilization twice destroyed.]

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.720
Damn you global warming, was once not enough for you?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.920
[Under the shadow of polluted skies, his powers ebbed…and he forgot even his own name…]

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.560
Since when have Superman's memories been tied to yellow sunlight?

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.620
[Finally, he was rescued by the youth Kamandi and the Biomech VII’s, a race of biological machines programmed to find the true cause of the apocalypse.]

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.220
Oh great, this is a sequel to something.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.960
Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth was a series Jack Kirby produced in 1972.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.440
It was set in the 26th century, when humanity had been all but destroyed in ‘The Great Disaster,’ and Kamandi was one of the remaining humans on the planet.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.820
Taking a cue from The Planet of the Apes, 
the world was populated with highly intelligent anthropomorphic animals who persecuted humans. 
A cute little concept, to be sure.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.060
So it’s 1993, tastes have changed…
so what do we do with the concept? 
We give it to Tom Veitch, who says this:

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.620
{You know, that Kamandi concept was good. But you know what would’ve made it better?}

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:09.420
{If it was set in the 22nd century instead of the 26th; and Kamandi’s not a caveman, but instead wearing a leather jacket and traveling around with huge guns,}

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.420
{and we’ll call it Kamandi at Earth’s End! That’s what the comic reading public wants!}

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.720
So there you have it, folks: an unnecessary, unwanted sequel to an already unnecessary, unwanted Elseworld story.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.740
I’m sorry it’s taken us so long to get to this point, but I am really not looking forward to this one.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.380
Okay, they brought Superman to their floating fortress above the clouds so he could 
have exposure to sunlight again.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.800
And now the Biomech VII’s are planning on purging the world of ‘subhuman scum.’

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.940
But Superman has other ideas...

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.220
[You're not blowing up Gotham City!]

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.260
Wait a second. 
These Biomechs plan to exterminate all living beings, and all Superman cares about is Gotham City?!

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:56.620
And these guys must be the Biomechs. Who the hell designed these people?! They have chicken heads and ears like those robots from Chobits!

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.400
Ladies and gentlemen, the restorers of the human race.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:08.100
The leader of the Biomechs, Ben Boxer, tells Superman that he’s scheduled it for demolition due to it no longer being viable for the new civilization of humanity.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.400
Super Santa Claus launches himself at Ben, and they…uh…wrestle or something. It’s not entirely clear.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:26.380
[A year, and the bright light of Sky City has restored Superman to full strength. He feels energized and alive. But Ben Boxer is a Biomech VII, the most powerful synthetic man ever built.]

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.980
Yes, because his builders designed him around a chicken - the most powerful animal on the planet!

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.800
[Gotham is infested with freaks and muties, my friend!]

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.180
{My friend that just tackled me through a wall!}

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.960
[It's a cess-hole of genetic corrupton!]

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.440
[And you're going to just wipe it out with your big guns, right?]

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.440
{Yeah, these guns! The Hulkster's guns!}

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.040
[We're going to nuke it and forget it!]

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.420
Well, wait a second, nuke it? I thought you people were trying to rebuild civilization!

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.260
[The mission of the Biomechs is to cleanse the earth for the new generation of mankind.]

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.140
Because there's nothing that mankind needs more than radiation!

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.820
[Foolish old man…your refusal to kill got you nowhere in 1999 - where do you think it will get you now, in a world ruled by death?!]

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.340
Yeah, remember when Superman failed us in 1999 by not killing anything? Boy, those days sucked.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.500
[The earth of 2102 is ruled by weapons, friend. That's reality.]

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.520
[Reality is: you are an android -]

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.180
[I AM A MAN!]

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.340
[I AM A MAN!]

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.520
Sweet merciful crap! Superman just punched that android’s guts out!

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:46.840
Let this be a lesson, kids: when debating, solve your disagreement not with words, but by screaming “I AM A MAN!” and punching them in the guts. 
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.780
I AM A MAN!

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.500
&lt;punch&gt;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.140
Yes, even if you're a woman, you should shout that you are a man. Otherwise it doesn't work.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.860
Get this, after Superman has done his gut punch, he's suddenly a lot more coherent.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.280
[Ben, I know you mean well. You're only doing what your creators programmed you to do.]

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.440
Dude, he's holding his own robot intestines in his arms!

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.080
[Superman gave his soul-stirring speech - then he left.]

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.940
Much like the reader does after reading that quote-unquote "soul stirring speech".

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.600
Superman flies around and contemplates whether weapons truly are the way to rebuild civilization.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.380
And so Superman flies down to the ruins of Gotham and…hey, wait a second.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:31.120
Didn’t Ben Boxer say the place wasn’t viable for their new civilization? Despite two apocalypses, the place looks like it’s in pretty good shape!

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.320
Sure, the architecture isn’t all that futuristic, 
but are you seriously telling me that they’re gonna plow over the whole thing?

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:44.720
[Gotham was part of a civilization that lifted itself mightily out of the age of stone and iron. The greatest civilization in the history of mankind.]

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.400
Wait, what the hell?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.820
Look, I admit that I have a biased view of the USA as awesome and possibly the greatest 
civilization in history,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.220
but when the hell did America ‘lift itself mightily out of the age and stone and iron?’

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.840
Did Clark Kent flunk history when he was younger?

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:08.700
And you know what? Gotham - the city of corrupt cops, criminally deranged supervillains, and whose primary protecter was a guy who dressed up like a bat -

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.560
is probably not the best place to be your monument of American civlization.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.780
[My friend Bruce Wayne understood that. He was a man of culture…passionately involved with his time…]

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.840
Bruce Wayne?

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.940
[I am vengeance! I am the night! I! Am! Batman!]

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.900
If he says so.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.480
Suddenly, some bizarre bat creature sees Superman and attacks.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.120
[The fight with Ben Boxer has sapped Superman's remaining strength.]

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.520
What?! He punched Ben Boxer’s stomach right in! And then he flew off into the atmosphere! When did he have a fight that sapped his strength?!

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.540
[Bruce?! Is it you?]

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.660
Oh, this is the Bruce Wayne he was talking about!

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.000
Superman crashes into an alleyway with the bat creature,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.980
but several more are waiting for him and attack.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.380
[Let me go, ya ugly slimes!]

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.600
Are we sure this is really Superman 
and not just some homeless guy from New York who found a Superman shirt?
