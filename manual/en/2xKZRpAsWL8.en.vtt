00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:06.029
so today and i'm at the University of Sydney with
Doctor Phil Dooley and we're talking about

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.989
how our idea of the atom changed from a tiny
little hard sphere

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.319
to something more complicated

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.550
And this apparatus has something to do with that
Phil: exactly, exactly it was quite a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.300
the landmark historical

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.669
experiment

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.680
it's just made of a tube of glass connected
to a

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.100
a vacuum pump

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.690
and in the tube of glass there are two pieces
of metal connected to high-voltage power supply

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.850
so we can suck the air out of here
Phil: that's right

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.230
and then apply a high voltage two metal plates
Phil: yes

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.420
Normally with

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.010
high voltage in air we don't get anything except
maybe a big spark

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.920
but what we what Geissler found who did this
in 1857

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.210
was something quite different so shall we have a look?

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.210
Derek: let's do it
Phil: ok, let's turn on the pump

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.860
and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.200
the high volts

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.200
turn off the lights so we can see what's going on

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.330
as you can see

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.620
something's happening now

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.840
yes I see a bit of a pink

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.009
glow in there.
Phil: that's right so imagine Geissler, the first person

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.560
to ever see this, it's pretty surprising

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.250
that started people thinking 'what is the stuff
that's coming from the cathode?' There seems to be

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.030
a ray emitted from this negatively charged
one which they called the cathode so therefore

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.329
it's called a cathode ray

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.070
and it became the topic for research for the next
forty years since

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.120
all the big big wigs of physics in science
basically tried to work at what was going on

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.780
So what did they figure out? I mean what is
going on? What's producing this glow here

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.180
there were two main camps

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.180
one thought that it was waves

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.220
and the second thought that the electricity was
being

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.790
carried by a stream of charged particles. Over
the next forty years they basically

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.540
came to the conclusion - well it was 
JJ Thomson in eigteen ninety seven

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.520
who came up with the idea that uh... there
is

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.770
a stream of very small charged particles

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.780
uh... negatively charged

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.859
they're smaller than an atom so the smallest atom

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:07.530
a hydrogen atom

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.859
they're about one thousandth of the size of that

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.499
and it doesn't matter what material it -

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.129
the metal is

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.769
it's always the same particle, so this
particle appears to be in everything

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.930
and this electron as it was as
knownn is what's carrying the electricity

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.559
so Thomson came to the conclusion that

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.879
all atoms have this particle as one of their
constituents

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.129
that's right, that's right so it wasn't a billiard ball,
there had to be something inside the billiard ball

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.030
so how do I picture like a billiard ball

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.100
with bits inside it?
Phil: Well you should probably think about a pudding

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.599
A pudding?
Phil: Yeah well that's what his idea was, that
it was a plum pudding

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.919
very dear

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.729
to every British person's heart

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:53.009
Derek: right 
Phil: and inside the putting you have plums

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:57.209
and plums can come out of that so when you
apply high voltage then a negatively charged

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.849
electron

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.219
which thompson pictured as a plum comes out and
leaves behind positively charged putting

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.249
are you a fan of plum pudding?

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.970
For research purposes definitely

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.670
All right, let's see if we can research this a little further
sounds like fun
