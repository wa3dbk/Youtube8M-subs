To fillet a whole fish first start off with
your fish and lay it on your cutting board.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.769
Here we have a tilapia. Usually the fish that
you buy have already been gutted especially

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.669
the ones you buy in the grocery store. That
just means all of the innards have been removed

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.220
from inside of the fish. Now with your fillet
knife you want to make sure that you have

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.870
a nice flexible fillet knife. We're going
to find your fin here right by the head and

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:36.060
we're going to cut around the head to loosen
up that piece of the fillet.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.660
You want to make sure you cut all the way
down to the bone, but don't cut through the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.489
bone. Once you do that we're going to find
the top fin and we're going to cut around

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:54.880
the top fin.
Now once you do that you can get your finger

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:13.740
underneath the fillet and cut in a little
bit deeper. Just keep on cutting through.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.310
Once you get about half way through the fillet
we're going to go ahead and take our knife

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:35.270
all the way through the fillet and cut all
the way down.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.049
Once you have one side done we're going to
flip it over and we're going to do the same

00:01:38.049 --> 00:02:04.380
thing to the other side. Once you have your
two fillets you'll still have the carcass

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.860
of the fish. Depending on the type of fish
that you have you can save the carcass for

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.760
later to make fish stock. If it's an oilier
fish you may not want to save it for fish

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.560
stock. That is how you fillet fish.
