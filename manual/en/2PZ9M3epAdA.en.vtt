Hello my friend and welcome to another Tuesday of tutorial.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.840
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and I'm so glad to see you again.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.160
Today we will do a very simple drawing,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.880
a sailing boat in the sea.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.060
We start by sketching the mast and the sail.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.280
Then the body of the boat.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.860
And a couple of sailors.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.140
I fill it in because it will be seen practically in silhouette.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.340
With some broken lines we do the reflection.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.640
I love doing reflexions, it's really fun.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.420
We could practically leave the sketch like this and it will look alright,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.500
but let's carry on, doing some shadowing for the waves of the sea

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.200
and also some very simple clouds.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.000
With white pastel you can give some reflexions, which look very nice,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.780
as long as you are not using white paper of course.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.460
This paper has a greyish tone.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.760
It looks a little bit pale, let's darken it, slightly.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.040
With a stomp you can smudge the pencil so it looks more even.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.760
We reinforce some shadows of the waves, we smudge them,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.000
And it's ready. I would love to know what do you think about it.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.480
