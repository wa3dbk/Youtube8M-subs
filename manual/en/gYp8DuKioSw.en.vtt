Hi! I’m Katrina Cameron and on behalf of
Expert Village, I’m going to show you how

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.320
to setup a cooking station that is really
well organized and easy to cook with. So one

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.379
of the things that you should think about
are what items do you like to cook with and

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.660
the items that you like to cook with should
be put next to the stove on something I like

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:29.540
to call a lazy Susan. We can put salt, pepper,
your shakers, we have olive oil, teriyaki

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.730
or soy sauce, anything that you like to use
when you cook. Then those are things that

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.329
should go right by your stove. The other things
that go right by your stove are utensils that

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.609
you use the most for your cooking. I like
to keep spatulas in there, I like to keep

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:54.920
scoopers, I like to keep tongs, things for
frying and also a whisk. Then the next area

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.749
that should be well organized is next to your
cooking station is your shelving and what

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:08.890
needs to stay next to your stove is spices
obviously because we use spices when we cook.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:17.530
You can get a step stair system for your spices
and this has 3 different levels and that way

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.960
it enables us to see all of the labels of
our spices. Just something to remember, you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.400
don’t want to keep your spices for years
and years and years. I don’t think they’re

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.880
necessarily going to kill you but usually
after 2 years you should really get rid of

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.860
a spice because condensation and sometimes
bacteria and stuff can get into the spices

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:48.600
so you want to replenish those. Lazy Susan’s
are great for inside shelves also. I like

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.500
to keep both cooking oil. I keep the spray
on the downstairs lazy Susan and upstairs

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:05.180
I keep your pouring oil and then your bulk
salt and bulk canola oil and then any sweeteners

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.319
or sugar that you might have for coffee and
stuff like that you keep on hand right here.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.670
Then the last area that I want to talk to
you about that should be in your cooking station

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.170
is your cutting boards and then also something
for hot pots and pans. You can simply hang

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.870
this up with a little nail or a screw so that
it’s always ready to use. Next, I’m going

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.560
to be talking to your about well organized
utensil drawers and a grab and go station.
