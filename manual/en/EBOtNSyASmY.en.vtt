00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.650
So these are the instructions for an origami
dolphin.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.580
The first step, we're going to take a sheet
of paper.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.140
We're going to start with the colored side
up and we're going to make a book fold.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.470
So go ahead and take the bottom edge, fold
it all the way up to the top, and make sure

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.310
that you have it nice and lined up, so that
there's no extra color showing.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.630
Just get it to where it's perfectly lined
up, and crease down at the bottom.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.320
Go ahead and open that back up.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.220
Then we're going to the other book fold.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.790
We're going to do the other direction as well.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.640
Again, try to be nice and precise, so when
you open it up, you'll have a really nice

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.420
plus sign right there.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.210
Flip it over.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.690
Now we do a diagonal fold, so take the bottom
corner, fold it all the way up to the top,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.719
just like this.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.020
Slide your finger down so it's nice and flat,
and keep your other thumb down there to hold

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.579
its place, slide out to one edge and then
slide out to the other.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.470
Open those two up and now take the bottom
and fold it all the way up to the top like

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.390
that, again being as precise as we can.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.250
Now just go ahead and leave that flat.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.899
What we're going to do is go ahead and pinch
right here at the bottom of this line, on

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.340
either side, and we're going to rotate our
hands close together, so that all of these

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.490
will come together.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.640
We can make a nice triangle base.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.670
Let me show you that.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.980
This is called a water bomb base, so take
both of your fingers right here, right up

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.060
against the edge, and we're going to rotate
them up together and when they come together

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420
there, that's going to help us make what's
called a water bomb base.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.570
You have two edges on either side, we're going
to flatten the paper down like that.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.099
Now that's not using any new creases.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.229
That's just using all of the creases that
are already there.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.750
We're just changing the way that they're folded
together, just like that.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.150
Now the next step we're going to take one
flap and we're going to fold it over, so now

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.630
we're going to have three flaps on one side.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.140
Three flaps on one side and one flap on the
left side.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.569
We're going to now take this one flap, the
extra flap and we're going to do a kite fold.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.780
We're going to fold this edge, this leading
edge right there, it's going to come down

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:33.269
and it's going to lie right on the middle
line, just like this, okay?

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.780
Next go ahead and rotate it over.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.480
So now it's facing the opposite direction.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.980
Next we're going to take this top point of
the whole triangle, we're going to bring it

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.300
down to this spot right here.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.200
You can also think about it as taking this
edge, and bringing down to the bottom edge,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.719
and cutting the whole thing in half.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:02.579
So just like this, when we fold this down,
it's going to thin the tail all the way down

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:09.500
to a point like that.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.560
Next we're going to fold up the dorsal fin.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.900
So this fold right here, this top of this
triangle that's going to turn into our dorsal

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.900
fin.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.370
So we're going to fold it up enough so that
you could see it, if you were to flip it over,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.569
so you can still see that fin poke up right
there just like that.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.689
Next step we're going to take this edge right
here, I'm going to fold it in half and that's

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.049
going to thin a little bit of the flipper.

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.859
And if you want to have a nice pointed flipper,
you can leave it all the way down there.

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.900
And you can also fold it down, just like this,
so that if you look at it, it just sort of

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.480
thins it a little bit, but still keeps a nice
little flipper aspect to it, just like that.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.659
Next I'm going to take-- you see how there's
a skinny triangle right here at the top.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.030
What we're going to do is we're going to fold
that skinny triangle over.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.709
What happens when this triangle comes over
is it wants to bring all of this paper right

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.709
here with it.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.529
That's okay, we're going to bring that over
too.

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:16.549
So go ahead and when we fold this over all
of this is going to come with, and take note

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.389
of what kind of a shape I'm making right here.

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.220
I want to thin this down, not all the way
to a point, but enough to right here, this

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.910
is the bump at the top of the head right like
that.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.270
Okay, so the next step for the origami dolphin,
we're going to fold the front of the head,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.030
we're going to fold it back like this and
then right back out again.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.419
That's a pleat fold, and that's so we get
a nice nose, sort of like a bottle nose dolphin,

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.419
just like that.

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.419
So it's a pleat that goes back and forth.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.550
And the next to finish it off, we're going
to fold the flukes of the tail.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.910
So go ahead and open this up.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.940
There are two sheets in here, two sections
of paper.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.140
Go ahead and open it up and inside reverse
fold one bottom section down.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.770
You can see how I open it up and push it down,
just like that.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.590
And then if you want, you can even open it
up and then fold this section up as well,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.380
in the middle as a crimped fold, so it would
come down and then back up.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.870
And that gets you that full tail section right
there, for the flukes on the dolphin and then

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.900
when you flip it over and have a look and
that is the origami dolphin.
