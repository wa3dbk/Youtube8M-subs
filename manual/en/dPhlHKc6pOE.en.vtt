00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.380

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.000
and labor rates

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.010
Now take this app with you on your lighting audit

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.780

lighting and lighting control information

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.829

You can also go into each room and customise a solution

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.900
and here are your lighting controls recommendations

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.900
You can also tap on each fixture to provide
a fixture upgrade
