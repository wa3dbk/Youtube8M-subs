00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.390
Hello, this is Eric Boldt from the National
Weather Service in Oxnard, CA.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.460
Here is a quick look at the El Nino Southern
Oscillation status and predictions for the

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:36.900
upcoming 2014-15 winter season for southwest
California.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.579
The typical El Nino pattern looks like this.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.559
When the warmer ocean water shifts eastward
across the subtropical Pacific Ocean, the

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.230
jet stream taps into moist, storm systems
enhanced by the warm waters and these systems

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.129
then track across the southern sections of
the country.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.550
More northern latitudes are typically warmer
and drier than normal during an El Nino pattern.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
This is a look at sea level heights from the
NASA Jason satellite.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.430
The heights correspond with sea surface temperature
and give an idea of warm or cold anomalies.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.470
The latest image from late August on the right
shows a slight increase in temperatures along

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.410
the equator compared to the late June image
on the left.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.970
SSTs were above-average across the eastern
equatorial Pacific Ocean during the last 4

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.970
weeks.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.790
In addition, temperatures remain well above
average over the north Pacific which has changed

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.390
little since last winter season.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.880
Sea temperatures below the surface at a depth
of several hundred feet have warmed again

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.950
across the equatorial Pacific as depicted
by the progression of images from top to bottom.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.170
This is a sign that El Nino may be strengthening
at this time.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.850
A consensus prediction between scientists
at the Climate Prediction Center and the International

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.830
Research Institute at Columbia University
shows that the chance of an El Nino this winter

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.849
has dropped from 80 percent to 65 percent
since the August update.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.549
The latest El Nino model forecasts project
many different outcomes as seen by the spaghetti

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.349
effect show above.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.420
The current reading is below 0.5 degrees on
the left and the range of outcomes keeps the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.609
El Nino mainly in a weak to moderate category
through next winter.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.120
Historically in southwest California we have
seen an increase in above normal rainfall

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.530
during El Nino winters compared with La Nina
and ENSO neutral winters.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.459
The probability of above normal rainfall during
weak and moderate El Nino events ranges from

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.730
41 percent in Santa Maria (middle pie chart)
to 53 percent in Los Angeles (left).

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.189
This is based on a total of 17 weak to moderate
El Ninoï¿½s since 1950.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.019
The important fact to remember is that the
odds of a drier than normal winter are just

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.700
as high as a wetter than normal winter during
weak to moderate events.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.689
Here are the latest CPC temperature predictions
for the January through March 2015 time frame.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.079
There is no significant signal of either above
or below normal temperatures for southwest

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.400
CA.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.060
The precipitation prediction for the January
through March 2015 time frame does show southwest

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.939
CA with an above normal precipitation potential
this upcoming winter season.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.040
This forecast is based on classic El Nino
trends of wetter storms across the southern

00:03:33.040 --> 00:04:09.379
tier 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:19.069
of the country.

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:20.479
