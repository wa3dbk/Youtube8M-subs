Hi this is Ross at Woodfirepower,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.540
and this is an update on the great

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.929
little aquaponic system

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.230
this system is a very simple, two barrel

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.749
payroll system one barrel cut in half
to create

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.280
two grow beds, and another barrel above

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.859
cut differently to create a flood drain cycle.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.230
In this system

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.230
everything you see growing is being fed
by the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.250
eleven koi fish

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.780
 in the lower tank

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.210
including that huge marigold which we've

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.180
contemplated tearing out but it just
keeps on creating great flowers so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.800
it's still here

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.670
We're into November now

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.520
and we've had a lot of rains and cold
snaps

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.670
for several weeks.  Today happens to be
sunny so it's a nice day to do filming

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.440
But what's interesting is how well this system is doing.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.440
I don't know if we can see the fish in here or not.  Maybe you can, maybe not

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.150
Here's a nice great big bok choy

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.480
These are some huge leaves being taken off (to eat), much larger than my hand

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.830
And that's been feeding the dinner table.  Here's a Napa (Chinese) cabbage, all nice and big and full, some kale......

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.950
Back there is a broccoli head starting

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.950
Here are some beets.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.400
And the onions are getting really huge.  

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.850
This is as large as my thumb, and they'll get a lot larger.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.000
and here's a nice

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.230
head of.......

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.230
cauliflower coming up,

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.449
along with some beets, and more beets over there.  

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.789
So, the system is doing great and it's actually growing

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:24.399
the plants better than our larger new
system which is not surprising because

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.169
this is  a couple year old

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.930
aquaponics system so it has

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.849
acquired a lot of bacteria and microbes that 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.189
are helping it perform better

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.930
so there's an update and I think we
are about

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.189
two months

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.469
after planting but we've had about three
weeks of really cold

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.609
sunless weather, so it's pretty amazing that it's doing this

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.209
and it's even more amazing the Marigolds are blooming like this

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.150
because

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.079
most people's Marigolds are pretty much
dead by now

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.679
That's your update for today on the Great Little Aquaponics System
