Pernille is a patent attorney with Høiberg.
Today, she'll be examining whether a -

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.470
- chemical invention is sufficiently
unique to be patented.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.770
It's my job to describe the invention,
perform a thorough analysis -

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.070
- and write a good report to the client.

YOUR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES
AS A BIOCHEMIST

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.810
I'm doing a novelty examination for a client
who would like to know whether a combination -

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.470
- of two substances they're working with constitutes
a novelty. The examination will show whether -

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.120
- others have used the two substances together,
and whether it constitutes an inventive step.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.309
My name is Pernille, and I have an MSc in
Biochemistry from the University of Copenhagen.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.580
I work as a patent attorney at Høiberg a/s.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.350
I've now reviewed the different documents
found in my database search, -

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.550
- which means I can complete my report.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.530
Hi, Peter. Nice to see you.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.430
You really learn a lot about biotechnology,
because you're working with new inventions -

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.930
- all the time. And you also have to study
the legislation in detail to know -

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.340
- what your options are in different situations.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.300
We have performed a novelty examination which
shows that your invention constitutes a novelty -

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.800
- and involves an inventive step,
so we believe it is patentable.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.000
What motivates me is when my clients
appreciate my work.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.330
It really makes me happy that I'm able to
actually help them obtain a patent.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.030
We'll get back to you.
Thank you.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.430
Thank you.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.310
I think it went well. The client seemed pleased
with our examination, and he appreciated -

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.399
- the work I've done.
I'm very pleased with that.

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.140
