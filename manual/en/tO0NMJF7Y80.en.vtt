00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.710
Amidst the telltale rustling of the trees

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.320
Under the faint light of a waxing moon

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.760
A single flower colors the darkness

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.260
As stardust peeks through the clouds

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.730
Clearly, loudly

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.790
I’ll spread my wings and fly

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.810
When I look up at the arid sky

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.270
Your gently profile

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.110
Plays softly in my silence

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.580
Like a wind brushing against my cheek

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.070
I’ll overcome eternity and reach

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.010
Toward a shining future

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.990
The sinking sun dyes this vast land scarlet

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.440
And it feels like I’m dreaming

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.890
As I watch the last ray of light about to vanish

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.310
Shadows play tricks on me, giving me fake answers

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.890
Dazzlingly, brilliantly

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.470
I imagine my future ahead

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.670
Even if this moon tonight

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.050
Is no more than a fairytale

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.660
I’ll break my way through countless futures

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.260
And surely I’ll find you

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.070
When I look up at the arid sky

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.500
Your gently profile

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.070
Plays softly in my silence

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.700
Like a wind brushing against my cheek

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.180
I’ll overcome eternity and reach

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.030
Toward a shining future
