00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.650
Titanfall loses it’s Titans! Well, kind
of… Man, those things must be expensive

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.210
to make, right?

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.370
I’m Figcoinc, and this is DB News!

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.120
Respawn Entertainment has recently announced
a new patch for their game Titanfall. It contains

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.430
the normal things like bug fixes, and weapon
balancing. This patch though has garnered

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.120
a ton of attention because of the introduction
of the new game mode called “Pilot Skirmish.”

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.699
This new game mode removes both the ability
to call in Titans to aid you in battle, but

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.879
also removes the AI grunts littered around
the battlefield. It boils the game down to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.809
a battle of 8 Human Controlled Players vs.
other group of 8 human controlled players.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.149
Due to the very special nature of this new
mode, it will not be a mode included in the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.309
Variety Pack Playlist that cycles through
mode randomly. You will have to choose this

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.850
mode independently.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.300
To be very honest, I can see people being
both excited and disappointed by this new

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.440
mode. So let me cover both sides.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.000
The crowd disappointed may feel that the uniqueness
of the game is gone. The Titans are the namesake

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.790
of the game, and removing them may ruin the
overall flow of the game. The game was designed

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.130
with the Titans in mind. The maps were designed
for Titans to fall, and have grand battles

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.939
on the open spaces while the pilots jumped
around having their own battles. There are

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.600
people out there who do their best while in
a Titan. Plus, with the removal of the AI

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.469
grunts as well, it may make the maps seems
empty. The grunts did give the game some atmosphere,

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.310
but the grunts were also essential in the
gameplay. You grinded the grunts to earn the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.270
Titan, and to help the overall score depending
on the game mode. This feels as if Respawn

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.219
just buckled under the pressure of the Call
of Duty crowd that only wanted traditional

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.950
style death battles they are accustomed to.
Considering how much the new Call of Duty

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.259
looks like a variation of Titanfall, and the
how this mode was introduced soon after the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.929
reveal of the new Call of Duty - it’s hard
not to understand that viewpoint of those

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.469
opposed to this.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.830
On the other hand, Titanfall was supposed
to be the game to either overtake or compete

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.980
directly with Call of Duty. That is why Microsoft
bought the exclusive rights to this title.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.580
It was going to be the next huge multiplayer
FPS game. While the game is still played,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.769
it never got the same level of play as Call
of Duty. One major reason was because players

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.989
felt that their achievements in game were
cheated because you could grind the AI grunts

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.250
if you wanted. The grunt themselves barely
posed a threat, and just felt like filler

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.810
to many players. Even if over time they understood
their purpose, the crowd Titanfall wanted

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.060
to attract wanted true one of one fights with
humans. That is what they are used too, and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.709
that is what they wanted. Not grinding walking
targets to gain a giant robot that you may,

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.610
or may not want to even use. Some people loved
the mobility of the pilots, the map, and weapons

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.989
but could not stand being in a Titan. The
call for a true human on human only mode was

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.540
around from day one.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.099
In my opinion, I do worry more about how will
this affect flow of gameplay. Mainly because

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.040
of the size of the maps. It simply was not
designed for only pilots to be jumping around.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.629
So I hope it doesn’t slow down what is supposed
to be a frantic high paced game. On the other

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.939
hand, I do feel that this mode will bring
back a lot of players. At least until the

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.620
new Call of Duty comes out. I do think Titanfall
is a good game, and a lot of fun. I just feel

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.790
that this mode needed to be in the game a
long time ago. Even at launch. This game was

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.430
already a bit light on the modes when it came
out, and this would have been a great alternative

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.879
mode for players who wanted something they
were more familiar with. While yes, I understand

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.379
the idea of making players play your original
vision, but they should have not ignored the

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:55.379
market they were trying to grab. The market,
to be very honest, that was created by them

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.610
when they were with infinity ward creating
the early Call of Duty games. I still feel

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.610
that whenever Titanfall 2 comes out - we will
finally see the complete vision of what this

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.810
game is supposed to be. Until then, it is
great to see ReSpawn Entertainment swallow

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.510
a little pride and introduce this mode.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.700
Let me know your thoughts in the comment section
below! As always, thank 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.800
you 
for being awesome!
