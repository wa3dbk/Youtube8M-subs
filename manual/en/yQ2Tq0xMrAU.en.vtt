[Kitchen Design Ideas: Finding Inspiration For Your Kitchen Remodel]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hi, I'm Nadia Geller, interior designer for Homestyler.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
[Nadia Geller, Interior Designer] Today I'm going to give you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
some great ideas on how to refresh your kitchen. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You can spend just a little and make some nice updates, or you can spend a lot and create

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a whole new environment.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
[Try new hardware, lighting, rugs or curtains.]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you're looking for subtle changes, try new hardware on the cabinets, new lighting,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or change your throw rug and curtains.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
[Use flowers in season] Even changing your flowers and plants can help.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[Small things can have a big impact] Small things can have a big impact.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When I want to make more dramatic changes, I like to start by

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
visualizing my ideas with a home design program.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[www.homestyler.com] This one is Homestyler.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's free and it let's you experiment with a lot of ideas before you

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
actually spend any money.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
For example, you may have always dreamed of updating your

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
appliances to stainless steel.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Use Homestyler to see if you like the look by trying different 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
appliances, brands, and placements.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Try out different styles and finishes until you find something you like.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Another kind of big thing to do is to change

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
out your floor. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Try something light and something dark.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Which one looks best to you?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There are plenty of things you can do that aren't as involved, like painting the walls 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a new color. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
There are literally hundreds of different wall treatments and paint colors for your kitchen.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Use the program to experiment with your favorites.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This may be the biggest time saver yet, 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and there's no commitments and no regrets.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Save your designs so you can look at them again and again.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Maybe you'd like to try something that will make a big difference

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
without being too much work.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Try painting or refacing your cabinets.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This will dramatically change the look of your kitchen.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Get inspired by the food you love best.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Most people are attracted to the colors that are the same color

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
as the food they like.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
For me, this is a perfect shade of green.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
