Hey guys so now that my phone is
connected to my computer and it's in

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:21.060
download mode what I'm going to do now
is click on start button so click on the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:38.190
start button here and now it's starting
to root your phone and once the flash is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:47.160
complete you should see that your phone
is rebooting so right now it says my

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.510
phone is rebooting in 10 seconds as you
can see here rebooting in 10 seconds oh

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.290
it's already rebooted ok so that
concludes our rooting the phone and the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.729
next thing we're going to do is back up
the phone and as well as installing the

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.150
MIUI Rom

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.670
so what we want to do now is install the
clockworkmod recovery because that's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.759
going to help us back up the mod that we
currently have just in case something

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.920
bad happens when we're modding and we
lose everything we want to go back to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.819
what we had before so basically you're
going to download this file here which

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:52.170
is called recovery CWM touch six point
zero point three point one so download

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.979
this file from this link here so I'll
provide all that in the description

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:07.379
below and then you're going to put that
put this file here in Odin where PDA

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:18.090
is okay so we're going to open up this
file here which is in the Downloads

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.700
folder and I'm gonna put it in my
desktop in my galaxy s3 so I'm going to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:37.069
put this file here make sure you do not
extract this file okay so previously we

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.069
extracted the CF root package but this
time we don't want to extract it and

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.630
then go to Odin make sure your phone is
in download mode again so turn it on

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.599
using download mode and hook it up to
your computer and this time in the PDA

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:07.739
file we're going to pick the recovery
CWM touch file and then you're gonna

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.290
press the start button again make sure
the only ticks that you have ticked are

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:23.269
Auto Reboot and F's reset time so click
start again and this time it should be

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.190
installing the recovery mode to your
phone

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.690
and once that's done your phone should
be automatically rebooting into

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:44.830
clockworkmod recovery and the last thing
I want you guys to do is to download the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.569
ROM that you want to install to your
Galaxy s3 so I'm going to click on

00:03:50.569 --> 00:04:01.600
samsung galaxy s3 on the MIUI ROM
website and you're going to download the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:10.400
download the ROM so download the
latest MIUI ROM installation package so

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.450
you're going to click on this

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:30.040
and then you're going to pick the
Samsung Galaxy s3 which is this one here

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:48.000
Galax i9 300 and then you're going to
click on this link right here which says

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.760
download the version that is recommended
rather than this one down here which

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.870
says download the beta version we want
to download the recommended version so

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:11.950
click that and this is the file here you
want to copy to your phone to your SD

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:23.980
card on your phone so we'll wait for
that to download the last thing you want

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:31.120
to do after you've downloaded the file
is to copy it to your phone so I'm going

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:41.520
to get this file copy it and paste it on
my phone which is in my computer

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:52.620
portable devices double click on that
and paste it in here

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.720
so it's pasting

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.319
okay so once that's done then the rest
should only need to be done on your

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:52.460
phone so go to your phone and see what
happens
