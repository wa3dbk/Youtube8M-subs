00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.500
- WELCOME TO AN EXAMPLE

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.833
ON HOW TO FIND THE CARDINALITY 
OF THE UNION,

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.367
AN INTERSECTION OF TWO SETS.

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:11.733
THE CARDINALITY IS THE NUMBER OF 
ELEMENTS IN A SET

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.900
AND THEREFORE WHEN FINDING 
CARDINALITY

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.100
WE'LL BE COUNTING THE NUMBER 
OF ELEMENTS IN A SET

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.900
NOT LISTING THE ELEMENTS 
IN A SET.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900
HERE WE'RE GIVEN THE UNIVERSAL 
SET U

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.700
CONTAINS THE WHOLE NUMBERS 
1 THROUGH 20.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.433
SETS "A" AND B ARE SUBSETS 
CONTAINING THESE ELEMENTS.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.600
WE WANT TO FIND THE NUMBER OF 
ELEMENTS IN THE SET "A" UNION B.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.033
REMEMBER THIS SYMBOL HERE 
FOR UNION MEANS OR.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:43.767
SO WE COULD ALSO SAY THE NUMBER 
OF ELEMENTS IN THE SET "A" OR B.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.100
WE INDICATE THE CARDINALITY 
OF A SET

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.533
USING ONE OF THESE TWO NOTATIONS 
HERE.

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.833
I LISTED BOTH.

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.233
WE ALSO WANT TO FIND THE NUMBER 
OF ELEMENTS

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:55.200
IN SET "A" INTERSECT B

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.233
OR THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN 
THE INTERSECTION OF "A" AND B.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:03.140
THIS SYMBOL FOR INTERSECTION 
ALSO MEANS AND.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.207
SO WE CAN THINK OF THIS 
AS THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:10.307
IN THE SET OF "A" AND B.

00:01:10.307 --> 00:01:14.540
THOUGH IT'S NOT REQUIRED LET'S 
SOLVE THIS USING A VENN DIAGRAM,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.640
AND LET'S BEGIN BY IDENTIFYING 
THE ELEMENTS

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.173
THAT ARE IN BOTH SET "A" 
AND SET B.

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:30.707
NOTICE 1, 6, 8, 14, AND 16 
ARE THE ONLY ELEMENTS

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:34.007
THAT ARE IN BOTH SET "A" 
AND SET B.

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.973
THESE ELEMENTS WOULD BE 
IN THIS OVERLAPPING REGION HERE

00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:39.173
TO SHOW THEY'RE IN BOTH "A" 
AND B.

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:42.040
SO LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND LIST THOSE.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.973
AGAIN WE HAVE 1, 6, 8, 14, 
AND 16.

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:53.240
SO NOW LOOKING AT SET "A" 
THE REMAINING ELEMENTS

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.307
WOULD ONLY BE IN SET "A"

00:01:55.307 --> 00:01:58.273
AND THEREFORE THOSE ELEMENTS 
WOULD BE IN THIS REGION HERE

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:08.380
WHICH WOULD BE 4, 11, 15, 17, 
18, 19, AND 20.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.547
NOW LOOKING AT SET B,

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.447
NOTICE HOW THE ELEMENTS 
THAT ARE ONLY IN SET B

00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:19.480
WOULD BE 3, 5, 9, AND 13.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.880
WE DO HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION 
WE NEED

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.047
TO ANSWER THESE TWO QUESTIONS

00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:24.747
BUT LET'S COMPLETE 
OUR VENN DIAGRAM

00:02:24.747 --> 00:02:28.213
BY DETERMINING THE ELEMENTS 
THAT ARE IN THE UNIVERSAL SET

00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:30.547
BUT NOT IN "A" OR B.

00:02:30.547 --> 00:02:33.113
SO IF WE QUICKLY COUNT 
FROM 1 TO 20

00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:39.047
NOTICE HOW 2 IS NOT IN "A" OR B 
BUT IT IS IN THE UNIVERSAL SET.

00:02:39.047 --> 00:02:41.313
SO 2 WOULD BE OUT HERE

00:02:41.313 --> 00:02:43.213
AND THEN WE HAVE 3, 4, 5, 6

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:45.980
NOTICE 7 IS ALSO NOT IN "A" 
OR B.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.847
SO 7 IS IN THE UNIVERSAL SET 
AS WELL.

00:02:47.847 --> 00:02:50.380
SO 7 IS HERE.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.947
8, 9, 10 NOTICE 10 IS NOT IN 
"A" OR B

00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:56.147
SO 10 WOULD BE OUT HERE.

00:02:56.147 --> 00:02:58.947
11, 12, NOTICE 12 
IS ALSO NOT IN "A" OR B

00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:03.153
SO 12 WOULD BE OUT HERE 
IN THE UNIVERSAL SET

00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:07.853
AND I THINK 13 THROUGH 20 
ARE LISTED HERE IN "A" OR B.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:10.220
NOW LET'S ANSWER 
OUR TWO QUESTIONS.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.320
THE FIRST QUESTION IS DETERMINE 
THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.087
OR THE CARDINALITY 
OF THE SET "A" UNION B

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:19.687
WHICH AGAIN IS THE NUMBER 
OF ELEMENTS IN "A" OR B

00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:23.420
OR THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS 
IN THIS REGION HERE.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.787
SO WE COULD JUST COUNT 
THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:26.353
IN THIS REGION

00:03:26.353 --> 00:03:27.320
BUT WE COULD ALSO NOTICE

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.587
THE UNIVERSAL SET CONTAINS 
20 ELEMENTS,

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:33.020
FOUR OF WHICH ARE NOT IN "A" 
OR B.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.653
20 - 4 IS 16

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:40.287
AND THEREFORE THE NUMBER 
OF ELEMENTS IN "A" UNION B

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:42.387
WOULD BE 16.

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:44.287
OF COURSE, WE CAN VERIFY THIS 
BY COUNTING.

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:51.487
WE HAVE 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16

00:03:51.487 --> 00:03:54.287
AND NOW FOR THE SECOND QUESTION.

00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:59.420
WE WANT TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER 
OF ELEMENTS IN "A" INTERSECT B

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.727
OR THE CARDINALITY 
OF "A" INTERSECT B

00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:07.260
WHICH WOULD BE THE NUMBER 
OF ELEMENTS IN "A" AND B,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.327
THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS 
IN THIS REGION HERE.

00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:15.827
NOTICE HOW THERE ARE 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5 ELEMENTS IN THIS INTERSECTION

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:19.793
AND THEREFORE THE CARDINALITY 
OF "A" INTERSECT B

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:25.993
OR THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS 
IN "A" INTERSECT B IS 5.

00:04:25.993 --> 00:04:29.827
I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL.
