00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
And now we are German.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.127
Hallo - meine name ist Jake

00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:03.118
And I took German in grades 8, 9, and 10

00:00:03.118 --> 00:00:06.438
That’s 8th, 9th, and 10th grade if that’s
your vernacular

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:08.878
Anyway the plan is Panzers

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:12.188
But Panzers aren’t for a while so we need
to get a bit of an empire

00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:13.978
They start as Cavalry

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:16.548
Then upgrade through to become a tank

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:18.178
But it’s a quicker tank

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:20.168
We have northern Hamburgers

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:23.988
And there’ll be more Germany over here - can’t
let the others expand

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:26.168
Boom - got a set for Spielberg

00:00:26.168 --> 00:00:28.387
Actually he can film wherever he wants

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:31.358
Genghis Khan attacked - not exactly surprising

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:33.808
Good thing there’s mountains between us

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:37.898
Everyone else did better than the Germans
- mostly because the Germans didn’t realize

00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:38.927
it was going on

00:00:38.927 --> 00:00:42.927
Like our Merchants - I don’t know who Adam
Smith is but Wikipedia says he was a Scottish

00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:44.117
Philosopher

00:00:44.117 --> 00:00:46.358
Civ needs Great Philosophers…

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.887
Joan of Arc was borrowed from France

00:00:48.887 --> 00:00:51.378
My Crossbowman can handle this

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:55.297
Hey Mr. Poland - how about Open Borders and
you can move your men on through, and not

00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:56.297
attack, mmmk?

00:00:56.297 --> 00:01:00.047
And Hey Mr. Denmark - how about you never
settle in Germany again

00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:03.048
Mr. Poland is like - I don’t care about
the border deal

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:05.708
This vid is… going interesting places

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:09.618
And yes, that is another Great General about
to remove Danish claims

00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:12.058
And our Crossbowman put up a noble fight

00:01:12.058 --> 00:01:16.287
But everyone get your war helmets back on!

00:01:16.287 --> 00:01:20.207
Oh - hey Kurt, you need a helmet

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:21.978
Now we fight at sea!

00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:24.308
And on land - lots more fighting on land

00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:28.677
Harold says he’ll back down if I back down
- he even took OFF his helmet

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:32.698
Then asked me to watch him “Rock the boat”
Ya - you have a great day Harold

00:01:32.698 --> 00:01:36.408
Germany needs a bigger army - so close to
that unique unit!

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:38.548
Science our way through Fertilizer

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:40.088
Wow the fields look so much better

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:42.817
We’ll defend the fields forever!

00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:45.708
According to the sidebar, Singapore wants
Irritation!

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.497
We want less unhappiness!

00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:50.198
Gotta get real - a monumental decision

00:01:50.198 --> 00:01:53.607
Lining up the Cavalry - they’ll be upgraded
before heading into Poland

00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:56.147
Hey - where’s the Red Arrow of Destruction?

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:57.147
Ahhh!

00:01:57.147 --> 00:01:58.467
Sehr gut!

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.927
Starting a small fire at the base of the empire
ensures terror for all

00:02:01.927 --> 00:02:05.198
Some Winged Hussars hiss at us but nothing
substantial

00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:09.218
Actually they are good at re-taking their
town - tres annoying

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:11.258
Back and forth, back and forth

00:02:11.258 --> 00:02:15.618
Enemies also arrive from up North - where
Mongolia once stood

00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:18.488
Maybe we’ll revive Mongolia then give it
some Poland

00:02:18.488 --> 00:02:19.808
Sounds like a plan!

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:21.458
Time to occupy the North

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.168
A Worker is fired

00:02:23.168 --> 00:02:24.848
The cities create Panzers

00:02:24.848 --> 00:02:26.758
Need a few turns to get ready

00:02:26.758 --> 00:02:27.958
Ready!

00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.088
Liberated a bit of Denmark for practice

00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:32.778
Does this look like enough units?

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:33.958
We Citadel-ed

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.068
Every tile helps when your empire is growing

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:37.678
This town has to go!

00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:40.148
But the Poles know how to take their cities
back

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:42.418
The second wave of destruction destroys

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:46.128
Meanwhile: a lone Panzer wreaks havoc on the
Elephants

00:02:46.128 --> 00:02:48.588
And Mr. Khan is resuscitated

00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:50.798
Look how happy he is with us!

00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:52.878
Look how huge Germany is!

00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:55.148
Look how Kuala Lampur comes back to life

00:02:55.148 --> 00:02:57.108
Look how dangerous the ocean is

00:02:57.108 --> 00:03:00.438
May have sold that coast to Mr. Khan - I don’t
mind being landlocked

00:03:00.438 --> 00:03:04.248
See, the thing is, Poland is on fire and Casimir
is angry

00:03:04.248 --> 00:03:07.158
I bet Mr. Khan will go for another city trade

00:03:07.158 --> 00:03:09.328
Suddenly there’s more Mongolia

00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:11.708
Take a break before the next bout of violence

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:15.258
Again - I don’t remember getting invitations
to these planet-wide projects

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:17.798
There’s like 10 turns ’til defeat

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:22.918
Off-topic: Mr. Khan invited us to the music
festival - bring your own yurt

00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:25.128
How do we… defeat the evil that is red

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:27.348
They keep stealing Kuala Lampur!

00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:29.078
Leave Malaysia alone

00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:30.638
Malaysia is back!

00:03:30.638 --> 00:03:33.408
But we are the losers - #OneMoreTurn

00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:35.228
And our Sub keeps getting bullied

00:03:35.228 --> 00:03:36.958
Will XCOMS save the day?

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:37.248
Nope.
