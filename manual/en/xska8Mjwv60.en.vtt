00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.290
This episode of D News is
brought to you by Toyota.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.808
Guys, this was 3D printed
and I'm going to eat it.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.600
Hey, guys, it's Trace
here for D News.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.354
I'm at CES 2014 and we're
in the 3d printing area.

00:00:17.354 --> 00:00:19.020
It's still the hot
technology this year.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.070
They have a whole
section devoted just

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.680
to all the 3D printers at CES.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.130
3D printers can use metal,
they can use ceramics,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.046
they can use plastics.

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:29.370
They can print bio cells.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.410
They can even print food.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.360
And that's what this
little guy is right here.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.670
Even though 3D printing
is super big right now,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.680
it's still kind of a super
nerdy, nerdy nerd nerd level

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.480
of technology.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.080
They've sold 68,000 3D
printers, according to one poll.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.690
And the industry is
about $2.2 billion.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.190
But most of them are
way too complicated

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.450
for the average consumer.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.950
And this year at
CES, they're trying

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.980
to change that and bring them
more into a lower price range

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.420
and easier to use.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.410
So this is by 3-D Systems.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.630
It's printed food, you guys.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.970
And we're going to try it.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.025
OK, guys, here we go.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.340
It's good.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.210
It kind of tastes like the
marshmallow in Lucky Charms.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.626
The MakerBot Replicator Z18 is
the largest model available.

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:22.000
And it was announced
here at CES.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.930
It's 12 by 12 by 18 inches.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.842
That is huge.

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.800
And you can do all sorts
of cool stuff with it.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.160
And we talked to Bre
Pettis, CEO of MakerBot,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.320
a little bit about it.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.530
What's the best part about it,
other than it's giant, right?

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.700
Is that it?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.650
So the MakerBot Replicator
Z18 is our biggest 3D printer.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.420
We launched a small,
medium and large one.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.890
And this is the big one.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.500
And there's a couple things
that are special about this.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.590
It's got the MakerBot
Replicator Smart Extruder.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.160
This sends you a message when
you need to add more filament.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.370
And it'll send it to your phone.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.830
It'll say, hey
your model's done.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.732
Come pick it up and get
the next one started.

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:58.190
It's got a camera in it, so
you can take pictures of things

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.773
that you make.

00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:01.180
You can monitor your
progress and broadcast out

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.770
your latest creation
on social networks.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.931
The MakerBot Replicator
Z18 has a heated

00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:08.430
build chamber, which actually
keeps the models dimensionally

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.840
stable, as it's being made.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.420
Inside the 3D printer is the
MakerBot Replicator 3D printing

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.030
platform, the
electronics and software.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.060
All three 3D printers have
very, very powerful electronics

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.430
and software behind them.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.770
And this one's no different.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.590
The MakerBot Replicator
Z18 is for the person

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.102
who doesn't want any limits.

00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:28.060
They want to think big.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.610
They want to go-- they
don't want any limitations.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.480
And the third in our lineup
of 3D printers at CES

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.040
is the DaVinci 1.0.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.740
It's made by XYZ Printing,
whose parent company was a 2D

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.240
printer.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.465
So they're able to
make this guy for $499.

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:44.490
Yeah, $499.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.200
It's super cheap.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.860
But it's made by a 2D printer
that now makes 3D printers.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.730
They just added
that extra D. And it

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.830
has proprietary
print cartridges.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.010
So that's pretty much it for
3D printing here at CES 2014.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.030
We've got a big guy.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.260
We've got a cheap guy.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.736
And we've got a tasty guy.

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:03.110
Which one of those would you
pick, if you could have one?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.930
Let us know down
below in the comments.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.570
And thanks a lot for
watching D News, everybody.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.830

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.830
We'll see you next time.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.600
Thanks again to Toyota for
