Hi, I'm Laura Fitzgerald on behalf of Expert
Village, and today I am here to talk to you

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.980
about care and maintenance of your pet rat.
In my hands today I am holding a dumbo rat.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.550
This is blondie, she is my little mommy dumbo
rat. See how her ears are on the side of her

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.640
head and not at the top of her head like regular
rats? She is also called a rex rat. See how

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.520
her hair is blonde, going in this direction,
and if you push the fur in this direction

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.360
its almost a silver grey. Rats make wonderful
pets, for family and children. They do not

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.570
bite or hardly ever bite. They are extremely
intelligent, they come when they are called,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.800
they can do tricks, they get along with all
the other family pets, they are very low maintenance

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.380
and they are very clean. I have a few other
rats to show you, momma had some babies, she

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:08.310
had four other baby rats. This rat is only
two weeks old. As you can see, its eyes and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.030
ears are closed. It will not be able to hear
for six weeks. It will be totally dependent

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:27.971
on its mom up until about six weeks old, when
it will start eating regular rat food. In

00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:37.399
this cage over here,
I have two rats, this is my big daddy rat,

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:44.849
Tar. Tar is also a rex rat, but see he has
normal ears, they are at the top of his head.

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:51.299
Tar is about eighteen months old. He was my
first rat, he has a little white belly and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:00.119
little white feet. And he is very intelligent,
he even knows his name and does tricks. You

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.479
can see the difference between the male and
female rat. The males are much bigger than

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:22.170
the females.
And this is Lucy, she is a hairless rat, she

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.720
has regular ears. But she has no hair, the
only hair is on the side of her head on her

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.170
whiskers and at the top of her head. Sometimes
that falls out and grows back. But all over

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:46.549
her body she has no hair.

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:55.000
Rats come in many different colors, hair types,
different body types and without tails, if

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.269
tails make you squeamish.
