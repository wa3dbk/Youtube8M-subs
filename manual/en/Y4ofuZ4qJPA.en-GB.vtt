00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.800
An elephant that was kept in chains for 50
years and abused by a drug addict who used

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.949
the animal beg in India has been freed. Raju
had been beaten and starved since being poached

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.320
from the wild as a baby and resorted to eating
paper and plastic to fill his stomach.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.390
The chains and spikes wrapped around his legs
had left him with chronic wounds and arthritis

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.920
and he was in almost constant pain.
But now he is walking free for the first time

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.710
after a daring rescue by conservationists
with a court order by the Uttar Pradesh Forest

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.330
Department to take the elephant from his abusive
owner. The charity took Raju in the middle

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.570
of the night on Thursday, supported by police
and state officials. The elephant's mahout

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.220
and previous owner tried to stop him being
taken by adding more chains and having people

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.260
block the roads for the rescue lorry. Experts
worked for hours to gain the elephant's trust

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.470
with fruit and encouragement until they could
get him into the van that would take him to

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.850
a sanctuary. When Raju was being rescued,
volunteers said they saw tears rolling down

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.350
his face. Pooja Binepal, from Wildlife SOS
UK, said: "The team were astounded to see

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.460
tears roll down his face during the rescue.
It was so incredibly emotional for all of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.040
us.
"We knew in our hearts he realised he was

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.620
being freed. "Elephants are not only majestic,
but they are highly intelligent animals, who

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.229
have been proven to have feelings of grief,
so we can only imagine what torture half a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.060
century has been like for him." Kartick Satyanarayan,
the charity's co-founder, said the mahout

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.440
tried to make the elephant charge by shouting
commands. He added: "We stood our ground and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.320
refused to back down -- and as we did so,
tears began to roll down Raju's face. "Some

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.020
no doubt were due to the pain being inflicted
by the chains, but he also seemed to sense

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.479
that change was coming. "It was as if he felt
hope for the first time in a very long time."

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.880
Almost two days later and 350 miles away in
Mathura, the chains were removed after 45

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.230
painstaking minutes. A video showed the moment
they cut the painful spikes and chains binding

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.150
the animal's legs so he could walk freely
for the first time. Mr Satyanarayan said:

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.240
"We all had tears in our eyes as the last
rope which held the final spike was cut and

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.200
Raju took his first steps of freedom." Other
elephants at the Conservation and Care Centre

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.590
at Mathura came to watch the new arrival.
He is being fed to restore him to a healthy

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.780
weight and vets are treating his many wounds
and abscesses from beatings and chains. Rescuers

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.620
at Wildlife SOS believe Raju started life
in the wild but was caught as a baby by poachers

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.330
and sold as a working elephant. Ms Binepal
said: "The poachers either slaughter the mother,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.620
or they drive the herd into traps that are
small enough only for the babies to fall into.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.849
The mother cries for her baby for days after
he's been stolen -- it is a sickening trade.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.410
"The calves are then tied and beaten until
they submit to their owners -- their spirits

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.900
are effectively broken." He had almost 30
owners in his life but was found by the charity

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.530
exactly a year before his rescue, working
as a begging elephant on the streets of Allahabad.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.379
His owner, a drug addict, would tell pilgrims
at religious sites his elephant could "bless"

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.780
them in exchange for money. Raju's tail was
almost bare because the man had been ripping

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.290
out hairs to sell tourists as a good luck
charm for hundreds of rupees. The elephant

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.819
was covered in deep wounds from the spikes,
as well as the spear used to discipline him

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.160
and abscesses from his chains. He was kept
chained outside with no shelter or rest, even

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.650
in the summer heat, and was dangerously underweight.
Raju is now recovering in Wildlife SOS' elephant

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.580
sanctuary, where he will live with other rescued
animals. The charity, founded in India in

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.280
1995, is appealing for Â£10,000 of donations
to help start the elephant's new life. To

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.530
donate, visit www.wildlifesos.org, or cheques
