00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:07.400
Hey.

00:00:12.473 --> 00:00:15.208
Whoa. Hey, yeah.
Come on, man. I'm sorry.

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:17.160
I didn't hear you. Come on.

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:19.563
I'll take you.

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:27.904
Where to?
1039 south
union street.

00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:29.606
Gotcha.

00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:48.107
How long you think
this'll take?
[max] seven minutes.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:51.578
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:53.880
Two minutes to get across
the 110 to normandie.

00:00:53.947 --> 00:00:55.882
Normandie to venice,
three minutes.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.385
Over to union is one,
plus one for "shit happens."

00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:00.487
Okay if I time you?
Knock yourself out.

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:02.622
If you're wrong,
I get a free ride?

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.275
You get an apology. Already
offered my free ride today.

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:07.144
To who?
Some girl.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.930
Did you get
a date with her?

00:01:10.998 --> 00:01:13.116
First time in l.A.?

00:01:13.184 --> 00:01:17.387
No. Tell you the truth, whenever
I'm here, I can't wait to leave.

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:20.757
It's too sprawled out,
disconnected.

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:22.442
You know?
That's me.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.444
You like it?
It's my home.

00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:26.446
17 million people.

00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:30.483
It's the fifth biggest
economy in the world,
and nobody knows each other.

00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:33.703
I read about this guy.
Gets on the mta here, dies.

00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:36.389
Huh.
Six hours he rides the subway

00:01:36.457 --> 00:01:39.592
Before anybody notices his
corpse doing laps around l.A.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.262
People on and off,
sitting next to him.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.197
Nobody notices.
