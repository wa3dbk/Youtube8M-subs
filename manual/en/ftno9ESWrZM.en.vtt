00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:10.100
Try as we might - we cannot master the flight
of the hummingbird.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.119
Hey everyone this is Carin for DNews and today
we are talking about human attempts to replicate

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.119
mother nature.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.539
Biomimicry is the term used to describe technologies
that we develop to try to be as awesome as

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.359
the structures and functions we observe in
the animal kingdom.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.939
Things like slug slime and spider silk have
been mimicked in many scientific studies;

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.820
however, today’s example comes courtesy
of the bird world.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.320
Hummingbirds move with awe-inspiring speed.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.410
Their tiny wings can flap at such high frequencies
that they are audible to human ears - hence

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.770
the name hummingbird.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.870
The fastest flappers are flapping up to 200
times per second.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.580
Hummingbirds are also masters of the hover
- maintaining their aerial positions with

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.400
what seems to be very little effort.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.170
Scientists have long been interested in mimicking
the flight techniques of hummingbirds, and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.080
our most efficient microhelicopters actually
do a pretty respectable job.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.330
The Prox Dynamics Black Hornet autonomous
microhelicopter is the most sophisticated

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.780
available - these tiny drones are about the
same size as hummingbirds and they are currently

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.080
used in Afghanistan by the English army.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.540
But how efficient are these autonomous helicopter
drones?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.920
A recent study led by David Lentink at Stanford
university looked into that question.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.620
The researchers analyzed the aerodynamic properties
of hummingbird feathers from twelve different

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.750
species and compared them to the blades of
the black hornets.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.700
Specifically mounted cameras allowed the researchers
to visualize airflow around the bird wings

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.780
and helicopter blades that were spun on an
apparatus designed for this exact purpose.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.960
In addition, sensitive load cells were used
to measure both lift force and drag on the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.280
feathers at various angles and speeds.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.870
In other words - how hard does a bird have
to work in order to achieve lift or to maintain

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.240
its position in the air?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.549
Do the helicopter blades have to work harder?

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.950
Actually, no.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.090
The news isn’t terrible, but we’ve clearly
got a ways to go.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.260
Lentink and his team found that microhelicopter
blades were able to hover with an efficiency

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.619
that rivals that of an average hummingbird
- which is pretty darn impressive.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.739
However, hummingbirds with top flight wings
such as those of the Anna’s hummingbird,

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.159
common on the west coast of North America,
are able to increase efficiency over the helicopters

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.650
by a staggering 27%.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.700
The best engineers in the world remain outperformed
by the power of evolution!

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.379
Overall, this work most definitely represents
a significant achievement in the study of

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.090
aerodynamics….but there’s more work to
be done in order to create technologies that

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.540
rival the movement patterns of hummingbirds.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.779
I mean, think about it - this was just one
aspect of hummingbird flight - hovering.

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.599
What about diving, navigating through complex
environments or flying through wind gusts??

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.310
Not to mention that hummingbirds actually
flap their wings - this study looked at the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.720
movement of spinning.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.510
If hummingbirds could actually move by spinning
their wings like a helicopter they would only

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.310
utilize half as much energy as they currently
do.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.349
When it comes to biomimicry, there are many
more secrets to be discovered from hummingbirds

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.230
and countless other organisms about amazing
ways they carry out their day to day functions.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.579
Which animal do you think we should try to
mimic and why?
