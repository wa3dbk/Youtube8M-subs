00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.939
I am here with Marlynn McNutt of Fire
Mountain Gems and Beads and Marlynn

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:04.870
is going to teach us about

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.200
something you probably take for
granted all the time, buttons.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.940
They're very interesting aren't they.
I think they are.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420
In history they were
used as a sign of wealth.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.480
They were used as adornment.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.720
Something you take for granted
as you're buttoning up.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.050
Now you brought some with you to show
us a little variety of some of the buttons

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.949
and how they came.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.050
Do you want to talk about those? Yes.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.329
To begin with back in history, they were
sometimes made out of precious metal

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.210
and precious gemstones and then in the
nineteenth century they started

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.000
mass production.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.410
Now most of the buttons
are made of plastic but

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.390
you can also still find them
in wood, horn, leather, bone

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.280
and we've got a
good selection here

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.860
all the way down to Hill Tribe silver.
I can see that.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.120
And we've got crystal buttons,
also in architectural shapes.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.600
I was going to say they come in such
amazing shapes. You see some circles,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.210
some squares and almost
an octagon shape.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.950
Quite fascinating. Now what I think is
great about this project is the fact that

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.470
something you take for granted like
buttons and you find everywhere, you can

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.460
actually add them to jewelry.
Show us how to do that Marlynn.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.189
Alright. Today we're going to start with
a basic bracelet of peyote stitch.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.970
This is five beads wide so you're going
to basically use your center row

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.049
for all of your steps. We've taught that
in previous episodes, how to actually do

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.450
peyote stitch and what type of beads did
you use for the peyote stitch? These are

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.650
number six hex beads and they
are in the Iris finish.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.890
So the first thing that
you're going to do is take

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.600
the center bead on one end of your
bracelet and you're just going to add

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.049
a button. You will go ahead and weave
your thread through the bracelet back

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.340
and forth to secure it.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.600
Come out the center bead
and add your button

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.049
and then you'll just
pull it down into place.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.140
You will then go ahead and stitch
back through the button

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.200
and that center bead, maybe three
or four times to secure it and make

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.840
sure that it's on there good and strong
so you don't lose your bracelet.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.750
Then you will go ahead and weave
the thread diagonally back and forth

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.670
through the bracelet

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.989
to finish the end off.  Wow!

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.300
The next step will be to
add the seed bead loop.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.530
This is going to be the other end
of the fastener for your button.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.019
So what you're going to do

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.440
is you're going to string
some seed beads on and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.569
take your button

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.769
and actually hold it in
that loop to measure it

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.830
and make sure because you
don't want it to loose

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.860
so it slips off easily. Exactly.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.150
Nor too tight where you can't put it
through. Correct. Then you go ahead

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.860
and pull that down and you will finish
this off the same way that you did your

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.360
button on the other end by
going all the way through.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.920
You want to go back through all your seed beads and that center bead a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.060
couple of times and then weave
your ends back in to finish it off.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.489
Let's look at how it looks at the end.

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.129
Once you have your bracelet
completed,

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.280
then you'll go in and you add
your buttons for adornment.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.400
You can add more than than
what we have here or very few.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.129
How would you go ahead and do that?

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.459
Are you going to demonstrate
how to do one of them?

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.379
I have gone ahead and woven the thread
through the bracelet to attach it.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.110
To the point where you want the
adornment to begin, right?

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.540
You are going to use the center row of this bracelet so I have come out of one of the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.099
beads in the center row so what
you're going to do is you're going

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.930
to go ahead

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.799
just like you're going to sew it onto a
piece of clothing. Come up through

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:50.489
the hole

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.019
and back down through.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.299
Using all of your techniques.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.540
Is there a particular type of
thread that you are using for this?

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.590
I'm using size D Nymo for
this particular project.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.989
Once you have your button in place,
then you'll want to weave around

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.599
under that center bead and then
back up and down through the holes

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.900
two or three times to secure it in place.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.109
So it really makes a difference
what size bead you use in the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.970
bracelet too, so that you have enough
room to go back and forth with all the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.419
additional stitches you are doing.

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.550
It does. You can just do
that all the way through

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.710
and then where you want to put them,
wherever you want to add the button sits

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.720
there you can even
just weave your thread

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.880
back and forth through the center beads
to lead it to the next spot that you

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.220
want to add a button.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.490
It's just amazing what you
can do with buttons. It is.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.169
There are so many different projects.
You brought some other

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.400
additional things. That's the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.900
finished piece of the project bracelet.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.830
Then this one is a right angle weave and

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.710
it is just a little different type stitch.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.680
It gives you a whole different look.
Yes, and it has a bit more movement.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.789
It's a little more flexible.

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.479
It's so pretty and buttons are not
only for bracelets, are they?

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.630
No, they're not. Let's start off
with these earrings down here.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.430
Are these more crystal type buttons?
They are the architectural crystals.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.639
and they're just put together
with some seed beads.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.789
Then a different length
and then the third one

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.550
that we're looking at is just a button.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.330
The third earrings are
just a gold metal button

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.919
with a little bit of wire work woven
around the outside and a crystal dangle

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:36.660
at the bottom.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.990
So creative, Marlynn. Then of course, you
can string them.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.130
We're looking at the necklace,
that's at the far end,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.139
that you've strung the buttons like beads.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.990
Yes, those were actually
strung on double thread.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.350
They are a two-hole button and they are
mother of pearl.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.460
And then of course you can use
them as the focal bead as well.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.310
That's an old button out of a button box
and all we did was just run fringe

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.710
through the two button holes.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.819
So fun and creative. Thank you so much.
I love learning things from you.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:09.090
Thank you.
