00:00:10.098 --> 00:00:13.048
Why should I go to an Ivy League school?

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:15.278
My parents think I should.

00:00:15.278 --> 00:00:19.988
Ivy League colleges make you pay a literally
high price for the prestige.

00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:23.407
Seven Presidents have had Harvard degrees.

00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:26.618
Going to Harvard doesn’t mean you’re going
to be President.

00:00:26.618 --> 00:00:28.467
And do you really want to be President?

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:29.467
Fine.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:34.638
I don’t really want to be President, though
Obama’s been on all the talk shows and met

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:35.738
lots of celebrities.

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:40.828
You can do the same just winning a major reality
TV show.

00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:44.418
And in that case, you’d actually get money
instead of spending a lot.

00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:47.958
A lot of people get scholarships.

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.628
Half off 120K is 60K.

00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:53.738
You could live at home and go to a state school
for 40K.

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:56.418
That’s as much debt as a car.

00:00:56.418 --> 00:00:59.697
It’s far better than owing a house payment.

00:00:59.697 --> 00:01:03.618
Ivy League graduates make more over their
lifetimes.

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:09.738
People who qualify for Ivy League but go somewhere
else are end up with just as high a net worth,

00:01:09.738 --> 00:01:13.668
income and life outcomes as those who were
offered and did attend.

00:01:13.668 --> 00:01:19.168
Actually, their net worth is often higher
because they spent less on college.

00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:22.077
So why not get the elite degree?

00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:26.848
There is no longer the same, huge premium
for being an Ivy League graduate as other

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:27.848
schools.

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:31.248
The fact that you’re a doctor matters more
than from which school.

00:01:31.248 --> 00:01:33.878
I don’t want to be a doctor.

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:39.998
Go to an Ivy League school, and everyone you
know is a doctor, lawyer, hedge fund managers

00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:41.598
or in politics.

00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:42.668
Fine, fine.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:49.088
But you get to interact with a diverse group
of people, from all corners of society.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:53.208
Like the one scholarship kid from a state
with four corners?

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:58.318
If you want diversity, try talking to the
lady who cleans your house or actually having

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.578
a conversation with a conservative without
assuming he’s crazy.

00:02:01.578 --> 00:02:08.717
The Cabinet, Senate, Executive branch and
others are dominated by Ivy League graduates.

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:14.088
There’s a fair argument to be made that
this is why we’re in such bad shape despite

00:02:14.088 --> 00:02:16.968
being years past a recovery summer.

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:19.777
Bill Gates dropped out of Ivy League.

00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:23.117
Why don’t you just drop out of the local
college and save money?
