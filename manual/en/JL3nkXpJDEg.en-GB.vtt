00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.290
We had to wait a long time, but yesterday
the 30th of January BlackBerry

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.230
finally announced their new
operating system BlackBerry 10

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.309
and the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.189
Here we have the BlackBerry Z10 in with us and that's the first BlackBerry OS10

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.239
device that will come to market, at the
moment the phone is in stores

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.570
in London and in the rest of England

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.430
and will be available later in February,
March and April

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.800
in other parts of the world.
It's not clear when it will launch in

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.949
The Netherlands, but we expect it
to be around March.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.890
In this video we will take a first look
at BlackBerry 10

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.469
and the BlackBerry Z10.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.699
It's some kind of prototype we have in
our hands

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:40.149
here,

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.199
it's a real production model, but for instance

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.739
we can not sell it. There's a big not for
sale on it

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.579
and we certainly won't do so, but we
can play around with it according to

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.190
BlackBerry.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.710
This is a review model and we will test it thoroughly in the coming two weeks.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.350
But first we will preview it for you,
because we have been able

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.949
to use it for a day now.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.100
So we have quite some experience with it now.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.489
The BlackBerry Z10

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.280
is a bit boring design wise,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.659
it takes some clues from the iPhone from
the front, 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.329
on the back there's a big BlackBerry logo,

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.929
BlackBerry is not called Research in Motion
anymore, but really just

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:13.759
BlackBerry.

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.090
And as you see there's only a BlackBerry
logo on the back of the phone.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.310
Off course there's a big BlackBerry logo
and the name of the company

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.479
underneath the screen and what stands out is
that the screen has pretty big bezels.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.600
Certainly for a modern smartphone. The phone
has a 4.2" screen

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.420
with a resolution of 1280x768 pixels

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.719
and at the top

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.829
and the bottom it stands out there
is quite some space around the screen

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.960
and also the bezels are quite thick.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.969
The screen it self is quite nice really,

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.409
it looks quite neat and reacts well

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.430
to touch imput. It has a good resolution
which is quite modern.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.060
Not yet full HD, even if it's a 2013 smartphone

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.670
but anyway it's a fine resolution.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.659
The back of the phone is made from
a rubbery material

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.390
which makes it nicer in hand,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.549
the phone is a bit thick,

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.909
just a bit thicker than the iPhone actually,
but not really thick.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.719
On the side there is a MicroUSB slot and an
HDMI

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.500
output,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.699
so you can connect the phone to a beamer
or a television.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.219
On top there is a powerbutton

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.480
and on the side there are volume buttons.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.410
This volume buttons are pretty small,

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.889
and a bit hard to push.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.139
If you push the two buttons at the same time,

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.809
the phone makes a screenshot.

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.679
Speaking of which, one of the most important
things in this phone is the fact

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.069
it runs on BlackBerry OS10.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.300
BlackBerry worked for 2 years on OS10 now

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.680
since the acquisition of QNX, what runs on the PlayBook.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.049
They started a new operating system.

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.600
BlackBerry 7, 6 and 5 were no longer up to date
anymore

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.069
and QNX should become the succesor of that.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.579
The problem was QNX was delayed a lot,

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.549
it should have been released on the first phones in 2012. RIM didn't make that deadline

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.139
and now, 12 months later, we are finally there

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.669
and we have the BlackBerry Z10.

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.949
So the BlackBerry Z10 is the first phone,
there will also be a Q10

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.810
which is a version with a keyboard

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.890
and a touchscreen, and that one

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.029
will be a month or so later than the Z10.

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:12.090
The Z10 has a dualcore processor,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.690
an 8 megapixel camera with 1080p resolution

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.849
and our first impression of this camera isn't really good.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.349
The camera itself is a bit pixellated

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.970
and especially in the dark it's pretty bad.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.210
In daylight it's normal, but as soon

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.660
as you turn on the nice functionalities

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.030
that BlackBerry promoted pretty heavily lately

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.940
that you take a photo of someone and you can adjust his face afterwards, that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.260
photo is quite pixelated, so that's a pity and with that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.969
BlackBerry seems to still not have the multimedia area sorted out.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.319
BlackBerry has a new application store,

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.099
BlackBerry World, on this phone. And here you can buy apps, music

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.189
and also video.

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.439
The problem is that the music and video service work in England, but not

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.169
in The Netherlands so if you will use the phone in The Netherlands you can only buy apps, 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.779
so no video or music.

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:57.239
BlackBerry works hard to bring this service to other

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:57.800
country's,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.260
so maybe we can use it during lauch, but at the moment that's not

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.179
possible.

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:04.389
BlackBerry 10 works kinda nice actually and the

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.669
cool thing is it doesn't use buttons to

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:12.329
control everything. It all works with swipes, from the edges. Namely the

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.909
right edge, left edge, top edge and bottom edge. You can activate every edge and

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.680
that will trigger something in the app.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.190
The phone will be unlocked if you swipe up

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.609
over the lockscreen and

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.849
you can swipe left or right to view more applications or go to 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.430
multitasking for instance.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.550
Really important is the hub functionality.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.910
You can trigger that by going all left, which will open

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.669
all your notifications, some kind of notification centre actually.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.340
You can also do that when you're in an application. If we start Twitter for instance,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.909
and swipe up

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.439
and after that swipe right, then you will see a preview of all your

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:47.250
notifications.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.720
That way you won't shut down the application, but you can view which notifications came in,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.539
for instance emails, Twitter or Facebook messages. 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.050
Another nice thing is that the phone comes preinstalled with Twitter, Facebook,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.460
Foursquare and LinkedIn and

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.819
all those applications work pretty good.
They are all native

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:05.410
apps

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.250
and we think they work better than for instance the applications which you can

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.699
find on Windows Phone 8 from these social networks. And that's a nice advantage.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.789
Another thing is that the phone is pretty fast in use and shows

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.319
almost no lag with us.

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.819
It scrolls pretty fast,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.789
apps open pretty fast, and faster than with competing platforms

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.639
apart from iOS and Android.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.629
It's all pretty smooth and that's really nice. Also

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.090
the browser is really good.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.210
It's one of the best browsers in a mobile phone OS,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.240
which can compete with Google's Chrome browser on Android and the iOS browser

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.680
and is even a bit better than Internet Explorer 9 on Windows Phone 8.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.449
We said a lot about this phone already,

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.919
our impressions of BlackBerry 10 and the BlackBerry Z10 are quite positive,

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.949
but there are a few small things.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.340
We noticed some bugs in the first day of use, for instance that it wouldn't

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.009
load the settings menu or wouldn't always set up an email account and sometimes it crashed.

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.389
But in general the phone is quite fast, runs quite smoothly and just looks

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.589
really nice. Better than we expected actually. The question is whether it's enough

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:10.279
for BlackBerry, but we will hopefully answer that in our

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.419
comprehensive review that we will publish in two weeks

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.740
on our website and our video review on our YouTube channel.
