00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:07.339
Hello, I'm Tom Wright, from Gingerbread and
Glass, on behalf of Expert Village. In this

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.190
segment we're going to talk about a cold seal.
Now a cold seal is when you take what we're

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.050
working on here will be our little pendant
of cane and diachronic and clear combined.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:28.810
We're going to take a clear, borosilicate
rod, get it hot just on the tip, and now this

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.800
is where we're going to want - we're going
to place it on one of the sides of our pendant

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:45.580
that is not currently hot. Now we push it
on there, and we spin it, give it a little

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.220
twirl at a pull back. Okay, now the cold seal
helps us in many ways. Now, it will help us

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.400
work this, because this will not work, this
is not a pendant right now. And now we will

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.250
continue to work on it with a cold seal. Now
we're going to take the back borosilicate

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:34.170
clear rod and take that off of the pendant.
Now that we have separated the clear rod from

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.450
the pendant, it is now much easier to work.
And again we're going to take the mashers

00:01:42.450 --> 00:02:01.009
and mash the clear back into the pendant.
Use the tweezers on the pendant to flatten

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:13.579
out the clear on the back. Once the back has
been flattened, you can move onto the next

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:13.819
step.
