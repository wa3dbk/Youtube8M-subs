00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:10.170
"For this particular rig here, I have 2 identical
turntables.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.620
I have a mixer in the middle.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.950
I have my laptop computer and I have my reference
monitor.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:23.250
I want to make sure that the song I have loaded
up on the left deck is going to be heard on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.250
the headphones and through the reference monitor.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.910
First thing is you want to make sure that
your turntables are plugged into the right

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.300
channels, right?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.550
So the left turntable is plugged into a phono
channel, which is channel 1.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.260
Then the right turntable is going to come
out of channel 2, on a phono channel, right?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.969
Turntables are always on phono, CDJ's or Ipods
or Sarato or Tracker they're always online.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.500
You have the cartridge connected to the tone
arm.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.780
You have your volume up on the gain.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.780
You have the volume up on the channel that
you're going to play your signal.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.549
This signal is coming out to aux out which
is connected to my reference monitor.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.729
So the way it's flowing, I have my song in
Sarato loaded up on the left deck, I have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.189
my needle on the record.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.279
Once I hit play on the record you'll hear
that signal flowing through this channel,

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:33.149
channel 1 and then I'll be able to also hear
it on my headphones.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.289
As I have my cue to the left deck when I raise
up the volume and as I raise up the volume

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.959
for aux out I'll be able to hear the signal
coming out through the aux out.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.489
Volume levels, I'm playing my track, I can
hear it on my headphones and now I raise up

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:57.979
the volume and there goes the volume for the
track that I'm playing on the left deck.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:07.729
So understanding the signal flow is the music
is coming from the laptop connected USB into

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.069
the TTM 57 Rane mixer which has Sarato built
in.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.530
I have my needle on the record, as I hit play
the record, that track is playing the signal,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.100
I see the LED lights on the mixer that means
it's getting signal.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.209
As I raise up the volume I hear a signal,
it's coming out the aux out, so pretty much

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.200
it's just understanding ins and outs.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.230
And in signal is input, an out signal is output.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.959
Understanding what's connected to what and
just understanding the overall flow so you

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.379
can get the signal to come out through the
main PA system or personal monitor and also

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.449
your headphones.
