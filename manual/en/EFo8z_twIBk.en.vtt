00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.580
My name's Jack Minkalis, I'm the
supervisor in charge of our Household

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.279
Hazardous Waste facility.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.399
I feel that we have one of the finest
household hazardous waste collection

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.130
facilities in the valley.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.420
This is a convenient way for our
residents to be able to dispose of their

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.009
hazardous waste. Any of the products that
people bring in that we deem are still

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.189
really good in something that people

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.159
other people may want to use we have our
swap shop it's open when the facility is

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.070
open

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.880
and people can come in, they're free to
take anything there's no charge. It's a

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.880
great way to reuse of some of the
products.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.640
One of our more popular programs is our
recycled paint program.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.000
People are able to come in and get 25 gallons of paint that we've recycled.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.430
My job here at Household Hazardous Waste is processing the stuff that residents bring in.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.309
such as paint, batteries, metals, oils,

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.730
small medals,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.030
the majority of it is the paint.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.770
We'll put it in this fifty five-gallon
drum

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.770
and that will go ahead and we'll mix it up

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.940
After it's all mixed

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.360
what would we do now is we will process it
we'll put it in the five-gallon pails

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.140
put a little marker on it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.990
now we're going to add the lid.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.110
you know what a lot of them are surprised on the money they save. Anywhere from seventy-five to a hundred twenty five for a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.550
five-gallon pail.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.300
they come here to take about five gallon pail for nothing.
