previously on MrFudgeMonkeyz's annoying villagers

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.600
You have killed my brother

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.000
And for this you must...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.380
Dance

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.700
No please! Mercy anything but that!

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.990
You hear him! Dance for the king

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.310
crying*

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.380
I hate dancing!

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.340
uh

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.140
oops wrong clip

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.040
Previously on MrFudgeMonkeyz's Annoying villagers

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.440
I think they're gone

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.880
Lets get some dirt and get out of here!

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.480
alright

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.640
looks like you're surrounded

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.560
Destroy him

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.820
And now

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.100
Get him

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.940
Hey look a villager

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.880
Where!

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.420
I can't believe you just fell for that

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.460
Oh master

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.200
It looks likes those zombies. They aspire against you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.340
They are working with those annoying villagers

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.080
Shall I send the minions after them?

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.780
No but send a message. That set them straight

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.540
Yes master

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.900
What are you running from?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.420
I'm so uncomfortable

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.940
I'm sorry

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.000
but sacrifices must be made!

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.160
Hey stupid zombie! Read that piece of paper

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.480
hehe right on time

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.400
We got him

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.880
Hey where did you get those swords?
