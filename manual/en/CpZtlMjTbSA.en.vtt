Joiselle Cunningham: Thank you two for joining me today to talk 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.190
about an issue that I'm very passionate about which is teacher diversity.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.110
Arne I want to start with you.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.140
What does Teacher diversity look like in the current teacher force?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.880
Arne Duncan: So this is one that when I ran the Chicago public schools 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.290
you could go into some elementary schools and see no men of color 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.460
and see sometimes not enough teachers of color and we want 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.630
great teachers in every classroom, we want great principals in every school.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.570
I just want that great talent to reflect the great diversity 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.200
of our nation's school children.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.450
When we look at so many of our young boys and young boys 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.080
of color who struggle without dads growing up in single parent homes, 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.010
the vast majority, not all, but the vast majority being raised by moms.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.160
The lack of strong male role models of color, 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.630
I think particularly those early grades, has a devastating impact.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.900
When you look across the nation, our numbers 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.540
are nothing that we should be proud of.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.660
In terms of lack of men teach it's like less than one in 50.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.800
Hispanic men, about the same.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.130
1 in 50 together.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.810
Less than 5 percent of our teachers are men of color.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.820
It's not just our young boys of color, 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.480
all of our children need access to great teachers and men 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.520
and women and start to see the rich diversity of our nation.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.450
We talked about this before.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.360
It's so interesting to me that we're predicting 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.720
that for the first time in our nation's history, this school year, 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.860
this fall our nation's public school children will become majority minority.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.510
And so making sure our teacher workforce reflects the great diversity 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.280
of our nation and our nation's children, we have to do that.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.550
Joiselle: I recently spoke with a student I taught during 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.550
my first year of teaching and I asked her to reflect 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.390
on the year we had together, things that she remembers.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.690
She remembers quite a bit of what we did, the academic side but 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.150
a lot of the things that she told me were little stories vignettes 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.760
that I gave during that year that really spoke to my identity.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.400
Stories of perseverance, a lot of stories 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.340
that had to do with who I am as a person.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.300
What can we do to make sure that all students have access 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.700
to great role models and a diverse teacher force.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.130
Arne: One think we try to do is obviously starting 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.110
here in the department is teach.org website is trying to highlight the need,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.790
highlight the opportunities, let folks know what's out there.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.430
Telling the stories of great teachers like yourself and what you've done, 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.740
not just on the academic side which is hugely important, but the grit, 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.130
the tenacity, the resilience, the perseverance, 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.960
those skills that will help our children 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.260
be successful not just in school but in life.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.030
You can't overstate the importance there.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.410
I always go back to we have to start young with this stuff.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.770
Yes we can teach it in 9th and 10th grade, but it's really, really late.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.110
Early childhood education, first, second grade, third grade.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.560
Those habits of mind, those mindsets, 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.950
those skills can start to become just a natural part of who our 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.760
nation's young children are then they can overcome anything moving forward.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.910
So many of our kids as you know, overcome extraordinary adversity.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.930
David Johns: If I might add one thing that I think ties together the threads

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.630
that you guys are weaving is that everything that you just said, 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.560
Mr. Secretary is also true for the other adults in the building.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.930
When I think about my own experiences being a classroom teacher 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.930
in New York where the statistics reflect that which you highlighted earlier.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.910
I was one of three classroom teachers that was often called 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.010
out of class whenever there was an issue.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.370
Particularly a behavioral issue, especially with 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.180
any of the male students but with any of the older 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.180
or larger students for that matter.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.460
Often when I think about conversations that I now have with 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.990
my colleagues now is what they talk about is that my being 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.070
in that building not only was impactful for students of all races 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.750
and genders and ethnicities who saw me working with other adults 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.670
to conspire for their success, but I also would help 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.370
them translate things that didn't quite make sense 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.370
in the way they could access their own experiences or be able to 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.170
sit down and sort of mitigate things whenever challenges came up.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.440
Joiselle: David I want to hear a bit about your work 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.910
and how we can reconcile the current teacher force and what 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.560
we would like to see in terms of teacher diversity.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.300
David: Yes, we can end where you begin.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.990
I think about the question that you posed initially which 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.000
was to the secretary to talk about the challenge 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.440
and I really think about this as an opportunity.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.130
We have an opportunity to celebrate the fact that amongst 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.780
minority members particularly African American men.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.970
Those who do graduate college, they go into the 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.510
teaching profession by and large, right?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.100
If we continue to invest in educational oppurtunities 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.020
as this administration has done, then we will find 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.410
a way to mitigate and to move onto other conversations.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.530
I just want to reiterate that it's something that's 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.320
important for all students, not just students of color.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.030
Having diverse role models, having a diverse set of individuals 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.390
that you are learning from is essential.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.060
I think that's right and again for us to acknowledge 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.550
that while we've been talking about educators primarily teachers, 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.700
classroom teachers, thinking about the ways that all caring 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.900
can show up in the lives of young people is important.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.640
They often say that teaching isn't rocket science.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.170
They're right, it's a lot harder.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.970
We can show up as mentors or volunteer time during the day 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.560
to find ways to support those who do God's work 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.440
and support our kids each and every day.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.850
Thank you.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.010
Joiselle: Thank you again.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.610
Arne: Great Job

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.090
Joiselle: Thank you.
