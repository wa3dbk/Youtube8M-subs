00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.749
A Knitted Bunny Balloon Animal!

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:09.010
Hi, Guys I’m Kristen and Welcome to Studio
Knit.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.320
Today, we are going to celebrate Springtime
and Easter with these adorable knitted balloon

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.199
animal bunnies.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.880
I love knitting up this great pattern by Lion
Brand Yarn. And I thought would that you would

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.499
love to see how we knit, twist and tie up
them up to make this really special Bunny.

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:35.499
The link to Lion Brand Yarn’s FREE pattern
is in my description below.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.460
The materials to knit our Balloon Bunny are:
Aran Weighted Yarn. The Color Choice is TOTALLY

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.079
OPTIONAL;
2 Size 6 Us Knitting Needles;

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:54.079
Scissors, a Tapestry Needle, and Stuffing.
I am using scraps of cut up yarn from a previous

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.670
project.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.670
We will begin by casting on six stitches using
the long-tail cast on method. Row one, we

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.550
knit. Row two, we purl. Now Row Three, we
begin our increases. So, on every single stitch,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.290
we will be knitting front and back. So, we
begin with six stitches and we will end up

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.890
with twelve. If you're not familiar with knit
front and back, also written as KFB, I have

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.560
a link in the description below. Now, row
four, we will purl. And it's another increase

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.520
row. So, we have twelve stitches, we are going
to knit front and back on every stitch again.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.730
That will double the number of stitches we
have on our needle. So, we are taking it from

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.730
twelve to twenty four. Now, we just continue
knitting in the stockinette stitch for thirty

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.760
one inches. If you're not familiar with the
Stockinette Stitch, it is simply purling one

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.890
row, and then knitting the next. Okay, so
now at the very end, we are going to make

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.810
our tail by doing decrease rows very similar
to how we made our increase rows. So, here

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.810
we go, we are going to knit two together,
that's written as K2Tog, and now we are down

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.900
to twelve stitches. Next, we will purl. And,
again, it's knit two together. So, that's

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.340
going to take us down to six stitches. Now
we do not bind off. We simply cut off our

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.090
yarn, we leave a long tail, and thread that
tail through the remaining stitches. Then

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.460
we simply knot.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.120
Oh, and If you think this would be a great
quick knit to make for those you love, please

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.160
leave a COMMENT BELOW to tell us a little
bit about who you think would love a Balloon

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.140
Bunny knitted especially by you! I’m knitting
mine especially for my Niece Delilah! She

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.750
loves the color pink!

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.390
Attach our eyes to the head, and you do that
just one and half inches from the edge, from

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.760
our cast on edge. You can use safety eyes,
I'm simply knotting some yarn about six times

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.760
and weaving it through. Okay, so now, we have
our big long piece, so we are going to seam

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.599
up into a big long tube. Now, if you've knitted
the stockinette stitch before, you'll know

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.569
that it does have a tendency to curl up a
little bit. Whatever is your favorite way,

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:50.250
go ahead and seam it up and as you go, you
can stuff along the way, as well. It's a lot

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.739
easier to do it this way, rather than stuffing
at the very end, since this is such a long

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.739
piece. Now, it's time for us to wrap and tie.
And you will see in the pattern that there

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:11.849
are these different segments here. We wrap
and tie. What I like to do is I like to mark

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.150
off the different inches that we have to wrap
and tie first. And then once those are all

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:26.259
measured out, I can simply wrap and tie. Okay,
so now the real fun begins. We are going to

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:35.009
tie the ears together. And then this is our
next section right here. These two are our

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.340
arms and we will tie the arms together. And
right here are the legs. So, you go ahead

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.370
and tie the legs together. And it's really
fun to just tie and twist and sort of create

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.430
your bunny and get him all into place. So
now, with any color of your choice, go ahead

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.879
and embroider mouth, whiskers, whatever you
would like to do to decorate your bunny to

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:21.789
give it a little bit of extra personality.
Oh, our balloon bunny is so cute. I hope you're

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.479
inspired to try this project yourself.
