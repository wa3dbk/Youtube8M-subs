00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.860
Building on the success of 
their Genius bars today, 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.110
Apple stores across the country,
unveiled the Friend bar, 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.110
where obsessive apple users can come 
to discuss Mac products at length.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.220
Onion News Network tech trends reporter 
Jeff Tate, has more.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.520
Thanks Andrea, Apple users looking 
for someone to talk at,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.460
about the newest twitter iPhone app,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.360
or why Safari's an infinitely
better browser than Firefox, 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.360
can now simply make an appointment,
at Apple's new 'Friend Bar'. 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.640
Free to anyone with an Apple care warranty, 
the Friend Bar is staffed

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.280
by Apple employees specially trained 
to carry out lengthy conversations,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.980
about even the most arcane 
apple related topics. 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.080
Unlike your girlfriend or your coworkers,
we're not going to get tired

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.850
of discussing the wireless networking
capabilities of the operating system.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.250
We're here and we're ready to listen.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.820
The friend bar is already a success 
with some Apple fans scheduling

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.960
appointments up to four hours at length.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.320
It drives me so nuts that Firefox is 
disabling the plug-in for the main RC3.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.000
Genius bars across the country 
are reporting shorter wait times

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.640
as customers who just want to impress Apple
employees with their ironic desktop image,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.270
or their impeccably organized iTunes library,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.280
are redirected to the Friend Bar, 
and the discussions don't have to be limited

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.710
to Apple products.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.680
Friend Bar employees are trained 
to discuss a range of topics, 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.950
Apple customers are interested in, 
from finding a good Neapolitan pizza,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.260
to talking to girls you aren't already 
in an improv. group with. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160
I think what our customers appreciate 
is the fact that

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.670
they've got a multinational consumer
corporation that they can relate to.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.220
The Friend Bar, is not the only 
good news for Apple fans.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.440
The 24 hour friend line connects  
users to call centers overseas, 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.230
where they can talk about Apple, 
even after store hours.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.510
That's just using GarageBand, and I like to
use iMovie if I'm just making a slideshow

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.740
or something, but...
-Oh yes!

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.670
I'll use Final Cut Express for 
anything that's more elaborate.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.610
Of course, sir!

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.180
... like just yesterday I uploaded some flip
footage of these kids skateboarding, and...

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.340
That is very interesting!

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.220
The company also announced that next year 
it will roll out the iStore,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.300
A miniature version of an Apple store which 
customers can set up in their own homes.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.860
It's going to be about six thousand dollars
for the hardware,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.160
and then there's a month of salary 
for your personal Apple employee.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.890
Then of course, anything you buy 
from the store.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.600
For Tech trends, I'm Jeff Tate.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.470
Thank you Jeff.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.730
Moving on, in a diplomatic 
show of good will, 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.470
China will be sending two Tibetan monks 
to the national zoo in Washington.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.640
A lot of  networks report the news 
as it happens.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.910
But only one has the power to report 
the news before it happens.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.040
Through our state of the art 
worm hole satellite, 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.280
The Onion News Network future channel, 
brings you exclusive news transmitions,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.550
from the year 2137.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.890
Because to stay ahead in today's world,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.070
you need to know what's going 
to happen in tomorrows.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.530
Still ahead this hour...

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.610
Red Lobster opens factory outlet.
