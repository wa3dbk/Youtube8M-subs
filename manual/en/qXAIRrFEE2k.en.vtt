Hi, I'm Diana Korten, and I'm here today with
Helen to talk about flea allergies in cats.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.210
Now, Helen actually has a terrible flea allergy
to cats, but we've got it really under control.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.150
When I first found her in the mean streets
of downtown Los Angeles she was covered in

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:25.070
fleas; covered in hundreds of fleas, and her
skin was a mess. All in here she had terrible

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.329
scabbing, all around her neck, all down her
back, most of the places where fleas inhabit

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.020
a lot. She was just coated in scabs. It took
us a long time to figure out how to take care

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.470
of this. The first thing to do of course is
to get rid of the fleas. What can happen is

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.870
that the cat; once they have the scabs they,
the scabs themselves are itchy, so they itch

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.192
the scabs, they they bite at their tail, they're...
So, there's a few things that you want to

00:00:55.192 --> 00:01:00.550
do. You you can take them to the Vet and have
them treated with antibiotics and anti-fungal

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.280
ointments and salves. You can also adjust
their diet, because sometimes, cats that have

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.860
flea allergies will also develop allergies
to particular foods, particular ingredients

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.340
in foods; like corn or gluten, or... Anyway,
you can have your cat tested for what other

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.820
panel of allergies they may have in addition
to the flea allergy, that may be contributing

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.200
to the outbreak of the the sores and things
that they get. Another common allergy that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.020
accompanies flea allergies is plastic allergies,
and so what I've done with Helen; she has

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.540
a leather collar, rather than a plastic collar
or a vinyl collar, because again, that seems

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.381
to really make a difference for her in terms
of the scabbing and things that she gets around

00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:51.619
her neck. You have to remember, with flea
allergies is it doesn't take an entire infestation

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.240
to cause the cat to start scratching uncontrollably.
Really, just one or two fleas can cause it,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.229
because it's the flea saliva that the cat
is actually allergic to, so once they get

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.580
bitten they start having a reaction that,
and if they dig their claws into it then they

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.830
they start getting the secondary infections
and all that kind of stuff. So, I have here

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.330
just a little hydrocortisone salve. That's
a little something that you can apply to any

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.870
itchy spots. This this one is made particularly
for pets so that they won't hurt them if they

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.220
end up licking some of it off. Anyway, she
doesn't really have any infections right now,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.691
but it is something that you can use. The
other thing that you want to be sure to do

00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.940
when you have a cat who has a flea allergy
is you want to be sure to keep their nails

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.550
trimmed and short, because that'll help reduce
the amount of tearing that happens when they

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.380
scratch. The other thing that you can do if
the if the clipping of the nails isn't enough

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.170
to help protect the skin is you can put soft
claws on their, on the the paws. Those are

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.250
the little plastic caps that you can glue
onto their paws. The truth is, if you can

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.670
keep the cat indoors, keep the cat deflead,
keep fleas out of the environment, and manage

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.720
the habitual scratching and biting that the
cat can develop from the irritation of the,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.930
that grew out of the initial flea bite, then
you can really manage it quite well, as you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.030
can see with Helen, who is really doing incredibly
well.
