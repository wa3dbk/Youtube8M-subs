00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.693
When I was a young girl,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.660
my mother and I would walk to the river

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.860
to collect water.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.280
Every day.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.340
We departed with our containers before dawn in the dark.

00:00:12.337 --> 00:00:14.897
My mother led me along on a narrow path,

00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:16.754
through the trees and the brush.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.120
The river was nearly four miles away,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000
and the walk was unsafe.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700
Long ago, our river was clean.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.593
Today, it is dirty and full of sickness.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.680
Malaria, Cholera, and fever.

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:35.815
My little Susan almost died from diarrhea.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.460
Our family was all affected by the dirty water.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.480
But we needed it.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.140
We all need water.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.000
We knew there was a problem.

00:00:45.327 --> 00:00:46.607
We saw the problem.

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:48.599
But we are a poor village,

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:50.834
and could do nothing to change it.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.500
I was sad and afraid of losing a child.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.660
Then last year, we recieved a miracle.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.220
It was a well.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.300
We were given the supplies, and also the guidance,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.640
but the men of my village built it.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.700
They built it for our family--for all the families.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.220
It took many months to dig and build this well.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.160
But my husband and brothers worked hard every day.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.980
Now I am happy.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.220
I know that we are safe.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.280
My daughter and I no longer have to go to the river every day.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.976
My children are also safe from the dangers of dirty water.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.620
Now that I don't have to walk so far to get water, 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.020
I can take better care of my family 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.905
My children can go to school.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.849
We have a better life.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.200
It is a kind of liberation.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.360
The well is the center of my village and the future of my family.
