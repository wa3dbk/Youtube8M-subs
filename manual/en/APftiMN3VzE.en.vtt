Hello Everyone hope you are fine doing fine

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.680
i'll show you today my cowashed hair routine with my mini looses twists

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.640
With this style i mainly do a cowash

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.840
Only washing my hair with a conditioner every week and with a shampoo the 4th week

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.840
Except for the 2 first week when i didn't washed it

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.840
because my loose twist was new

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.480
i first saturate my loose twist with water

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.480
Before applying my conditioner

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.540
i run my finger through my hair to remove shedding hair

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.180
Sometime i cowashed it in 4 sections

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.000
And another time without sectioning my looses twists

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.880
i apply my conditioner and run my finger through my hair

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.780
I do not rub hard my scalp

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.520
To avoid tangle at the roots

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.560
After saturated my hair with conditioner

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.880
I rinse it immediately

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.180
I continue to run my finger through my hair

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.540
To remove again shedding hair

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.500
With the mini loose twist

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.660
it took me about 1hour to wash and style my hair

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.800
Which is impossible with my 4C hair

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.420
Again removing conditioner and specially shedding hair

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:18.880
After the co washing, i style my loose twist

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:29.920
in bantu knot out or

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:42.480
stretching with threading method
