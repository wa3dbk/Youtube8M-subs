00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.000
The Cyber Archive.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.400
From bizarre and scary insect lollipops to

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.000
spooky candy body parts, we count 15 weird
and gross Halloween candy treats,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
both sweet and savory.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.730
Number 15.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.410
Maggot Toffee Apples. Made by Hotlix.com,
these toffee apples are apparently a healthy

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.860
nutritious snack for your kids this Halloween.
The creators claim the maggots are clean and

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.400
have been fed on apple, banana and oatmeal.
They may well be healthy but they're still

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.140
the sort of maggots you'd expect to find on
a rotting corpse.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.620
Number 14.
Vampire Repelling Garlic Mints. Made by Archie

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.910
McPhee, these mints are perfect for protecting
yourself from the odd vampire attack. With

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.810
potent garlic breath you'll not only keep
the vampires away, but most likely everyone

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.530
in your office, your family and the majority
of people in your neighborhood as well.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.920
Number 13.
Insect Lollipops. Another mouthwatering treat

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.390
from Hotlix.com. These lollipops are available
in a variety of fabulous colors and flavors,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.640
each with their own exciting surprise waiting
inside! Once you've licked off the candy,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.000
you're treated to a crunchy insect. Available
in scorpion, cricket, worm and ant flavor. Yummy!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.440
Number 12.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.130
Zit Poppers. Plump and ripe, as it says on
the packet, these are no simple pimples. Fruit

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.850
flavored gummies shaped like a zit, each has
a sticky gooey filling that comes in strawberry

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.470
and watermelon flavors. They're so gross,
you might as well be eating a real zit. Or

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.189
maybe not.
Number 11.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.100
Oven Baked Tarantula. Healthy oven baked,
not fried. A delicacy in Cambodia, these crunchy

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.680
black, hairy spiders are cooked ready to eat
or can be warmed up in the microwave. Full

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.720
eating instructions come with this snack because
putting too much in your mouth at once results

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.819
in too many sharp, stiff legs jabbing at your
gums from various directions, making the spider

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.999
seem alive. Probably not the sensation you
were looking for.

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:22.060
Number 10.
Ear Wax Candy. With a plastic container shaped

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.079
like a human ear, Ear Wax Candy is supposed
to look like gelatinous earwax but is actually

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.760
fruit flavored gel. In addition to this unusual
holder, you can also get marshmallow cotton

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.549
swabs, so you can get right in there.
Number 9.

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.129
Toasted Giant Ants. A delicacy of South American
Indians. These crispy insects can measure

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.430
up to 2 cm, and have a nutty bacon flavor.
I'm not sure if these account for one or two

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.719
of your five-a-day, as these can easily be
mistaken for raisins and sultanas.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.579
Number 8.
Gummy Flesh Fries. If zombies opened a fast

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.669
food chain I'd imagine these would go down
a treat. Complete with a French fry box, these

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:13.419
fingers are soft and slimy with a watermelon
flavor. Not as gross as real fingers but I'd

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.579
imagine that would be fairly illegal.
Number 7.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.269
Urine Sample. It looks like someone actually
found a way to recycle all those used sample

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.499
pots. These realistic looking urine samples
actually contain delicious sour candy. Guys

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:34.930
your girlfriend would never know, when you
tear off the 'Sterile' label and toss back

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.489
a few swigs on your next date. But if she
says you're breath smells of pee, you obviously

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.499
picked up the wrong one.
Number 6.

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:49.370
Blood Bag Candy. No matter what your blood
type, your body won't reject this delicious

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.870
sweet blood. Red liquid candy is packaged
in real looking blood bags that comes with

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.969
a handy IV tube. The blood is strawberry flavor
and is vegan friendly.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.290
Number 5.
Bacon and Cheese Flavored Crickets. These

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.609
crispy protein rich treats are perfect for
those with diabetes or just sick of sweet

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:17.260
candy. They come in three flavors, Sour Cream
&amp; Onion, Salt N' Vinegar and Bacon &amp; Cheese.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.950
The best flavor is apparently Bacon &amp; Cheese
but perhaps it's because it covers up the

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.810
taste of cricket slightly better.
Number 4.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.560
Body Part Sushi. Impress your friends by serving
them chewy eyeball and brain rolls wrapped

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.930
in gummy seaweed and severed fingers, noses
and ears gently nestled on beds of gummy rice.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.510
Each packet comes with a pair of chopsticks.
They may only be candy but this sushi looks

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.330
pretty disgusting.
Number 3.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.520
Larvets. More yummy savory delights. These
dried mealworms are actually an extremely

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.340
popular source of nutrition in Asia, Africa
and South America. They're even sold in vending

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.440
machines alongside crickets, scorpions and
butterflies. They come in a few different

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.600
flavors, BBQ, Cheddar Cheese and fiery Mexican
Spice, so you'll never get bored.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.060
Number 2.
Brain Candy. Think Geek's Gummy Brain candy

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.000
comes with delicious strawberry flavored brain
parts and a small vial of cherry flavored

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.900
liquid candy blood. Packaged like a tasty
cut of meat you'd find in your local supermarket.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.530
This candy is sure to freak out the youngsters
and is one of the best looking 'normal' candy

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.560
for Halloween.
Number 1.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.510
Chili Candy. Made with real chili peppers
ranging from the mild Jalapeno to the inferno

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.710
of the Ghost Pepper, these things are the
perfect treat for those annoying brats next

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.590
door. As with most candy, everyone loves the
red ones. Unfortunately for those poor gullible

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.000
kids, this particular candy will most probably
blow their head off.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And that's it for this nasty countdown, as
always thanks for watching.
