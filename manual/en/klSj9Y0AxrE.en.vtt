00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.429
Hey guys.

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.049
This is version 2 of my GoPro sel-leveling
mount.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.431
I'm going to give you a quick overview of
it and then compare it to the first version

00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:14.660
real quick and then we'll get right into the
build.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.200
The purpose of these self-leveling mounts
is that they will keep the camera pointed

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.420
at the horizon when the mounting base changes
angle.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.730
I'll show you a little demonstration footage
real quick here just to show you what I'm

00:00:27.730 --> 00:01:13.619
talking about.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.830
This is version 2 of the mount that I just
finished.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.330
Here's the first version and they both have
some positive and negative aspects.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.810
Version 1 has a bearing in here so it keeps
the camera pointed at the horizonby balancing

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.790
it.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.860
The downsides are that it's hard to balance
this and when you do, it's only balanced for

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.040
one case.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.820
If you're changing cases from waterproof to
The Frame, that may come into play.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.840
It's possibly a little more fragile than the
second version.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.870
The positive is that it can rotate 360 degrees
if that comes into play for your application.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.729
It can be blown by wind, which is a negative
so deffinitely think about that.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.330
Teh second version, there's no balancing involved,
you can easily switch from case to case because

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.480
you don't ahve to balance it.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.811
It could be slightly stronger (than version
1) and that's kind of on factor / reason that

00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:18.950
I built it.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.319
It's not susceptible to wind but the downside
is that it only pivots about 180 degrees.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:34.470
So, for most applications, that would be enough
but if you need to do over 180 degrees, you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.739
might want to build this first version.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.379
I'll put a link to the first version build
up here.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.550
Ok, let's start showing you how to build this...

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.069
The key to the whole self-leveling mount is
this miniature rotary damper.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.099
Thsi is a dual direction rotary damper built
by ACE Controls.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.290
I got it from McMaster-Carr.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.650
It's about $11 dollars for this tiny little
thing, amazingly, but that's the only place

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.639
that I could find these.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.040
It's pretty tiny but that's the heart of the
whole system.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:23.099
The part number from McMaster Carr is 6597K8
and I'll put a link in the description.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.059
So, this is the part that's the key.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:34.000
It's resists the torque and only lets it spin
smoothly.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.790
So that is the key to the whole thing.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.689
The frame is pretty rudimentary here.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:46.989
It's made out of 1/8th inch thick aluminum
and it's 1 1/4" wide.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.390
This is roughly 4 1/2" long but you might
want to alter that for your situation.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:01.999
The ears on here I was worried are kind of
flimsy so I built this mount to sandwich it

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.500
between two pieces of aluminum.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.589
So you can see that this slides through like
this and then that bolts together and sandwiches

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:10.589
it.

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.959
Ok, so I've got this bolted together.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.549
that just sandwiches the rotary damper in
there.

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.269
Just some small bolts.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.810
I did want to point out that it's important
to get this specific damper.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.620
If you get one smaller or larger, the torque
rating will be different and the camera either

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.060
won't be able to swing because the torque
is to high or it will will just be to small

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.830
and it will be floppy and fragile.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.479
Ok, so I've got it mounted in there.

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.939
I wanted to make this as simple as possible
so I just took a long GoPro arm, and it just

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.790
kind of slides on the shaft.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:58.410
The shaft is keyed on one side so that keeps
the arm from spinning on the shaft.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.900
So that's the basic motion of the mount.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.110
It's just a smooth ark.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.639
You can see I has to remove some material
down here so that it would clear this nut.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.150
So you just put it on and I've got a bolt
and a nut and you just tighten it up and that

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.330
keeps it on there.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.660
Ok, now I've got it bolted on there.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.180
You can see that it's still not real secure
on there.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:34.400
So, I wanted to try to make this a bulletproof
so I bent up a piece of sheet metal and it

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.560
just through bolts with some long screws,
all the way through it.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.210
And, that just keeps the arm from flexing
out and comeing off the shaft.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:54.110
I thought about making something that could
securely clamp onto the shaft but I wanted

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.270
to make this something that other people could
make easily so that's why I chose to go this

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.280
direction.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.510
So this just threadis in here and threads
through.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.050
So I've got the piece of sheet metal mounted
on there.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.960
It's just real rudimentary as you can tell.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.610
just through bolted and then snug some nuts
up there and that just keeps the arm from

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:21.870
coming off and it doesn't really provide and
friction so it still pivots real easily.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:29.139
Obviously the GoPro camera cases just slide
on like normal and you can see, it doesn't

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.190
have the camera in there but it's still doing
it's function.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.460
I mount to alot of metal objects so I use
magnet bases.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:47.000
You can get these at Harbor Frieght or Hobby
Lobby.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.150
Just through bolt them like that.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.789
And here I've got it back together with the
magnets mounted.

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.120
You need these spacers.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.740
These are just nuts over the bolts but you
need the spacers so that the camera, when

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:08.419
it's moutned on here, the side of the camera
will clear whatever object you're mounting

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:09.580
it to.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.439
So I'm mounting to alot of metal stuff like
I said but you might want to mount this to

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:16.439
different objects.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:23.979
You could put U-clamps on here or just mount
it to alot of different things, so use your

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:25.349
imagination.

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:27.169
You know this doesn't look that great.

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:32.699
The way I fabricate these mounts is that I
start with an idea and I just kidn of go out

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.479
in the shop and just mess around.

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:40.560
I don't have alot of highend tools oro anything
so that's why it's not machined perfectly.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.370
But that's how the first versions of these
start out for me.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.069
Anyway, I hope that helps.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:49.800
Thanks for watching and make sure and let
me know if you have questions on this.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.620
I'd be glad to help!
