she likes to use trendy or trashing
weeks to realize that this legally we're

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.089
gonna be talking about one of my
personal favorite son as pixie cuts

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.719
before we go to the success of the
pictures that we have we have some great

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.639
ones

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.499
uh... we have tabulated the votes from
the comments and many many things

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.210
degenerated allot of comments

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.609
almost universally they were negative so

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:20.560
unfortunate

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.179
deering photo of conan o'brien that we
have been as nineteen c is going to have

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.679
to be the first inductee

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.570
into the hall ashamed

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.779
and that's not

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.390
seventeenth string cooking

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.940
so are we got side boob we've got making
snow

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.160
dixie cups where's again end up with a
seat

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.579
uh... let's go over the phone before
showing photos

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.390
uh... i was looking for a lot of photos

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.879
a lot of these are going to be
celebrities because it's apparently

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.850
become very common for female set-aside
ocular yep that's one reason they were

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.460
talking about and also because i was
like that so

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.570
series c natalie portman

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.650
just the normal pixie cut not super
super short on time that's going on here

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.580
stand that then you can see your facial
structure i think that that's going to

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.850
be kind of a common thing it was the
next

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.760
significant bargained for

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.150
yet but should actually

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.320
so some of these photos that aren't
celebrities are coming from last summer

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.890
the cultural care cody's were girls

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.470
post pictures

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.230
exactly

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.970
and so that the goal here

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.250
is a post pictures resting at the
haircut is they want support what they

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.990
want to know don't stupidly put feeling
she certainly does look good to hear

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.370
more about anything wherever he have
then when fortunate so we have that one

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.580
so here you see olympia

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.380
rubin i think in a men's she was in
juneau from juneau yet all of our

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.520
friends you know i didn't know that if
you come back i'd like to what he said

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.299
he actually that photo

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.220
interpreting it yes yes yes

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.830
like and you know she thought twenty
four simple but she looks like okay yet

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.119
but i guess i am

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.390
i didn't realize until i saw these
photos while searching for them like

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.640
orleans to link that you know girl and
named the short there seems to me that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.130
doesn't really i mean it's really
getting with one more for action

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.030
thriller

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.960
yessss you how shall i still feel like i
like there's a little bit longer on top

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.230
but still bearish or on the sides

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.770
uh... and it certainly seems to
superseded yet i think one thing that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.800
you have to do that our if you want to
have this haircut but still the feminine

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.959
is you kind of then have to wear a lot
of make up a lot of times are leaving

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:15.560
soon

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.800
outlook on life like there are some in
clothing and jewelry or something like

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.870
that again

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.199
'cause i mean i'll

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.689
elaborate on that out

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.790
like nl files using intervention maddox
makan come across as kind of like a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.879
million began

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.669
c_a_c_ another one from that sublet it
but she had just gotten the haircut is

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.259
our first i'm going out

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.409
however up but you can't see it in

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.319
it's a little bit died there but

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.729
i think it's it's there had been even
compare directly to the other girl is a

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.589
much more traditional haircut then

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.809
uh... was axed

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:49.879
are high separate clarinet

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.999
until i die the picture of the kitchen
and

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:54.699
pat

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.189
if she'd like she's like to have any
questions like

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.089
uh... yet is the picture for worse is
like doing something of the oven or

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.390
whatever and there's just something
about that photo anyway

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.489
let's go to the yeltsin

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.540
are just great

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.540
she looks amazing it totally suits her
facial structure and she

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.210
looks better with the pixie cabin with
have been sent to no longer hair i've

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.350
had these heated discussions of my
friend james online about it because he

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.690
thinks it's looks much better just the
regular longer but i think wig if you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.050
have a fairly delicate facial structure
like your years have to be fairly like

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.960
small

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.639
and i have read that your face can be
very long

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.739
if you look really good so what do you
think overall do you think that it

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.100
should spread like more growth should
consider it

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.280
i think i think it's all a common for
people collect all will be your look

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.819
hotter with longer hair

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.939
but i think i'm seeing more and more
women getting these haircuts and i think

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.219
they look great a lot of other actually
i don't think i've seen on the desktop

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.599
for you know responded and and and so
when you look like

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.989
hamburger it's a little interest in our
back anything about it as a female

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.589
is that because i have times just wanna
top up my hair off

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:03.109
but then there are no long-haired i do
have relied america that are thinking

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.659
about that it's like you don't really
know your own head shape until you don't

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.120
have any hair on it

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.410
and that could look awful and then it's
gonna take along her is to grow back so

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.239
it's just

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.019
it's just scary and i think that's why i
won the nobel the efforts here when i

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.049
was beginning to arm i was really
interesting line and so i'd like a row

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.419
but like if i didn't end up liking
active traded anytime it's a little

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.979
averages instantly growing again yasir
in two weeks of something

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.979
so tired lately i've always been into
integrals trainer short because it's

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.560
something different late want there's
going to let you people there

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.610
i would like myself that i have
certainly i think that's not the one

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.139
that i left the acts like a not to worry
about style you know from where the

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.070
motorcycle helmet doesn't mess up too
much l maybe if we are growing you're

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.350
considering that they be destroyed
progressively shorter nancy if you write

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.560
in every morning

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.659
magazine like you know a tryout like
uh... like excellently for a few lines

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.909
enduring unsettling because

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.960
you know it just like yourself into it
and how did something like that i i

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.180
don't have anything sophisticates trashy
technically that same as there was some

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.360
like it exactly so let us know in the
comments do you think the pc cuts

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.310
generally a good or bad and we will put
it on

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.379
the hall of fame

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.979
or the hall of shame
