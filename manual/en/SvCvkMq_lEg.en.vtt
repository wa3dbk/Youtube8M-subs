00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.180
Today on our 2001 Ford Explorer well be installing
the Timbering Suspension Enhancement System

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.430
part number TGMFK10.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:16.090
First, well need to go ahead and raise the
vehicle and remove the manufacturer bump stop.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.080
To do this well remove the nut off the top
of the bump stop stud.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.250
First, well go ahead and spray down the fastener
with some spray lubricant.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.920
This will assist us in removing it because
over time its gonna build up rust, dust, dirt,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.030
and debris.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.510
Quick tech tip, it may be necessary to go
ahead and put a block of wood in between the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.550
axel and the bump stop so that it holds it
in position.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.989
Youll notice theres a small nipple in the
top of the bump stop that goes into the frame

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.270
to stop it from spinning.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.050
Now well go ahead and put our block of wood
in place and were ready to go ahead and start

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.340
removing the fastener.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.010
Now, with the fastener removed well go ahead
and remove the block of wood and our bump

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.930
stop and here you can see the nipple that
protrudes into the frame.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.729
Were ready to install the new Ion rubber spring.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:21.619
Before we put 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:52.950
it 
in place lets go 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:12.640
ahead and assemble it.
