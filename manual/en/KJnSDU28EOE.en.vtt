Hi there,  everybody!

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 it has been a long time since I posted a video on YouTube

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.359
 but I've received so many comments and I  
 thanks you   all  which posted them

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:17.678
 and I was wondering what to do today

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.251
 and as it is  Spring outside, and 
 the temperatures are starting to raise up

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.040
 I wondered why not to do something really cool?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.040
 So, let's try and do some ice cream today

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.790
 ingredientss for the banana ice cream

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:41.013
 you can choose any fruit you like

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.539
 in case of bananas, you will need 400 g of them.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 180 g of sugar

00:00:55.658 --> 00:01:00.658
 350 ml   of a milk and cream mixture

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.550
  process  the bananas in a food processor

00:01:13.027 --> 00:01:22.027
 and the other ingredients to the mixture

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.040
 transfer the mixture to the ice cream maker

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:58.160
 depending on the ice cream maker model, the process of making ice cream may 
 take longer,   in this  video  it took 45 minutes

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.640
30 -40 minutes later

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.960
 take the ice cream out of the ice cream 
 maker and place it in a proper container

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 store the ice cream at   minimum temperature of -14Â°C  and 
 for no more than two weeks, because it  will lose its taste.

00:02:58.376 --> 00:03:08.380
 take it out of the freezer from 10 to 15 minutes before serving

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.560
 the above ice creams  are :  
  strawberry, banana  and  Mango Flavoured

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:50.800

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.480
