00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:08.639
\f0\fs24 \cf0 Heart disease is a collection
of gradually increasing symptoms that affect

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.650
the heart\'d5s ability to pump blood through
the body. Perhaps one of the first symptoms

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.910
that can show up is high cholesterol. Usually
the next thing to show up is high blood pressure.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.079
This can then lead to a condition known as
atherosclerosis, which is basically referred

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.509
to in lay terms as \'d2blocked arteries.\'d3
The next step for most people is sometimes

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.860
angina, or pain in the chest, and if left
untreated, that can lead to thickening of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.570
the heart walls that we refer to as \'d2congestive
heart failure,\'d3 and eventually it can lead

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.760
to heart attack and even death.\
\

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.149
The conventional medical approach to managing
heart disease is to attempt to control each

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.640
individual symptom with a different medication.
So they\'d5ll try to control the high cholesterol

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.579
with a cholesterol-lowering drug; they\'d5ll
try to control the blood pressure with one

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.430
or more blood pressure-controlling drugs,
and so on. In those cases, they can be valuable

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.490
tools for the short term. But long-term, for
case management, they produce side effects

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.820
and they don\'d5t address the root causes
of the condition.\

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.130
\
When patients come to see me, I always start

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.909
with a thorough history that looks at their
diet and lifestyle factors: heart disease

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.500
is one hundred percent related to diet and
lifestyle and so if they have this, I need

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.170
to know what factors are going on in each
patient\'d5s history so I can help teach them

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.210
how to reverse those. Next, I\'d5m going to
order basic blood work where I need to look

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.230
at things like lipid panel, but also some
things that are often missed, like homocysteine

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.079
levels and C-reactive protein levels, because
those factors are actually some of the things

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.500
that actually cause vascular inflammation.
I\'d5ll then also order electrocardiograms

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.940
to look at the electrical conductivity of
the heart, usually a Doppler echocardiogram

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.180
to look at the cardiac output, is it pumping
blood efficiently?, and sometimes a CT scan

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.239
to see if they have calcium deposits in the
coronary arteries.\

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.039
\
I\'d5ll always base my treatments on test

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.310
results. For example, if someone has high
levels of homocysteine, which is a normal

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.610
metabolic waste product and can actually damage
the blood vessel linings, the treatment involves

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.860
high levels of vitamins B6, B12, folic acid,
and an amino acid called glycine. If the patient

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.489
is consuming a lot of dairy products such
as milk or cheese, and those products happen

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.450
to be pasteurized, one of the risk factors
is an enzyme in cow\'d5s milk, known as xanthine

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.019
oxidase, will be broken up into fragments
which the body absorbs into the bloodstream,

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.730
and those xanthine oxidase fragments actually
cause inflammation and damage to the lining

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.260
of the blood vessels. That, in turn, causes
the elevated cholesterol and the other symptoms

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.200
we see in heart disease. So it would be very
important for those patients to give up their

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.590
dairy products completely.\
\

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.020
If a patient is presenting with angina, or
chest pain, one of the problems is either

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.690
a blockage or a constriction of the blood
vessels supplying the heart with blood, which

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.709
are called the coronary arteries. The main
form of treatment I use is the amino acid

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.489
arginine, which stimulates the body to produce
its own natural nitric oxide, which can help

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.650
dilate the blood vessels and stimulate the
healing of the blood vessels. In every case

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.430
of patients with heart disease, I always prescribe
a nutritional plan consisting of organic,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.659
whole foods and no processed foods. I will
supplement essential vitamins and minerals.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.780
In every case, I\'d5m always prescribing some
form of appropriate exercise program and stress-reduction

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.019
plan. And I always am using the herbs hawthorn
berry and gingko biloba\'d1the hawthorn will

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.930
help nourish the heart, and the gingko biloba
increases the fine circulation in the body.\

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.190
\
Patients who follow my treatment protocol

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.099
have had great success. Their high blood pressure
is lower, their high cholesterol is lower,

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.400
their angina goes away, their atherosclerosis
is reversed, and within a year, most of them

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.360
are off all prescription medications. If someone
would like to prevent or reverse heart disease,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.460
I recommend they adopt a natural living lifestyle
that includes whole foods, no processed foods,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.530
essential nutrient supplementation, and exercise.
I would also recommend they seek out a qualified

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.040
naturopathic doctor who can help them manage
the more serious aspects of this condition.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.410
