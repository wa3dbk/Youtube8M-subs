Hi, I'm Candi Cane Canncel with Expert Village.
I'm going to go ahead and change my zigzag

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:25.900
foot to a zipper foot, then I'm ready to stitch.
I'm actually going to start a little further

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.300
down so that way we make sure that the zipper
head is out of our way and we are going to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.440
come back and finish that up at the end. I
take my pins out and then just go ahead and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.260
stitch. As I stitch I just make sure that
the corner of the zipper foot is actually

00:00:44.260 --> 00:01:26.080
lined up with the center seam. Just pull the
pins off as I go. When you get to the end

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.369
where's the stopping point make sure that
the needle is in all the way down on the fabric

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:39.439
lift up your foot and you are just going to
turn your fabric come across the teeth. At

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.100
any point the zipper (the needle) isn't going
through the zipper you can just manually move

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.290
it. Once you come across turn the fabric back
around and you are just going to come right

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:07.840
back up. What I like to do is actually stretch
out the fabric as I'm sewing so that I know

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:22.180
it's not going to bunch up and I'll really
get a clean zipper. After that we are ready

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.340
to finish up our zipper.
