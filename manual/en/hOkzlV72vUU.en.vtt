00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.735
&gt;&gt; Houston Station
on Space to Ground.

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.036
&gt;&gt; [Background Music]
Welcome to Space to Ground,

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:05.604
your weekly look at
what's happening aboard the

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.073 line:92%
International Space Station.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.441 line:92%
I'm Josh Byerly.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.810
A lot of eyes, both on
the ground and in space,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.778
were watching out
for Comet Ison.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.346
The station crew got
the chance to see it

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:17.450
on November 23rd before it
began its swing around the sun,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.151 line:92%
eventually disintegrating.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.687
If you'd like to take a look at
this photo or any of the others

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:26.525
that the crew has taken onboard,
just log on to nasa.gov/station.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:27.626 line:92%
Just in time for the holidays,

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.562
the crew is getting
loaded up with cargo.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.331
A Russian vehicle arrived last
week with almost three tons

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.733
of supplies and on
December 17th,

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.003
Orbital Sciences will launch
its Cygnus cargo vehicle.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.639
It will arrive at the
station on December 20th.

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:42.408
Onboard are crew
supplies as well

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.376
as several hundred
pounds of science.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:45.678
There will be thousands
of students

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.947
across the country
also flying experiments

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.350
that study everything from
ameba reproduction to calcium

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.553 line:92%
in the bones to salamanders.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.288
In station science, the
crew worked this week

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:58.224 line:92%
on a capillary flow experiment.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.659
If you've ever used a paper
towel to mop up water,

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.728
you've seen capillary
flow in action.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:06.065
In space, it's a little harder
to control fluids such as fuel,

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.967
so the purpose of this
experiment is to look

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.636
at how capillary flow
works up there and to use

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.271
that to design better
spacecraft.

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.507
It can also be used
down here on earth

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.643
to understand how ground water
moves and also in certain types

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.044 line:92%
of electronics cooling.

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:21.947
How you ever wondered exactly
how the crews weigh themselves

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.315 line:92%
in space?

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.885
You can't exactly step on a
scale since there's no gravity.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.455
Well as it turns out, they slam
themselves against the wall.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.123
It's a device called
Slam D [phonetic]

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.992
and it uses Newton's
laws of physics

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:36.295
to accelerate the crew toward
the wall using a known force.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:40.232
From that, the crews weight can
be tracked to the half pound.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.268
Make sure you look up in the
sky over the next few days.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:45.271
Even though the sun may have
won the battle with Comet Ison,

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.673
the space station still
looks pretty spectacular.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.308
To find out if you can
spot it in the sky,

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:52.678
just go to
spotthestation.nasa.gov.

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:55.681
We also encourage you to send
us your comments and questions.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.150
Use the hashtag spacetoground
to talk to us.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.785
If there's something you
have always wanted to know

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.121
about the station, we'll
see if we can answer it.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.489 line:92%
We'll see you next week.
