00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.620
Cremation or burial are the two possibilities offered to dismiss the funeral the body

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.640
However Burials and cremations cause a significant environmental impact.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.980
The idea of green burials is not new

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.620
and several years practiced

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.240
especially in countries like UK, USA or Canada.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.440
ecological coffins made from recycled cardboard, bamboo and rattan

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.700
avoid cutting down millions of trees each year.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.960
There are also alternatives to cremation that do not release toxic gases like resomación

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.400
in which the bodies are dissolved in a hot mixture of water and caustic soda

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.000
or promesión that using liquid nitrogen and vibrations

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.820
transforma al difunto en un polvo aprovechable como abono para plantas

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.340
Many farmers have chosen to make compost with the corpses of their animals resulting satisfactory

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.120
The stage, which lasts less than a month, transforming the corpses of animals into compost

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.720
and it is respectful of the environment.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.020
but if the result was positive in animals,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.600
Why not try it in people?

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:24.262
FUNERAL - ORGANIC FERTILIZER WITH CORPSES

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.620
A Spade a US Katrina 37, graduated in anthropology and architecture

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.820
who has been been working on another greener and cleaner form of funeral rite for the environment years

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.980
It came up with the idea of designing a composting system

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.860
to convert the corpses into fertilizer

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.880
in order to use it in parks around the country.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.840
The project, called Urban Death Project, is a three-story tower height

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.340
with a three-story structure centralde works great as a composter

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.480
where the body wrapped in a shroud is placed together with a mixture of wood chips and sawdust

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.000
Upstairs it performed the ceremony with the deceased

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.520
Family and friends give their last goodbye to their loved one in an ecological way

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.700
connecting them with the natural cycles of life.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.600
after the corpse is placed in the larger middle floor of the building

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.900
with a spiral ramp, where the compost material layers between 1.8 and 3.6 meters

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.640
separated for a total of 30 bodies are incorporated as will removing the compost,.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:08.000
What Mother Nature would take 20 years to decompose, microbial activity and aerobic decomposition,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.640
plus the added moisture and nitrogen

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.660
The bodies become compost over a period of four to six weeks

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.520
The Temperature reached about 60 degrees, killed by the intense heat to common pathogens

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.640
so they should not shake odors

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.860
In a second stage, the material is screened with the remaining bones and cured compost

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.280
a material becoming a product of the decomposition of organic waste

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.600
usually used as fertilizer.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.420
part of this credit will be given to families and the rest will be used

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.520
for parks or conservation land across the country.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.380
the price of human compost process will amount to about $ 2500

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.740
cheaper than traditional burials because of its simplicity.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.180
There is still much to discuss with the medical community and the health department

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.880
A concern as incineration, is heavy metal pollution

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.720
as dental fillings they would have to be removed from the bodies.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:38.440
there are many detractors and defenders of the project, some believe that goes against the cultural and religious norms,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.820
others argue that some diseases can survive the composting process

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.560
while for others it is the best natural and ecological way to live forever

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.340
However, Spade advances towards the project.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:05.160
overcoming legal difficulties and raising funds to design and construct the first prototype facilities

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.940
In late 2014 Urban Project Death

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.980
He received a grant of $ 80,000 fund for the environment Echoing Grenn.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:24.300
Ironically, the man, the most intelligent being on earth

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.340
that is as incapable of taking care of their own planet

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.580
Will one day be part of the natural source of his own life.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:21.800
