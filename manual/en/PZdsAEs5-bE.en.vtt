00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.410
Protecting your car is a very important, yet
difficult, task to take on.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.210
Considering all of the money you put into
a vehicle, it's common sense that you would

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.140
want to maintain its appearance with a shiny,
scratch-free paint job, but there are numerous

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.970
outside elements that will consistently make
it hard for you to do that.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.640
From road debris and bird poop, to insect
splatters and ultraviolet light, these harsh

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.829
environmental factors will strike at any given
time, and eventually, you will begin to notice

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.340
that dazzling new car look start to disappear.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:47.470
So why not prevent the nicks, dings, scratches
and color fading with paint protection film?

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.050
As the pioneer in paint protection film, 3M
clear bras started to pave the way decades

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.320
ago for vehicle owners to find an effective
way of avoiding the extensive wear and tear

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.620
that the finish on cars are exposed to every
day.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.319
Other companies, like XPEL clear bra, have
since followed suit and now there are several

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.240
brands of invisible films to choose from.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.330
However, they aren't all manufactured with
the same quality in mind, so how will you

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.369
know which is the best option for your car?

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.539
There are a few things you might want to consider.

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.229
Yellowing
Even though a major plus of having a paint

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.310
protection film installed on your car is that
it is designed to be invisible, some customers

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.729
have noticed their clear bra yellowing or
staining over time, which takes away from

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.920
the vehicle's glossy surface.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.420
Yellowing may depend on the color of the car
or the way the film has been maintained, but

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.719
either way, if you're going to spend the money
on a clear bra, you will want to research

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.259
which seem to have upheld their invisibility
the best.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.709
Self-Healing
XPEL clear bra declares itself to be the world's

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.929
only self-healing film, which means it has
been constructed with polymers designated

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.759
to eliminate superficial scratches and swirl
marks that can appear on the film.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.459
Generally, it only takes a short period of
time to "heal" itself depending on the severity

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.319
of the mark and the temperature surrounding
your car.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.560
Many people prefer a protection film with
self-healing properties so as not to have

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.200
any visible blemishes even if they aren't
actually on the paint itself.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.560
Cracking
Despite the excellent shield that paint protection

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.090
films provide against the damaging effects
ultraviolet rays have on a car, lower quality

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.519
clear bras don't have the same defense for
themselves.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.959
That's when customers will notice cracking
in their films, leaving those areas of the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.040
vehicle no longer protected.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.079
Be careful when choosing a clear bra that
you look for one guaranteeing to be resistant

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.939
to cracking.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.050
Warranty
The warranty of your paint protection film

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.319
is another important consideration.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.880
Most are backed by a reasonable assurance
of coverage in the event of any defects, such

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.200
as the five and 10-year warranties offered
by 3M clear bra and the XPEL Ultimate film.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.220
Read up on the various warranty inclusions
to make sure you're given ample coverage.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.570
It doesn't matter if you drive a practical
family car or a rare luxury vehicle, it's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.680
always an awful feeling when you get that
first chip in the paint of your brand new

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.959
car, but you won't have to go through that
again if you rely on the professional installers

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.349
at Ghost Shield Film to protect your treasured
investment with a 3M or XPEL clear bra.
