00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.410
In what truly epitomized the title of his
TV show, "My Cat From Hell," feline behaviorist

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.059
Jackson Galaxy is calling his attempt to tame
the Portland cat notorious for attacking a

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.040
baby and boxing his panicked owners into a
bedroom "the hardest case I have ever worked."

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.550
It got more difficult after the happy ending
for the cat named Lux soon unraveled.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.180
In the reality show that aired last weekend,
Galaxy persuades another Portland couple to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.949
take Lux while the cat is treated with antidepressants
and anti-seizure medication.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.960
A veterinarian diagnosed Lux with feline hyper-esthesia
syndrome, which can trigger violent behavior.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.340
But after the episode's taping, Lux attacked
his new guardians and they gave him up for

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.340
their own safety.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.390
"It was the worst letdown," Galaxy told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.760
"I don't think I've ever had a bigger shock.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.090
This is the hardest case I have ever worked."

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.850
But take heart, Lux supporters.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.690
The 4-year-old cat has become Galaxy's buddy,
and the reality star says he hasn't given

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.690
up.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.920
He's placed Lux in a veterinary clinic where
the cat receives medication while undergoing

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.220
treatment to try to identify what turns this
feline Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.299
Lux became one of the most notorious cats
in pet history after his owner called 911

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.100
on March 9 as the cat terrorized his family.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.230
Lee Palmer told dispatchers Lux had scratched
his son's head and was out of control.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.079
The family barricaded themselves in a bedroom,
and Lux could be heard screeching menacingly

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.590
in the background.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.009
Galaxy set up a series of meetings with Lux
and his owners, who did not return messages

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.259
seeking comment.

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.299
The episode shown Saturday demonstrated the
difficulty in solving the puzzle that is Lux.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.000
In their first encounter, Galaxy walks into
a bedroom where the cat's fearful owners have

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.479
sequestered him.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.980
Galaxy sees Lux peeking out from behind a
box.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.930
The cat's eyes are dilated, a sign of distress.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.430
He growls.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.130
After making eye contact at the cat's level
and offering treats, Galaxy is able to pick

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.090
up Lux and put him on his lap.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.060
The cat returns Galaxy's affection as the
tattooed TV host pets him.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.890
"I do not see a vicious cat," Galaxy says.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.740
"I do not see a killer."

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.240
In the show, Galaxy temporarily puts Lux in
the care of another couple to see whether

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.830
the cat would be violent in a different home.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.820
Lux attacked one of its new owners.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.610
A Portland veterinarian suggests Lux be medicated,
and the new owners agree to take Lux back.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.570
At first, it went well.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.670
But after the show wrapped, the couple called
Galaxy to say the cat had several violent

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.670
episodes.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.480
Galaxy said the cat was a danger to them and
he understands why they couldn't keep him.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.220
Despite the outbursts, everyone seems to fall
for Lux, a long-haired cat with a sweet face.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.290
That's the case for Galaxy, who has dealt
with thousands of difficult cats.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.500
"I fell in love with him the second I met
him," Galaxy said.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.690
"He's the sweetest boy in the world."

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.890
The reality star has made saving Lux from
euthanasia his personal crusade.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.060
The cat is at a clinic — Galaxy won't divulge
the location — where specialists are trying

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.000
to better understand the complicated feline.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.420
Galaxy works with them on treatment, and it's
going well so far.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.410
The medication is starting to work.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.750
Staff members at the clinic put Lux in different
social situations to see how he responds.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.620
Galaxy hopes they can modify Lux's behavior
so the cat can someday find a home.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.910
"I'm going to keep working with this cat,"
Galaxy said.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.410
"I've got to be sure I give him the best shot."
