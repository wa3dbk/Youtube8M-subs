00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.480
I wish I could become kind

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.140
I wish I could become strong

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.440
I wish I could be fun to be around

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.320
But none of that really matters...

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.240
I want to go somewhere far away

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.040
I want to just disappear like this

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.920
A world that doesn't let me be happy

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.680
I hate it so

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.140
Ah...

Translation: Amesubs

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.420
Today, someone jumps down again

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.380
Today, someone smiles again

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.400
Today, someone stabs another again

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.600
And someone cries again

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.680
Morning

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.820
And night

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.620
Today

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.740
and tomorrow

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.680
just repeat over and over

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.660
'til I'm sick of it all

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.860
And like that, I run away

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.340
From everything

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.340
It's amazing how I can smile through all of this

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.160
I've long forgotten

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.840
how to love myself

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.100
You're always, always

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.980
happily smiling like that

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.120
And so I sway and sway

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.900
from side to side

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.980
between "like" and "hate"

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.680
Again today, the world continues to be cruel

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.480
and again, someone's crying

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.620
You see, it's not a kind place

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.620
but even so,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.780
once I see your face,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.700
I can't tell anymore

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.160
Even if I told you "I like you" yesterday

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.240
When I wake up the next day, everything's changed

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.000
To forget everything and smile,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.480
that's the only way to live in this world

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.720
Painting

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.540
over lies

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.420
with more lies

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.440
I can't even

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.220
tell

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.020
the truth from the lies

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520
I'm sure you don't know,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.300
that today

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.440
I couldn't sleep again...

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.880
But as long as your days

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.180
are even a little bit fun

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.800
Wouldn't someone please

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.740
teach me how to love this world?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.820
You're always, even today,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.640
happily smiling like that

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.880
And so, even these

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.820
trashy days

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.720
feel something special

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.320
So why is it that we still

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.400
soon loose things and get hurt

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.280
We're still, still

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.440
unable to become kind

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.540
and again,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.660
we make someone cry

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.100
When we are born,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.080
we cry and sob loudly

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.960
and for the rest of our lives

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.700
we've lived our days in tears

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.120
I'm sure that even in the future

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.400
we'll cry everyday in the same way

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.340
And so, at the very least, I want you

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.400
to laugh,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.760
just a bit more...

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.500
I wish I could become kind

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.220
I wish I could become strong

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.280
None of that really matters,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.300
you're fine as you are now

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.220
Today, someone laughs again

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.740
and in their shadow, another cries

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.740
Even so, you have to keep laughing,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.320
or else, I'll be sad...

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.220
You're always, always

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.940
happily smiling like that

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.100
And so, even these

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.240
trashy days

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.040
feel like something special

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.540
Again today, the world continues to be cruel

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.420
and again, someone cries

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.540
You see, it's not a kind place

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.660
but still,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.940
your smiling face saves me

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.100
yet again...

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:56.720
