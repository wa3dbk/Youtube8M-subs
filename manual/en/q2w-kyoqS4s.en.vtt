Hello YouTube. Today for this video I thought I would do a wee quick unboxing

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.790
I really normally don't do unboxings. But as a wee quick search

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.799
on Youtube confirmed this isn't actual on yet, so it's the HP Chromebook 14

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.300
q031ea. So we will take a wee look at it and wee what is inside the box

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.820
Ok, so we will go ahead and open this box up. I have it already

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.460
have it pre opened up anyway. As I say it's my sisters so she had it opened anyway

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.660
So as you can see inside. It's packaged brave and well

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.590
HP seemed to have done a good job. A bit of polystyrene or what ever

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.800
So we will go ahead and see what's in

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.890
the side pocket here. We'll just pull all this out

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.140
and take a look and see. What's in it. Nothing else in there. That's just your power leads

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.580
and that is your main power adapter that goes into the laptop

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.770
That is the only thing that is that side. And then,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.270
that is just setup instructions.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.460
If you fancy looking at that, and.. seems to be

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.820
some literature. And some different books

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.170
if you fancy taking a quick read. And then the main thing itself

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.140
is the laptop. So as you can see is

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.220
packaged up brave and well.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.259
It's not gonna really get damaged to much

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.500
you just simply pull them off and dispose of them as you so want

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.020
And, that is the Chromebook itself. We got it in this turquoise colour

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.790
as I said it is for my sister so

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.710
she got it for doing coursework at college and what ever else

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.970
so that is just a bit of polystyrene. So that is the Chromebook

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.670
it's self.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.180
As you can see. There is very little to it so

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.649
it is actual quiet a nice nifty wee thing. I will be doing a review on this

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.989
as I say we only got this at Christmas time, so I am really

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.350
only getting to do a video on it now. But I will

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.380
after a couple of days playing about with it. And what ever else I will

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.840
stick a quick wee video up. Just thought I would do a quick unboxing to see

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.900
what you think but overall it seems a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.290
a brave and nice Chromebook. Until the next time

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.370
thanks for watching
