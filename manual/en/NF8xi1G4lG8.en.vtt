How we doing everybody, welcome back to FairgroundsTV
I'm your host Peter Moeller.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.450
Today we have something that none of you have
probably heard of.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.789
A long time ago, you heard me talk about a
gentleman named Mike Kochanski and his girlfriend

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.550
slash fiancee, Sara Stefans.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.780
They've been brewing beer.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.100
And now they have a little operation they
like to call Left Lane Brewing.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:36.640
Which, somewhere on the screen I'll show you
the, um, I wanted to say icon, their logo!

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.180
It's right over here.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.290
Anyway, they brewed this a long time ago,
sitting in my fridge, I promised him I would

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.640
do a tasting, I fell a little behind.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.390
So we have a honey lemon ale.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.340
Let's give it a check out.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.360
In my trusty new Belgian glass.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.420
Beautiful color, nice tight carbonation, if
you can see that.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.010
I don't know if it's just because it's so
gnarly hot out here, but it's just got a slight

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.030
haze to it, but it's got some nice carbonation.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.250
Not much head, but its homebrew, people!

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.560
Let's give it a sniff.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.149
*sniffs*
Oh wooooow.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.280
*sniffs*
I wish I had smelled this a long time ago,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
I'd be asking for some.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.229
I'm getting, I'm getting that slight hint
of honey, actually a nice amount of honey

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.619
but this nice citrus maybe like an orange-lemon
peel behind that.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.720
Hence the honey-lemon maybe?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.819
But I'm also getting the hop.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:43.700
And I know Mike loves the hop, so let's see
what he did with this one.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.729
*sips*
That's fantastic.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.270
That honey's cutting the, cutting the hops
a little bit.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.840
And I'm not a massive fan of hops.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.770
But usually when it gets on the back of my
tongue it's all sticky, I can't stand it this

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.340
is kind of like sitting mid-to-front of my
tongue.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.920
That sweetness is very subtle but the lemon
and it's almost turning into like this orangey

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.420
flavor from possibly melding with the honey.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.580
It is awesome.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.480
If you could buy this somewhere I'd tell you
to go get some, even if it wasn't at my store!

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.670
Everybody pray that Mike will start his brewery
and we can go visit him and his hopefully

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.890
summer seasonal or all the time will be his
Honey Lemon Ale.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.130
And we can go drink as much as we want.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.460
Good job Mike and Sara.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.420
Cheers!
