00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.859
Okay, now we are to the final step, which
is checking for errors. And lo and behold,

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.990
I did one for you! Not really on purpose,
but I was stitching the pocket on, and I did

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.391
not have my straps all pulled and out of the
way. So, it went straight through there, all

00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.480
the way through the strap, all the way through
both sets of material. So what I do is go

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.802
ahead and strip, this is our time to correct
any mistakes we made, so we're going to go

00:00:26.802 --> 00:00:35.690
ahead and fix it. I need to take the stitches
back out in that area, free the strap. Now

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.880
I have a gap that would be a hole straight
through my pocket right here, and that's never

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.239
a good thing, you don't want a hole in your
pocket, money goes fast enough without. So

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.301
what I'm going to do is go ahead and restitch
that back in, make sure I know where I'm at,

00:00:53.301 --> 00:01:01.659
and you want to make sure you do your backstitch
to lock it in place, and just right back through.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.780
And I will tell you that I have been stitching
for years and I still make mistakes, and I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.490
still have to pull stitches. It's part of
sewing, it's probably the worst part of sewing,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.689
but it's kind of a fact like life, sometimes
you've got to fix what you mess up. So I went

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.810
ahead and fixed that, now all we would need
to do is trim strings. If you leave a raw

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.170
edge, you're going to have to expect that
you are going to get longer strings that come

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.840
off. And that's not a big deal, if that's
the style you're going for. You want to make

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.590
sure your straps are all secure in, none of
them are coming out. If, when you tug on them,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.890
any of them feels loose, make sure that you
do another stitch over here, just reinforce

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.610
that stitch. And other than that, the apron
is done and you are ready to use it for whatever

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.170
you want to use it for. We use ours for cooking
in the kitchen or doing crafts, or we have

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.460
one at Grandma's house that matches. She has
one for her and one for the grandkids, so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.979
they wear them whenever they go over to Grandma's
house. They're hanging on the wall as decoration

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.460
until the kids come, and then they can always
look forward to having their apron to wear

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.609
with Grandma. So that is how you make an apron!
