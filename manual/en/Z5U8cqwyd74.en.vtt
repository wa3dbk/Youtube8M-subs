00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.660
My name is Janet Varney

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.040
and I am the Avatar

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.040
Well, I mean I... I'm the voice of Korra on
a show called 'The Legend of Korra' and she's

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.180
the Avatar, technically...

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.020
I'm not saying *I'm* the Avatar

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.590
[Commands: WATER!]

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.109
I know that I'm not the avatar.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.879
I know that I'm not the avatar....

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.730
So, I just want to take a minute to tell you
about a movie that I'm going to be doing that...

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.280
actually doesn't involve me using any of my
bending skills...

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.440
No airbending in this one!

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.440
[Janet makes adorable whooshing sound effects
herself]

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.480
Not that I... Because I don't have airbending
powers.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.449
That is Korra. Not, not me.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.350
[More adorable whooshing sounds from Kor-
...Janet]

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.320
[Commands: FIREBALL!!]

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.310
[Struggles]

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.280
[Commands: Fire!!]

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.110
I, Janet, am in touch with reality.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.070
Naga... go!

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.040
Naga, go!

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.020
[coughs]

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.320
So... the project that I'm doing is a movie
called....

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.680
Diani and Devine meet The Apocalypse

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.939
And my dear, dear friends Gabe and Etta have
started a Kickstarter campaign

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.040
And if you check it out, you will see that
there are a bunch of Korra-related incentives

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.880
that you can get including... I dunno, a signed
picture of me, Korra...

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.380
[Grunts]

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.360
How about an exclusive Skype one-on-one conversation
with me, Korra...

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.560
[Wails as she spins around, bless her]

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.590
Or you can get a copy of the movie when it's
finished.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.700
Featuring me, Korra.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.369
Featuring me, Janet.
Featuring me, Janet.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.590
Janet's in the movie...

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.570
Anyway... definitely check out the Kickstarter
campaign, send all your Korra-loving friends

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.900
there, and give!

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.390
If you can.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.430
If you can't, no big deal. What's the worst
that can happen?

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.199
I mean, I could stop maintaining balance in
the world, throwing everything in to terrible,

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.820
terrible chaos... you know, but... maybe you're
willing to take the chance...

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.190
Or, just give a little bit.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.780
Or, chaos.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.370
Or, give.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.829
Or, total distruction of the world as we know
it.

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:38.109
No pressure!

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.749
[Woosh, only this time in slow motion, like
she really means it]
