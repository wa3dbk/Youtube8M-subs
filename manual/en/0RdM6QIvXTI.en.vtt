Episode 3:
Sister Juana's Dream

00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:37.765
What is that?

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:39.568
– Get in, Sister Juana,

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.891
I need to speak to you.

00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:43.948
– Right away, God.

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:55.825
– What’s up, God?

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:57.938
– What is all this about excommunication?

00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.841
– Excommunication?

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:01.540
– Do you not know?

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.083
– No, I know.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.736
I just thought that you already knew too.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.673
You see, I heard the Pope say:

00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:14.451
“women who abort shall be excommunicated from the Church”

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:16.910
and I didn’t understand a thing.

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:19.371
– “Excommunication” means that the Pope

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:23.786
wants to expel these women from the Church for having terminated their pregnancies.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.978
– Ah... 

00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:30.476
and why do these women want to terminate their pregnancies?

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.731
– For different reasons...

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.470
because their lives or health are at risk,

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:37.685
because they were raped,

00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:39.775
or because they do not want to bring someone into the world

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:42.085
if they are unable to offer a life with dignity.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.483
– It will always be a difficult decision

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:48.965
but they are exercising their freedom of conscience.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.413
I don’t think these women have bad intentions.

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.305
– But the Pope does

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.255
and he wants to punish them 
by expelling them from the Church.

00:01:57.423 --> 00:02:00.941
– How is it possible that the Pope expels people 

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:03.436
if not even I want to do so?

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:06.611
(The Pope, the Pope, ra, ra, ra)

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.511
Get up everyone, today the Pope is coming.

00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:19.225
A la bio, a la bao, a la bim, bom, ba,
the Pope, the Pope, ra, ra, ra.

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:25.580
God, I hope that you are still there,
I have a few more things to tell you.

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:28.213
To be continued...
