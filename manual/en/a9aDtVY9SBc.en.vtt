00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.689
Hello I'm Bruce Zimmerman Host of the Open Line Garden Show and Certified

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.909
Horticulturalist for Rittenhouse.ca. Today we're going to take a look

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.699
at the Codling Moth Trap.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.949
Now Codling Moth goes after apples, pears, walnuts and quince.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.779
You have to get them out very early in the Spring.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.419
Preferably  before leaf break but absolutely before the pink flower buds

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.799
stage.

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:36.469
Now you have to put them out one to two feet in from the tips of the branches. You'll

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.260
need two to four traps per tree.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.750
And if you have a large cluster of trees you may also want to ring them as well.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.420
The traps are good for a month.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.680
They should be replaced each and every month

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.320
through the growing season.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.890
Now Codling Moth has multiple generations that means you could have

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.950
two to six generations

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.060
per season depending on the length of the season.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.500
They cause premature drop

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.190
that means the fruit drops long before it's ever ripe. That fruit must be

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.190
picked up within one to two days and disposed of

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.020
to keep it from

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350
regenerating.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.250
Now the moths come along and it traps only the males.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.240
The females will then lay unfertilized eggs and you'll break the cycle. They

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.820
won't hatch and you won't have Coddling Moth.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.880
If you're looking for the Codling Moth

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.320
they're going to be three-eighths of an inch long,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.700
they're brown, they have a bronze tip. They will come along,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.090
they will lay a single egg at the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.649
end of the fruit.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.810
And it will hatch. The larva will crawl into the calyx end or the bottom

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.920
end of the fruit.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.659
And

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.659
then it'll eat up through the fruit and deposit all its waste, its frass, at the end.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.319
So you will know there's just nice little pile of you know what ya that's what it 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.260
looks like

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.670
at the end of the fruit. You'll know the fruit is ruined 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.420
so dispose of it.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.340
Now once it hatches out of there

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.290
it will pupate in a silky mass. So if you see them in a protected area on

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.799
the tree scrape them off. Dispose of them, get rid of them.

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.059
