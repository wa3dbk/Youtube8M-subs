Knowing the language makes
navigating through cancer land a
lot easier. It also helps us

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:10.142
feel more in control of our
destinies because we can make
better decisions when we can

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:17.383
understand the lingo. Today Dr.
Erba and Dr. Johnson will
discuss grade and stage. Two

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.022
words that take on a new meaning
after a cancer diagnosis and
greatly influence both the

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.326
course of treatment and
prognosis. We'll also look at
how our individual biology

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:33.299
influences both the cancer and
approach to treatment. What
happens in cancer is that there

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:38.037
is breakdown in that
organization such that the
relationship between cells to

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:46.212
one another is lost. Part of
that relationship requires an
organizational closeness. During

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:53.152
the cancer process, it's
advantageous to the cancer cell
for its own long term survival

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:01.393
to depart from that organization
and start to spread to other
places. Staging is the process

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.832
the clinician does with the
patient. Once that diagnosis is
made, we want to know where in

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:15.241
the body that tumor is for a
number of reasons. One is to
tell what type of therapy the

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:21.580
patient should receive. For
example if it is an early stage,
or low stage and localized to an

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:26.051
organ, it can often be cured
with surgery or radiation
therapy alone or as a

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:31.657
combination as opposed to a more
advanced stage where the disease
has already spread and you have

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.728
to think about more systemic
therapies....treatments that go
everywhere in the body to take

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:42.768
care of the disease. And so a
clinician will do a staging
evaluation to come up with a

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:50.276
prognosis and the best therapy.
The tests that are done in that
staging evaluation depends on

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:59.618
that clinicians knowledge of
what that tumor normally does.
For example...if we had a scan

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:04.557
of toenails, we're not going to
do a scan of toenails in a
person with lung cancer because

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:10.196
we know lung cancer doesn't go
to toenails. So, histologic
grade ...the grading is the

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:18.337
description of the microscopic
appearance of the cells. It is
informative to the clinician in

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:31.150
that it depicts the degree of
abnormality of the cells. When
you assign a high histologic

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:43.929
grade to a cell, it implicitly
informs the clinician, that this
is a tumor with tendency to an

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:55.341
aggressive clinical course. Now
ideally, that information is
also going to be conveyed in the

00:02:55.408 --> 00:03:02.681
context of stage which Dr. Erba
described earlier which is the
clinical evaluation of the

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:15.427
extent to which the tumor has
spread from its primary site of
origin. So, high grade does not

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:21.066
mean high stage. And high stage
does not mean high grade. It
just conveys some of the

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:25.904
biological properties. So when
you see the grade you'll say
this is likely to be an

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:35.180
aggressive tumor. And there's a
system by which numbers are
assigned to give a description

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:42.388
of how aggressive histologicly
microscopically the tumor cells
look. One thing for people to

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:49.595
understand is that cancer is not
always the same..it isn't the
same in different people. It's

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:57.870
not one disease. These cancers
of different organs behave very
differently and have different

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:05.711
underlying events genetic
changes that lead to them. But
moreover, we are learning that

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:11.550
even when we see something under
the microscope and we say, "A
Ha! That's breast cancer or

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:19.792
that's prostate cancer or lung
cancer....that there can be
differences between the genetics

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.331
of that cancer in different
people. And that's what we're
investigating right now. And

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:31.503
what we are finding in a variety
of malignancies is how
heterogeneous these cancers are.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.077
That brings up the challenge and
the hope for the future. By
getting these samples from our

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:45.651
patients, and evaluating these
genetic changes typically done
in pathology labs and nuclear

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:53.759
diagnostic labs, we are going to
learn about the biology of the
disease. And hopefully in the

00:04:53.826 --> 00:05:01.834
future, be able to have better
drugs that can interfere with
the cancer process. That process

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:10.142
might be very different from one
person to another with the same
disease under the microscope. So

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:21.787
it's quite a challenge and
underscores the need for people
with cancer allowing the biopsy

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:28.060
to be taken for research
purposes . We can study the
heterogeneity of the tumor which

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:32.327
will lead to better treatment
therapies than what we have
today.
