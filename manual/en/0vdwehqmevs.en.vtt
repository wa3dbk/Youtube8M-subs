00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.330
Today we're making healthy hash browns

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.640
so we need to buy potatoes and carrots.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.380
Let's start with the potatoes

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.330
these are Russet potatoes they're great

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.880
all-purpose potato usually on sale

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.040
always nutritious always available and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.019
just a really good staple to have around.

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.269
We can either buy potatoes individually,

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.540
or we can buy them in a bag. Individually

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.329
these potatoes cost 99 cents a pound, in

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.199
a bag they cost $1.88 for five pounds. So

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.690
if we think about comparing 99 cents a

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.409
pound

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.329
for five pounds of individual potatoes that

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.820
would be five dollars. Where it's a

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.339
dollar eighty eight for a five-pound bag. So

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.350
comparing the two, clearly these are a

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.479
lot more expensive. Now you have to make

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.710
sure that you're actually going to use

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.570
five pounds of potatoes to make it a

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.280
good deal but we're going to use the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.830
potatoes in loaded potato soup and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.930
in healthy hash browns and just a good

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.640
thing to have in your refrigerator so

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.960
we're going to go with the five-pound

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.420
bag of potatoes for a dollar eighty eight. Let's go

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.630
look at the carrots.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.060
Looking at the carrots we can see that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.610
we have two choices we can buy regular

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.350
carrots in a two pound package for a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.869
dollar sixty-nine. Or we can buy a packed by a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.299
one-pound bag of baby carrots for a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.850
dollar forty four. Clearly this is a much better

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.539
choice,

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.579
it's about half the price. Two pounds for

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.920
a dollar sixty-nine vs 1 pound for a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.000
dollar forty four.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.640
So what are baby carrots anyway? Baby

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.619
carrots are just regular carrots like

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.450
these that have been ground down into

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.060
smaller pieces. For healthy hashbrowns

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.130
the recipe we're making we really want

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.599
big carrots anyway because we want to

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.119
chop them up into smaller pieces so

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.990
we're going to go with these today.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.259
Let's go put this together. Today we're

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.909
making healthy hash browns and I really

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.130
love this recipe it's one of my husband's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.080
favorite recipes also so I make this for

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.369
breakfast a lot and serve it with

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.539
scrambled eggs.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.840
Ok so first we need to do is one

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.450
tablespoon of vegetable oil,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.150
we're going to add that to a large

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.860
skillet,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.980
set that aside i'm going to turn the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.260
heat on start heating up the oil. Turned

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.270
up to medium heat and just let that heat

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.710
up while we're continuing on with our

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.940
other ingredients.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.070
Ok then we need four baked potatoes and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.720
these have been previously baked using

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.640
the best baked potato method which you

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.400
can see on another extension video so

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.740
I've already cut up three of them going

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.930
to cut up the fourth, just chop it up to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:05.870
regular pieces.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.890
Ok,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.960
we're going to add that to our Bowl we

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.209
have four potatoes total then we need

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.010
one medium carrot which we've already

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.830
peeled and already partially cut up just

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:32.050
going to finish cutting it up here. We

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.760
want to cut it up in really small pieces

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.680
because the potatoes are already cooked

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.650
but the carrot is not the carrots very

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.660
hard vegetables we want to cut it up

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.310
into very small pieces so that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.340
everything's done about the same time.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:53.320
Ok so to that we're going to add about 1

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.190
cup or 1 onion 1 cup of onion, coarsely

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.920
chopped.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:13.750
Two cloves of garlic minced then we need

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.239
a half teaspoon of salt

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.570
we're going to measure this before we

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.769
put it in with the other ingredients so

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.450
that if we spill it,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.000
we don't get too much. And a fourth

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.010
teaspoon of ground black pepper.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.620
Okay we're gonna mix that all together

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.740
and hopefully our oil is hot now looks

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.960
like it's getting hot so then you're

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.650
going to pour this into the pan i can

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.630
hear it sizzling sizzling a little bit

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.710
so we know its hot. Spread it out we're

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.760
going to let that cook for about 5

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.590
minutes on medium heat and then we'll

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.850
come back and take a look.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.400
It's been about five minutes and these

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.510
look perfect

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.389
this skillet was a little crowded you

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.560
have a little bit bigger skillet like

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.210
maybe a 12-inch skillet might have been

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.979
a little better but this work just fine.

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.770
We left the potatoes alone for about

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.630
five minutes then flip them over and

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.010
they got really crispy on the bottom

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.510
which is what we wanted.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.789
Ok so we ready to serve our meal and

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.979
over here we've got roast pork and it's

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.140
nonfat milk, slice of whole wheat bread

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.419
and steamed broccoli. And we're going to

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.520
add our healthy hash browns.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.150
This is about two dollars and fifty

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.760
cents for five servings so about serving which

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.680
is a really cheap way to add some good

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.330
nutrition to your meal. Vitamin A and

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.060
vitamin C. I'm going to go eat this right

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.240
now.
