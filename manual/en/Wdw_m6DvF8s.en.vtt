00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.280
The following trailer is rated H for Honest

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.800
From the studio who sounds like they picked

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.760
three random words out of a hat

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.880
comes a franchise based on the books you never read,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.040
a sequel to the game you never played

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.040
and a follow-up to the game you heard was

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.400
really, really good and scrambled to finish before

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.600
this one came out.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.720
Come on, I know you did!

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.040
THE WITCHER 3 WILD HUNT

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.780
Journey to an overwhelmingly vast

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.260
and Polish land

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.980
where Gerald is Geralt,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.640
Jennifer is Yennefer

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.520
and the locals are covered in charming

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.420
Eastern European prison tattoos.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400
Become a witcher,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.360
which is confusingly different from being a witch

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.820
or a witch hunter

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.760
but is basically just a fancy orchardman

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.960
(Geralt) "...slayer in the largest city... looking for rat sh*t.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.660
Sheesh."

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.700
Thrill as you haggle with dirt poor villagers over

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
how much it will cost to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.520
save them from unspeakable horrors

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.060
then rob their crumbling shanties blind

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.360
once they've paid up.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.180
Ooh-hooh! Goat hide!

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.840
It's the second most dangerous

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.980
profession in the kingdom

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.580
right behind bouncer trying to keep you

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.820
from entering a building.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.700
(Bouncer) Cock a doodle do, what am I to do?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.420
Sh*t myself?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.140
(Geralt) All right!

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.640
(my bad, bro)

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.160
Take control of Geralt,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.860
a whirling dance of death while in combat

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860
and an impossible to control spaz

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.820
when you're trying to open a chest

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.800
or pick some flowers.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.840
(DAMMIT Geralt, just pick the Celandine)

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.640
Use his finely tuned Witcher Senses

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.240
to locate stuff you can

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.000
EASILY find with your normal senses, like:

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.400
blood stains,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.620
dead bodies

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.020
and shoes (really?)

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.100
Just check your mini-map, dude!

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340
Get ready for the Monster Hunter game

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.100
Capcom wishes they made

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100
as you take down griffins,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.020
trolls

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.900
and wraiths in epic fun-to-play battles

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.120
after hours of tedious potion, oil and spell preparation

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.220
that's as fun as making

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.880
lightsaber noises at a spreadsheet

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.160
(Lightsaber noises at a spreadsheet)

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.480
Set out on an epic quest to save Ciri,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.640
a princess who's always in another castle,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760
full of tough moral choices that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.540
will result in innocent deaths

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.500
NO MATTER which option you pick!

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500
Like Game of Thrones if it were a

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.880
"choose your own adventure" book

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.880
then completely ignore the main quest

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.040
as you take on more pressing matters like:

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.880
escorting a goat,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.160
snowball fighting

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
and helping an old woman find her missing...

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.660
pan! (What?)

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.140
(Old Woman) "Found the pan, have ya?"

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.960
Dammit, I'm a Witcher, not a panner!

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960
STOP WASTING MY TIME!!!

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.180
But it will all be worth it when you finally take on

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.680
the Swedish death metal album art known

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.920
as the Wild Hunt

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.420
in an ending so final in its endingness,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.420
gamers will unanimously agree

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420
that's totally how the game ends!

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.240
Yeah, uh, we haven't beaten it either!

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.900
(Eskel) "Sommon the b*tches"

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.860
Role-play as man who's not just a freak,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.620
but also a SUPER freak,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.000
(Rick James - Super Freak)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.900
as the latest installment of this x-rated dating sim.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.240
doesn't disappoint, full of:

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.460
boobs,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.460
Boobs,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.720
BOOBS

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.460
and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.600
dangly old water hag boobs.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.280
KILL IT! KILL WITH IGNI!

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.560
The developer heard you liked games

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.300
so they put a game in your game

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300
so you can game while you game

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.260
with Gwent:

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.260
a card game featuring images of characters

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.180
from the game you are currently playing

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.660
outside of that card game.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.800
GAMECEPTION!

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.160
(Inception OST)

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.820
So dive into a franchise whose biggest flaw

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.280
is having to quit your job or drop out of school

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.560
to experience it all,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.240
from the beard-growing physics,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240
to the beautifully rendered areolas,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.560
to the stunning vistas that will

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.440
absolutely take your breath -

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.380
Oh no! I haven't saved in like FOUR HOURS!

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.460
Starring:

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.520
The Guy with Two Swords 3: Helen Hunt

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.820
Anyone else noticed that Roach is basically

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.800
a teleporting demon horse?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.480
(Chills and creepes)
