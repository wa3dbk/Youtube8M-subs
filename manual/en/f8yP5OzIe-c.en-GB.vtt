00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.760
Take command of your fleet and set out to unite the galaxy in Sid Meier's Starships.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:16.660
Starships is an adventure driven strategy game which combines episodic missions, resource management, tactical combat, exploration and spaceship design

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.480
Travel to new worlds and complete missions on planets across the galaxy.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.900
Set in the universe of Beyond Earth, after the age of the seeding, players can take on the roll of fleet commander, 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.840
Leading their starships across the galaxy, while making important decisions managing and building the worlds under their control.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:43.720
In this video, we'll introduce you to some of the systems to Sid Meier's Starships, and how you can master them to achieve your vision of a unified galaxy.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.140
Use Energy to build new ships and modules.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.000
Build your ships to fill any tactical role, from powerfully armoured battle cruises, bristling with short ranged cannons, to fast laser arm destroyers

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.360
or add fighter base, turning your ships into powerful carriers. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.300
Your federation scientists can research upgrades to your starship modules, 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.880
you can also win a science victory by unlocking three level 6 technologies.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.780
Use Metals to contruct planetary improvements, increasing the yields of that world.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.860
Or they can build unique Wonders that grants powerful bonuses to your fleet. 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.260
Build seven Wonders and win a wonder victory.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.580
Use Food to start new cities on planets. 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.340
As the population of the world increases, not only do you come closer to winning the population victory of 51% of the galaxy, 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.580
but each world is capable of producing more resources for your federation. 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.400
At the heart of the game are the missions that your fleet will undertake.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.680
Combat missions are turn based, each turn your ships move and take an action:

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.860
Firing weapons, launching fighters or torpedos, cloaking, or sweeping with your sensors.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.000
Narrow passages open in these asteroid fields, allowing ships and fighters to pass. 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.360
Take advantage of them, but be aware that the enemy will also do so. 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.080
Your ships will have a number of hit point and are knocked out when these drop below zero. 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.540
Critical hits affect some modules' effectiveness, leaving your ship vulnerable, leaving you with a choice to make:

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.020
either use an action to repair these critical hits or use that action to fire on an unsuspecting target.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.660
Keep in mind that you can repair your starships with energy in between missions but not during. 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.480
There are also battle cards, which can provide you with bonuses in combat. 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.320
Some battle cards affect single ship on one turn, while rare and powerful ones benefit the entire fleet for a whole mission. 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.640
Don't overlook these as they make a difference between defeat and glorious victory.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.100
While your crew are dedicated, long missions can take their toll.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.000
As your crew becomes fatigued, the performance of your ships also decreases.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.640
A fatigued crew of a powerful fleet, can be wiped out by an enemy that they would easily defeat if rested.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.700
At some point in your turn, you will need to decide if your crew needs a rest and shore leave. 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.780
As you complete missions and special tasks for worlds, you gain influence. 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.580
Sending your crew on shore leave will increase your influence in that world by one at the start of your next turn. 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.300
When you gain four influence points with the planet, they will join your federation.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.080
Other factions may also try to recruit the same world to join them. You see competing influences here. 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.680
Winning a game of Starships will require more than tactical success in combat. You'll also need a plan for victory.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.200
Consider how to use the features of your world in combination with improvements. 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.540
For example, this icy world produces extra science. Building the cryptolab here will be more effective than building it on another world.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.960
Plan for your victory type. If you have a small federation with powerful neighbours, 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.540
you will be able to win through a science victory.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.660
If you have a large number of worlds, try for a population victory. 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.780
There is an entire galaxy out there, waiting for you and your fleet to defeat threats and bring a glorious new age to humanity 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.500
In Sid Meier's Starships.
