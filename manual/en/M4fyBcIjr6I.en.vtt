00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.950
Swing to dinner with your 8 person swing table,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.080
After you break out your vintage baseball
glove leather wallet.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.940
Because it's episode 38 of LÃœT.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.369
Start your day using some perfectly shaved
soap courtesy of the soap shaver.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.800
And guys look your best thanks to the ABC's
of Men's Fashion book.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.529
Maybe you could add this portable pocket hoodie
that attaches to any shirt to complete your

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.999
fresh look.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.439
But if a hoodie isn't enough to protect you
from the elements you could wear a lion...

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.550
ski mask.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.489
Which will winterize your face while you ride
on this gas-powered snowboard.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.840
It holds up to 250 pounds and tops out at
18 mph.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.370
For something a little less adventurous and
a lot more little fly the world's smallest

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.620
quadcopter.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.510
The Proto X is less than 2 by 2 inches and
weighs four tenths of an ounce.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.410
You could always blow up your arm with this
inflatable mini gun arm.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.150
After that you'll want to take a few laps
while you nap in your pool...bed.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.270
And gaze at your glorious candelier made up
of 15,000 hand strung acrylic gummy bears.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.520
Or look at your Sparkbeats phone case that
lights up using the flash from your phone's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520
camera.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.730
So you have enough light to read K is for
Knifeball.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.250
An alphabet of terrible advice book including
"D is for drifter", "G is for grandma", and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.530
"A is for apple."

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.830
Eat one every day and wash it down with your
Mom's cabernet.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.820
Break the rules and cheat with this apron
cooking guide that helps with cooking times,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.420
how to properly cook steaks, and even a spaghetti
measuring guide.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.160
Luckily you have a leaning tower of pasta
to keep that in.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.860
And a squirrel nut grinder that is a grate
little rodent.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.860
Equally great is this condiment gun that you
might want to use to add some flavor to your...

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.900
Bizarre food dot com.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.390
A cool website where you can buy all kinds
of weird foods from giant bug chili dipping

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.980
paste to Chinese yellow scorpion candy lollipops
which you'll wash down with some giant centipede

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.980
whiskey to wash it down

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.650
That can carry in this shot flask that has
a shot glass built-in.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.829
To add some fizz to that whiskey get a portable
water carbonator that turns still water into

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.069
a bubbly delight in less than three minutes.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.400
But if that's too much work just steal someone
else's drink with Wave.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.900
A toy that transfers liquids using the physics
of a syphon.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.030
If your drinks too warm use the spin chill
to cool it down.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.709
Simply attach it to the top of your container,
place it in ice, and spin.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.799
Check your mail when you see this webmail
notifier light up and hopefully get a nicer

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.620
message than you'll find in these Misfortune
Cookies.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.090
Don't listen to the cookies listen like an
audiophile using Meze headphones.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.739
They're handcrafted out of ebony wood to reproduce
a warm natural sound.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.530
Whether with the earbuds or these headphones
featuring a fancy ergonomic headband.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.709
Really cute Robot Cleaner from Japan.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.689
For something cute and squishy for your sweetheart
get squishables.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.290
The adorable squishable creatures feature
custom designs you can vote on to produce

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.140
the next squishy hedgehog or comfort food
toast.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.079
Then get comfy with this blanket featuring
built-in speakers to listen to love songs

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.109
as you cuddle up in your tranquility pod.

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.440
The memory foam waterbed has 50 LEDs that
synchronize with your heart beat and it only

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.260
costs 30 thousand dollars.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.230
If that's too extravagant keep warm with these
love gloves because you're probably smitten...

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.079
Finally, make sure to save up for full scale
Space shuttle orbiter replica that costs 3.5

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.590
MILLION dollars.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.400
And as always... thanks for watching
