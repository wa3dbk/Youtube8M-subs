I am Chitrotpola Mukherjee, speaking on behalf
of Expert Village. I am from India. I would

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:20.660
like to show you the possibilities of making
designs in clay. Clay is a very malleable

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:33.120
material to work with. You can use clay to
make abstract sculpture or you can make realistic

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:43.950
reproductions. You can play around with it
and come up with your own imaginative design.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:54.550
I have a few pieces here today, which show
a variety of design and shows the flexibility

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:09.869
of clay. Here we have a fish. This piece started
as a plate. The artist folded the plate, cut

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:22.450
out bits
and pieces to create the tail, pressed and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:32.469
molded the body and scratched out a design
and then glazed the work. This is an abstract

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:54.420
piece. It started as a simple ceramic bottle
with glaze and on-glaze, but the artist was

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:13.489
creative when it came

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:29.209
to the lid. The artist has taken the liberty
of adding extensions to the round lid, applying

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:47.940
raised designs and color, thus creating an
entirely individual piece of sculpture. Basically,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:03:06.250
there is no limit to the
number of designs you can do with clay. Do

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.180
what pleases you. I hope that some of you
will take up clay sculpture. Thank you.
