00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:02.560
- Hey, guys.
So today we're going

00:00:02.584 --> 00:00:06.059
to talk about bone tissue
and cartilage tissue.

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:09.852
Hopefully this visual
is totally familiar to you,

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.226
because we've been here,
done that.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.477
And we already know
that we've dealt

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:15.975
with connective tissue proper.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.976
You know that connective tissue
is a tissue made up of cells,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.185
found within a matrix
of ground substance and fibers.

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:27.768
We talked about all the,
like,

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:31.268
normal kinds
of connective tissue.

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:35.268
And today we're going to deal
with our structural types

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:37.185
of connective tissue.

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:40.976
We have two main kinds
of structural connective tissue,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.477
and that would be bone
and cartilage tissue.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.975
And we're going to look
at all the different subsets

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.685
of bone and cartilage tissue.

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:50.976
We're going to talk about how it
forms, how it grows.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.602
We'll do a little bit
of lab preview,

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:57.852
and look at some of
the histology.

00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:04.935
But we're focusing today not
on bone organs, or, like,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.477
the bones that you
think of in your brain

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:09.560
when you hear the word bone.

00:01:09.584 --> 00:01:11.935
Instead we're going
to focus on the tissue itself.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:17.810
Now, bone organs are definitely
made of bone tissue,

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:20.810
but bone organs also
have other tissues in them.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:22.935
In the next
lecture we're going to spend

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.393
the whole time talking
about bone organs,

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:27.477
and how those things
actually work.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.560
Now, we have one more
kind of connective tissue

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:32.185
before we've completed
our full survey

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.727
of connective tissue land,

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:38.226
and that would be our fluid
connective tissue, blood.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.975
Blood is bloody fun.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.685
However, we're not going
to do that until we get

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.935
to the cardiovascular system.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.975
By the end of the semester
you will have studied

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.351
all of these types
of connective tissue.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:53.435
You will be a connective
tissue expert.

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.435
Today we're adding
in a big piece

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.185
of your connective
tissue picture.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.976
All right.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.709
Let's get started looking
at cartilage connective tissue.
