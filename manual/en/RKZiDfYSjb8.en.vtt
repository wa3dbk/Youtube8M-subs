00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How does the team face next Sunday’s decisive fixture?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We are terribly excited and looking forward to it. We know it’s a key game for us. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We’re playing at home, where we know we’re stronger with our fans’ support.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
With everything that’s at stake, obtaining the three points in a key match such as Sunday’s would be an important step.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What’s the team feeling since you know you’re four points away from the title?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We’re there on our own merits and because of the work we’ve done since the preseason. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We’re thrilled to finish the season as near to the top as possible. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It’s what we want and we have to play match-by-match the three remaining ones.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How do you focus on the match-by-match being so close to the Champions final?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is something our coach instilled in us when he arrived two and a half years ago. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We know what we want. We’ve always done it and it’s always gone well for us, and now more than ever since each game is a final due to all that is at stake.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Therefore, I believe it’s logical to focus on facing each game as if it were the last.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
How do you expect the atmosphere to be during the last fixture of the season at the Calderón?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We know it’s going to be spectacular. People are super-thrilled watching their team doing things right and knowing that it can lead to a very good season with a happy ending for everyone. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They’re going to be 200% with us, more than ever. It’s very important for us that they are fully supportive from minute 1 until the end of the match.
