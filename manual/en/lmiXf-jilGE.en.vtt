00:00:01.743 --> 00:00:03.461
- [Voiceover] So we know
that when a cerebral artery

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:05.272
gets blocked the brain tissue

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:09.070
that that vessel serves
can die off pretty quickly.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.135
The neurons die off without the oxygen

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:13.167
that they get from their
blood supply, right?

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.734
And that's what a stroke is.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.139
Well, it turns out that what we see

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.659
is this interesting
pattern in brain tissue

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.574
that's undergoing a stroke.

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:22.304
Essentially, we see two different

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:24.336
almost zones of injury.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.565
There's the zone closest to the artery

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:29.863
that's been blocked off
called the ischemic core.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.119
And there's a zone sort
of on the periphery

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.238
of the core, called the ischemic penumbra,

00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:38.872
which is ischemic, but still
viable cerebral tissue.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.205
And before I explain these two areas

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.829
lets draw it on the other brain here.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.746
So notice that this here

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:46.534
is the left hand side of the brain.

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:48.531
Here is the right hand side.

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:50.320
And we're actually looking at this brain

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.072
from a left hand view.

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:53.883
So that works out nicely.

00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:56.437
So on this view what we'd
see is something like this,

00:00:56.437 --> 00:00:59.537
so we'd see the ischemic core here.

00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:01.708
And the distribution of
the middle cerebral artery

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:03.578
because that's what's been blocked.

00:01:03.578 --> 00:01:05.789
And then we'd see the ischemic penumbra

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:09.123
just sort of surrounding
the ischemic core.

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:11.429
So lets talk about the core first.

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:13.167
So in this core zone,

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:15.104
when there's severe ischemia.

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:16.175
Which is defined as

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.781
blood flow of about 20% less than normal.

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:21.109
You get this massive loss

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.210
of two vital nutrients for our neurons

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.905
and their supportive cells.

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:27.738
So you get this loss
of oxygen and glucose.

00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:30.640
Because they use up what's
in the area already.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.405
And then they're not getting replenished

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.135
because there's no more blood flow.

00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:36.320
So what will ultimately happen

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.872
is that the severe ischemia
will cause these neurons

00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:41.507
and their supportive cells to die off.

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:43.435
Which is also called necrosis.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.571
And this actually happens in only minutes.

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.974
It only takes a few minutes

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:48.543
for the core neurons to die off.

00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:50.238
So what about the penumbra?

00:01:50.238 --> 00:01:51.830
Remember I said there
are two different zones?

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.744
The penumbra is this almost rim

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:55.706
of moderately ischemic tissue

00:01:55.706 --> 00:01:58.336
that lies outside the
core zone between the core

00:01:58.361 --> 00:02:01.034
and the normally profuse brain tissue.

00:02:01.034 --> 00:02:02.779
The tissue in the penumbra

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.205
won't actually die right away.

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:05.297
Because what's happening,

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.293
remember I said it's
moderately profuse tissue.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.871
What's happening is that
it's getting some blood still

00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:13.710
from nearby arteries, referred
to as collateral arteries.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.674
You can imagine that oxygen is diffusing

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:19.240
out of these blood vessels and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.537
still serving neurons in
this ischemic penumbra.

00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:25.242
These white dots are my representation of

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.876
oxygen diffusing out of these
collateral blood vessels.

00:02:28.876 --> 00:02:32.371
So these penumbra neurons get some glucose

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:34.762
and oxygen from collateral arteries.

00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:36.841
But the catch is that
it won't last forever.

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.023
And in fact these neurons
in the penumbra region

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:40.405
will still die off

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:43.035
if blood flow isn't
reestablished pretty early on,

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.410
like within a few hours

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.001
of the vessel obstruction happening.

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:47.731
And that's because this
collateral circulation

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:49.588
still isn't enough to maintain the oxygen

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:52.270
and glucose needs of
these penumbra neurons

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.114
past a few hours.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.765
So just two more penumbra things

00:02:55.765 --> 00:02:57.170
I want to touch on here.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.467
So, first, the more collatoral
blood vessels you have

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.673
then the more penumbra neurons you have.

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:04.774
Which is a good thing because it means

00:03:04.774 --> 00:03:07.607
that neurons aren't
just outright dying off.

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:09.337
And of course those collateral arteries

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.206
have to not be blocked off as well.

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:13.133
So for example, in this drawing here

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:15.711
this penumbra is allowed to exist

00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:19.090
because this collateral
artery is still patent, open.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.273
And this collateral artery is still open.

00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:27.100
However, if the blockage
happened say down here

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.271
right before each artery comes off,

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:31.441
then, of course none of those arteries

00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:32.358
would have blood in them,

00:03:32.383 --> 00:03:36.228
so then this particular
penumbra wouldn't exist.

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:39.209
All of this would just be more dead core.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.336
Although, then there might be

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:41.740
some other collateral vessels

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.702
creating a different penumbra.

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:45.897
Like maybe this vessel and this vessel.

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:47.522
These would then be the
new collateral arteries

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:50.007
for that newly created ischemic core.

00:03:50.032 --> 00:03:53.330
So lets put that down here:
more collaterals equals

00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:58.016
more oxygen into neurons
at risk of ischemic death.

00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:59.736
The second thing is that the penumbra

00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:01.129
is the area where medications

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.103
are most likely to be effective.

00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:04.507
So what does that mean?

00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:06.806
One of the goals of treatment
is to break up that clot

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:09.836
and get blood back into
that ischemic area.

00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:11.087
You wanna get blood flowing

00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:13.203
into that ischemic area ASAP.

00:04:13.203 --> 00:04:14.666
What this'll do is effectively

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:16.605
rescue neurons in the penumbra.

00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:19.171
So me erasing this blue penumbra

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:21.377
is supposed to show them
now getting enough oxygen

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:22.689
and getting enough glucose

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.337
to function properly again.

00:04:24.337 --> 00:04:26.079
It's likely that the core neurons

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.971
will have died though, unfortunately.

00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:29.840
So just a quick recap now.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.036
If for whatever reason

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:33.906
blood flow stops to
some part of your brain.

00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:37.710
You develop an ischemic
core and ischemic penumbra.

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:39.500
Neurons in their supporting cells

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.829
that are in the ischemic core,

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:43.851
they'll die off within a few minutes.

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.909
And neurons and their supporting cells

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:47.906
in the ischemic penumbra,

00:04:47.906 --> 00:04:50.204
without treatment they'll
die off in a few hours.

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:52.114
So they stick around
for a little bit longer

00:04:52.114 --> 00:04:53.501
than the core because they get

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.286
some blood flow from collatoral ateries.
