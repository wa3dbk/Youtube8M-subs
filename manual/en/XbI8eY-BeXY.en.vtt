00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.520
The kidney is the body's filtration system

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:15.600
and produces urine in its thousands of nephrons - the kidney's basic unit.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.700
Each nephron begins with the Bowman's Capsule wrapped around a capillary ball - the glomerulus - 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.039
which becomes a tubule that eventually forms the Loop of Henle,

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.039
before collecting into tubules and ducts that empty into the bladder.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.360
Fluid from the blood enters the nephron
by filtration

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.390
and passes along it, where substances are added from the blood -

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.110
by secretion - or removed from it by re-absorption.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.370
Potassium and Hydrogen ions, organic acids and bases, metabolites and foreign substances

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.190
are secreted across a selective membrane.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.840
The Potassium and Hydrogen are exchanged with Sodium along the tubule

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.580
99% of the filtrate is reabsorbed through a mixture of passive diffusion - 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:20.240
down an osmotic or concentration gradient - and active transport, by pumping against a concentration gradient.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.140
The kidneys can conserve water.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.850
The only way that the body can move water is by moving Sodium Chloride first.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.130
You have to create a concentration gradient so that water can move by osmosis

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.350
in the direction of the highest concentration.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.470
The Loop of Henle creates a hyperosmotic region in the medulla of the kidney,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
acting as a sponge, drawing water out from the collecting ducts,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.430
if the duct becomes permeable under the influence of Vasopressin, also known as Antidiuretic Hormone, or ADH.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.140
The ascending limb of the loop of Henle - which is impermeable to water -

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.890
pumps out Sodium Chloride, via Sodium Potassium Chloride co-transporters,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.220
from the urine into the blood in the Vasa Recta.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.129
Blood in the Vasa Recta carries this Sodium Chloride into the medulla,

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.200
making the entire region hyperosmotic.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.480
The blood - which is moving in the opposite direction to the urine in the Loop of Henle -

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.060
then ascends parallel to the descending limb of the Loop of Henle.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.519
This descending limb is water-permeable

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.470
allowing water to move out of it into the Vasa Recta.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.130
This entry of water into the ascending Vasa Recta

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.470
reduces the osmotic potential of the blood to normal as it returns to the body.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.730
The interplay between the Loop of Henle and the Vasa Recta is called the Counter Current Multiplier.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.200
Essentially the medulla acts as a sponge,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.130
retaining and releasing water to address

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.420
the water requirements of the body.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.870
ADH acts on the collecting duct to make
it permeable to water,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.209
allowing water to move into the hyperosmotic medulla

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.099
where it is drawn up by the Vasa Recta and returned to the body.
