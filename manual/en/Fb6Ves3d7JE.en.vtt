00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.290
I don't know what to say really.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.160
Three minutes till the biggest battle of our
professional lives all comes down to today.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:25.760
Now either we heal as a team or were going
to crumble.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.210
Inch by inch, play by play, till were finished.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.850
We're in Hell right now gentleman, believe
me and we can stay here, get the shit kicked

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.640
out of us or we can fight our way back into
the light.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.899
We can climb out of Hell one inch at a time.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.280
Now I can't do it for you I'm too old.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.119
I look around, I see these young faces and
I think, I mean I made every wrong choice

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.800
a middle-aged man can make.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.990
I pissed away all my money believe it or not.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:31.330
I chased off anyone who's ever loved me and
lately I can't even stand the face I see in

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.850
the mirror.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.401
You know when you get old in life things get
taken from you I mean that's, that's, that's

00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:47.610
part of life, but you only learn that when
you start losing stuff.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.880
You find out life's this game of inches, so
is football because in either game, life or

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.420
football, the margin for error is so small.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.390
I mean one half a step too late or too early
and you don't quite make it.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.130
One half second too slow, too fast you don't
quite catch it.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.140
The inches we need are everywhere around us.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.610
They're in every break of the game, every
minute, every second.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.810
On this team we fight for that inch.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.070
On this team we tear ourselves and everyone
else around us to pieces for that inch.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:42.490
We claw with our finger nails for that inch
because we know when we add up all those inches,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.150
that's going to make the fucking difference
between winning and losing.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.080
Between living and dying.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.870
I'll tell you this, in any fight it's the
guy who's willing to die who's going to win

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.940
that inch.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.540
And I know if I'm going to have any life anymore
it's because I'm still willing to fight and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.190
die for that inch.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.569
Because that's what living is, the six inches
in front of your face.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.960
Now I can't make you do it.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.120
You got to look at the guy next to you, look
into his eyes.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.610
Now I think you're going to see a guy who
will go that inch with you.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.810
You're going to see a guy who will sacrifice
himself for this team because he knows when

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.560
it comes down to it you're going to do the
same for him.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:57.390
That's a team gentlemen and either we heal
now as a team or we will die as individuals.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.610
That's football guys.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.620
That's all it is.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:16.030
Now what are you going to do?
