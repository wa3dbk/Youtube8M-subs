Hi, my name is Darin on behalf of Expert Village.
I'm going to show you guys how to do the Melbourne

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.530
Shuffle. You're probably sitting here like,
Melbourne Shuffle? Where did that come from?

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.420
Right now, I am going to give you a brief
history on the Melbourne Shuffle. Shuffling

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:29.970
was actually the original name. It originated
in Australia. This dance came from a lot of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.489
clubs, raves, electronic festivals and such.
It's a

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:47.620
free form dance. It comes in steps of shuffling
your feet back and forth, front and back,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:58.210
trek walking in place, moving, doing the running
man. It comes in these little steps that you

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:06.070
can do that made the shuffle. They didn't
start calling it the Melbourne Shuffle until

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:15.780
the late 1990's, which was probably '98 or
something like that. A lot of out of towners

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.549
from the US or Malaysia called it the Melbourne
Shuffle, so Australia stuck with the name

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.090
the Melbourne Shuffle. They started calling
it the Melbourne Shuffle themselves and kept

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:40.520
that name. The name grew, the shuffle became
big and now you can see the shuffle playing

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.869
in all sorts of countries, states, provinces,
everything like that. The shuffle is pretty

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.420
big in the electronic scene. What we're going
to do is I'm going to show you how to break

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:57.990
it down in steps. First thing I'm going to
show you is the basic shuffle. Remember this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:08.391
is a free form dance style, if you have your
style, add it to it, or if you want to make

00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:10.000
something a little different instead of having
it be a cliche, make it different. It's all

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.090
about experimenting. That's what music is.
It makes us move, it moves our spirit and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:24.010
our body and it evolves us to dance to certain
beats and certain patterns of it. So the next

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.770
clip I'm going to show you guys the basic
steps on how to do the shuffle.
