00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
Sup gamers Xeivan here showing you how
to farm the MINAC for those retarded

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.629
collection Achievements without getting hit in the open from the Borderlands DLC

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.620
Claptraps New Robot Revolution. The
achievements I'm going to show you are

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.410
so realistic what a party the lubricator
and my nemesis bottle trap this video

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.960
starts here since the spot takes a
little finesse and you line up right

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.619
plus it's also after the fact that I've
taken out all the turrets on the in the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.439
knack itself otherwise nothing doesn't
work now pay attention the video is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.630
explained in detail so if you'll see
throughout this explain as you'll see

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.680
I'm not getting hit from media that SAPI
fights in women act I'll show you how

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.480
they do that just a moment here with
these achievements I mean it really suck

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.660
you drop rates really suck even more you
know some afterwards ransom numbers drop

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.480
rates on this I believe Pizza alone was
like one in 200 and that was after an

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.800
update so yeah I mean if you really want
to know the numbers you know you're on

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.219
the internet looking at this video
Google made this awesome tool called

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.750
Google so and just go look it up there
are ways to improve your chances have a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.990
full party helps a lot but since the
game is old and it takes a lot of time

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.000
you're most likely getting so long like
I think you can guess account power

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.090
level another character split screen
them and then just have them hide in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.350
unknown safe spots
if you have any class gear that gives

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.040
you better drop rates as well although
I've read pretty much anywhere that said

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.770
if they did not notice an increase and
drops so it's really your call on that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.250
the two most common methods
farming the Monaca is called patch afar

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.299
me which you even seen this whole time
we sit ions the not just roams around

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.270
and you just don't get hit and then the
Kamikaze robots from just come out of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
clothes that's happened the other one is
active farming this is when you actively

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.729
chase down the knack and you know shoot
down the Kamikaze robots as we spun out

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.390
the door you with high-power weapons and
damage and all that kind of stuff and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.430
you know fast kalos fast drops that kind
of stuff what you're gonna want to do is

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.210
not do just one or the other really
you're pretty much gonna do a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.810
combination of both
don't do just pass a farming due to the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.070
fact that
if you me your system on all night the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.730
drop rates will despawn and it makes
sense because the math normal look data

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.570
at one time you know similar to the
bullet holes and maybe first-person

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.710
shooters when she kill all those
disappear pointing I can personally

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.330
confirm is that the exploded junk from
the robot setup falling on top of the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.310
loot have to spawn that see it happen so
just watch out for that so that's why

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.570
you want to be both wanna stay for a
little bit you know come back collect

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.770
maybe kind of track down shoot it or
just come back and collect go back to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.730
doing it you know that kind of stuff
just make it so it's active and then

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.520
that your stuff that's going to be
swapped all right so now that you've

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.180
seen that I have sat here the whole time
without being hit although that you have

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.050
seen me you know my screen rumbles into
the back of the kamikazes will come out

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.230
or explode near me that's just the
rumbling I'm not getting hurt you're not

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.690
seeing it damaging looking you
whatsoever all right so you should

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.510
already know how to get to the next
pretty straightforward just you know

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.740
follow the quest line you'll especially
get through them here yet new boss what

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.880
you're doing you spawn in run over for
these rocks of the year and see the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.680
lines I'm a rock here basically what
you're gonna do is you're gonna stand in

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.160
between them try to get to about right
there and then stand here and they're

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.580
gonna be those point alerts if he's
ratcheted these lines you know the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.300
graphics line is similar to like the
halo two bouncing days if you don't know

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.410
what they able to some bouncing days
where I turn your neighbor coming now

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.300
but anyway switch interviewed you'd be
on the fine and then your anymore this

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.680
rock right there found that it's best to
stay low with your crosshair

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.580
as you can see not getting hit
be careful though because like I said it

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.130
takes a little finessing you're gonna
want to be on the backside here because

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.270
when it comes to this spot here he will
turn and sometimes will turn on to you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.740
the aware of problems I have come across
is my P is actually over in that

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.090
location in the far corner sometimes you
will hit you again but like I said

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.460
little finesse will practice not too
hard should be able to get it no problem

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.509
and that's it just how you passively
farm them and have the claptrap seen so

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.940
that way they mortals fun exploding
Sundra like seven three sixty so if it

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.940
works on a Playstation and the PC let me
know in the comments I'll update the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.080
video otherwise rate comment and don't
bother subscribing I don't find

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.160
underlies video so I hope this video it
was I helped you good luck on these

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.770
achievements I do a fucking sock and
that's left
