Hi! I'm Ed Dowling from eddowling.com. I'm
here to talk about tuning your dobro to standard

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.080
dobro tuning on behalf of expertvillage.com.
This is my dobro; it's a nice looking one.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.910
As soon as I played it I knew I wanted it.
I think it was made in Korea. I don't care.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:30.450
I had to raise the strings myself. I use a
brass tube instead of a steel. Dobros are

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.530
normally going to be played with a steel I
find them cumbersome and to no advantage in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:49.989
any way. Go for it if you want. The tuning
is G, B, D and G, B, D. Theses are sort of

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:58.820
like the notes of a major chord repeated twice,
and I'm going to guess this is G, the major

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:09.190
chord G. G, B, D, G, B, D. It makes it kind
of a funny chord, but you get a guy like Jerry

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:36.000
Douglas playing this and he will blow you
away. Let's just do a little bit on them.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:02:04.030
I go to play out of the alternating row. Chase
Jerry Douglas and play the thing like he does.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.959
It's amazing. The dobro in the hands of an
expert can make you cry. This is a great tuning.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:26.440
It's not my tuning, but it does work well.
It takes advantage of the ability to cover

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:41.790
and uncover strings. This is the true dobro
open G tuning. You can tune to open A, but

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.879
since this string is already up 3, you're
going to have to wind it up to A. You're going

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:55.400
to end up with an A string here for your low
E. If you tune your dobro to dobro A, you're

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.340
going to have to go do some string consulting.
Send me an email at eddowling.com and I'll

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.180
help you out.
