Hi! I am Debbie with Expert Village.com. These
are called Happyhangers. This is the bee we

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.360
are going to talk about making today. These
two, of course, are your Mr. Bee’s antennas

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:21.930
and you will need a nose. Then we have and
of course we folded our papers the magic cutting,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.210
we need two wings, two eyes, you are only
going to need one smile, but I went ahead

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:35.269
and put it on that piece. You are going to
need three sets of legs. I added a little

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:43.621
stinger here on the same piece of paper and
you are going to need three strips about two

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:49.190
inches wide for his stripes, and you’ll
need a black circle for the bee’s head.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.510
Okay, now that you have your pieces cut out
and they are in a baggy, stay nice and organized

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.370
and not lost, we need to work on our hanger.
Now hangers come in different thicknesses;

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.050
for a little hands the thinner ones work a
little bit better so, I found that the cleaners,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.080
the white ones that come in the laundry are
a little bit easier to bend than the heavy

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.600
duty or more heavy duty ones. This one is
just a kind of average one. Again this is

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.420
such great opportunity to work on those fine
motor skills. We talk about what shape we

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.030
need them bumblebee is going to be round,
so we need to change this into something round,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.590
talk about stretching the hanger, down as
long as we can, talk about being safe and

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.480
not aiming towards somebody’s face or your
face or popping it into your face, keep it

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.030
down onto the ground or low away from your
face. Now we have these little bumps in it,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.980
take your thumbs and push, get the bumps out,
push. Now we still don’t have a circle,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:04.300
so we are going to have to work on getting
that a little more rounded, talk about pushing

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:16.000
until you get a circle. Now the fancy part
and the tissue, we moved it to the very end,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.230
and our hook is off of the paper and we fold
it over and make sure that it is going to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.690
completely covered, then we are good. I like
to use this kind of glue you can use glue

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.940
sticks but for me it is hard for you to see
where the glue is and sometimes the tissue

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.090
does not stick. We talked about not using
too much of glue; if we make puddles it’s

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.560
just not going to work. We squiggle the glue
over the hanger, it’s got to be over the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.400
hanger so that the tissue will stick to the
hanger and we talk about not coming way out

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.430
here, because that is going to make a big
glue spot in the middle of your bumble bee’s

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:04.790
body, so don’t push too hard, skinny little
line, squiggling all the way around. After

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:15.620
you do that, very carefully fold the tissue
over and we stretch it out tight, and touch

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:29.050
all the way around until we know it’s stuck,
flip it over, touch it again, make sure everything

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.711
stuck. So you put if away, let it dry for
at least 30 minutes; often we will do this

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:40.140
part in the morning, and then do the other
part in the afternoon, spread it out, it is

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.370
a two phase activity. Okay, you have given
your hanger a little bit time to dry, and

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.210
so now we are going to talk about cutting
it out; now this can get tricky too! If you

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.150
get too close to the hanger, then it’s going
to pull away and then won’t stick. So we

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.209
talk about leaving a little bit of an edge
outside of the hanger, and we don’t want

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.330
a big giant edge, you will want to chop it
up and then this gets a little hard for some

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.060
kids and they might need some help.
