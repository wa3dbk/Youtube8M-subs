00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.710
I'm Dave and this is the MAKO Spearguns Rapid
On/Off Camera Mounting System installation

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.710
video

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.570
Note, before we mount the system to our speargun
we'll liberally apply marine grease to all

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.110
the screws.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.510
The first step in mounting the kit to your
speargun is to place the protective rubber

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.520
pad inside the clamp, then slip the clamp
over the barrel and tighten the screws.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.430
The unique clamp design fits on any gun and
will not interfere with the guns operation.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.530
Now tighten the Allen screws on the clamp
- tighten it good and snug, but don't over

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.380
tighten the screws.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.719
Next screw the knob into the clamp just a
turn or two and then slip the camera bracket

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.630
on and tighten the knob.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.540
Next we'll attach the camera to the bracket
using the knob &amp; pad supplied with the kit.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.770
If you're using a GoPro, you'll need their
tripod mount as the housing doesn't have a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.870
standard attachment point.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.180
Not only can you video your underwater targets,
but if you're into selfies, just spin the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.180
camera around and hit the record button.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.770
One really important safety feature of the
camera mounting system is it's ability to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.530
rapidly be removed and re-attached.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.270
By loosening the knob and slipping the bracket
off the clamp, you can safely video your buddy

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.220
without ever pointing your gun towards him.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.840
Most spearguns with any power at all will
have some recoil.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.170
The GoPro housing and tripod mount mating
surfaces are smooth plastic and the thumb

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.840
screw that connects them often can't be cranked
down tight enough to prevent your GoPro from

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.150
tilting forward and down upon firing.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.110
And there you are filming the bottom of the
ocean while you just stoned the trophy of

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.110
your trip.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.210
Our Recoil Stabilizer solves that issue by
installing the stabilizer at the housing mount

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.869
and replacing the GoPro knob with our longer
screw.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.549
Just tighten the screw and the HERO 3 housing
is now locked in place.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.119
Of course the rapid on/off feature also makes
it easy to travel and store your gun without

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.130
the bracket attached.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.930
