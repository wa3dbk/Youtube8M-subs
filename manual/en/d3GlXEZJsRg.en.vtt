00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
WHY

00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:04.218
does newly posted videos on YouTube

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.000
stops at 301 views for a day?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yesterday, I came upon a video in English 
of a guy who asked the chief

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of analytical service products of YouTube why, and it explains everything,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and since I know this can interest people 
 who watch a lot of YouTube videos

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080
or even those who post them…

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.000
“So how many views has your video got since yesterday?”

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
“Uh, 301...”

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500
“301! 301?!?”

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
“Well, it’s frozen…”

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
“You boss! You fucking own!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.320
I’m talking to a celebrity! I’m talking to a fucking star!”

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:48.000
I decided to summarise it so that everyone knows.
So everything will know about that fact.
There will be no more "Sorry, I didn't knew"

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I didn’t understand the video, I don’t speak English, sorry. Real sorry… (rambling)”

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You need to know that once a video is posted on YouTube, it’s duplicated on multiple servers around the world.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So if, for example, you watch this video in Paris,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.100
you’re watching it from French or European servers.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.240
No need to get it from the US or Japan.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.000
Next, these servers all over the planet send the information to YouTube,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
saying “Hey, this video has been seen once on my servers.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Go on YouTube, write it down, yeah, there you go…”

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
YouTube also differentiates between 2 types of videos:

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.340
300 views or less and more than 300 views.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.000
So if a video makes 10, 20, 30, 100, 200, up to 300 views

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
YouTube lets the views accumulate normally.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If a video hits more than 300 views 
 YouTube thinks they need to be verified.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So the counter freezes at 301 and YouTube checks that there aren’t any robots

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
having fun clicking the video thousands of times to inflate the views.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.400
That’s cheating! Bad robot!
I've got my eyes on you!

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.000
YouTube gets rid of the false views and, 
 after a bit less than a day,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
puts up the correct number.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I can hear you saying “But wait!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Sometimes it freezes at 302 views or even more!”

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In addition to having the same voice as Grandpa Simpson, you’re right!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Here’s the explanation:

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.860
When a video gets more than 300 views, i.e. when 
 its views go from an unverified to verified,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.000
it could be that YouTube counts multiple views that 
 arrive at the same time from different servers.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.900
Since they come at the same time, YouTube counts them before blocking the counter for a day

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.000
which explains the fact that we can spot numbers as far as 320 views.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Such as 302, 303, well you should know the numbers between 301 and 320.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.120
normally, if you went to school.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.000
Now when you see a comment like

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:01.000
“If you’re the 301st view as well, thumbs up!” 
 or “301 views and 1342 comments?! WTF!”

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.360
show them this video. It’s your civil duty!

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.000
Thanks to NumberPhil or Numberphile, dunno how it’s said,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.840
for the explanatory video. His channel talks about numbers…

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.000
He must have an amazing life. Like, seriously, numbers…

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.680
See you soon!
