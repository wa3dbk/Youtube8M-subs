Today we are talking about tea and now I'm
going to talk about a tea, an Oolong tea known

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:14.440
as Oriental Beauty, it's also known as Formosa
Oolong and also known as white tip Oolong

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.051
or Bhai hau Oolong. One of the things, one
of the reasons it's called oriental beauty

00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:26.280
is because the Queen Elizabeth the first of
England when she first tried this tea, she

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.210
was reported to say, ooh what an oriental
beauty. So that's one of the, that's the folk

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.070
legend about how this tea got that name. But
then you can look at the tea leaf here and

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.739
you can see these little white, white hair
type things and that's why it gets the name

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.270
bai hau oolong which is white tip oolong.
And so you know you'll find there are various

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.850
names for this tea. Here is the Chinese characters
Dan Fong may wren, or in the English translation

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.010
is oriental beauty. Ok. So this is a really
amazing tea because this is the summer harvest

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:09.420
and what happens in the summer is from about
April to June is the time when the tea jassid

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.689
is the most present in Taiwan. And that's
a little, like a a leaf hopper or a aphid

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:24.680
that attacks the tea plant, and when it bites
the plant, the plant undergoes a metabolic

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.500
chain reaction and it, and that is actually
a biological form of a self defense. And that

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.530
is, produces a scent that then attracts the
leukoplakia wax spider and then that wax spider

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.109
is a predator of the aphid, so but the end
result of this, is a tea that is amazingly

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:56.060
honey like in flavor. The Dan Fong and this
oriental beauty or Formosa Oolong is a tea

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.830
that is quite well oxidized about seventy
percent so it's closer to a black tea, but

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.240
again it's so honey like and so light and
delicate that it, that it's not anything like

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.200
a sort of an English breakfast or that type
of a black tea. This is a tea because it's

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.990
a summer harvest, the leaves are very delicate
so when you brew this tea it's best to use

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:28.230
a lower temperature about one ninety or so
Fahrenheit so you can, you know, and then

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.790
this tea will yield many infusions and it's
very fragrant and very floral so you can drink

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.140
this over and over and brew it over and over
with the same leaves and it will produce so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.740
many wonderful infusions. So that's a little
bit about Formosa Oolong tea from Taiwan.
