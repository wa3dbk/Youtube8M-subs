00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.380
Hi.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.830
I am Laura-Jane, The Rawtarian, from therawtarian.com
and today I was just making a chocolate cream

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.290
pie in my kitchen, and I suddenly thought
that you guys would all love to see some of

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.010
my kitchen molds and pans.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.590
I know a lot of you are very familiar with
looking at my raw food photography and recipes

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.660
at therawtarian.com.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.951
But I thought you’d love to see the actual
devices, the kitchen tools, that I use to

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:37.000
make those food photographs look or attempt
to make them look quite delightful.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So what I have here is a chocolate cream pie
and I really won’t go into the details of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.520
Really, the gist of what we’re doing here
is it’s a nice, creamy mixture, and we’re

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.360
gonna put it into some molds or pans, and
then we’re going to freeze it, and then

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.470
it’s done.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.230
But really the gist of what I wanted to show
you was some of the molds that I use and I

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.820
have—this is just a strange selection of
stuff but I thought I would show you and talk

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.909
about each thing.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.560
First of all, spring form pans.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.210
When you’re doing food photography, everything
should be small.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.310
It’s way easier to photograph little things.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.270
You don’t have to use as much ingredients.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.039
Like one batch of this can do a whole bunch
of stuff.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.509
If you have a huge spring form pan like this
big, it’s not gonna work well.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.060
So of course, the spring form pan just means
that it can pop out like that, and that works

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.280
really well because it gives a really nice
edge and you don’t have to cut it.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.520
So this is a traditional little mini.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.650
I think it’s a 4 inch spring form pan.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.159
This is awesome.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.070
I just got it lately and it makes look like
you’ve cut a big slice of pie, but you didn’t

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.670
have to cut it.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.670
This is awesome.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.670
I love it.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.000
So those are spring form pans.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Then I’ll talk about this type of pan.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.659
I actually recently bought this pan about
a year ago, and I’ve never even used it

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.389
because I love using silicone.

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.580
I got so excited, I started throwing them.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.420
But silicone or silicone, I don’t know what
it is, molds.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.710
I don’t really use these like traditional
muffin tin pans much anymore at all.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.670
So yeah, I bought that and I never really
even used it.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.970
But what I use all the time are these kinds
of silicone molds because they’re so much

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.120
easier.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.840
And another tip that I like to do as well
is here’s the sheath that it came in and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.310
there’s some—I’m getting distracted.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.420
Okay.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.950
With my lack of perfectionism but nobody needs
to be perfect, and that’s why I’m sharing

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.950
this with you.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.010
So a good tip with the silicone mold, even
like this, is you can cut them with scissors

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.400
and it makes it easier to just use one of
these things.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.150
So why don’t we go ahead right now and just
show you a little bit of how it’s done.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.930
So of course, we’re going like this because
this is easy.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.370
And I do have a big reveal at the end so stay
tuned because I’m going to show you more.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:17.330
So this is going to make you know a nice pie
in the pans, and you can go as thick or as

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.530
skinny as you like.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.600
And actually, sometimes making them skinny
like this is really nice because it’s almost

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.090
like a tart or a flan and then you can load
a whole bunch of fruit on top and it still

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.420
has a really nice—it looks like you’re
giving a really big piece but it’s not a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.740
huge piece.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.700
So that would be—that’s easy with a spring
form pans.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.290
Then I love making little—and again, it’s
the same recipe and frequently I will take

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.450
one recipe like this and put it into a bunch
of different little molds so that I have different

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.020
things to photograph.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.310
So there’s these guys.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.550
And again, what’s so great about this silicone
mold is that once it has frozen, you can easily

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.420
just peel it right off.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.550
And I don’t know if you’re allowed but
I even just throw them in the dishwasher.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.250
It’s easy.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.860
I do it.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.240
And this is so cute.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.600
This actually has a really unique shape, and
I’ll show you my final product in a minute,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.970
but these are great to make granola bars or
chocolate bars.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:26.330
They have a very nice bar shape and I believe
they’re called financier.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.380
F-I-N-A-N-C-I-E-R.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.420
That’s the name of the type of mold.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.130
All of these you can get on Amazon very inexpensively.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.220
So you put it like that.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.100
What else do I have?

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.820
I don’t know.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.970
Oh, this!

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.970
This.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.370
I won’t pour it in.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.540
see this mold?

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.200
It’s so cute.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200
Okay.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200
Getting distracted.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.630
But what I want to do, as you may remember,
I recently had a kale cheesecake that I had

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.630
made.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.620
This is just in my freezer and I just thought
that it would be good to show it to you right

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.280
now as well.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.010
And I had a delicious slice of it already.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.530
But you can see, this mold.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.380
This kind of chocolate bar shape came from
these guys, and this circular one is probably

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.650
my most favorite.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.820
The mold that I use the most and it’s that
4 inch cheesecake pan.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.400
And I have little tiny cake plates and from
far away, it almost looks like a whole huge

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.870
cake but it’s actually quite small.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.470
So that is where that came from, and this
base little guy was from this.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.730
And that is this.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:46.130
And these little kind of chocolate little
bite size nuggets from this.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.260
So I think that’s a lot of sharing my little
secrets of how I make my photos and I know

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.000
we all love to share tips.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.050
And also, the last thing I’ll say too, you
know, I’m The Rawtarian.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.310
I make simple satisfying recipes at therawtarian.com
but you will remember me if you’ve been

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.520
with me for a long time, where I used to say
food photography.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.860
I don’t take food photography!

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.919
I’m not a food photographer.

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:09.919
I hate it!

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.400
Here’s my ugly picture of like my crap like
this and I didn’t put any effort into styling

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.870
it at all, and that is actually something
that has not come not like a pretty designer

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.930
kind of person and it’s been hard work.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.711
And I’m enjoying it more now, but I think
that it’s something you don’t have to

00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:33.230
put a lot of pressure on yourself to have
nice things like this, and you’ll know that

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:41.480
I always include basic examples like if you’re
gonna make a banana cream pie and you don’t

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.040
have any of this, just use what you’ve got.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:51.960
You could pour this into a big dish that just
has sides like an old brownie dish and that’ll

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.670
work totally fine and you just cut it out.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.220
So make use of what you have, and I’m happy
to share my tips with you.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.900
And as always, I’m so thankful to have you
here with me.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.340
your creations in your own kitchen.

Thank you.
