00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.858
The President: Dorood.

00:00:01.858 --> 00:00:04.024
As you and your families
gather around the Nowruz

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:06.825
table, I want to extend my
best wishes on this new

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:09.024
spring and new year.

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:11.491
As always, this holiday is
a chance to give gratitude

00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:13.458
for your blessings and to
reflect

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:16.224
on our hopes for the year ahead.

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.491
As I have every year as
President, I want to take

00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:21.024
this opportunity to speak
directly to the people and

00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:24.124
leaders of the Islamic
Republic of Iran.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.858
Since taking office,
I've offered

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:29.224
the Iranian government an
opportunity-if it meets

00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:31.391
its international
obligations,

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:33.658
then there could be a new
relationship between our

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:36.425
two countries, and Iran
could begin to return

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:39.925
to its rightful place among
the community of nations.

00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:43.825
Last year, you-the Iranian
people-made your voice

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:46.024
heard when you elected
Dr. Hassan Rouhani

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:47.858
as your new president.

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:49.825
During his campaign, he
pledged to strengthen

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:52.625
Iran's economy, improve
the lives of the Iranian

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.958
people and engage
constructively

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.458
with the international
community-and he was

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:00.458
elected with your
strong support.

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.758
Last fall, I spoke with
President Rouhani.

00:01:03.758 --> 00:01:05.425
It was the first
conversation between

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:10.425
an American president and an
Iranian leader since 1979.

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.792
I conveyed to President
Rouhani my deep respect

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:15.525
for the Iranian people,
just as he expressed

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:17.258
his respect for the
American people.

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:20.091
And I told him that I
firmly believe that

00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:22.625
we can address the serious
disagreements between our

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.224
governments, reduce
distrust

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:29.124
and begin to move beyond our
difficult history.

00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:31.925
Since then, we've
made progress.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.491
For years, the
international community

00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:36.224
has had concerns that
Iran's nuclear program

00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:38.258
could lead to Iran
acquiring a nuclear

00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:40.792
weapon, which would be a
threat

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:43.158
to the region and to the world.

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:44.725
Under the initial
agreement we reached

00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:46.425
in November, the Iranian
government

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:50.658
has agreed to limit key parts of
its nuclear program.

00:01:50.658 --> 00:01:53.124
Along with our
international partners,

00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:54.258
the United States is
giving

00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:57.224
Iran some relief from sanctions.

00:01:57.224 --> 00:02:00.258
Now we're engaged in
intensive negotiations in

00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:03.091
the hopes of finding a
comprehensive solution

00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:05.124
that resolves the world's
concerns

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.758
with the Iranian nuclear program.

00:02:07.758 --> 00:02:10.725
As I've said before,
I'm under no illusions.

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:12.591
This will be difficult.

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:14.425
But I'm committed to
diplomacy because

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:18.458
I believe there is the basis
for a practical solution.

00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:21.958
Iran's highest officials,
including Supreme Leader

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.191
Khamenei, have said that
Iran

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:26.925
is not developing nuclear weapons.

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:29.558
So there is a chance to
reach an agreement

00:02:29.558 --> 00:02:33.224
if Iran takes meaningful and
verifiable steps to assure

00:02:33.224 --> 00:02:35.358
the world that its nuclear
program

00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:38.224
is for peaceful purposes only.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.792
Iran would have access to
peaceful nuclear energy.

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:44.124
And we will have
addressed-peacefully,

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:46.925
with diplomacy-one of the
greatest challenges

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:50.291
to international
peace and security.

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:53.358
A comprehensive agreement
on the nuclear issue-and

00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:56.358
an Iran that upholds
universal rights, at home

00:02:56.358 --> 00:03:00.224
and abroad-would help move
Iran along the new path

00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:02.958
that so many
Iranians seek.

00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.024
After all, throughout your
history the talents and

00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:06.892
genius of the Iranian
people

00:03:06.892 --> 00:03:10.224
have led to great achievements
in literature and the arts,

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:12.692
science and technology.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.024
But the economic hardship
that so many Iranians have

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:17.625
endured in recent
years-because of the

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:20.758
choices of Iranian
leaders-has deprived your

00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:23.425
country and the world of
the extraordinary skills

00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:26.358
and contributions
you have to offer.

00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:28.525
And you deserve better.

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.658
If Iran meets its
international obligations,

00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:33.458
we know where the path of
dialogue and greater trust

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:34.558
and cooperation can lead.

00:03:34.558 --> 00:03:37.425
It will mean more
opportunities for Iranians

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.858
to trade and forge ties
with

00:03:38.858 --> 00:03:40.458
the rest of the world.

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:42.558
It means more economic
growth and jobs for

00:03:42.558 --> 00:03:45.358
Iranians, especially young
Iranians who dream of

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.558
making their mark
in the world.

00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:49.591
It will mean more
opportunities for Iranian

00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:52.358
students to travel abroad
and build new partnerships

00:03:52.358 --> 00:03:55.625
that help you realize your
incredible potential.

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:58.825
In short, real diplomatic
progress this year can

00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:00.892
help open up new
possibilities and

00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:05.325
prosperity for the Iranian
people for years to come.

00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:07.191
That's the message the
Iranian people sent at the

00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:09.158
ballot box last year.

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:11.191
I hope that the entire
Iranian government hears

00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:12.191
that message too.

00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:13.892
Because for the first time
in many years,

00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:17.391
we have the opportunity to start
down a new path.

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:20.425
If Iran seizes this
moment, this Nowruz could

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:22.858
mark not just the
beginning of a new year,

00:04:22.858 --> 00:04:25.291
but a new chapter in the
history of Iran and its

00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.258
role in the
world-including a better

00:04:27.258 --> 00:04:29.591
relationship with the
United States and the

00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:32.725
American people, rooted in
mutual interest

00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:34.892
and mutual respect.

00:04:34.892 --> 00:04:40.858
Thank you, and Eid-eh
Shoma Mobarak.
