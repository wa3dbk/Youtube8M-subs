00:00:06.327 --> 00:00:07.484
We've all seen movies

00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:09.729
about terrible insects from outer space

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.294
or stories of abduction by little green men,

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:14.325
but the study of life in the universe,

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.995
including the possibility of extraterrestrial life,

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.087
is also a serious, scientific pursuit.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:23.267
Astrobiology draws on diverse fields,

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:24.160
such as physics,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.185
biology,

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:26.170
astronomy,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.182
and geology,

00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:29.351
to study how life was formed on Earth,

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:31.013
how it could form elsewhere,

00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:32.895
and how we might detect it.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.191
Many ancient religions described

00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:38.105
other worlds inhabited by known human beings,

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.074
but these are more like mythical realms

00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:41.517
or parallel universes

00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:42.813
than other planets existing

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:44.613
in the same physical world.

00:00:44.613 --> 00:00:46.434
It is only within the last century

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:47.604
that scientists have been able

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.183
to seriously undertake the search

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:51.384
for extraterrestrial life.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.296
We know that at the most basic level

00:00:53.296 --> 00:00:55.452
organisms on Earth need three things:

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:56.345
liquid water,

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:57.547
a source of energy,

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:00.005
and organic, carbon-based material.

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:01.376
We also know that the Earth

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:03.336
is just the right distance from the Sun,

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:06.264
so as not to be either frozen or molten.

00:01:06.264 --> 00:01:08.389
So, planets within such a habitable range

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:09.643
from their own stars

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:11.880
may be able to support life.

00:01:13.187 --> 00:01:14.349
But while we used to think

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:15.521
that life could only exist

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:17.402
in such Earth-like environments,

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:20.124
one of the most amazing discoveries of astrobiology

00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:22.526
has been just how versatile life is.

00:01:22.526 --> 00:01:24.426
We now know that life can thrive

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.247
in some of the most extreme environments

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:28.607
that'd be fatal for most known organisms.

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:30.419
Life is found everywhere,

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:32.551
from black smoke of hydrothermal vents

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.605
in the dark depths of Earth's oceans,

00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:36.602
to bubbling, hot, acidic springs

00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:38.273
on the flanks of volcanoes,

00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:40.654
to high up in the atmosphere.

00:01:40.654 --> 00:01:43.134
Organisms that live in these challenging environments

00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:45.184
are called extremophiles,

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:46.791
and they can survive at extremes

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:47.636
of temperature,

00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:48.437
pressure,

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:49.434
and radiation,

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:50.470
as well as salinity,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.386
acidity,

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.629
and limited availability of sunlight,

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:54.498
water,

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:55.881
or oxygen.

00:01:56.988 --> 00:01:59.345
What is most remarkable about these extremophiles

00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:01.399
is that they are found thriving in environments

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.697
that mimic those on alien worlds.

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:05.908
One of the most important of these worlds

00:02:05.908 --> 00:02:08.681
is our red and dusty neighbor, Mars.

00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:11.736
Today, astrobiologists are exploring places

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:14.228
where life might once have existed on Mars

00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:16.534
using NASA's Curiosity rover.

00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:18.333
One of these is Gale Crater,

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.062
an impact crater created

00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:21.589
when a meteor hit the surface of Mars

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.271
nearly 3.8 billions years ago.

00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.671
Evidence from orbit suggest past traces of water,

00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:28.763
which means the crater

00:02:28.763 --> 00:02:31.185
might once have supported life.

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:32.841
Planets are not the only places

00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:34.928
astrobiologists are looking at.

00:02:34.928 --> 00:02:37.518
For example, Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter,

00:02:37.518 --> 00:02:39.200
and Enceladus and Titan,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.349
two of Saturn's moons,

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.595
are all exciting possibilities.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.018
Although these moons are extremely cold

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:46.847
and two are covered in thick ice,

00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:50.028
there is evidence of liquid oceans beneath the shell.

00:02:50.028 --> 00:02:52.950
Could life be floating around in these oceans,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.879
or could it be living around black smoker

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.838
vents at the bottom?

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.321
Titan is particularly promising

00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.465
as it has an atmosphere

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:02.745
and Earth-like lakes, seas, and rivers

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.496
flowing across the surface.

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:05.929
It is very cold, however,

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:07.545
too cold for liquid water,

00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:09.382
so these rivers may instead be flowing

00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:10.657
with liquid hydrocarbons

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.953
such as methane and ethane.

00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:14.915
These are composed of hydrogen,

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:16.943
and, more importantly, carbon,

00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:18.480
which is the basic building block

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.255
of all life as we know it.

00:03:20.255 --> 00:03:22.969
So, could life be found in these lakes?

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.842
Although instruments are being designed

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:26.513
to study these distant worlds,

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:28.347
it takes many years to build them

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:29.537
and even longer to get them

00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:31.134
where they need to be.

00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:33.188
In the meantime, astrobiologists work

00:03:33.188 --> 00:03:35.849
in our own natural laboratory, the Earth,

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.108
to learn about all the weird

00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:39.379
and wonderful forms of life that can exist

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.832
and to help us one day answer

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:43.065
one of humanity's oldest questions:

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:44.614
Are we alone?
