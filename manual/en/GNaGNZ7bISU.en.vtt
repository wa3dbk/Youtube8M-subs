00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.940
Team Cat Mojo-- I am excited.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.920
Can you tell?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.420
I've been waiting
to put this down

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.140
into the video ether
for quite a long time.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.600
Now I get the chance.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.060
Can't wait, man

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.590
We are going to be talking
today about the confident where.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.530
Are you ready to get catified?

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.090
Let's go.

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:30.020
So what we're really
talking about today

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.040
is the confident where.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.170
Where in the world
are they confident?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.690
Is your cat a bush
dweller, a tree dweller,

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.055
or a beach dweller?

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:41.860
A bush dweller is a type
of cat who is always

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.970
hiding under the coffee
table, or they're

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.190
behind a potted plant, a bush.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.650
And they are waiting to do what?

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.940
In the raw cat mind, if we
think about cats in the wild,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.280
what are they waiting to do?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.460
They're waiting to hunt, to
strike, to get your ankles,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.630
to do something.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.830
They're down there
getting their mojo on.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.890
Now, tree dweller,
pretty obvious--

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.930
if they're not down
there on the floor

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.250
behind the potted plant,
what are they doing?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.400
They're up there, somewhere.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.780
Now, here's the important
thing with tree dwellers.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.630
It can be anywhere
above the ground.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.120
Tree dwelling
doesn't necessarily

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.240
mean way up in the rafters.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.960
Rafters included, for sure.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.700
But it can be this chair.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.180
It can be this table.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270
It can be on top of the couch.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.370
It can be way up in the rafters.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.600
But they are demonstrating
confidence up.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.810
The beach dweller still
lives out on the floor,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.610
likes to feel all four paws are
firmly touching terra firma.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.320
Got it.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.070
However, they do like being out.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.075
Yes, you know that
cat, the cat that you

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:50.260
trip over, every day, when
you come into the living room.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.900
And you haven't had
your coffee yet.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.710
And you go face planting
into the kitchen,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.540
because you've tripped
on your beach cat.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.790
What they're doing is, they're
sending a clear message

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.380
to you and to the other
animals in the house.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.010
Basically, if you want to
get from point A to point B,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.840
you're going to have to not
take the straightest path.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.570
You're going to have
to go around me.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.770
Remember something, it's
all about Cat Mojo 101.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.560
Which is what?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.540
Confident ownership
of territory-- where

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.710
does your cat
demonstrate confidence?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.476
Well, what's the
anti-confident where?

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:24.310
Where are the places
where your cat develops

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.300
a lack of confidence, fear.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.950
Now, if you use the
word hide, then you're

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.450
not talking about a dweller.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.750
You're talking about a hider.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.300
You're talking about a caver.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.060
So if a cat is
caving, that's saying

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.750
that they like to
be small, invisible.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.560
If they could, they would
disappear into their cave.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.470
That's what makes a cat a caver.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.420
So what turns a caved
cat into a bush dweller?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.570
Well, I'm glad you
asked, because this

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.180
is what catification
is all about.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.480
Catification is getting
you to the point, where

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.460
instead of hiding, where we
can't find you-- oh, you're

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.720
behind that shoe box
back there-- to creating

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.984
an environment where
it's under our control,

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:10.400
where we're saying,
you know what.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.490
It's OK if you want to be
in an enclosed environment.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.440
But we want it to be
where we want it to be.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.890
Let's look at another example.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.290
You say, Jackson Galaxy, I have
a cat who's a tree dweller.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.780
He never comes off the fridge.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.440
Huh?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.750
What?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.870
No, you're cat is not
confident on top of the fridge.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.730
Your cat is fridging.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.590
They're up there
trying to get away

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.450
from other cats
who are tormenting

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.690
them or kids or humans.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.090
They're not coming down, because
they only feel safe there.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.100
They can disappear up there.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.760
Safety does not
equal confidence.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.220
It's a component of.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.240
But that's the pendulum
swinging way to the other side.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.540
We want your cat to
be the mojito cat.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.280
We want your cat up like that
and ready to take on the world.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.669
And if they're on top of
the fridge, that ain't it.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:05.835
So what are we trying to do?

00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:09.370
We're trying to
transition the fridge cat

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.830
to be a tree dweller.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:13.810
And how do we do that?

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.120
We catify.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.290
We give the world ramps
and a cat superhighway,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.380
to make sure they can move
around there with confidence.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.710
And then over time,
we encourage them

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.960
to come down and join
the rest of the world.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.290
So what our job is-- if our cat
is displaying the unconfident

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.840
where, if our cat is
displaying fear and the urge

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.000
to disappear and be small,
we want to say to them,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.930
just as if they were our
children, go out there.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.610
Step into your greatness.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.860
And the way a cat steps
into their greatness

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.590
is territorially.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.480
If they only own the joint,
they are a confident genius

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.940
of a cat.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.420
And that's what we want.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.120
We don't want to
change our cats.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.890
We don't want them to
be someone they're not.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.080
If they're introspective,
that's who they are.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.120
If they're life of the
party, that's who they are.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.020
But we don't want
the introverted cat

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.540
to become a hermit.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.060
That's not a good life.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.980
You know your cat.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.800
And if you don't know
your cat, all you've

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.340
gotta do is watch them.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.680
All you've gotta do is
put on your cat glasses

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.940
and watch them.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.940
And you will find out the
most intense stuff, man.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.640
Hey, what makes
us Team Cat Mojo?

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.570
It's the we.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.260
It's the us.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.560
And how do we become
a we and an us?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.090
And how do we make life
better for cats, our cats,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.440
all those cats, shelter
cats, cats on the street?

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.650
We spread the word.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.830
We talk to one another.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.870
We become a community.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.110
So how do you do that?

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.290
