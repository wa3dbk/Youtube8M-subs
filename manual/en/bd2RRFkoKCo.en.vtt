Today lets see how to prepare soft and fluffy chapati recipe

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.860
Wheat Flour - 200 gr

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Add salt to taste

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
Add 2 &amp; 1/2 tsp of warm milk

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.800
Water for kneading the dough

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.600
Measure hot water using the same cup used for measuring flour and add it to the milk

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.640
Only 1/2 cup of water was required for kneading the dough

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.260
Add 2 tsp of oil and knead the dough well

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.820
Once the dough is ready set it aside for 2 hrs

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.480
For 1 cup of flour 1/2 of water is required for kneading the dough

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.900
After 2 hrs , the dough is very soft

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.820
Make small balls and dust it with dry flour

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.560
Once you have pressed it to a round , fold it as shown

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.240
Folding it this way , gives you a soft and fluffy chapati , moreover you will get layered chapati

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
When small bubbles appear on the surface flip the chapati to the other side

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.740
Once again flip the chapati and add oil or ghee as you wish

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Fluffy and soft chapati is ready !!!

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.620
Now add ghee or oil on the surface to prevent it from drying
