In this video I am going to show you a nice alternative to spit shading using a water brush pen.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.280
There are many different brands you can purchase with different size tips.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.640
The one I am currently using is made by Derwent, size 2 medium.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.874
I will add a link to the description down below where you can purchase it.

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:29.915
You simply fill the handle with water and screw the top on.

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:32.994
Then the water is absorbed through the brush bristles on the cap.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.640
You can use it the exactly same way as you would use a water brush for spit shading.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.840
I can imagine a lot of people might prefer this technique because you don't have to put a paint brush in your mouth.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.540
And you might actually find this technique easier.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.660
This pen works really good with watercolour inks.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.634
You can either wet the area first before adding the ink or put the ink down then fade it out using the brush pen.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.360
If you find you need me water on the brush give the handle a slight squeeze.

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:15.814
This adds more water to the bristles.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.040
If you find the brush has picked up some ink you can use a paper towel to clean it off.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.600
Also give the brush a little squeeze whilst doing it.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.560
Try and not let to much ink build up on the brush otherwise it will start leaving a faint tone of colour

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.913
when you are trying to use it and will make it a lot more difficult when you are trying to get clean fades.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.920
