Welcome To Bachelor's Cooking

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.100
Today we will make you teach Dahi Puti or Dahi Batata Puri as its known by this name in Bombay.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.400
So, for this we have done lots of preparation

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.100
For this we have prepared these Puries, how to make these puris

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.220
Put 100 gm of Rawa in 1 Kg of Maida

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.560
and we have to prepare a tough dough.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.735
and after making it cover it with the wet cloth and leave if for almost 1 hour

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:37.301
after that, have to make its small round balls and fry them

00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.912
Semolina is added so that it gets crispy well

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:44.565
that's why hard dough is prepared so that puri becomes crispy

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.180
So, we have prepared the puris along with we have prepared the coriander-mint chutney

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.980
What we have done, 1 medium bunch of Coriander &amp; Mint, along with 4 green chillies

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.884
with added some ginger and salt, we have prepared this green or coriander-mint chutney

00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:04.964
And apart form this we have prepared the Tamarind Chutney

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.300
In the Tamarind Chutney take Tamarind Pulp, along with add some jaggery and dry ginger powder

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.400
and some fennel seeds powder with added some red chilli powder. and boil of them or cook them

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.840
and after that stain it and take out, so we have prepared Tamarind Chutney

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:32.243
Apart from that this is Red Chuteny which contains Red Chillies &amp; Garlic

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.260
so we have mixed in the mixer by adding some water. So that's the Red Chutney.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.860
All of this we have prepared it and apart from that we have boiled &amp; Chopped potato

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.400
So, let us start making Dahi Batata Puri, So for this we have curd with us

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.140
Take Curd and we have to add almost 1/2 spoon of Sugar

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.840
and along with add 1 pinch of Salt

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.660
and along with add 1 pinch of Black Salt

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.980
and apart from this we will add almost 1/2 spoon of Red Chilli Powder

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.460
and now what we have to do? we have to mix it nicely

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.560
In case you want you can add Roasted Cumin Seeds Powder

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.450
Beat the curd smoothly, so that it doesn't contain any lump

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.520
so the curd is smooth now

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.920
Now, first of all we have to take Puri &amp; we have to make hole with the thumb

00:02:50.600 --> 00:03:00.320
after making hole we have to put, the boil potatoes, &amp; after that we will add green chutney first

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.340
This chutney is spicy so if you like more spicy then you can put more chutney or less if don't like too  much spicy

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.720
and when you make it and it you like this snack as in very spicy the you can increase the decrease the quantity of spice as per your likings

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.960
So, we have put in the green chutney

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:39.180
after that we will add this Red Chilli and Garlic chutney to the sev, so put this also

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:54.226
And now we will add Sweet chutney means Tamarind Chutney

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:57.866
so, here the Tamarind Chutney goes

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.580
after that put the curd which we have just prepared it.... sweet and salty curd

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.240
after that we have to put Black Salt, very less of it

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.420
along with put some chaat masala

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.800
after that we have to add these Nylon or you can say very very thin Sev to the puris

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:13.320
and after that chopped onions if you like it otherwise can leave it as it is optional

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.200
and some chopped coriander leaves

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:29.219
