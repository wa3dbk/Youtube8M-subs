00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.639
this is the heat

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.879
daytona

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.779
accelerated

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.970
finance

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.569
and as a influence and i a land of
fashion

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:21.390
handwritten

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.529
are reasonably

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:24.019
consultation

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.070
front pages of differential is coming

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.710
withholding information

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.340
intellectual as a reference for fast
relief function

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.700
it's incredibly valuable to have

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.350
a manic announces lifelike is this to
enable us to

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.420
practice what it would be likens could
situation so you can build any type of

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.780
scenario you can make it go in any
direction

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.390
and they can be change in the vital
signs as you that provide care

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.510
and we can have the government positive
way that they're improving or maybe the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.980
child is declining a little bit

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.470
and they need to think about a new path
leading down a little too manipulates

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.230
the settings that the child had a lot of
blood pressure

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.000
have a high heart rate

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.390
wasn't breathing very well

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.870
all the things that can only be would do
and then

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.210
required that seemed to intervene and
fascinated how life like the simulation

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.860
baby is

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.410
see that they have seizures and he could
see the respiratory status

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.610
changing in proving that the people size
changes dislikes like enough that people

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.740
can

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.610
into the scenarios actually feel like
they can

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.020
check for pulses and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.630
was their response to his educational
institutes taken by me everybody works

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.530
really well together as a team

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.810
so they feel comfortable asking the
questions that they would not want to be

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.090
asking

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.159
situation for the greater the responded
well and

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.540
effects

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.110
a good spirits scenarios you know i
actually doing c_p_r_ 'cause you've done

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.000
the right things it as and an outlet for

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.280
a different form of education which when
they're we didn't have before we

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.080
appreciate their donation very much has
been phenomenal learning for the staff
