Welcome to iPhonedo, you may remember me from the creeper behind the Keanu Reeves photo.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.200
Or the blur behind the Arnold Schwarzenegger video

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.280
Or the creeper behind the Keanu Reeves photo with the selfie stick in his hand!

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.920
OK. So we have come to this, huh?

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.720
This is a monopod!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.680
And you shall not confuse it with...

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.840
selfie stick!

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.320
Today I'm here to review the OlloClip Active Lens and the OlloCase for your iPhone 6 and 6 Plus

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.960
Which allows you to use the OlloClip lenses.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.600
This is the best OlloClip I've ever reviewed!

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:49.919
whoa, whoa, whoa, I hear you say!

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.240
"How do you know, you didn't even open the box" I hear you say!

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.040
HAH! I shoot first and ask questions later!

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.240
So last week, once again for an OlloClip review, I went to Rodeo Drive for the fathers' day special gathering

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.960
where you can see a lot of cool cars

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.920
That's where I tested this and the results are pretty spectacular!

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.040
So here it is the OlloClip Active Lens and let's start unboxing.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.000
You need this if you're using your lens with iPhone 6 and this if you're using it with iPhone 6 plus

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.680
Simply place this here and then push it in there

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.560
And now you can use this with iPhone 6

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.800
Unless you're using it with the case. The OlloCase

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:11.262
When you're using your OlloClip with the OlloCase you need to take this part out.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.320
By the way the lens feels heavier than the other OlloClip lenses I've tested previously.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.520
So now let's go ahead an test this and see if it is true

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.000
1.3oz to 0.9oz

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.800
Front facing camera, rear camera, front facing camera...

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.160
So now when you want to use your phone with the OlloClip you don't need to take your case off

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.400
The buttons are very soft and you can reach into the mute switch easily.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.800
The OlloClip Active Lens Seems to be one of the best lens for the iPhone

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:11.600
the fact that is has a telephoto and a wide angle lens allows you to be prepared for any situation

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.320
Such as if Keanu Reeves is far away you can zoom in with telephoto lens

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.840
if he’s right next to you use wide angle.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:32.080
Joking aside when you align your lens to your camera perfectly, there is almost no chromatic aberration

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:42.920
Remember to turn off your automatic brightness and keep in mind that olloclip blocks the led flash on your phone

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.320

Oh hi! This is the part where you can select another video.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.160
You know, something for the road...

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.360
Something for you... Something for me...

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.560
Something for everybody

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:01.538
For example this one is an OlloClip video

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.840
But this one, is an OlloClip video.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.680
Also this one is completely different. It's OlloClip video.

00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:14.971
And then this one is umm...

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.600
It's a documentary about

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.080
If I'm obsessed with OlloClips! OK.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.040
As I always say, it's up to you pick one. I'm not looking, I'm just practicing guitar.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.000
I'm not looking

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.080
No, not that one! Choose the other one, other one!
