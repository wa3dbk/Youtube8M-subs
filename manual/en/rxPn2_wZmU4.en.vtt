00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.366
- THE MOVIE IS HILARIOUS,

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.500
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
IN A MINUTE,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.100
BUT IT REALLY IS SO HILARIOUS.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.266
DAVE FRANCO WAS HERE YESTERDAY.
- YEAH.

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.433
- AND I LOVE THE MOVIE,
AND I LOVE WHEN YOU'RE HERE,

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:10.566
AND YOUR PARENTS
ARE ALWAYS HERE.

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.233
WHENEVER YOU'RE HERE,
YOUR PARENTS COME

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.233
AND SIT IN THE AUDIENCE.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:14.800
- THEY LITERALLY
DROVE ME HERE TODAY.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.700
[laughs]
- DID THEY REALLY?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.133
- YEAH, THEY ACTUALLY DID.
[laughs]

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.966
- YOU GO FROM DRIVING HIM
AT 13 YEARS OLD DOING STAND-UP

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.033
TO DRIVING HIM TO A SHOW
WHEN HE'S ACTUALLY TURNED OUT

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.500
TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.533
SO CONGRATULATIONS.

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.200
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- [laughs]

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.900
- ALL RIGHT, SO...

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.033
YOU DID--I DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY PEOPLE SAW THIS.

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:38.166
BUT YOU AND--IT WAS JAMES,
RIGHT--FRANCO?

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.133
- YEAH, WITH FRANCO, YEAH,
JAMES FRANCO.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.133
- DID THAT KIND OF TAKE OFF
ON KIM AND KANYE'S VIDEO.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.766
- WE DID, AND IT WAS ALL
BECAUSE I SAW IT.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:50.433
I WAS--I WAS--I SAW--
I WAS WATCHING YOUR SHOW,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:55.266
AND I SAW THE PREMIERE
OF THE VIDEO.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.300
AND WE WERE SO, LIKE,
TAKEN BY IT

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.733
THAT WE ACTUALLY, LIKE,
LITERALLY THE NEXT MORNING

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:03.233
STARTED FILMING, LIKE,
OUR OWN VERSION OF IT.

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:04.500
AND THEN WE KIND OF REALIZED

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.666
LIKE, "OH, WE COULD DO IT
EXACTLY HOW THEY DID IT,"

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.266
LIKE, LITERALLY, LIKE, MOMENT
FOR MOMENT, SHOT FOR SHOT,

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.600
AND THEN ONCE WE REALIZED THAT,
WE KIND OF BECAME OBSESSED

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.733
WITH GETTING IT, LIKE, PERFECT.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.200
LIKE, EVERY--EVEN THE LIGHTING.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
LIKE, I WOULD TRY TO NUZZLE
THE SAME WAY THAT SHE NUZZLED.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.033
WE COULD'VE DONE IT
A BIT BETTER,

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:24.833
BUT IT'S--IT'S PRETTY...

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.033
[laughter]

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:27.066
PRETTY GOOD.

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.666
- IT WAS FANTASTIC.

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.666
AND Y'ALL HAD TO LEARN--
HE HAD TO LEARN ALL THE WORDS

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.766
TO EVERY SINGLE--
EVERY BEAT OF THAT.

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.733
- AND I JUST HAD TO LEARN
TO STARE LONGINGLY

00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.900
AND DO A LOT OF--
THERE'S A LOT OF HAIR TOUSLING.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.733
AND I GOT RAZOR BURN
FROM FRANCO.

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.633
IT'S--YEAH, IT'S A TOUGH GIG.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:45.800
- BUT IT WAS
AN INTERESTING THING,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.633
BECAUSE HER HAIR, EVEN THOUGH
SHE WAS SITTING BACKWARDS,

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.133
HER HAIR WAS BLOWING
IN THE DIRECTION--

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.533
- HER HAIR'S BLOWING
THE WRONG WAY, YEAH.

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.666
AND THEN YOU DID
THE "VOGUE" COVER.

00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.733
YOU AND JAMES DID THE "VOGUE"
COVER THAT THEY DID.

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:58.533
- YEAH, IT WAS--ONCE YOU GET
A LAUGH WITH A JOKE,

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:01.733
YOU KIND OF WANT TO KEEP DOING
IT, I GUESS, IS THE INSTINCT.

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:04.566
SO, YEAH, IT, YOU KNOW--

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.566
YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS PROUD
OF THE LAUGHS YOU GET,

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:08.900
BUT IT...
[laughs]

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.933
WE PERPETUATED IT.

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:11.200
- BUT SO HE DIDN'T GET MAD
AT YOU.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.266
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
YOU KNOW, LIKE KIMMEL,

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.900
HE GOT MAD AT KIMMEL
FOR MAKING A JOKE,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.233
BUT WITH YOU,
HE ACTUALLY ASKED YOU

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:18.800
TO PERFORM AT HIS WEDDING,
I THINK.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.033
- HE BROUGHT IT UP, YEAH.

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.600
ME AND FRANCO GOT A CALL.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.266
HE SAID THAT HE WAS THINKING
IT MIGHT BE FUNNY

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.566
IF WE, LIKE--IF HE PERFORMED IT
AT THE WEDDING

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.566
AND WE CAME OUT ON A MOTORCYCLE.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.666
AND THEN WE'RE LIKE,
"AND THEN WHAT DO WE DO?"

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.366
AND THEN WE WERE ALL LIKE,
"I DON'T KNOW."

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:34.366
AND THEN WE WERE LIKE,

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:36.533
"THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE
VERY FUNNY THEN," BECAUSE--

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.433
HE'S LIKE, THEN I'M JUST RAPPING
WITH YOU AND JAMES FRANCO

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:40.600
ON A MOTORCYCLE
FOR FIVE MINUTES,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.366
AND THANK GOD, I THINK
IT WAS KIND OF A--REALIZED

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:45.366
THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE
THE BEST IDEA.

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:48.033
BUT IF HE WANTED ME THERE,
I WOULD'VE BEEN THERE--

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:50.533
NAKED, WITH A SHIRT OFF,
HOWEVER HE WANTED ME,

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:54.466
ON A MOTORCYCLE, DOING WHATEVER
HE NEEDED, 'CAUSE I'M A FAN.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:55.933
THAT'S JUST AS A FAN.

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:57.700
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT DOESN'T
TAKE A LOT TO GET YOU NAKED.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.066
IN THIS MOVIE, YOU'RE NAKED.

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.300
YOU'RE GLADLY NAKED, IT SEEMS.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.700
[stammers]

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.133
- [laughs]

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:06.733
- A LOT OF NAKEDNESS IN THIS--
IT IS.

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:08.933
IT REALLY IS HILARIOUS.
- THERE'S A LOT.

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:10.233
- AND YOU'RE SCREENING IT,

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:12.600
AND IT'S GETTING--
IT'S TESTING VERY HIGH, RIGHT?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.966
- YEAH, PEOPLE REALLY LOVE IT.

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.200
IT'S LIKE, IT PLAYS REALLY GREAT
IN A THEATER FULL OF PEOPLE.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.033
LIKE, THERE'S MASSIVE LAUGHTER.

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:20.200
IT'S ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES
I'VE EVER BEEN IN, I THINK.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.466
HONESTLY, LIKE...
- YEAH, I AGREE.

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:22.800
- IT'S REALLY--
YEAH, AND IT'S GREAT.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.033
IT'S VERY RELATABLE.

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:25.833
I THINK, LIKE, THE STORY IS
REALLY, LIKE, SWEET.

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:26.900
- I WAS SO MAD
THAT I DIDN'T THINK OF IT.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.466
I WAS LIKE, "WHY DIDN'T I
THINK OF THIS IDEA?"

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:30.633
IT'S SUCH A--SO THE MOVIE--
EXPLAIN WHAT--

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:32.333
- IT'S ABOUT, LIKE--
I PLAY A HUSBAND,

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.466
AND ME AND MY WIFE HAVE
A NEW BABY,

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:36.733
AND A LOT OF IT'S ABOUT HOW
WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.033
THAT WE CAN'T, LIKE, GO OUT
AND DRINK AND PARTY

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:40.700
AND DO ALL THE FUN STUFF
THAT YOU DO

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.200
BEFORE A BABY RUINS IT.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.066
AND THEN, UM--AND THEN TO KIND
OF ADD ON TO THAT,

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:47.766
A FRATERNITY MOVES IN NEXT DOOR
TO US

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:50.500
AND KIND OF, LIKE, BRINGS ALL
THE PROBLEMS TO THE SURFACE.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.100
- AND ZAC EFRON IS SHIRTLESS
CONSTANTLY,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.333
RUBBING IT IN YOUR FACE THAT
HE'S THIS GORGEOUS, YOU KNOW.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.666
- THE MOST HANDSOME DUDE
OF ALL TIME.

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:58.933
- THAT GETS TO JUST PLAY
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:00.600
THIS IS A GAME
THAT YOU AND YOUR WIFE PLAY,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.366
AND IT'S A VERSION OF, LIKE,
CRANIUM, RIGHT?

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:06.700
IT'S LIKE CHARADES, BUT YOU HAVE
TO MAKE THINGS OUT OF PLAY-DOH.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.900
- YES.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.133
- AND SO I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
MAKE THINGS OUT OF PLAY-DOH,

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:11.800
AND I WILL TRY TO GUESS
WHAT THEY ARE.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.833
- AWESOME.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:14.200
- THIS IS THRILLING FOR ME.
- YES, OKAY.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.566
IT'S THRILLING FOR ME AS WELL.

00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:16.600
- WOW! OH!

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.633
THAT'S A HEALTHY SERVING
RIGHT THERE.

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:19.066
- WELL...
- OKAY, YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:20.233
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE.

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:21.766
IT'S GOT TO BE...

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:23.300
- A CIVIL WAR RE-ENACTMENT.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.800
- ALL RIGHT.
- [laughs]

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.166
- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME,
SO...

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.566
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, READY?

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:29.100
- YES.
- HERE'S THE FIRST ONE.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.000
- OH, MAN. OH.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.133
I'M NEVER GONNA
BE ABLE TO DO IT.

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:34.233
OKAY.

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:35.533
- OH, IT SEEMS LIKE
A CLOCK IS ON.

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:37.066
- OH, DUDE.
- OH.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:38.266
- [grunting]
- OH, NO.

00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:40.400
- OH, NO.
OKAY.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.700
OKAY.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.933
IT'S GOT--THESE ARE--

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:45.200
- IS IT A DOG?
- [stammers]

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.766
- IS IT A CAT?
- YEAH!

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:48.933
[laughs]

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:50.466
- ALL RIGHT.
- BROKE THE RULES TECHNICALLY.

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:53.133
OKAY, EASY. EASY.

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:54.466
- A RING?
- YEAH.

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:56.533
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:58.366
- OH, SIMPLE.

00:04:58.366 --> 00:04:59.833
I'M GONNA TECHNICALLY BREAK
THE RULES AGAIN.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.133
THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS ONE
IS, I CAN JUST DO THIS.

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:04.633
- A YAMAKA?

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:06.233
- TECHNICALLY.
- A HAT?

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:09.500
- YES.
[laughs]

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.166
OKAY.

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:14.833
I AM BREAKING THE RULES BY
ACTING IT OUT TO SOME DEGREE,

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:16.533
BUT...

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:17.533
[buzzer sounds]

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:18.933
- OH, NO.
WAS THAT A SAXOPHONE?

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:20.366
- IT WAS.
- OHH.

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:24.433
- I'M GLAD YOU GUESSED THAT.
[laughs]

00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:27.433
- YOU WERE BLOWING.
- NOT THE ALTERNATIVE.
