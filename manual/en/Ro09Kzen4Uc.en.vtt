Hi! My name is John Armstrong with expertvillage.com.
I'm a professional guitar instructor and today

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.500
we are going to be studying beginning jazz
guitar. The next type of 7 chord that I would

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.920
like to discuss with you will be the dominant
7 chord. Now when it comes to 7 chords, we

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.289
just don't have major minor like major, minor,
diminished, augmented like we do with triads,

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.720
we also have a new chord value or chord quality
that we refer to as the dominant chord. Now

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.090
the dominant chord is created by flatting
the 7th notes, so the formula for that would

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:41.210
be root, 3rd, 5th and flatted and 7. So basing
that off my major scale here, my 2 octave

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:52.239
major scale off the string is A. What I am
going to have is a root, a 5th. Here's normally

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.500
the 7th note of the major scale. We are going
to flat it so 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 flatted. 1,2,3

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:08.310
we're going to add this 3rd here, 4,5, we
add the 5th and the root at the top. So we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:19.810
have a root, 5th, flatted 7th, 3rd, 5th and
root again. An A 7 or dominant 7. If you see

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.950
the letter number of the chord with just the
numbers 7 next to it. If there is nothing

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.740
specifying whether the chord is major or minor,
you assume that it is a dominant 7 chord.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.049
Major and minor must both be specified. Major
with either m, a,g,a, capital or upper case

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.049
M are often times a triangle symbol is used
to specify major. Minor with a lower case

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.189
m sometimes min or sometimes a dash symbol
is used to specify minor but it is just the

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.939
letter and the number 7 you have a dominant
7 chord. The same thing would apply to 9's,

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.719
11's and13's. You must specify major versus
minor with those, otherwise you are playing

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.609
a dominant chord.
