00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.710
Welcome to 2 minute neuroscience, where I
simplistically explain neuroscience topics

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.069
in 2 minutes or less.

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.809
In this installment I will discuss neuroimaging.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:12.150
I will cover a few of the most common types
of neuroimaging: CAT scans, MRI, PET scans,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.440
and fMRI.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.890
Some neuroimaging techniques allow us to see
the structure of the brain, while others allow

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.480
us to look at brain activity or function.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.699
Computerized tomography, also known as computerized
axial tomography, is a type of structural

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.699
neuroimaging.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.490
It is usually called a CAT or CT scan.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.020
It involves taking a series of x-ray images
from various locations around the head.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.250
These images can then be combined to construct
an image of the brain.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.950
The resolution of CT images is not that high,
but they can visualize any major structural

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.989
problems with the brain, like a tumor.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.500
Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, involves
applying a combination of magnetic fields

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.150
and radiofrequency energy waves to the brain.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.100
Hydrogen atoms respond to the magnetic fields
and radiofrequency pulses by emitting energy.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.629
The MRI machine receives this energy and can
tell what part of the brain it came from.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.789
A computer can use that information to reconstruct
an image of the brain that has high spatial

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.550
resolution.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.000
Positron emission tomography, or PET scanning,
is a way of imaging brain function.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.370
To do a PET scan, a patient is injected with
a radioactive substance that emits positrons,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.140
which then emit gamma rays when they collide
with electrons in brain tissue.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.450
These gamma rays are detected by the PET scanner.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.640
Because the radioactive substance was injected
into the bloodstream, what the PET scanner

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.680
is detecting is the movement of blood throughout
the brain.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.120
Blood flow to an area of the brain increases
when that area is active, so PET scanning

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.920
creates an image that highlights the areas
of the brain that are being used the most

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.479
while the person is in the scanner.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.979
Functional MRI, or fMRI, uses a similar approach
to MRI but focuses on the different responses

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.770
oxygenated and unoxygenated blood make to
magnetic fields and radiofrequency energy.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.950
fMRI uses what is called blood-oxygen-level-dependent
contrast, or BOLD, to identify changes in

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.110
blood flow in the brain, and thus to identify
areas of the brain that are most active.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.590
fMRI allows one to image brain function without
having to inject anything, and it provides

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.409
high resolution MRI images at the same time
as it provides a functional image.
