Hello, my name is Luis Estrada, and I'm a
software developer. In this clip, we will

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.629
talk about installing Internet Explorer skins.
Internet Explorer is a registered trademark

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.050
of Microsoft, and I'm in no way affiliated
with Microsoft. When you look for skins in

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.750
the Internet Explorer add-ons website, you
get just a few results of software created

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.019
by a third party. The thing about installing
software, that is not created by Microsoft,

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.490
is that you cannot be sure of what you will
get, until you install it, and unfortunately,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.500
a lot of software nowadays, also installs
Spyware or Adware, that makes your computer

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.399
and Internet connections slower. Now, I'm
not saying that any of these extensions are

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.789
bad. Some of them are extraordinary. What
I am saying, is that you would have to install

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.820
and try them at your own risk. It appears
that Internet Explorer wasn't truly created

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.620
with graphical interface customization in
mind. The reason I haven't installed any of

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.600
these applications, that add skins to your
Internet Explorer, is that when I want to

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.159
have a web browser, looking exactly as I want,
I prefer to use Opera. In Opera, it is incredibly

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.250
simple to add new skins, and you do not have
to worry about installing software, that might

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.530
do something else, than just changing the
graphical interface. In Opera, select Tools,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.759
and Appearance.Here I have a list of installed
skins. By selecting each one, you see in real

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:50.189
time, how the browser would look. You can
also change the color of each.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.899
If you want to try another skin, just select
the Find More Skins option. You can get a

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.920
list of tons of different options. Select
the one you want, by pressing the Download

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:11.500
button.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.550
Once downloaded, the skin is applied, so you
can see how it looks. If you like the skin,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:29.160
press Yes to keep it, or no to discard it.
Opera is free, and installation is very simple.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.870
I'm Luis Estrada, and I've just shown you
how to use your web browser.
