Welcome back to another cooking video, I am
Chef Devaux and today I am going to teach

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.370
you how to make two beautiful garnishes that
you can add to your sushi platters or any

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.770
other food recipe for that matter, and just
elevate that presentation and make it a little

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.820
bit more beautiful.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.299
Okay, so let's start with the carrot one first,
let's go.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.829
Carrot Swirl Garnish
Alright so you start off with a big carrot

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:27.289
and just cut a slice off one side to have
a working surface, and then you take a cheese

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.269
knife or something similar to create a thin
slice, and you make a thin slice with your

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.530
carrot, and then you take this thin slice,
place it on a cutting board and grab your

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.690
knife.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:46.300
Now you cut 45° angle slices across your
carrot which are 2.5cm wide, 1-inch, and 7.5cm

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:55.969
long, 3-inch, and you just make these slices
all the way across your carrot, however many.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.969
And once you're done with that you take your
carrot slice and you place it in some slightly

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:01.969
salted water.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.550
This will make it a bit pliable.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.780
After two or three minutes you take it out
and then you cut smaller incisions on the

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.710
inside of the carrot which are about 2mm to
3mm wide and leave the top and bottom of your

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:31.570
carrot slice uncut so it stays as one piece
-- just like so.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.020
Once you're done you pick it up and you curl
it tightly around a chopstick and then place

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.270
it down on the cutting board and place something
on top of it to keep it in place for two or

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.090
three minutes.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.229
After two or three minutes have passed you
take it off and then unwind it softly, and

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.290
place it wherever you need to and just feather
out your curls, and voilà there you go, the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.439
carrot swirl is done.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.619
Vegetable Twisties
Alright, so now to make a very simple garnish,

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.300
it's called a Triangle Twisty and literally
you can make this with any vegetable.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.120
I am just using a cucumber here.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.390
I am just going to cut the skin off and then
I am going to refine the edges of this piece

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.580
I just cut off the cucumber to make it into
a rectangle.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.250
Alright, so now I am going to cut two slits
into the rectangle leaving a margin about

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.330
2mm to 3mm on each side and cutting them from
opposite sides to create three even parts

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.610
that are still united together in a sort of
zigzag shape.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.730
Now I just bend the two arms out and that
makes a little triangle which just adds a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.760
little something to a plate, and just livens
it up a little bit.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.300
You can make these out of any vegetable, basically,
and the best thing is you can use scraps or

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.010
leftovers to make these pieces of garnish
-- so that's great.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.340
Alright, so there we go, now you know how
to make these beautiful garnishes, it's up

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.910
to you to add them to your sushi platters
and any other food type, just elevate that

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.990
presentation a little bit.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.270
Just make it look a little more beautiful
for your friends.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.820
