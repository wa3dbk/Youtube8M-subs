00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:23.340
Quick, what do Twilight Princess, Sonic 3D
Blast, Yoshi�s Cookie, and MTV�s Celebrity

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.779
Deathmatch have in common? That�s right,
they all launched on two adjacent generations

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.260
of hardware. Usually, it�s a bad sign; a
moneymaking ploy that tends to underline just

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.800
how dead one system is and how little effort
went into taking advantage of whatever new

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.949
shinyness the emergent generation offers.
Behold, Sonic 3D Blast: the infamous hedgehog�s

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:50.100
swan song on the Genesis what got slapped
onto the Saturn when Sonic X-Treme just kinda...

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.150
failed to happen. So, of course, the Saturn
offered what the Genesis version was missing,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.140
like tighter controls, right?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:07.320
Wrong. Sonic�s quest to dismantle the roboticized
flickies and deliver them safely to the goal

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.500
ring is, unfortunately, just as sloppy as
its previous version - which is to say it�s

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.720
crafted from the elemental forces of ice and
frustration. Your goal is to traverse each

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.909
isometric stage, defeating foes and getting
the flickies they contain to follow you - just

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.340
like in the arcade classic, Flicky - but actually
managing to aim yourself so as to not die

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.430
can be a bit on the tricky side. Initially,
you�re gonna be slip-sliding all over the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.219
place, and later than initially, much the
same will be the case. It doesn�t really

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.310
improve, though you can kinda get used to
it through liberal use of the B button to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.450
duck into a spin-dash (one of the only ways
to make good use of your momentum) and religiously

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.150
collecting as many shields as possible. But
let�s put that aside. That�s all gripes

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.530
I�ve had since the Genesis version. This
is the SATURN, after all, which means all

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.219
sorts of new opportunities, am I right? Like,
how about redoing the entire soundtrack to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.990
take advantage of the much richer Redbook
audio available now that the game�s on a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.880
CD-based format? Sure, it doesn�t have that
classic Genesis bassy twang like it did before,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.370
but the improvements far outweigh the losses,
sound-wise. Load times, on the other hand...

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:23.510
ehhh. Well, that�s the price you pay for
an upgraded soundtrack.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.120
As you might also notice, the textures for
the playfield and characters also look much

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.489
more refined, taking advantage of the Saturn�s
increased power. Enhanced visual effects include

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.879
this waterfall, or the torquing of any bridges
you happen to roll over. But the most pronounced

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.770
change comes in the requisite Bonus Stages,
where you�re trying to obtain the Chaos

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.569
Emeralds so that Dr. Eggnik Robotman can�t
get his confusingly-named mitts on them. Now,

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.319
Sonic 3D Blast on the Genesis just had a �collect
rings on a track� mechanic, activated by

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.520
passing off 50 or more rings to Tails or Knuckles.
This Saturn version, though, features an all-new

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.410
take on... oh, what the hell, it�s just
a 3D version of the half-pipe style bonus

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.430
stages from Sonic 2. That said, it�s a 3D
version of the half-pipe style bonus stages

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.519
from Sonic 2! Considered by many to be one
of the most fun bonus games, it�s been rebuilt

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.190
with new twists and turns, hedgehog accelerators,
and timed rings that yield more bling the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.660
faster you navigate the course. A refreshing
update of an old favorite... but whether it�s

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.909
worth the ice-skating and load times that
plague the rest of the game is a much more

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:30.510
personal matter.
