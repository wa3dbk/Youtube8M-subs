00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:07.129
Hi everybody.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.500
It's Jay, here with another edition of the
"We Make it Easy Video Series" for BuyAutoParts.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.440
Today, we're going to do a catalytic converter
on a 2003 Honda CR-V.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.150
We're going to use just basic set of metric
tools today.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Nothing fancy.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.070
It's just a few nuts and bolts, O2 sensor.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.789
Should be an easy-off-easy-on kind of job.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.390
A little easier for us because we're working
with the lift, but shouldn't be too difficult

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.230
of a job for you to do at home.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.510
Let's go ahead and get started and take a
look.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.210
First to get started, I'm going to use a special
O2 sensor socket here.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.280
Anything that you can get in there that's
22mm will work for you.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.260
These sometimes are a little bit sticky, so
if you happen to use a bolt loosening agent

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.690
of some sort, lubrication, if you get that
soaked in there and get the bolt loosened

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.640
up, that might help you out.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:13.929
But if you don't live in too rusty an area,
like here in California, it shouldn't be too

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:22.689
much of a problem for you at all.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:32.369
You can go ahead and move that to the side
so it's out of our way.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:56.070
I'm going to remove the three bolts here on
the back of the catalytic converter.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:07.270
Alright, moving up to the front of the cat
here, we're just going to take these two nuts

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:19.480
off and we'll have the old one out already.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.269
There you go.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.770
Old one out, we'll grab the new one and pop
it right in there.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:39.951
This particular cat comes with a new gasket
when you purchase it new so we're going to

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.710
pull the old one off here.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.710
And pop that one on.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:03:25.390
And then we bid everything down and press
that on and make a nice tight fit and won't

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.280
have any exhaust leaks.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:54.190
We're going to tighten everything down.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:13.200
We'll just tighten the three nuts and bolts
here on the back.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.359
And we're going to move on to the O2 sensor
and be on our way.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:39.310
Alright, there you 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.310
have it.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.310
Just that easy.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.460
High-quality parts from BuyAutoParts.com.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.940
Old one out, new one in.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.520
Just these two bolts on the front, the three
bolts on the back, and O2 sensor and simple

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.520
as that.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.740
So with the set of basic metric tools.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.240
Get up under on the car.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:07.430
Make sure it's nice and safe when you're working
under the car and you should be all good.
