On behalf of Expert Village my name is Tom
Roland and we're at Cottonwood Motor Sports

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.379
and I'm here to tell you about doing a service
on a Polaris Quad and this is fairly representative

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.710
of many of them. Another thing that's often
over looked is the tires and when you're checking

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.490
the tires you want to jack the wheel off the
ground and you want to look it all over for

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.980
thorn holes you want to look for any nails
or things. On tubeless tires, commonly something

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.900
can go in the tire and if it stays in the
tire it'll stay up, that's one of the advantages

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.030
of tubeless tires. The other thing is air
pressure. Air pressure on a locked rear end

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.560
vehicle is very, very important. People commonly
say my vehicle pulls, my unit pulls to the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.590
right or pulls to the left when I drive it
and I don't know what's wrong. Well, on a

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.450
vehicle that doesn't have a differential in
the back or say when this one is in 2x4 vs.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.960
turf mode, the problem is, if the tires aren't
exactly the right, same circumference, which

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.030
usually is a function of tire pressure, then
the larger tire is gonna be the more forceful

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.601
tire and it's gonna try to make it veer. Say
the left tire is slightly larger in diameter

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:17.350
due to having more pressure in it it's gonna
make it pull to the right. If the left tire

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.250
is larger in diameter, it's gonna make it
pull to the left. Sometimes if both tires

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.700
have the exact pressure on these kind of tires
they won't be exactly the same diameter and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.300
in the past the only true way to know is to
run a tape measure around the outside. If

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.920
a person is not having a problem with it,
they both have nine pounds in it, it drives

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.610
OK, you're not really having an issue then
ordinarily it wouldn't be a deal. But if you

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.110
are having problems like that and you suspect
that that could be the issue then the only

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.380
way to really tell is put a tape measure around
the entire outside of the wheel and compare

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.250
both wheels together because sometimes these
tires will, one will swell up a little more

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.210
than the other. Also, the other thing with
alignment is checking the front end. On a

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.200
Polaris when the handlebars are sitting straight,
most Polaris' front end, the handlebars would

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.620
be, the front wheels would be towed out a
half an inch which is 1/4 of an inch each

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.030
way from straight. The camber and the caster
on the front end isn't adjustable, if it changes

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.329
it's usually because somethings bent. But,
the tie rod adjustments or wear or a wheel

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.909
being bent or something like that those are
all things you have to look for. These are

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.329
utility vehicles, they're not a Lexus car,
okay, they don't go down the road, they don't

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.139
go down the road perfectly, they're a utility
vehicle, but they still, they should drive

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:49.450
good and they shouldn't have problems and
you should be able to take your hand off the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.140
bar and it shouldn't shoot of the side of
the road. So, those are all, those are all

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.989
things that have to be looked at. Different
units have different tire pressures. Rangers,

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:05.609
9 to 12 pounds say, a unit like this might
be 6 to 8 pounds, it just depends on the unit.

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.249
Smaller units usually take less tire pressure,
bigger. Heavier units usually have more tire

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:10.619
pressure.
