Hi, this is Kim, Program Director for SlimGenics.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.509
I'm excited to tell you about one of my
favorite SlimGenics products

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.890
Thermo-Boost, our great-tasting weight loss energy drink.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.080
Do you need a little more energy? Well who
doesn't!

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.460
Thermo-Boost is an anti-oxidant energy
drink that also promotes weight loss

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.910
by increasing your metabolism with our
special blend of fat fighting nutrients.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.590
Thermo-Boost has a long list of
benefits for those who are losing weight.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.000
Thermo-Boost revs up metabolism, helps
burn storage fat,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.809
increases nutrient absorption, fights fatigue,

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.229
attacks free radicals that can cause
cancer,

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.729
boosts energy and performance, and it
includes a dietary fiber

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.719
to help you feel full and satisfied. Many
of our clients have replaced their

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.109
coffee with their Thermo-Boost and they love how
they feel.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.379
Thermo-Boost is an awesome, ready
to mix drink that

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.839
comes in lots of different flavors,
provides anti-oxidants,

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.989
provides energy, I can keep it with me all
day, and it's a really great part of the SlimGenics

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:02.859
program.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.159
I'm cheating on my coffee with Thermo-Boost. You know, when I have a Thermo-Boost I think it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.350
makes me more alert.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.640
I had one on the way here this morning. I
drink two Thermo-Boosts a day,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.390
love the berry in the morning and the lime
in the afternoon. It's great. The ingredients

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.299
in Thermo-Boost have anti-inflammatory
properties

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.770
and its ingredients have been shown to
reduce allergy symptoms.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.159
Thermo-Boost is full of essential
vitamins and nutrients

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.369
like quercetin and herbs like green tea,
ginseng,

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.880
ginkgo, and chicory root. And another great
benefit to Thermo-Boost

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.460
is that its easy to take with you. Our
convenient stick packs

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.210
make Thermo-Boost the perfect companion. Just toss a few stick packs into your

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.049
bad, your backpack, or your gym bag.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.390
And Thermo-Boost comes in four delicious
flavors:

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.820
orange, berry, lime, and grape. For

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.240
energy and for fat burning properties that
support your weight loss program,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.600
Thermo-Boost is your daily must-have
weight loss enhancer and energy booster.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.060
