00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.850
How to Keep a Baby Calm on a Flight.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.179
Reduce your chances of becoming the seatmate
everyone hates by learning how to head off

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.639
a screaming jag.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.630
You will need A seat over the wing A baby
bottle, breast milk, or a pacifier Frequent

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.430
diaper checks A midweek, midday flight and
a baby stroller.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.449
Step 1.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.800
Try to arrange your flight so it coincides
with your baby’s naptime or bedtime so they’ll

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.800
be sleepy.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.550
Fly midweek, and midday if you can; flights
then are less crowded.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.550
Step 2.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.060
Request a seat over the wing.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.680
That’s where the engines are located, and
some moms find the noise lulls infants to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.700
sleep.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.010
Don’t check your baby stroller; use it all
the way to the gate, and then ask the gate

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.640
attendants to stow it.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.640
Step 3.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.090
Feed your baby during takeoff and landing,
or give them a pacifier.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.890
Sucking and swallowing helps prevent the painful
earache that can develop due to air pressure

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.379
changes in the cabin.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.360
And offer them your breast or a bottle often
during the flight to prevent dehydration.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.540
The Transportation Security Administration
allows you to bring more than three ounces

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.330
of baby formula, breast milk, or juice so
long as you declare these items for inspection

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.770
at the checkpoint.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.770
Step 4.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.990
Walk your baby up and down the aisle if they
start to fuss.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.260
The combination of the motion and the change
of scenery can stop a crying fit in its tracks.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.560
Bring a baby sling to make pacing more pleasant.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560
Step 5.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.700
Check their diapers often so a soggy or poopy
diaper doesn’t have a chance to send them

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.950
into a tizzy.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.950
Step 6.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.950
Nothing working?

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.190
Hide in the bathroom for a while (as long
as you’re not inconveniencing other passengers).

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.720
The close quarters will provide a soothing
cocoon for you and your baby, and you’ll

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.310
escape the nasty looks of your seatmates for
a while!

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
Did you know Seventy-one percent of travelers
surveyed think families with young children

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.560
should sit in their own section of a plane.
