00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.960
Hello. How are you doing David?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.600
What's up?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.400
Nice to meet you.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.400
- Where are we going?
- At the hotel.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.400
Can you open the window and scream: "I love Paris".

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
Yeah, you know the spirit of Paris.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.320
Ok I'll do it.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.160
One, two, three.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200
I love Paris!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.320
If you had the opportunity to ask a question to a
player, which one would it be?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.600
And what would it be?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.280
Well, I'd like to ask Roger Federer…

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.960
Despite his apparent coolness, what does he feel
in the tough moments of a game?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What is he thinking of?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.200
What is happening in his head?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.160
It's an excellent picture, really funny.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.800
I'd shave my hair. If I won Roland-Garros, 
I would cut my hair easily.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.600
Oh yeah?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.520
Completely shaved?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
Completely. And my coach would do it to!

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.200
A question from the Internet.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.760
What are your objectives for Roland Garros?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.800
To play Lukas Lacko on the first round.
He's a really good player, very dangerous.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.600
That's it as I try to live for the moment.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.400
I live every game to its fullest either at Roland Garros
or at an other tournament.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.600
I take one game at the time.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.600
A picture for…

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600
I can't do it.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.200
- I look like a cat.
- Come on, do it!

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.200
Ok, I'll do it.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.600
It's a cat or a kitten.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.000
Well  it worked pretty well.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.400
Why it doesn't work?
