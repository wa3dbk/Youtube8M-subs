00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.900
Welcome to our two thousand eleven culinary
arts showcase. This event is turning into

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.480
a triangle tradition.
&gt;&gt;Who would miss this right? Oh my gosh this

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.480
is like the highlight for me. The teams had
two hours each to create a cake depicting

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.169
the theme which is cruising the open road.
&gt;&gt;We're here to check them out, get some ideas,

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.689
and watch how they play with their pondip.
&gt;&gt;What do you think?

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.230
&gt;&gt;Awesome, its awesome.
&gt;&gt;And why do you think it's so good?

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.950
&gt;&gt;um..I want to be a chief when I grow up
and to just see all the opportunities and stuff

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.330
around here that I could end up doing.
&gt;&gt;And I don't know if you saw the cakes that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.830
the judges decorated.
&gt;&gt;I think mines looking pretty good over there.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.490
&gt;&gt;I think I am pretty talented at it. I think
I'm gonna enter the competition next year.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.490
Can I take that one off?
&gt;&gt;Yes, what you can do is you can take it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.080
off and put another one in its place
&gt;&gt;do over

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
&gt;&gt;uh...its awesome, its really cool, all the
designs that people can do there just really

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.100
cool.
&gt;&gt;They are very talented, its very neat to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.470
watch, but no i don't think i could do it

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.110

dollars? Okay. Eighty dollars give me ninety.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.549
&gt;&gt;I'd like to recognize one individual without
whom this would never have happened. She heads

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.860
