00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.560
I'm here at Geostick
in the Netherlands

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.960
at one of our flagship customers,
one of our reference sites.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.280
They have here three
WS 6600's HP Indigo presses

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.360
running continuously,
full time, printing labels

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.440
together with AVG
finishing equipment.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.800
At Geostick, we've been working now
for eight years with the HP Indigo presses.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.040
We are organizing, together with HP,
at the moment an open house.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.000
We have around 90
Print Service Providers (PSPs).

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.120
It's a nice moment to network and
leverage each other's experience.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.040
Our company is specialized in producing
 labels for the wine and spirits industry

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.080
and it is a market that requires 
much of reactivity, regarding deadlines.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.040
Therefore, thanks to digital
(printing),

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.000
we could offer our clients record time processing 
that couldnÂ´t be done in some cases.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.800
You see that digital plays
a massive business role

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.960
through the interest of the
brand owner and the printer.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.440
So, do not think that it's
just a printing technology.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.240
It is a business booster.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.920
What I get back from my experience and working
with these HP Indigo presses is that,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.280
of course, the quality is
superb but the nicest thing,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.560
what I always say, is that I have time to quickly
deliver the label and the production to my clients.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.320
The output, at the end of the day
is much higher vs. the conventional.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.720
What is the volume done
on digital vs. analog?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.400
If you see the number
of jobs we have every month,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.800
an average of 1,800
production orders,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.320
2/3 are digital.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.920
So 1/3 is conventional.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.560
We are an existing HP user.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.840
We have an Indigo 6000.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.960
We're here looking
at the 6600.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.120
We're considering
a second machine now.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.840
So, it's been really useful for us to see
what Cees at Geostick has done

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.120
in installing their
three 6600's.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.760
I'll be interested in seeing
the inline primer today

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.120
and very interesting for me and for colleagues
that also create labels to see the inline finishing.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.600
Let's get into some
of the highlights,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.560
for instance, on the inline primer,
what difference did it make?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.400
The two biggest reasons
for us were the work flow.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.360
We don't have to think
about priming anymore.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.440
So, when the job goes to the press, you're
starting to prime the material on the press.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.600
It's more on the spot.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.960
The second thing is what
I experienced with offline priming.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.040
It happens that you put the roll
on the machine that was badly primed

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.640
and then you
lose productivity.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:05.360
Today our visit to a company such as Geostick
with a strong presence in the label industry

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.400
gives us the chance to learn a lot of
new ways to work, new processes,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.160
from a company
that is open

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.280
and that shows us the way they work.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.760
So, we have customers that come here to see
the machines live and talk to each other.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.320
They talk to the
management of Geostick

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.240
and they share ideas
about new applications,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.360
about new production
methods and about business.
