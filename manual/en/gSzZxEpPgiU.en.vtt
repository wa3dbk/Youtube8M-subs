00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:05.100
For you people who are looking for a hardy
Primula,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.020
this is a great selection here

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.999
This is Primula Denticulata

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:13.849
commonly called the Drumstick Primula.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:14.849
Like most

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.929
Primroses or Primula they do like 
to be sort of in a half-sun

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.990
half-shade situations 
so we've

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.000
got it in our garden here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.499
on this north-facing

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:26.929
flowerbed.

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.029
It comes up very early in the spring

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.960
bloom time is about

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.770
four to six weeks

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.770
and they come in this lavender-blue color,
white and a darker, rosy pink variety as well.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.130
So in the spring

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.700
it'll just be a tight whole set of leaves poking
out of the ground

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.580
and you'll see the buds just sitting there and as it
warms up a little bit as it explodes down the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.300
middle like this

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.600
these nice drumsticks

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.010
and just a real foolproof Primrose that's
going to survive for you every winter no matter what. 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.630
It's really, really hardy.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.570
The next plant we're going to talk about 
is the Helleborus

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.470
or commonly called the Christmas Rose
or Lenten Rose, 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.409
are one of the first things to bloom in the
spring

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.460
some varieties are

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.790
truly evergreen, others too come out fresh
with their leaves and flowers

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.909
very early in the season

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.140
usually 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.260
beginning in March,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.390
that time frame.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.560
They have a very unique flower to them

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.250
and they vary in

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.060
many different

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.990
pastel colors and now there are some brighter double,
roughly varieties coming out and the raspberry

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.390
swirls and

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.350
even some yellow tones and so on

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.360
pure white.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.250
A good plant for the Okanagan

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.610
It is deer resistant.
Another shade-loving plant 
so they're in our 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.659
north-facing bed

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:59.940
and all this growth will

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.710
be new this year so none of this
is a variety that is evergreen.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.179
All that was fresh growth 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.979
that came out of the ground

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.819
and just a must-have if you got deer
issues and you've got a shaded garden.
The safest is the Helleborus.
