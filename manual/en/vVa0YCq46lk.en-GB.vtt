00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I've always loved cats and

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.500
the character of Simon's Cats is definitely inspired by my own four cats.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.200
Well, first off there's Jess.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
And she's a little tortoise shell.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.790
She is quite clingy

6
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.160
and when I'm in the house she's never more than a couple of feet away from me

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.000
and she will follow me around and whine for attention and food.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Um...

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.300
which can be a little annoying sometimes but I do love her to bits.

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.070
I have a real soft spot for Jess

11
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.000
because she's been with me for so long.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Next up there's Maisy.

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Maisy is a huge great big white and grey spotted tabby,

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
who is absolutely gorgeous to look at.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.500
Um... she's a rescue cat and can be a little
frosty sometimes

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.300
especially with the others come feeding time.

17
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.000
But, she is a big softy... really.

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Then there's Hugh!

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Hugh is a big fat black cat, who, again he's very lovable.

20
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.700
He has very lovely, thick, dense fur, which the others don't have.

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.020
Which makes him very cuddly.

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.000
He is very affectionate in the mornings, before he gets fed basically.

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's probably Hugh actually who is the main inspiration for Simon's Cat because,

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.500
it was him that gave me the idea when he was a kitten.

25
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.000
Teddy is the new member of the family and again,

26
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
he's another rescue cat.

27
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
He was found in a box.

28
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And when I heard the story of the way he was found,

29
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.300
I had to take him in.

30
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.000
But now, since then, he's grown in to this huge great cat,

31
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.200
with a huge great big fluffy tail

32
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.500
that sweeps the ground as he walks around so he's er,

33
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.000
he's quite a character Teddy.

34
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And he's a real sweet heart as well!
