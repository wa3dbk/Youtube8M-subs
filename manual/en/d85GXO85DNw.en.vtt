This recipe is a little bit plain flavor, so you can add more soy sauce or ketchup if you like.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.700
I used mirin in the sauce as sweetener.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.500
But you can use other sweetener like cane sugar instead of mirin.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.840
Enjoy making your own flavor.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:35.200
Some people don’t like putting pineapple in this recipe, so just skip it if you don’t like it.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.700
See you next week!
