00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.890
On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Bill
Bassett and I am here to tell you about how

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.890
to play the pedal steel guitar. The knee levers
are very important also. They do the same

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.440
type of thing but they are activated with
the knees. This one on my right knee pushing

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.581
towards the inside changes my E strings down
half step. If I go to the other side, it changes

00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:37.860
both E strings half an up step. So I can play
and get chord changes that way. The knee levers

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.760
on the other side do important functions too.
The same mechanisms apply but on different

00:00:43.760 --> 00:01:09.610
strings. I've got A, I can change. You can
make all sorts of different changes. If I

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:23.759
want to hit a 7th chord, on my left knee the
lever that pushes the outside changes that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.289
up so that I have a 7th chord and I've got
one that goes vertically too so that I've

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:39.880
got a major chord with my pedals down. I raise
up on one pedal and it lowers the string to

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:53.689
a minor interval so that I get a major A minor
chord and back. It's an amazing set of possibilities.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.630
In this case, 7 pedals and 5 knee levers,
any other guitar that you might find might

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.029
have similar setups or completely different
and they all work on the same principle that

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:11.670
if the pedal changes the pitch of the strings
up or down and from that you can construct

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.330
in this array of chord changes and voicings.
