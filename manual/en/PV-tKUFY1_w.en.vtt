My name's Kurt Jenson. I'm a freelance photographer
in Eugene, Oregon. And I'm going to talk a

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.220
little bit about the pros and cons of being
a photo journalist. And often they're, they're

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.610
pretty much the same thing. One of the things
I really like about photo journalism is you,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.609
is you get to be involved in the community.
You are, you know, your, your job is to, is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.259
to interview people, is to find out what the
story is to get, to get at the heart of the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.320
story. And it may not be what you think it
is when you start, but after talking with

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.760
some of the community members, getting involved
in the issues you, you find out what the story's

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.140
really about and then it's your job to try
and make pictures that illustrate that story.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.380
And to me that's, that's always a lot of fun.
I just enjoy getting involved in the community

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.980
and meeting community members. And finding
out what the, what the real issues are that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.070
are important to them. Often what that requires,
however, is lots and lots of long hours. Hours

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.059
that, that you don't get paid for. It used
to involve lots of hours in the dark room.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.860
Today that doesn't, that isn't so much the
issue, but you do spend a lot more time behind

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.189
the computer rather than the dark room. Which
is not something that I, that I really anticipated.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.979
And of course you're out in all kinds of weather.
You know, news doesn't, doesn't stop for,

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.060
for bad weather. And in fact news often occurs
when the, when the weather's the worst, so.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.470
So you're working outside a lot and in all
kinds of conditions. And, and again, sometimes

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:38.409
that's fun, sometimes it's not. I guess the,
the, the negative side of getting involved

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.270
in the community is sometimes you have to
cover really tragic events. Which is, which

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.810
is something I don't like to do. Some of,
some of my, some of the things that have been

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.159
very memorable, memorable. But my least favorite
assignments have been covering like accidents

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.210
and funerals. That stuff is important because
we just don't cover the, our, our achievements

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.470
and the joys of life, but we also cover the
tragedy. And, you know, all that's important.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.860
It's part of the, of the human condition and
that's what we cover and so. So, yeah, so

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.120
a lot of things that are good about the, about
the career are also some of the things I don't

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.800
like about it too.
