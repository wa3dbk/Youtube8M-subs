00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Day 2 - and our journey took us from
Curitiba east to the coast, and then north

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.639
up along the coast to Santos - and from there
we went up to Ubatuba, where we finished our

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.289
journey.

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.240
When we left Curitiba, the sky was fairly
grey, and in fact there was a slight drizzle.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.010
As we headed east we could see the good weather
we were going to get to, but before then we

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.100
had to cross the mountains.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.960
And the mountains had clouds dusting across
the top of them.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.550
As we crossed over the main ridge we could
see the cloud almost enclosed within the mountain

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.700
valleys.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.429
It was a majestic sight, and actually rather
dramatic.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.429
So we got to the coast - we refuelled before
we started our journey north.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:52.960
We passed islands, lighthouses - We had forts,
fantastic beaches...

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.571
.We passed towns - one of which was the first,
I believe, populated place in Brazil, when

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:02.069
it was discovered.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.430
Further up the coast, we came to Santos, which
actually is the biggest port (we were told

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.630
by Jorge, our pilot) in Brazil.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.070
We also discovered the most extraordinary
thing, which was the cemetery in Santos...

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.550
which actually looks like a skyscraper.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.210
Perhaps because of limited space, people have
gone up as opposed to down.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.990
Close to the cemetery was the stadium where
PelÃ© played, and of course he was known to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.500
everybody who loves football around the world.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.930
And along the seafront at Santos, Jorge pointed
out that several of the skyscrapers are actually

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.000
beginning to lean!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.280
And when you look at them, it's absolutely
true.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.430
I have to say that I don't care to buy an
apartment in a building that's leaning about

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910
10 degrees - an extraordinary sight!

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.860
We ended our journey at Isla Bella, which
means 'Beautiful Island'... and it truly was

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.860
a beautiful island!

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.570
It was almost like one mountain range.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.860
We discovered a great waterfall and some fantastic
beaches.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.550
One of the interesting sights is an old prison
- and the ruins still stand.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.750
I mean, one has to say it's in a fantastic
position, but not perhaps if you're locked

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.030
into one of the cells!

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.940
And our journey ended at Ubatuba, which is
clearly a very popular resort, because out

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.700
on some of promontories were some truly magnificent
but no doubt very expensive holiday homes.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.170
Tomorrow is Day 3 and we continue north up
the coast - but of course what we're gonna

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.459
see tomorrow is Rio de Janeiro.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.870
And that's something I can't wait to see.
