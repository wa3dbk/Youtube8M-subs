00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.990
We'll start by turning our cake out onto our
serving platter. Now if you don't have a platter

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.719
or a tray to put your cake on, you can make
one with a double thickness of cardboard that's

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.369
covered with tin foil. Okay, I have a cake
box bottom that I'm going to turn mine on.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.949
Now I want my cake to be facing up because
I want for the teddy bear, we want the roundedness

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.180
of top of the take, so I want, I need first
the turn the cake the out and then put it

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.580
back onto our tray. Now I'm using a cutting
board with a little piece of baking paper

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.140
here so the cake doesn't stick to the board
while I'm turning it and you can put the cutting

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.760
board, just lay it right on top, and turn
like this. Now if the cake does not come out,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:03.010
then you want to take a spatula and very gently
go around the edge like this. Now what I do

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.790
to, for like a no-fail, get-your-cake-out-without-
ruining-it, I always put a piece of baking

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.830
paper on the bottom before I bake my cake
and then I grease all the sides and bottom

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.610
of the cake. So you'll see the baking paper
when we turn this out. Now we've loosened

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.860
the sides and then just give it a shake until
you feel it release and there's our cake,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.970
out nice and neat. Now this is the baking
paper that I'd placed on the bottom of the

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:47.920
pan and you see I've cut it exactly the size
of the bottom of the pan and this is a no-fail

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.360
way to get the cake out of the pan. Now when
you have it out and you've removed your baking

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.630
paper, then you simply put the tray or the
platter like that and flip the cake right

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.140
over. Remove this; now center your cake and
we're ready to start.
