00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:02.166
Hey guys, a lot of you
ask me questions about how

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.334
I look so damn good in photos.

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:05.739
(crowd whistling and cheering)

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:08.398
And the truth is that
normally I look terrible.

00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:10.418
(sad trombone)

00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:12.693
The fact of the matter is,
people who look good in photos

00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:15.340
are trying to look good in photos.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.451
It's not that you may or may
not be naturally photogenic,

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.819
it just may be that you
haven't spent as much time

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:22.050
thinking about how you look in photos

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.418
as people who literally
spend all day, every day

00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:27.054
prepping to take pictures, like models,

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:29.538
or actors, or my dog.

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:30.490
(bell dings)

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.814
Anyway, here's some tips and tricks

00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:33.834
for how to be more photogenic.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.538
(magical harp strumming)

00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:38.101
Tip number one I use a lot.

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.190
When I'm feeling tired
or not feeling my best,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.503
I slap on a pair of sunglasses

00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:43.569
and, suddenly, it's a purposeful look.

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.402
For instance: slightly
fatigued young mother

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:48.585
(baby crying)

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:49.943
or cool guy?

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:51.266
(sexy saxophone)

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.681
Or, that one cool guy emoticon?

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:55.689
(bass guitar run)

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:56.629
Tip number two is that it's not

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.884
in your best interest to take a photo

00:00:57.884 --> 00:00:58.987
with the sun behind you.

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:00.008
Depending on the brightness,

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:01.146
it's usually in your best interest

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:03.349
to take a picture with the
light coming from the front.

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:06.824
Right now, however, yeah,
this might be a bit much.

00:01:06.824 --> 00:01:08.182
But remember that next time you're trying

00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:09.842
to take a selfie at an amusement park.

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:11.606
If the sun's behind you,
it's never gonna work.

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:13.743
This tip is probably the
most important tip of all.

00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:16.286
Get angular. Know your face.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:18.121
There are round faces, oval faces,

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.024
heart-shape faces, and long faces.

00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:22.345
It's really a good idea to
take a picture straight on.

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:24.598
What you want to go for
is a three-quarters look.

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:26.781
You might want to try experimenting
with tilting your head

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:30.960
along the x-axis or y-axis,
depending on your face shape.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.119
Rounder faces, go from left to right.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.163
Longer faces, try up and down.

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:36.799
Here's my photo face.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.076
(applause and shouting)

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:40.863
This is a full look. This
is the three-quarters look.

00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:42.384
And now I've achieved what I like to call

00:01:42.384 --> 00:01:43.706
a Hannah Hart Photo Face,

00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:45.344
with additional Hannah Hand.

00:01:45.344 --> 00:01:46.342
(bell dings)

00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:47.759
So remember, know your angles.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.663
It's okay to experiment
with taking pictures

00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:51.961
and finding the most flattering
angle for your own face.

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:53.076
But don't overdo it.

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:55.258
Raise the camera up a little
bit, tilt your chin down,

00:01:55.258 --> 00:01:57.383
and slam, now you have a jaw line!

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.983
Another great pro tip: always be aware

00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:01.841
of the location of your nipples.

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:03.826
Sheer clothing, mesh clothing,

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:05.301
it looks really cool, but it can

00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:06.775
get you in a whole lot of trouble.

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:08.261
A great way to make sure that your outfit

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.735
is not too revealing is to have a friend

00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:11.256
take a photo with the flash on

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.578
to make sure you're not
getting your flash--

00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:14.460
(car honks)

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.491
(Hannah laughs)

00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.730
For instance
(sexy club music)

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.913
Nope. Sorry guys.

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:22.969
I've never made this
mistake, and never will.

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.629
Actually, I probably
shouldn't jinx myself.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.651
Anyway, it's important to make sure

00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:26.707
your outfits aren't too revealing.

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:28.808
Because, remember, once you put something

00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:31.908
on the internet, it stays there forever.

00:02:31.908 --> 00:02:33.325
Forever.

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:34.311
Moving right along.

00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:35.345
Last, but not least, not everybody

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:36.726
wants to take pictures
of their face place.

00:02:36.726 --> 00:02:37.887
That's okay.

00:02:37.887 --> 00:02:39.350
You can still express your artistic,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.707
photo-graphic self by taking pictures

00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:45.199
of something you do like,
like your knee or your shoes.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.497
I take so many pictures of my feet.

00:02:47.497 --> 00:02:48.855
And, frankly, I think that's great.

00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:50.540
If you guys wanna practice
taking some photos,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.443
try helping some hapless tourists out

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:54.219
who are clearly about to make a terrible,

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.065
terrible photographic mistake.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:57.981
Hey guys, thank you so much for watching.

00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.361
I hope that this gave
you some of you some tips

00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:02.138
and tricks and advice and whatnot

00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:03.821
on how to be more "photogenic".

00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.120
Because I think it's
ridiculous to tell yourself

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.024
a negative thing like "I
don't photograph well"

00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:08.302
or "I don't take good
pictures, so don't ever

00:03:08.302 --> 00:03:10.924
put me in the family photo",
"Ugh, I hate my face".

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.262
Stop. Stop that negative thought dialogue.

00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:15.224
And be happy to be documenting

00:03:15.224 --> 00:03:16.941
your life permanently, forever.

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:18.892
And if, in the end, you
still hate it, that's cool.

00:03:18.892 --> 00:03:20.482
I just want to know that you've tried.

00:03:20.482 --> 00:03:22.062
Hey guys, thank you so much
for watching that video.

00:03:22.062 --> 00:03:24.000
It's me, your friendly
neighborhood Hannah,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.033
live from the Electra
Woman and Dyna Girl set,

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.692
where I can show you absolutely nothing

00:03:27.692 --> 00:03:30.375
due to not wanting to spoil too much.

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:31.396
Anyway, what I want to let you know

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:33.056
is that I uploaded two videos today.

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:34.182
This one, that you just watched,

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:37.619
and one on my second channel,
which you can watch right now.

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:39.435
I participate in YouTube's
"Dear Me" campaign,

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:41.954
which uses the hashtag
#DearMe and encourages people

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:45.751
to send a letter to their
high school or past self.

00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:47.713
So if you wanna watch mine,
go ahead and click below.

00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:50.349
If you guys wanna see any
more of my daily adventures,

go ahead and click any of the links below.

00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:54.048
I'm all over the internet
and social medias.

00:03:54.048 --> 00:03:56.347
And that's really it for now.

00:03:56.347 --> 00:03:58.831
So subscribe to my channel for new videos

00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:00.400

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.975
(kiss smack)
Bye. Whoah!
