00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi Guys.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.509
I have here the Google Nexus 7 tablet.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.470
This is Google’s first own brand tablet,
And you can see the Nexus logo here,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.710
And also the tablet edge in the picture making
the number 7,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.679
Showing it’s a 7 inch screen tablet,
Same size as Amazon’s Kindle Fire.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.810
It’s not actually manufactured by Google.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.800
It’s made by Asus, who’ve been doing pretty
well in the Android tablet market.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.550
You can see some of the specs on the back
of this outer sleeve.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.589
It’s made for Google Play.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:35.570
It’s got a quad core processor, front-facing
camera, and 7 inch HD display

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.470
And it comes loaded with the latest Android
4.1, Jelly Bean.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.730
Also, this version I have here is the 16 gigabyte
one.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.190
And that’s everything on this outer grey
sleeve.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.270
It’s a nice design, simple and to the point.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.130
The actual box is inside and you need to push
it out.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.930
It’s a little tricky because the sleeve’s
on quite tight.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.570
Google probably wanted to make sure everything
stayed together in one piece until it reached

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.190
the person who bought it.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.631
So that’s the sleeve off,
And you get this black box with just the nexus

00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:07.720
logo on it.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.290
It’s a really sturdy box, and feels premium.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.840
I guess that’s a good omen for what’s
inside.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.860
It’s well sealed with black tape on both
sides.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.750
That just needs to be cut open.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.620
The box is a little fiddly to open
Trying to pull it open doesn’t work

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.760
Placing it on the table and wiggling the top
loose does the trick.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.600
And there you have it, the Nexus 7.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.140
First thing you notice is that it’s all
glass on the front,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.240
With no physical buttons.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.810
When you take it out, it actually fits quite
well in the hand

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.240
Nice and portable for a tablet.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.260
I’ll come back to that in a minute,
Let’s see what else is included in the package

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.190
So you get this black mini box tucked into
the larger one

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.140
And everything else is inside it.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.860
That’s quite nice.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.990
There’s a few things in here.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.200
There are a couple of booklets.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.040
The warranty booklet
And then this quick start guide, which has

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.480
some information in it if you need it.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.439
Next you get a USB cable; the micro USB for
the tablet and the standard size USB on the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.920
other end.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.130
And the last thing is the charger
It’s in two parts

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.420
The one I have here is the UK version
And the charger part is in the other side

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.090
of the box

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.650
So you can see this is the UK three pin charger
And the other part has the USB port

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.450
They slot together quite easily.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.590
And that’s everything inside the box.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.849
Coming back to the tablet.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.090
We can take a proper look at the screen once
the plastic cover is off.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.420
It really does feel nice to hold.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.680
This is actually an LCD screen, and it has
1280 x 800 HD resolution, and Gorilla glass.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.810
Right at the top you can see the front facing
camera and light sensor

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.989
And then at the side you’ve got the power
button and the volume rocker.

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.660
The back has a large Nexus logo
And it’s got this pitted surface that gives

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.220
it a very textured feel.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.200
It’s plastic, but the texture makes it feel
more rubbery.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.690
I’m going to switch it on for the first
time here

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.220
And you get the Google logo as you wait
Followed by the Nexus one for a while

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.770
And then there’s the welcome screen that
takes you into the setup with all the different

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.110
language options.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.930
Once you finish setup you get a bit of a bonus
from Google

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.670
By way of £15 worth of credit in your Google
Play account.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.580
I think it’s $25 in the US.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.379
You also get an email confirmation of that.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.010
Well that’s definitely made up for the nearly
dead battery.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.910
Once you get past the setup stage,
You get this initial helpful tips overlay

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.430
Click ‘OK’ and you get to see the actual
display.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.269
It’s looking quite nice at first glance,
Sharp text and really nice colours.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.430
Scrolling seems smooth as well.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.900
I’ll be using this tablet over the next
few days and finding out a bit more about

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900
it.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.209
Then I’ll post an in-depth review detailing
any pros and cons that I come across.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.230
So stay tuned for that video.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.530
And I’ll see you then
Bye
