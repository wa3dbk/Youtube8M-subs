00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.640
Now I am going to show you some veil work
called "Sweeping the Floor". You are going

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.570
to start with your veil in front of you. You
are going to open your legs and your arms

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.349
are going to be doing this kind of movement.
You are going to bend in front and you are

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.369
going to be doing this motion. You are going
to bend your knee and you are going to have

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.230
your legs open. You are going to bend to the
right, bend to the left. Bend to the right,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.820
bend to the left. The arms are going to be
crossing in front of each other. This is without

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.870
the veil. Now I am going to show you the movement
with the veil. It goes like this. Sweeping

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:56.460
the floor, sweeping the floor. Sweeping the
floor, sweeping the floor. With this movement

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:06.109
you can incorporate all the steps in your
choreography.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:12.850
And it looks really good when you have a group
of belly dancers doing the same motion at

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:22.590
the same time. Once again, you are going to
start with your veil in front of you. You

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.570
are going to open your legs. You are going
to bend a little bit, your knees, and you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.649
are going to bend your body. And you are going
to be crossing your arms in front, the left

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:46.390
arm in front, the right arm in front. The
left arm in front, the right arm in front.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:54.140
And if you want you can incorporate this other
step. And it would be good if you can look

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.719
to the audience because they want to see your
face. And there you have it. The veil work,

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.490
"Sweeping the Floor".
