Whew! I’ve been moving stuff into the new
Livid Lobster studios, painting and organizing.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.590
My body says I’m tired, please go to bed,
but *I* say not too tired for some awesome

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:26.860
tech news! I’m Cali Lewis. Welcome to GeekBeat.TV!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.510
JackThreads

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.850
Everyone knows just how crazy and brilliant
Richard Branson is. He never seems to do anything

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.929
small. These days, he’s working on a couple
major projects. Virgin has conquered air travel

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:45.059
up to 40,000 feet. Soon it’ll be conquering
BOTH space and the oceans. The BBC is the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.109
first to get a sneak peak at Virgin Galactic’s
SpaceShipTwo, a vehicle that’ll transport

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.250
not only scientists, but also YOU to space.
As any Virgin vehicle, the technology inside

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.850
is impressive. It’s bigger than SpaceShipOne
- about twice the size, and will hold six

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.210
people in addition to the two pilots. The
vehicle is made out of carbon composite, and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.190
has a hybrid rocket motor. Instead of the
normal space ships we’re used to that start

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.890
on the ground and zoom upwards into space,
the SpaceShipTwo starts out like a normal

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.040
plane. It takes off from the runway, but once
it’s at 50,000 feet, the spaceship then

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.530
detaches and launches into space. This way,
it’s safer and requires less weight than

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.680
trying to launch FROM the ground.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.780
As Trace points out, there are more windows
on Virgin Galactic than on any other space

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.460
vehicle we’ve seen, so you can rest assured,
you’ll get a good view for your $200,000

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.570
price tag. If you have $20,000 now, you can
go ahead and reserve a spot. They’re also

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.450
working on Virign Oceanic to dive deep down
to the bottom of the ocean. Oceans I should

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.750
say. For now, it seems to be primarily for
scientific research, but I don’t think Richard

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.340
can keep the public out of his projects, so
I expect to hear in the not too distant future

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.560
that they’re making it possible to send
you to the bottom of the ocean as well.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.390
Toshiba is working hard to make 2D to 3D conversion
happen smoothly and reliably. They just announced

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.460
a new line of HDTVs. The 55ZL1 has a seven
core CEVO CPU that supposedly can do 2D to

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.819
3D conversion on the fly. It also has a face
recognition feature. Let’s say you have

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.830
four people in your family. Each of you can
save your personal preferences. Favorite channels,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.450
recorded videos. When you sit down in front
of the TV, it’ll do it’s magic and pull

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.420
up YOUR settings. Each of you can have your
own. I assume whoever sits down first will

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.629
be the one “in control”, but that remains
to be seen. It’ll be available later this

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.019
year in 42, 46 and 55 inch options.

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.769
Doing what we do around here at Livid Lobster
- lots and lots of video, we’re constantly

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.159
looking at steadicams. They’re very cool
(in my opinion), very useful, and a good one

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.720
is super expensive. On the flip side of video,
almost all of you are probably using your

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.450
phones from time to time to record video that
you can then share on Facebook or YouTube.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.669
Having cameras in our phones is great and
makes video accessible, but sometimes that

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:05.159
shakiness is just terrible! Steadycam Pro
is an iPhone 4 application that aims to fix

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.169
that issue. Instead of carrying around a physical
steadicam, they’re fixing it WHILE you shoot.

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.200
It looks like it works well, but I haven’t
tried it myself - don’t have that fancy

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.480
iPhone 4! There is a free version that gives
you 15 second watermarked videos. The paid

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.329
version is $3. Regardless, geekbeat.tv/steadycampro
(with a y) will get you right to the download

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.329
page.

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.999

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:56.609
A company called Robopec combined two awesome
things. Robots and media center PCs. REETI

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.549
is an adorable little thing that talks to
you, makes faces and most importantly serves

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.079
up and plays your media files.

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:58.590
Now I can have a little company while watching
the entertainment of my choice! Though, I

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.760
might wind up only paying attention to cute
little Reeti. They are planning on selling

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.250
this, though no word on when or how much he’ll
be.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.480
We have more pictures and video from the new
studio coming soon. Best way to catch it all

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.440
is on our newsletter - geekbeat.tv/signup.
Thanks to those of you who tell your friends
