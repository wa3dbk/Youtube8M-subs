00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.580
president clinton mail

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.040
he came out earlier

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.859
uh... this week and they have something

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.619
partners that ceiling they never came up
during your term incident that

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.089
gingrich in the republicans bob out

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.750
using this as a leverage moment to try
to get more cuts and stuff like that

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.660
and they were disputes of the notion

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.990
and give me clean

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.890
uh... process that they said why

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.539
they were smart enough to figure out

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.219
that but no he said i'm sure they'd
figured out that i would be smart enough

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:32.770
to say hey wait a minute

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.670
this is money that was already spent

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.330
by republican provide republican
presidents ronald reagan and george h w

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.270
bush

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.079
not money was spent later not money i'm
spending

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.670
it's money you'd expect

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.920
are you i think the american people and
added costs

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.190
now all bomb up

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.109
never do that because he's afraid he's

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.129
of lost its he loves anne it's a
combination of those on which one is a

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.099
which one is that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.649
but he thinks singing to the american
people who get killed and his way of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.800
doing it like he's

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.140
you know eighty he's went back to you
know so many respects even though we

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.940
speak so soft landing is much weaker
than the militarism and how we got wise

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.670
to magic apathetic what he would never
be the american people including basil

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.610
he wants the right wing proposal

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.520
that's the conclusion i've come to
dispose because my grandma group brian

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.330
piece about this by the way i'm calling
it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.270
greenwald a best roles in america

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.600
also ironically nata

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.590
threatened that he was innocent

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.820
profit but that missing not

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.810
focuses the investment is is i i i a
significance close

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.310
anti-union trade of course a lot of
great journals

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.960
but i think he's amazing anyway so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.869
he says that integrity of the people
isn't easily with the use of president

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.399
obama's address social security

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.200
right after he got elected i said before
i don't like it is like how to protect

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.860
social security this john mccain
somewhat more basic atwood white after

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.810
he gets elected is that all dat

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.400
social security you know we got a new
entitlement reform and fixes and

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.240
cuts in et cetera et cetera anything
that i needed

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.789
uh... you know deep i'm done arguing

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.149
with anyone about what he

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.509
e wants or what he really believes
because i think part of problems that we

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.629
we really don't know what he believes
because i'd i'm i'm i would i guess

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.779
that's closer to what he said but it's
irrelevant at that point was

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:25.089
conversation we clubs and what we learn
from that conversation released when he

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:26.939
was talking to kids about

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.529
he loves compromise

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:32.009
he loves it that's what he wants to do
that's what he thinks leaders do

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.620
is make deals he still set

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.019
clearly what is unquestionably true in
goes toward the what you'd set like if

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.719
you got to write the legislation
self-pride drive my hunch is they'd be

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.579
significantly

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.290
a bush tax cuts would be done

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.390
because that's an irrelevant point in
who cares why would why would you be

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.290
willing to talk about it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.499
he certainly doesn't in at the air not
interested enough

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:56.979
in in anyway

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.939
being the party or the president

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.089
that gets label is raising taxes

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:02.910
even under this scenario

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.809
they don't want it they're not
interested in

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.579
if you give it to me usually

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:08.970
but they have to fight for it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.350
milan spring hill loved were in fact
people making over two hundred family

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.859
more than two hundred fifty we need it

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.449
okay fair point if you got it

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:27.449
predict that the so they don't you know
they clearly no white man with us

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:35.029
she was walking with a list

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:40.579
denial

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.759
well of course ended and i'm not buying
in

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:48.799
dot established energized let them out

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:49.909
i want it

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:50.589
