00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.929
Borussia Dortmund were 18th in the table and
under huge pressure to get a result against

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.100
Hoffenheim. How did they fare on Friday night?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.440
Well in the end it was a 1-0 win thanks to
Ilkay Gundogan, it was a hugely important

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.390
result. Jurgen Klopp and his men relieved
themselves of the red lantern - that is the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.300
German version of the wooden spoon - and climbed
all the way to 14th in the table. Dortmund

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.689
once again had a good goal wrongly disallowed
but they also got lucky for a change, the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.260
referee not giving a penalty that looked to
be so.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.140
Gundogan had a particularly good game in the
number ten role and at the back it was the

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.640
fab four reunited for the first time for the
start since the Champions League final in

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.200
2013. We must continue to work for more victories
said a very relieved Jurgen Klopp and indeed

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.361
they must. Two or three more wins from the
last few games will make sure Dortmund go

00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:01.199
into the winter break in a much more relaxed
state.

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:14.959
04 were the opponents for Stuttgart and Roberto
di Matteo showed no mercy. Max Meyer and 

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:23.399
a hatrick from Choupo-Moting consigned Stuttgart
to the bottom of the table and pushed Schalke

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.450
all the way up to joint-fourth. Another game
with a big x-factor was Bremen's trip to Eintracht

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.869
Frankfurt. It was a suitably bonkers affair
without much in the way of defending, and

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.490
Alex Meier set Frankfurt on their way with
a brace. Bayer Leverkusen are also fourth

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:53.240
in the table with an identical record to Schalke
after a 1-0 defeat at Bayern on Saturday.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.469
Frank Ribery's 100th goal for Bayern was enough
to secure all three points against a very

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.590
technically astute Bayer Leverkusen, who frustrated
the home team but didn't create much themselves.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.459
When somebody suggested that Alex Meier should
be part of the German national team two years

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.921
ago, he just waved them away and said no,
I'm too old. But he is still only 31 and he

00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:23.790
is top of the Bundesliga goal scoring charts,
ahead of Lewandowski and Marco Reus with 10

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.180
goals after 14 games. In ten years with Frankfurt
he has scored 34 times in 66 games, that's

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.209
better than a goal every other game. He is
typically modest saying it doesn't really

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:45.329
matter who scores. Is it inconceivable that
Alex Meier would get a call up for the German

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.390
national team next year? I'm not so sure.
Joachim Low isn't exactly blessed with strikers

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.959
up front and he could do a lot worse than
having a second look at the Fusbol god from

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.650
Frankfurt.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.019
Markus Weinzierl's Augsburg were the first
domestic team to beat Bayern Munich last season

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.060
and they have a chance to repeat that feat
on Saturday when they welcome their big neighbours.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.209
They are third in the table, that's the best
position this small club have ever been in.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.599
Augsburg don't yet see themselves as genuine
contenders for the Europa League or Champions

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.849
League, let alone the championship, but their
sporting director has said that it might not

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.430
be a one off, referring, jokingly, to last
years win. "We have shown before that we can

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:38.439
annoy Bayern said their manager and maybe
they can do that again.
