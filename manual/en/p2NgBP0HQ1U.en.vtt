00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.800
My name is Jacqueline Bush and I'm an editorial
in celebrity hairstyles.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.270
My clientele has included Faith Hill, Mark
Ruffalo, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.370
Jane Krakowski.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.680
I want to be able to show you that hair isn't
as intimidating or as hard as you think it

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:26.390
is and I want you be able to have fun with
it and do what your vision is with your hairSo

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.750
now I'm going to show you how to get hair
like the women in "Mad Men" or Betty Draper

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.800
hair.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.530
As you saw from our last clip, "How to Get
Hollywood Glamour," you're going to do the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190
same thing, which is what I have already done
to the model.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.039
The difference is instead of brushing it out,
you could even brush it out, what I did is

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:50.730
I took about inch section on the top of her
head and curled those ones just a little more.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.190
In the last video we took larger sections.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.649
This time, just on the top of the head, we're
just taking a little bit smaller sections

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.590
to give a little more curl on the top of your
head.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.331
We're going to do this all the way around,
I've already done this side for you, and I

00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:17.210
curled these last two pieces away from the
face cause I like a little bit of variation

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.670
and movement.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.590
So, after you do that you're going to take
some, for me I'm using a styling wax, has

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.820
a little bit of shine in it cause shine was
very important back then.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.750
You're going to silk that through the hair;
and I'm not brushing the curls too much yet.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.350
Then you're going to take your smoothing brush
with a little hair spray, as we did in our

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.390
last video, we're going to do it again.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.230
As you notice, I'm not going all the way through
just yet.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.770
Then we're going to brush through the ends.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.600
Now, what were going to do is I am going to
have our model turn around for us.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.300
The first thing we're going to do is we're
going to lift up the top half of the hair;

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.270
and you know the sectioning doesn't have to
be really particular on this.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.480
We're going to lift that up, clip it out of
the way, then we're going to take our smoothing

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.040
comb and we're going to tease this part.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.189
We're going to take that clip out.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.709
Could spray it a little bit if you're hair
is a little soft, if you're hair is too soft

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.799
that's what prevents it from holding the style,
so you're hair needs to be a little rough.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.760
Now we're going to smooth that out, just smoothing
out the curls a little bit.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.829
Then what we're going to do is take a little
rubber band, a small rubber band.

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.040
If you have long hair this is the trick you're
going to do, if you have short hair and you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.609
already did the curl and brushed it out that
is "Mad Men" Betty Draper hair, the old Hollywood

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.060
style glamour look.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.180
Now if you have long hair like our model does,
what you're going to do is you're going to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.790
take that whole section of hair, you're going
to make sure it's all mainly together.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.169
You're going to put it in a very low ponytail;
you see that pony tail comes about the middle

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.120
of her back.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.620
Then what you're going to do is you're going
to take this section, you're going to tease

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.870
it underneath.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.209
Then, taking my fingers or you can do it with
a comb, you're going to bring that ponytail

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.430
through, under one more time, then you're
going to pull it out a little bit.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.530
Then what you're going to do is you're going
to pin it underneath.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.569
So I have some bobby pins here and this little
pony tail, remember this little teased section,

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.269
that's what you're pinning.

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.569
So I can go through that little hole that
we have and pin that underneath.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.959
And I have shown you, in another video, how
to use bobby pins so you can look that up

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.809
if you're confused.

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:59.379
Gripping the hair, just making sure that ponytail
stays out, and as you can see, "Oh it's falling,"

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.829
I'm going to stick in another little pin.

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:09.989
You know, the more precise, the more time
you spend doing this, the cleaner it's going

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.840
to look; the less time you spend...

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.840
If you spend less time on something like this,
it's ok, but, just make sure the look blends,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840
you know?

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.000
You can make it a little bit more undone looking
if you spend less time, but you just got to

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.740
make sure the undone works.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.120
You might ask "How would you do that?"

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.850
You can tease it out a little bit at the end,
pull out some sections so that it doesn't

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.750
look like it just sloppily fell you know?

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.070
Pinning a little more, making that nice "X"
shape.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.690
You can use larger bobby pins too; I'm using
the small ones because most of you guys probably

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.430
don't have different sized pins at home.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.199
Pinning that ponytail right in there to the
nape of her neck.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.040
Now we're going to have our model turn back
around.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.320
Now we have most of that hair pinned up, you're
going to look at it from the front.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.670
Now she has this little section here.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.420
What we're going to do is we're going to pin
that in the shape that we want.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:17.620
So we want a little bit more of the curl to
show, so we're just going to pin that right

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.010
here.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.780
Just taking that pin and putting it directly
into the hair.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:33.860
Now what I'm going to do is spray again with
hair spray, smooth it, spray a little more,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.610
give it a little more control.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.490
This is where it's all about the eyes guys,
because, back then it was about shaping it.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.900
And that's the short way to get "Mad Men"
hair.
