Hey Everyone, Mike here from CrazyEconomyCraft
hows it going? Welcome to a little plugin

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.429
tutorial that i figured i would do because
i just implemented it onto my server Crazy

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.750
Economy Craft and a i figured i give you guys
a little rundown of it. So the plugin is called

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.210
Leaderheads and what is does is implements
itself with a bunch of other plugins which

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:33.450
ill name now uhhh so it works with scoreboardstats
Vault GAListener Island world battle levels

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:43.330
playerpoints killstats ultimate votes ultimate
skyblock skywars and wicked skywars. So what

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.230
it does is it pulls information from those
plugins which you have already implemented

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.320
into your server if you havent already you
need to implement it so it can pull thos stats

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.901
onto the plugin. So what this plugin is going
to do is its going to allow you to create

00:00:55.901 --> 00:01:02.430
signs with a head above it and its going to
pull the stat from whatever thing your pulling

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.000
from so for instance right here on the top
line here i have the top kills for my server

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.100
so i have scoreboard stats implemented onto
my server on the right side of the screen

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.720
there youll see that i have the scoreboard
so right now it has how many uh, so it has

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.240
how much economy so the balance scoreboard
is not needed for the balance to show up on

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.950
signs. Uh but scoreboard does pull the balances
from your economy plugin. So it shows the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.979
balance deaths kills and players online. So
the scoreboard stats one will only show kills

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.330
killstreaks and mobkills, so right here ahead
of me i have kills and mobkills obviously.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.091
So the way you go about doing and creating
signs on your server, so make sure you have

00:01:55.091 --> 00:02:01.840
your scoreboard stats plugin on your server
and you can implement this once youve implemented

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.711
the leaderheads plugin onto your server make
sure you restart your server and allow it

00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:11.670
to pick up and then you can restart your server
again and use the plugin. So to create these

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.739
signs that you saw just a second ago place
a head down you can create the leaderheads

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.409
sign and then on the second line your going
to put whatever plugin you want to pull the

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.810
information from. So on the the leaderheads
website which ill leave a link in the description

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.269
below and you can check it out there. They
have all the information there that you need

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.480
to put on your second line which is the plugin
that your trying to reference. So in our instance

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:50.730
its Scoreboard stats so sbs-kills and then
whatever place you want to put. Now on their

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.659
website it says that you can put 1-9 but ive
noticed on my server that 6 7 8 9 do not pull

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.700
the information so im not sure if thats a
glitch or a glitch on our side or a glitch

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.739
on their side but uh 1 to 5 works fine. So
lets say we want to pull the third place person

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.540
of the kills scoreboard stats, so we click
done, its going to say in the bottom left

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.730
of the chat sign added update sbs kills board
its takes a second, pulls the information

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.459
and there you go. you have preddzel with 8
kills on the server, and just like here third

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.330
place person 8 kills on the server whos tied
with another person so, im going to give you

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.370
one more example which is going to be the
balance one. so it does not need scoreboard

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:47.709
stats. Balance only needs vault. So you place
your head you place your sign, leaderheads

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.239
bracket enter, second line is the plugin,
so in this case were looking for balance as

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.269
i said before you can check out the link below
uh the developer has listed everything there

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:08.959
and you can just type in balance. balnance
balance, and once again the position is important

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:16.329
1 to 9 all 1 to 9 works on this one so lets
say we want 5 on the server, there we go,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.989
so on the bottom left we noticed it works
there you go weve pulled the information 136

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.729
thousand on the server, so there we go, thats
the plugin um, in the configuration you can

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.680
change the colors of the signs so actually
what it starts off is uh, the name will actually

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.479
be yellow and the money will be green. Uh
i found it hard to read so i changed it, it

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.260
worked no problem, when you restart the server
it picks up the colors, you dont even need

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.470
to remake the signs. So you can also pull
up a GUI for each of the stats you would like

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.860
to pull form the server. So lets say you want
to checkout the uh scoreboard stats kills.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.509
So in your configuration youll setup the command
that you need to type, you just need to type

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:09.430
it in there and youll set it. Default its
setup as top mob kills for the top mob kills.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:17.919
So you type in /topmobkills and it brings
up a little gui one two three four five, that

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.110
would actually explain he 6 7 8 and 9 dont
exist for some reason im not sure if it only

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:31.159
picks up the top 5 for scoreboard stats, so
theres the name and the balan, the uh amount

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:37.490
which is actually the uh hard to read because
i set it to black in my configuration, which

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:45.120
matches the sign, and about to test another
one top balances which is the balance one

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.680
and there we go, everything right there top
9. So its a great plugin glad you guys tuned

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.070
