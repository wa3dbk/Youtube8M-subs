Kristin: One of the really great things we
do here at RSI is we have a mock audition.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.889
We put them through an audition process just
like they would anywhere else, but then we

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.969
give them feedback. We try and give them some
criticism that they can take with them and

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.539
work on. Also, things that they're doing really
well and to stay positive about it.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.630
Amarisa: It's definitely scary standing on
the side, waiting for your name to be called.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.470
Then they finally do and the nerves kind of
settle a little bit but then once that music

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.140
kicks in, you get nervous again and you just
need to focus on smiling really big, making

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.140
everything sharp and clean. It's very scary
but it's so exciting at the same time because

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.280
you know that you're doing Rockette choreography
and it's just such an honor.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.550
Kirsty: It's really helpful because normally
in auditions, you don't have any feedback

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.550
but this time, we were able to have some feedback
on what we can work on and to go home and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.850
think about the next time we have the opportunity
to audition for Rockettes or any other audition.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.550
We can be a step further forward.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.920
Nia: We all come in this really big rehearsal hall.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.150
Then we all line up. She starts breaking
down the choreography, teaching us each step

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.710
and she goes over it but she doesn't go slow,
it's really quick. After you learn all the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.760
choreography, you go to separate sides of
the room and they start calling you out by

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.380
threes. You go out there and the music starts
playing. I personally, was really nervous.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.130
Francesca: I think the mock audition is an
awesome thing because it helps me when I want

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.530
to audition to be a Rockette, knowing the
combinations, especially with the style because

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.960
not everyone knows what the Rockettes style
is like.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.280
Jenna: One thing that really helped me was
listening to the corrections that everyone

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.049
else is getting in all of their feedback.
Then really concentrating and making sure

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.850
I was consciously thinking about how I would
apply that to myself when I took the floor.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.080
Making sure that I wouldn't repeat the same
mistake and making it my goal to receive a

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.350
new correction and not one that had been given
before.
