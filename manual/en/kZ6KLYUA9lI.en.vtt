00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.760
Hey guys!

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.420
So with the Sailor Moon Crystal anime coming out last year

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.000
there have been so many Sailor Moon products on the market recently

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.800
And I've been searching for the past few months to try and find some interesting ones to show you guys

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.410
and it's been really hard D:

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.010
They have these gummy candies out right now

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.540
These gummy candies that I really want to try, but I can't find them

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.200
But I did find all the flavours of the chips!

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.360
Aren't these just the cutest packages ever?

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.580
These took me so long to find

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.600
and I ended up finding them at the dollar store

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.469
which I was not expecting

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.160
But I got all three flavours, and they
all have different characters on them so

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.780
These grilled pork ones come with Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, all the characters

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.980
So you can choose which one's you like

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.860
Let's see what is special about these besides the package just being Sailor Moon

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.040
It says that they come with something...

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.220
I was hoping it was a sticker but I don't think it's a sticker

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.480
"Comes with a sailor scout wallpaper for your smartphone!"

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.420
Oh okay, so you get a wallpaper for your phone inside of each one

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.400
And it will be the character that is on the
package

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.320
So this one has a Tuxedo Mask wallpaper

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.830
and a Sailor Moon wallpaper

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.960
and a Sailor Mercury! Okay let's try these cuz I'm starving

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.110
and they look really yummy~ So we have
avocado cream cheese flavour

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.660
Bagnacauda, which is an anchovy and garlic flavour

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.380
and... Balsamico Grilled Pork

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.440
I guess that's balsamic
vinegar and grilled pork maybe?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.440
I don't know, I'm just guessing

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.140
Let's start with the avocado one!

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.080
Cuz we all know how much I love avocado

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.140
Oh yummy~

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.580
They're really tiny chips, hehe. That's so cute. 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.000
They're really green! Itadakimasu :)

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.200
Mmm yummy

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.120
They're corn tortilla chips

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.360
Mmm these are really good!

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420
These would be really good with salsa too 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.220
They're not super cheese flavoured either which is nice, it's just really subtle

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.200
I really like these ones

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.660
Yum! Those will probably be my favourite, I'm just guessing now. 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.720
avocado cream cheese

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.980
Sailor Moon!

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.980
Ok let's try the Balsamico Grilled Pork

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.519
Hmmm... They kinda smell like... 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.720
Smell like... Mr. Noodles, beef flavour

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.080
and they taste like them too!

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.140
Kinda taste like soy sauce

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.900
These ones are really salty

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.900
They're like a stronger flavour of Mr. Noodles beef flavour

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.840
Like you put on 2 packages of seasoning instead of 1

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.360
They're good, but I don't think I could eat the whole pack because they're so salty

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.400
They are yummy though

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.180
So if you prefer saltier flavours, go for these ones

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.670
And last we have Bagnacauda! I don't know if I'm saying that right

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.560
I'd actually never heard of this until I came to Japan

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.480
and in Japanese they call it ba-nyakauda

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.380
It's a vegetable dish that you dip in an anchovy paste sauce kinda thing?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.800
Hmm these ones don't really smell like anything

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.640
Mmm super garlicky

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.220
Oh yum~ I love garlic :3

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.300
A slight fishy flavour

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.940
just really slight, it's not bad at all

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.320
These are good! It's definitely a tie between these and the avocado ones

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.800
There's a little Luna in the corner :3 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.380
These are really good! I can't choose guys

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.540
They're only a dollar, just get them all 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.520
At first I was kinda suspicious, thinking they're just luring us in to buy them

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.800
with the super cute Sailor Moon packaging

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.740
But they're actually really good

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.240
I woulda bought them anyways even if they weren't, but... 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.380
YUM. 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.980
I'm gonna have to say Avocado

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.980
Avocado is the winner

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.240
Anchovy and Garlic being a very close second

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.500
And the pork ones were just a little too salty for me

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.640
Still yummy, but very salty

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.900
Alright guys, I have one other Sailor Moon product that I wanted to show you!

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.220
Ta-daaaaaa

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.630
Sailor Moon sanitary pads!! 8D

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.920
I have no idea what about these is Sailor Moon

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.620
I'm kinda hoping that they're printed with really adorable Sailor Moon designs or something

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.320
But look at the package, it's so cute!

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.040
If you guys don't know about Japanese pads... they're gigantic D; 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.340
They're huge~ I never use them I always bring ones from Canada

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.200
Cuz I find them so uncomfortable

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.340
Oh yeah! They have Sailor Moon designs written on them 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.660
Can you see how big they are!?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.200
This is gigantic, it's like the size of my face!

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.380
Aww but it's got a really cute Sailor Moon design

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.640
That is so cute~

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.060
Here I'll open it up and show you guys what it looks like

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.280
You're just gonna be shocked at how big these are

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.220
Look at that D:

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.120
That is just crazy~ and they're so thick too!

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.440
It's like they try to make them as thick as they possibly can in Japan

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.240
Whereas in Canada they try to make them as thin as possible, which I prefer

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.180
Oh there's more, I hadn't unraveled the whole thing!

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.480
Oh my god~

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.180

I'm definitely looking for the gummy candies

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.180
Gummy candies, I guess they are in English... 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.780
Gumi in Japanese, in case you were wondering

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.540

definitely go and search for it
