In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, traffic is a very
important issue. 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.640
We have almost 7 million people here going from A to B to C to D.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.430
When we first developed the basic API for
working with cities, we gave it to the guys

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.080
at COR in Rio and they turned it into something that was incredibly useful for them as a city.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.100
Implementing Waze was something that we've never saw before.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.260
From the first phone call that we [have], two weeks later we were there inside of Waze's application

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.399
with APIs bringing to the operation center
every information that we agree to share.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.240
Let's take a look at how we use Waze up here.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.460
This place here is the Crisis Room, a
place where we handle tough situations.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.300
The question is when we enter the building: What is happening and where?

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.530
We have here this important road and people
are complaining about heavy traffic.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.080
And then we see a picture. We don't only know that they're telling about it but we can see

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.760
that it's loaded.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.110
We can even make some alerts in our system
that will help every operator here to investigate

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.220
what is happening where.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.820
This is one of those reasons that our partnership
is so valuable.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.000
We have the channel, we have the data and
we need to shorten the distance between the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.420
citizens and city hall.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.100
It feels like this entire city is structured
like a start up, with innovation, with a commitment

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.119
to excellence and execution all the way down the line, and they're teaching us how we need

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.539
to improve our API so that it can be used
for cities around the world.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.300
We receive here in the operations center,
lots of information about the Wazers and they

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.040
talk about incidents, hazards, problems with
traffic in terms of moderate or stand-still

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.940
traffic. Those information are very important to us.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.560
With 400,000 Wazers in Rio de Janeiro, 50,000
users every day, it's like we have an army

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.260
of public agents talking to us.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.639
With the World Cup and the Olympic Games, we need to maintain the city functioning because

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.360
there are some people that are not going to
the soccer games or to the swimming competition.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.200
Waze is one of our ways to make it happen.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.699
There is this effect where it because the
information is getting better as we have more

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.549
users, that it just keeps continuing to grow.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.669
As many Wazers that we have, the more this
number grows, the more efficient and more

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.120
greatly this tool will work for the city.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.140
Brazil is an incredibly important market for
us because they have a ton of users and the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.280
more users we have the better the data is.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.720
That means that we can not just save each
individual time, but look at the city as a whole.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.120
And this is where we think the next
part of our evolution really lies.
