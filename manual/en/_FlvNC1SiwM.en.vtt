(music)

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.300
Beluga whales an arctic species of whales.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.482
They're found off the coast of Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland and Norway.

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:12.202
They're very unique whales because they have a number of adaptations

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:14.560
that allow them to survive in a arctic environment.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.240
They're very blubbery animals.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.280
Everyone might be familiar with their white color from the Raffi baby beluga song.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.490
Help them to camouflage in their icy and snowing arctic environment.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.750
(music)

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.410
The primary goal of my research is learn more about beluga reproduction biology.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.265
What I'm aiming to do is to monitor reproductive behavior here at the Mystic Aquarium

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:45.174
and align it to various physiological measures that allow us to understand more about beluga reproduction.

00:00:45.174 --> 00:00:49.074
Including ultrasounds and everyone's favorite, the whale snot.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.460
So today what we're going to be doing, is we're be working directly with the training and veterinary staff

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.340
here at the Mystic Aquarium to collect a number of samples.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.782
First we're going to collecting a blood sample.

00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:02.902
And the veterinarians are going to be collecting this.

00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:04.762
And the whales are trained to this voluntarily.

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:08.436
So their going to lay out and present their tail flukes to the trainers

00:01:08.436 --> 00:01:11.076
and the flukes are a great place to draw blood from a whale

00:01:11.076 --> 00:01:14.808
because they have a lot of blood vessels close to the surface of the skin in their tail.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.460
So the veterinary will be able to draw a blood sample

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.160
and I'll be able to store that sample and later on analyze it for hormone levels.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.419
And then within the same training session, this morning, I'll be collecting that sample of whale snot.

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.409
And that will allow me to go back eventually and compare the levels of hormones in the blood

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.800
to the level of hormones in the snot.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.559
And hopefully they'll correlate and allow us to have a very powerful research tool.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.420
Ultimately we can use this sample collection technique in the wild because it's minimally invasive.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.820
You don't have to catch the animal, you don't have to hold onto it, you don't have to poke or prod.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.080
You just have to be close enough to capture an exhale.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.620
And really that's going to be key for monitoring endangered populations,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.480
where being able to catch them is illegal and isn't possible.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.740
So it really opened up research avenues that otherwise wouldn't be available.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.900
The great part about my research is that it's a little bit of a collaboration between

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.576
the University of Rhode Island and the Mystic Aquarium.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.740
So that I can draw on the experience and the expertise of all the marine mammal staff here

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.108
at the Mystic Aquarium,

00:02:17.108 --> 00:02:21.526
as well as the materials and the expertise that are available at the University of Rhode Island.

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:24.846
So it's working out perfectly for me because it's really the best of both worlds.

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:30.106
