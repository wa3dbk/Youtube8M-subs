00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:08.779
Video Script: Ford EcoSport

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.240
This is Ford's take on the Nissan Juke.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.930
It's a Fiesta based SUV, called the EcoSport,
and because of the 'One Ford' global strategy

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.560
is was designed and developed in Brazil, and
built in a factory in Chennai, India.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.920
Ford want me to pronounce it 'EchoSport' but
as I can't see the 'H' in the name I'll stick

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.920
with Ecosport for now.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.970
It's only available in front-wheel drive,
but it has 200mm of ground clearance and a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.290
wading depth of 550mm.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:39.829
We won't need any of that today though, as
here in Spain we'll be driving it exclusively

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.920
on the road, to find out if its any good.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.329
I was actually surprised by how well the looks
work on the road, and although the exterior

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.321
design is not as unusual as the Juke, or as
personalised as the Renault Captur, there

00:00:58.321 --> 00:00:59.699
is plenty to like.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.680
The angular head lights come with LED day
time strips as standard, the 16-inch wheels

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.670
are standard too, as are the silver roof rails,
but at the back, things take a turn for the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.670
worse...

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.240
The neat front end styling might be a good
mix of the Fiesta and the Ford Edge concept,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.820
which is coming to Europe in 2015, but here
at the back you see the first signs that the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240
EcoSport wasn't always intended for Europe.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.579
This big spare wheel well sits on the boot
and ruins the rear styling.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.799
It looks a bit like the mark one Toyota RAV4,
and adds 0.2 metres to the overall length.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.140
There is no option to have it removed either,
and as I'll show you, if you're parked in

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.310
a tight parallel space or a multi-story, then
don't reverse in because this massive swing

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.140
door will make accessing the 333 litre boot
very difficult.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.880
Not 
ideal for town buyers, who Ford predict will

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.759
make up the majority of sales.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:02.840
Like any Ford, the EcoSport drives very well.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.610
Because it shares most of its mechanicals
with the Fiesta, the weighty steering and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.280
precise gearbox all feel really well engineered,
and although there is more body roll than

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.450
you get in a hatch back, it grips eagerly
at the front end and turns in very nicely.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:33.180
There are three engines to choose from, starting
with a 110bhp 1.5-litre petrol, and topping

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.819
the range is an 89bhp 1.5-litre diesel.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.480
Here though, we are driving the 1.0-litre
EcoBoost model, which Ford claims makes the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.900
EcoSport is the world's first three-cylinder
SUV.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.700
With 123bhp its the nippiest of the lot, with
0-62 taking 12.7 seconds, but it'll still

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:58.349
manage to return 53.3mpg.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.120
It reminds me a lot of the TwinAir Fiat Panda
4x4 - which means hushed driving in town but

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:20.909
a less than hushed off-beat warble when you're
accelerating and cruising the motorway.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:04:06.329
The 
EcoSport 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.930
we are driving here has been shipped all the
way from India, so it's actually a prototype,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.469
and doesn't have the finished interior trim.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.000
Anyone who has driven a Fiesta will recognise
this interior, with its mobile phone style

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.160
centre console, and in here that means you
get solid robust materials on major touch

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:43.440
points like the steering wheel 
and gear lever, but elsewhere in the cabin

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:52.990
there is a lot of hard scratchy plastic, as
you can probably hear.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.990
Space in here is decent though, and you could
easily fit four six foot adults in total comfort.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.370
There is plenty of headroom, although squeezing
three across the back might be tricky, and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.560
there's not much flexibility with the seats.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:22.490
Still practicality is definitely one of the
EcoSport's assets.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.930
So, does the Ecosport have what it takes to
be a cash cow for Ford?

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.710
Well to give you some idea the brand plans
to sell ONE million SUVs over the next SIX

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.250
years, and this car is key to making that
strategy work.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.610
There are some compromises to designing a
car in South America, and the interior -- although

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.940
this is a pre-production prototype doesn't
quite meet the interior of some of its rivals.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.090
But, the sharper driving dynamics do give
it a real USP in this crowded market.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:05.580
However, the old fashioned looks and some
of the interior trim does let it down slightly.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.880
Having said that Ford are likely to sell every
one of the 4,000 cars they plan to sell in

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.710
the UK next year, and probably many more than
that in years to come.
