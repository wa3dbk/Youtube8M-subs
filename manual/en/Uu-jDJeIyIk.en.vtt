Hi! This is Jon on behalf of Expert Village.
In this video clip, we will be installing

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.200
our back piece. Once we've dry fit our back
piece and made sure that it fit pretty snuggly,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.849
we need to remove that so that we can ready
to glue it and pin nail it. The pin nails

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.589
on the left here are the ones that I use when
installing my trim. They are about an 1 1/4

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:31.980
long. However whenever I install my back piece,
I don't need to go through as much material

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.780
so I've got this much shorter pin nail. If
you take a look at the back, I have this little

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.179
gap here and when I pull my sides together,
it closes. That tells me that one of my sides

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:51.559
are just a little bit warped. A lot of times
when you are using lumber in long lengths,

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.260
here we have a 6 ft. long bookshelf, the board
tends to warp or they could crown a little.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.769
We need to correct this when putting in our
back piece so that when it is standing up

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.920
on the wall it looks straight. First I am
going to put a small amount of glue around

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.422
my entire project on that rabbet. When I put
the back piece on, it is going to secure to

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:26.250
that glue and that is going to hold my project
nice and square. Next we are going to position

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:42.310
our back piece in place. After that I am going
to place a clamp on the section that bows

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.520
and just pull it in tight. Then I am going
to put a few pin nails in to hold it in place.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.610
Now I am actually going to angle the gun into
my lumber so that it doesn't show through

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.489
on accident and we will go ahead and go around
and put a few nails in.
