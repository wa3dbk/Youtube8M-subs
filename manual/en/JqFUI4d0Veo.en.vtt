00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.485
- I want a mustache.

00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:03.256
Do people wanna date me because of that?

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:06.881
(lively animating music)

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.269
- I'm a big scruff
enthusiast if I'm honest.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.090
- I'm not a big fan of beards.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.950
- It's just not a good feeling.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.372
- I do love a beard on a guy.

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:16.955
It's an automatic plus for me.

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:18.896
- Facial hair has never
been a deal breaker. No.

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:20.373
- Talking about beards
is already getting me,

00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:22.067
like, hot and heavy (laughs loudly).

00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:26.594
(lively animating music)

00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:35.230
- Lumbersexual (laughs).

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.439
- Like super sexy lumberjack looking men.

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.716
- I do find the lumberjack
look like quite attractive.

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:42.046
- I'm fine with the flannel.

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:43.580
- All about that beard.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.419
- I only like a guy if I can tell

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:46.980
the last time he took a shower.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.768
(lively animating music)

00:00:50.127 --> 00:00:53.121
- I would say about 50
to 40 percent could.

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:54.522
- 70 percent

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:56.638
would, you know, be able to grow abeard.

00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:58.441
- I think every man I've been with

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.069
has had at least the scruff.

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.642
- I think every boyfriend
I've had hasn't been able

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:04.288
to grow a beard (laughs).

00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:08.635
(lively animating music)

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.686
- There are beard transplants?

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:19.057
- Guys, no.

00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:21.696
- Are you taking pubic hair
and putting it on you face

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:22.807
because that's gross?

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:24.580
- You know how painful that is

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.164
and how long that probably takes?

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:27.881
- If it makes you feel happier

00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:30.736
and it makes you more
confident, then, sure go for it.

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:32.236
- But don't feel like you have to.

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:33.613
- Just be happy with who you are.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.819
(lively animating music)

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.478
- If a man has a baby face,
then he's seen as not as sexy

00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:41.881
versus like a woman
has to have a baby face

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.518
so like what is happening?

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:45.863
No one's a baby. They
just have their face.

00:01:45.863 --> 00:01:47.909
- I just don't want guys to
get self-conscious about it.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.938
I dated a guy who was
changing his diet to try

00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:51.737
and be able to grow facial hair.

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:52.839
- That's really why I transitioned

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:54.471
because my beard just wasn't good enough.

00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:57.682
- There are much better things
about a man than a beard.

00:01:57.682 --> 00:01:59.729
- You not being able to grow
a beard has nothing to do

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.978
with your masculinity.

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:02.411
And also,

00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:03.745
I love smooth skin.`

00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:04.625
- [Transitioning woman]
I sometimes miss it.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:05.634
I miss stroking.

00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:07.817
I mean I like my soft skin but
it was nice to have something

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:09.666
to stroke when you're pontificating.

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:10.377
- [Brunette woman in red]
No. I don't understand

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:11.767
what a lumbersexual is.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.805
Is it just someone who looks
like they work at a lumberyard

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:16.615
and they have a beard?
