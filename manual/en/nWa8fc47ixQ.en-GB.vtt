00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.550
Right from the start of my first
consultation with Dr. De Silva,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.250
I was considering having
rhinoplasty for 2 reasons.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.000
Firstly, a great bump
I had on my nose,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.460
and secondly because I was
suffering from chronic sinusitis.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.250
I had previously sought
advice from other surgeons

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.630
that specialize in rhinoplasty,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.370
but I didn't feel as confident
or comfortable

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.140
to actually proceed with
surgery as I thought

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.200
it's such a big decision
being surgery to my face.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.790
The fact that it's surgery to my face
I thought it had such an impact

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.110
on my life, and recovery
and anything else.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.260
But I considered it for years
and finally went on with Dr. De Silva,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.840
and sat down and we
discussed the options,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.150
the advantages and the disadvantages,
the procedure and the healing.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.360
I decided to go ahead.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.730
 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.250
After doing the research 
Dr. De Silva had told me that

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.820
you know I could have
the surgery done.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.550
It will take place at a
private hospital in London

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.120
which was very convenient.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.020
He also insisted that I have
certain tests carried out

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.800
to ensure that the
procedure is right for me,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.630
and that they are familiar with
my blood and different aspects

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.350
that could play a big role
in the surgery on the day.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.490
I felt rightly assured about that,
because I haven't really been posed

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.260
with questions like that when
it comes to rhinoplasty.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.410
I had the necessary test carried out,
and everything was good to go

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.700
and an appointment was
scheduled for my surgery.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.770
Of course one fears especially
as I mentioned it is my face.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.000
But I was feeling a lot of
reassurance from Dr. De Silva

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.180
and his very helpful,
supportive staff

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.690
that gave me the confidence to
actually pitch up on the day.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.520
When I did I was welcomed.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.470
I sat down roughly for a few
minutes filling out a form

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.130
at the Welbeck Hospital.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.430
They showed me to my private room
with en-suite, it made me feel like

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.550
almost at home and not 
really going to have surgery at all.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.610
I was visited firstly
by the anaesthetist.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.100
She was a lovely lady and she 
made me feel confident and comfortable

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.610
with the fact that she knew
what anaesthetics I'd need.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.600
She explained how 
it's going to be controlled

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.590
and how I'd recover from it,
and what to expect.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.770
After that I had a visit from our Dr. De Silva
who again made me feel reassured.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.420
He came to see me before the surgery
 and he marked out

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.120
where the incisions would be made
to the open surgery I had.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.610
 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.230
And within a matter of time 
I was taken down to the theatre

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.980
where at first I thought
I can now run.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.320
And in seconds I fell
into a very lovely sleep

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.320
to recover after the procedure.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.970
In the recovery room, I woke up
and I felt as if I just had

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.690
fantastic sleep that 
I hadn't had for a long time.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.850
I was taken back up to my room,
and my girlfriend was with me.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.840
She sat there for the 
few hours we were there.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.620
The most pain I had despite
all my fear was a headache.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.770
 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.060
I stayed for a few hours
until I felt comfortable

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.400
and even I had a little 
bit of lunch, and went home.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.910
Of course going home 
I had a cast on my nose

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.470
just to support the surgery 
and what's been carried out.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.830
And as I was prepared by
Dr. De Silva and his team,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.220
I had all my necessary antibiotics,
and ointments that are required.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.880
And I started applying
the ice bag as suggested

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.590
and found that I was
quite comfortable.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.560
And to crown it all I got 
a phone call from Dr. De Silva

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.100
about 8:00 o'clock that
night, just after 8:00

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.970
to find out how 
I was getting on.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.090
I explained that 
I was comfortable.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.010
Well, I was obviously
quite new,

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.900
and I do feel that there's 
a bit of swelling, but I was comfortable.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.220
I went back to work probably
about 10 days after,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.840
but I think those 3 days were
just a little bit of laziness,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.560
because really I expected
to have big panned eyes.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.090
But it wasn't that bad, and by the
third or fourth day after using arnica

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.560
which was recommended, I felt as
if I'm on the way to recovery.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.760
That I'd strongly suggest 
if anybody was going to consider

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.920
having rhinoplasty to seriously
consult Dr. De Silva.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:59.839
