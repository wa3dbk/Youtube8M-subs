00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.570
This K&amp;N air intake system is designed to
increase power and acceleration by reducing

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.210
restriction in the intake path.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.050
K&amp;N’s 63-2578 air intake comes with a carbon
fiber lid for easy filter access.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.030
This air intake fits 2011 and 2012 Ford Mustang
GT models with 5.0 liter engines.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.370
The 63-2578 air intake is not legal for highway
use in California or other states adopting

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.970
California emission standards.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.020
Check KNFilters.com for an up to date list
of models this air intake fits and for a list

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.320
of other CARB adoption states.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.010
K&amp;N power testing showed an estimated power
gain of 20 horsepower at 5400 RPM with the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.250
63-2578 air intake installed on a 2012 Ford
Mustang GT with a 5.0 liter engine.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.759
Actual results will vary depending on the
condition of the vehicle, mileage, weather
