00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.100
Everybody should experience a cruise.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.600
Well, I find that a lot of people that’s gone to resorts

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.300
numerous times want to experience something different. So

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.200
for them to experience something different and they’re used to the Caribbean

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.500
I think they should probably start with a Caribbean cruise.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.200
You can start out with three days, there’s some ships that will allow you to go

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.700
for three days or you could go for three hundred and sixty five days.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.800
So there’s any length of cruise that you wish to do.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.100
The Caribbean is made up of Southern, Eastern and Western Caribbean.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.000
So the main thing is we’ve got to sit down and figure out what points

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.200
of interest that, what ports interest you. The Caribbean has so much to offer,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.400
I mean you got Cuba, and you got the Dominican Republic.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.800
Every Island you go to is something unique.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.800
I mean, I’m a shoe hound and in St. Thomas you can go and get shoes

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.600
right, and St. Lucia there is the most gorgeous mountains that you can

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.400
see and every island is different and the people are all different

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.800
so every time you go to a new island you’re gonna meet extraordinary people.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.900
You get to see a lot. You get to do a lot. And you get to meet a lot of people.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.100
Every age group goes to cruising.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.300
They have special programs onboard for young

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.700
that start from ages three right up to seventeen.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.800
They have art collections so they can go to art auctions.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.000
So you’re looked after from the time you board the ship

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.300
right until the time you get off. You’re completely catered to.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.700
They have really fine dining chefs.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.400
Their stewards, everybody looks after you, like good room service,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.300
you’re completely white glove service if you want it.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.100
You could dress up as dressy as you want to, if you wanna put on

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.600
all your good wears and go and really have a good time you can do that

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.900
or you can just go to the buffets and dress very casual,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.400
you, you’ll fit in very well.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.900
There’s absolutely nobody telling you what you have to do, it’s up to you.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.000
You can get up in the morning and maybe just go to the libraries and pick up

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.200
a book and alright I’m gonna read this book and relax all day onboard

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.100
or you might be one of the people that like to, excursions you know,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.500
like oh we’re into a new port and I’m gonna go and do an excursion,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.500
I’m gonna go swim with the stingray, I’m gonna do something fun.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.900
It’s totally up to you what you wish to do.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.600
So normally when people cruise once they come back

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.300
and do it again and again and again. So they’re hooked.
