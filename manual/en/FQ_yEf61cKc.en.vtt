00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.130
Check it out Treky, says it’s a special delivery just for you.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.100
For me? From who? And why? So many questions!

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.835
Let’s open it up and find the answers.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.620
No way.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.420
Dan’s Dino field guide.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.200
Hey Trek, Dan here.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.720
Dan!
Mom! Dan sent me a video message!

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.659
Maybe you can finish my dino experiments for me ?

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.600
Yes!

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.300
The first one is Dino Experiment 301: Does the Albertosaurus hunt in packs?

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.220
Good luck Dino Trek .

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:44.861
Awesome, the albertosaurus just met up with two of his buddies!

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.120
Wanna see if you can work together to catch me?

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.800
One, two, three!

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.480
Hey! Where are you going?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.860
Chase me!

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.940
Sharesies?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.890
Whoa. I wonder if those Albertosauruses will work together to get this tasty ham sandwich away from me.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.660
Still undefeated!

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.520
And Trek launch to safety!

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.380
Home run!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.060
You got me!

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.020
So you guys do work together to get food that was hard to catch!

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.940
I figured out Dino Experiment 301!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.300
And the crowd goes wild for Trek!

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.020
Tag, you're it, Albertosaurus, no touch backs!
