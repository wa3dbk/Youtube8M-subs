00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:11.669
Avalaaaanche!

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.940
On an asteroid?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.279
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.960
Avalanches aren’t exactly a big killer of
humans, but they’re still a hazard for skiers,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.380
climbers, bikers… basically anyone who does
any sport in secluded areas on mountains.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.100
But one avalanche scientists have managed
to predict will be both super cool and super

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.590
safe for all extreme sports fans: an avalanche
on an asteroid.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.150
Scientists have been tracking a football field–sized
asteroid called Apophis, and it turns out

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.000
this space rock is going to make a very close
fly by the Earth -- it will come within 22,000

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.030
miles of our planet -- in 2029.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.490
It’s not going to affect us or our planet
at all, but the Earth’s gravity will take

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.460
its toll on the asteroid, triggering a series
of small avalanches.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.060
Scientists are basing this avalanche prediction
on pictures Japan’s Hayabusa spacecraft

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.860
took of an Apophis-sized asteroid called Itokawa.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.760
Itokawa, it turns out, isn’t a solid mass
but a clump of rocky debris held loosely together

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.760
by gravity.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.620
It’s likely Apophis is the same, not a solid
mass but a clump of debris.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.310
Computer modeling revealed how a loosely shaped
asteroid might behave passing by our planet.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.650
Scientist placed virtual piles of sand on
the surface of a model asteroid with roughly

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.920
the same shape and dimensions as Apophis.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.730
They factored in the asteroids own gravity,
the tidal forces from the Earth, and centrifugal

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.060
force from the asteroid’s rotation, and
other inertial forces.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.550
Then they measured the effects on the sand
piles.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.070
The results confirmed that the Earth's tidal
forces will be strong enough during the encounter

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.570
to cause tiny avalanches on the asteroid.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.409
So while the view from up close on Apophis
might be awesome during the close pass, it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.630
dangerous, and unfortunately we won’t see
much of anything from our Earthly vantage

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.630
point.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.920
These avalanches are going to move extremely
slowly thanks to the asteroid’s low gravity.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.650
And really, the shifting rock is probably
just going to keep Apophis looking young.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.250
It’s going to resurface the asteroid sort
of like a microdermabrasion treatment.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.950
Still, pretty neat that we can predict an
avalanche on an asteroid five years in advance,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.950
eh?
