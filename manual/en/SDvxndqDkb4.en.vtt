Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. You can
also use a melon baller for this job. For

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.310
a watermelon, it'll take a long time to melon
ball this whole watermelon, but it's a nice

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.770
touch. If you don't want to use the melon
baller for the whole watermelon then we'll

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:35.500
carefully trim out the flesh. With a short
sawing motion just like we did before. You

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.640
don't want to go too deep because you don't
want to come out. Just go down about an inch

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:53.489
all the way around. Then you can begin cutting
out sections of fruit. Maybe a wider knife

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.230
is a little better for this because you can
pull that out and then cut the pieces into

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:13.880
a bowl. Just cut out sections like this using
the different knives that make is easier to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:36.180
pull sections of the fruit. Continue in this
way until you've emptied the whole watermelon.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:46.600
Let me show you at the canopy section. I don't
know if I'm showing you that well. Take the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:02:02.409
knife in a short sawing motion and cut into
it there and then cut there and pull that

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.200
watermelon out. You want to try to get it
out in bigger chunks so that you can use it

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.060
again. You want to be able to cut it into
good bite size pieces. Sometimes it's difficult

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.890
to do that. After you get most of the usable
fruit out of it, we're just going to clean

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.489
it up. We're just going to take a very large
spoon and scrape along just to get it sort

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:38.939
of cleaned out. Then you can just dump that.
It get very wet. Into a bowl and just continue

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:47.170
to scrape it until it's nice and cleaned up
and there's no seeds and extra pieces in there.
