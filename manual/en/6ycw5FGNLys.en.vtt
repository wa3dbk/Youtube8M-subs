00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:08.460
Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now I'm going
to finish the inside neck and the muzzle of

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:22.420
the horse. Start with a back and forth to
knot it and a quarter inch seam allowance.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:34.639
When you come to the corner here, you can
stop and put the needle in and pivot it. It

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:40.620
would be good here to also reinforce this
section so you just go back and forth a little

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.979
bit. That would give it a little extra strength
that is a weak point anytime you have a really

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.839
sharp turn in a stuffed animal. That is a
weak point so it is good to do a little reinforcement

00:00:51.839 --> 00:01:10.049
there. I'm just checking to make sure that,
that shifted a little bit here that is likely

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.079
to happen. I'm just checking to make sure
that I'm sewing on both pieces of fabric.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:29.140
When you come to the end you want a little
back and forth to knot it there and just trim

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:40.909
those threads. Now it is a good idea to just
lightly snip this sharp corner area. Just

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.899
a little bit like mine; don't cut the threads.
Don't cut into the seam but put the fabric

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:55.819
very close to where the seam is and that would
help when you go to turn your horse. Next,

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.969
we are going to turn the head right side out.
