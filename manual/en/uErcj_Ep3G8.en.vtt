00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.670
This is just a short video clip to show you
how to use the world cup spreadsheet you have

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.670
downloaded.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.940
When you get the download and you open up
the zip file you will see 2 files.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.840
The one is for the organiser and the other
one is for the participants.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.340
If you open up the organiser spreadsheet you
will see there is an instruction sheet which

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.370
explains how the spreadsheet should be used,
a little bit lower down the default point

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.719
scoring is shown, you are welcome to change
that to suit whatever system you want to use.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.670
Once you have decided on the points system
you can send out the input template which

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.410
is this file here.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.989
Participants can read the instructions but
it is fairly straight forward they need to

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.991
need to fill in the scores they predict for
each match so you will see that these are

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:07.790
all the matches, group matches.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.220
We will just put a score in here.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.350
When all the group matches are complete the
group standings will be automatically populated

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.360
and the knock out phases will be shown.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.520
Again everyone must guess the scores all the
way to the finals.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:40.530
When they have completed this they must save
the file and send it back to the organiser

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.700
When the organiser receives the spreadsheet
back all they need to do is go and do this

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:59.770
exact copy so go from F10 and go all the way
down to J91, copy it, go back to the master

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.490
spreadsheet, put the player in his appropriate
place for example player 1, I am going to

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.019
come here and then you must paste it as values.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.720
What you will see that all the details come
through but most importantly the participants

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:27.040
predicted knockout matches are pasted as values
and is no longer using a formula.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.760
Once all the players have been captured you
just need to wait, as the matches play the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.310
results will be updated these will automatically
be done and you will see with the results

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.530
in the scores will turn black which indicates
that these are actuals as opposed to predictions,

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.710
the points that that player gets for the matches
will be highlighted here with a total and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.959
this will come through into the overall points
which will then rank it and put the players

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.129
in their appropriate order
