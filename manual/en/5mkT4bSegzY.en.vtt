00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.320
My name is Craig Hale. I am an interior decorator
and I am helping Expert Village.com today

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.340
talk about ways to decorate your walls and
different types of objects it is decorated

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.450
with and also how to even arrange them on
your wall. So you found your big piece of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:34.640
artwork. This time it is an inexpensive museum
print 25 bucks max, framed it myself, probably

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.250
another $25 plus the glass which is not going
to cost you too terribly much. But you have

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.070
hung it up here and you are looking at it,
something that suggests not really right.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.820
There is too much negative space on either
side of your print. So what you are going

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.660
to do is you are going to find your pencil,
your tape measure and nails and you are going

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.309
to hang items on either side to fill in the
negative space around this print. So the easiest

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.399
thing to do is, I am a big fan of eyeballing
so what you want to do is you want to kind

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:19.320
of sort of hold it back, step back and look,
have the center of this wall sconce in between

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:32.560
the top and bottom of the print. Mark the
very tip top of it and then taking your ruler

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:45.310
measure from the top of the sconce down to
the top of the hole for the nail and that

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:55.229
is 8.25 inches. Good luck finding your spot
again there it is and 8.25 inches marked on

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:03.130
the wall. Now since these arenâ€™t very heavy
you do not really need super big nails. So

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:16.230
I am going to just take these little bitty
guys, pound them into the wall

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.980
and then hopefully there Oh! God, that was
easy it went on the first time. So then basically

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.120
you are going to repeat this on the other
side hanging the two sconces to fill up your

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.550
negative space on the wall.
