00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.000
Booze! Yes, it is of course a Great British tradition

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.300
to drink alcohol to deal with any and all of life's problems

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.460
including but not limited to

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.700
inability to find a good parking space

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.080
not being sure how to spell the word, "buttress"

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.400
having a hat that's a bit too tight, any of those

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.080
you can drink your troubles away

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.520
and you'll have no problems whatsoever

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.920
except, you know, maybe

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.200
alcoholism and ruined lives

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.340
but anyway!

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.440
Let's not get into that!

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.140
Let's look at some booze which is horribly past its sell-by date

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.800
to say the least

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.920
Yes, somebody has very kindly

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.180
- and by kindly, I mean evilly -

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.300
sent in a bottle of Royal Wedding ale

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.180
Mmm!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940
From the Courage brewery in London

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.540
Look, they've even put their logo on the top

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.480
'cause they're good like that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.960
And here is a picture of where the wedding took place

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.920
which would have been Westminster Abbey

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560
because of course, it's a Royal Wedding

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.940
Who was married? Well

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.880
This was specially brewed to celebrate

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.380
the wedding of Her Royal Highness Princess Anne

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.980
and Captain Mark Phillips

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.040
at Westminster Abbey, November 1973

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.840
Yes, this ale is 41 years old

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.920
my goodness!

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.020
It's not often I review things older than me

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.840
but here we go

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.960
Minimum contents, nine and two thirds fluid ounces

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.660
wow, those were the days

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.900
or two hundred and seventy five millilitres

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.500
from Courage in London

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.780
Marvellous

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.860
So, as part of our incredibly scientific, uh

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.880
look at whether food stuffs go funny or not

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.940
does beer go off?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.320
What happens to ale over a long term?

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.160
Well, I actually know a little bit about this because

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.960
of course, I'm British

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.820
and therefore looking after booze is extremely important

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.220
to every aspect of my life

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.360
Erm, no, seriously

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.920
It's going to depend a lot on how it was kept

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.820
if it was kept in a cool dry place it might still be alright!

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.780
If it was kept on a windowsill for the last forty years

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.120
it might well be massively toxic

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.860
Uh, things to give it away are

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.400
is it still fizzy when you take the top off?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.360
you know, there should be a little bit of gas escaping

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.440
shouldn't there

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340
I'm slightly worried by this, to be brutally honest

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.480
but, there's only one way we're gonna find out

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.260
if this is as royal and wonderful as we hope it is

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.540
and that's gonna involve

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.100
a bottle opener

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.460
here we go

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.940
Um

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.200
I hope this isn't worth millions and I'm ruining it by opening it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.920
Argh! Can't get it off

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.840
Go on

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.160
And, ooh, blimey

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.640
this cap's on really tight, actually

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.160
Ooh, yeah!

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.400
Release of gas!

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
We could be doing alright here!

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.920
Mmm

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.700
Well, something is giving a hint to me

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.560
that actually, things may not be alright

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.220
and that is the incredibly powerful citrus-style smell

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.240
that has filled the room

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.700
on taking this off which is a pretty good sign

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.540
there's some bacteria at play

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.480
I shall have a sniff

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.760
Yeah

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.480
That smells very, very sweet, for an ale

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.360
also, there appears to be some sort of stuff growing on the inside of the lid

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.880
well, let's pour it out

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.380
and see what it looks like in all its glory

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.440
Mmm, I hope there's a good head on it

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.980
Ooh, it looks alright

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.560
again, the smell is not exactly, uh

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.620
going to, uh, excite anybody

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.140
Wow!

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.960
what a joy that is

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.500
The smell is something really quite fantastic

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.360
it just smells of very gone-off beer

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.960
Mmm, I wonder why

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.880
I'm going to have to sip a bit now, aren't I

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.280
in order to get my Internet points

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.080
Right

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.760
Here goes everything

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.240
Ooh

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.540
Yeah, that is what we call in the trade, a bad pint

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.360
probably because it's over forty bloody years old

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.620
mind you, there's nowhere near a pint in it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.020
Barman, I demand more of this possibly poisonous stuff!

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.280
Nah, seriously, that's all gone a bit nasty

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.520
I would've expected to be considerably nastier

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.420
actually, just tastes sort of slightly off

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.520
but not quite as bad as I would be expecting, to be honest

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.700
I've probably had worse from dodgy pubs over the years

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.260
well, maybe not, actually

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.580
Yeah, in fact, definitely not

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.540
I'm going to say

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.780
hmm, quite looking forward to rinsing my mouth out with something

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.520
well, there we go

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.560
unfortunately, even the mighty ales cannot survive forty years

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.160
unless they're probably in very, very good storage conditions

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.140
and even then, it would be a little bit dubious

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.480
well, if you know how the wedding of, uh, Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips ended up

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.620
hint: divorce

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.240
I would be expecting it to taste of tears and recrimination anyway

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.780
so it's always got that going for it

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.720
Subscribe for more

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.680
Anyway, I shall leave you with this British pub classic trick

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.940
if you've got a pint and you don't really want it

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960
or you just want to cause hassle behind the bar

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.040
take your finger, stick it up your bum

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.060
and then offer the pint to the barman and say

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.700
"Ooh, this pint's off, sniff that"

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.000
and when he goes in to sniff it, it will smell like it's gone off

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.660
Sorry, that's an old joke

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.260
don't actually do that

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.160
that would be fucking horrible

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.920
but if you do, don't tell him I told you it
