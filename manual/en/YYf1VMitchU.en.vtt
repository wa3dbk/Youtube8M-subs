00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.890
Utilizing both hydrophobic down insulation
and synthetic thermo pro insulation, you have

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.080
the Kelty Dualist 22.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.199
The story behind this sleeping bag is that
Kelty has decided to use two types of insulation,

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.779
one being that 550 fill down that is coated
with a water re-sistant finish.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.919
So you have that insulation closer to the
top of the sleeping bag.

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.700
This is going to really protect against moisture
entering the sleeping bag.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.620
The other part of the insulation, you have
that thermo pro synthetic insulation and that

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.550
is basically on the bot-tom, so the top has
that down and the bottom part of the insulation

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.110
has the synthetic.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.670
And what the synthetic is going to do is allow
it to breathe, allow moisture to wick away

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.180
from your body as you are sleeping in the
bag.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.540
So you have got a really nice design here,
a really great mix of insulations which puts

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.240
this bag at a really great value.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.560
Kelty uses European norm or EN ratings for
their sleeping bags, which is really nice,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.680
be-cause it gives you a realistic idea of
how comfortable you are going to be at different

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.950
temperatures.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.109
The EN rating for this sleeping bag has a
comfort level of closer to 30 de-grees and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.780
the lower limit level is right around 22 degrees.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.009
So, you know, with all the fea-tures of this
bag it is a mummy shaped bag, so you can really

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.509
cinch down the hood and keep your heat in
there.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.840
But consider the EN rating before taking it
into the backcountry.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.299
You have got just enough features with this
bag while keeping the weight pretty low.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.030
Starting with the zipper you have a full length
zipper that goes most of the way down to the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.970
bottom of the foot box.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.479
It is a two way zipper.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.600
So if you need to vent on warmer nights you
can vent the sleeping bag from the bottom.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.490
Obviously you can unzip it from the top.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.550
You have a nice hood and it is really nicely
shaped.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.170
You have, you know, one panel up here on the
top and baffles around the side.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.390
So, like I said, when you really need to batten
down you can batten down with this draw cord.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.010
And that cord goes around the top and around
the bottom so if you want you can just cinch

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.060
the top part down around the top of your head.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.390
If you really need to cinch the bottom down
around your face, you can do that as well.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.460
There is a collar on the inside so that just
provides a little bit more warmth around your

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.220
neck so you are not losing a lot of heat from
your core.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.730
And there is a draft tube behind the zipper
so that prevents cold spots from occurring.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.150
You also have a durable material behind the
zipper so, you know, if that were to snag

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.760
as you are opening and closing the sleeping
bag, it is not going to rip that light weight

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.090
material, but it also prevents snags from
happening, so you can really slide that zipper

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.430
up and down without worrying about it getting
caught.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.980
The material here is just a really nice, light
weight, comfortable material on the inside

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.900
and the outside.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.120
And all in all just a really great bag.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.090
Some last quick features, the foot box is
a natural fit foot box, so you don't just

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.230
have the top of the bag sewn to the bottom
of the bag.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.320
You do have a nice box shape so it is a lot
comfortable for your feet there.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.290
It also comes with an included stuff sack
so you can stuff that down with the down insu-lation

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.180
and the synthetic insulation.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.760
That definitely stuffs down to be pretty small
for this type of bag.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.150
It is going to be great for campers, back
packers and travelers looking for a warm weather

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.620
bag that is going to last a long time.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.320
It is the Kelty Dualist 22.
