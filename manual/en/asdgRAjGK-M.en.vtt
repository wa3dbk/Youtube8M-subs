00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.870
Architecture is used for more things
than just building a house. It's in this

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.840
building, in your phone, even down at the
park.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.930
Did you know that the Sims video game
was initially designed as an

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.220
architecture simulator? Why have i told
you this unnecessary fact? Because today

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.050
we're talking to an architect and if you've
ever played Lego or The Sims then maybe

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.800
you have the artistic design and flair
to be an architect and today we're gonna find out.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.890
Today we've come to the
University of Western Australia to talk

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.360
to Sophie Giles and architecture lecture
to get the lowdown on what it's like to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.559
be an architect.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.160
Jesse. Very nice to meet you. I got
a couple questions about being an

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.719
architect could you help me out?

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.560
Love to. Love to answer your questions
come with me.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.800
Jesse what would you like to know?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.580
Well I want to know what's involved with
being an architect. I am an architect I'm a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.420
registered architect and I practice, but
i'm also teach architecture associate

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.530
dean in the Faculty of architecture
landscape and visual arts at UWA so I

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.940
have a number of roles and that but i'm not
a typical architect. You're a busy person.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.060
So can you take me through a
typical day for you and also what it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.320
would be like for an architect?
For me a normal day would be teaching

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.979
students, the typical architect who
doesn't take would be involved in

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.780
probably a number of scales of project
so small scale projects, possibly drawing

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.820
designing details, working on-site
fielding calls from contractors on site

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.950
working in large teams, large projects
either likely or around the world.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.580
So it's not just sitting down and designing
houses it's a lot more involved? I think

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.229
sometimes architects wish they could just sit
down in one spot and design all day

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.070
architects are generally covering a whole lot of
different scales of project at the same

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.850
time. Sitting down to draw would be a luxury. 
Is that why you became

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.080
an architect? I particularly was engaged by the
sort of sense of being out to make

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.240
spaces that people could be in,
hang out in but when I was wanting

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.450
to be an architect I didn't know all of
the kind of richness that actually

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.720
involves now and wonderful first year students
come in thinking they're going to kind of

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.480
come out be able to design a house and
then when they come out they can design

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.260
so many things. They can design cars
and can design objects they can think

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.980
about whole master planning and urban planning. Is that the best thing about

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.060
being an architect?

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.330
i think the variety and and one of
the most wonderful things is actually

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.750
being able to hang out in the
spaces and see people enjoying them

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.590
yourself it's kind of almost an
anonymous sense of being up to give back

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.560
to people. You've done your building,
you've done all the design, you've done

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.069
the fun part, but what's the hardest
thing about being an architect?

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.580
The hardest parties is reconciling your
client expectations and also your own

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.630
expectations about time and budget.
Trying to produce a really quality piece

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.850
of work for yourself but also for your
clients.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.940
I mean is there much work out there for
architecture the moment? I think there's

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.340
it's a really varying wave and
particularly in this boom state

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.730
it seems really connected to the amount
of money that

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.720
the state has. Here there's less work
currently for architecture compared to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.000
European nations at the moment but
there's always working in the realm of design.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.340
And so someone wanted to become
an architect what is the one piece of advice you would give?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.099
I think it's really about
kind of immersing themselves within the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.910
realm of design and so it's
not just the design of buildings but

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.080
very much the design of kind of
environments and furniture, clothes

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.950
products,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.310
yeah just immersing oneself within that
in that realm.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.329
Awesome well why don't we immerse
ourselves in the edge now you're ready?

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.900
First question, what characteristics 
does someone need to be and architect?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.560
i think very much the
creativity and also the kind of science

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.910
base the ability to hold a number of
different aspects in their head at once.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.569
Whether their pragmatic and creative
aspects of being able to put a deal with

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.799
them at the same time. And if you could end up
where you are today but do one thing

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.540
differently, that would that be? Probably
spend more time communicating with

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.280
clients throughout the building process. 
And from school to

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.299
today what are the steps you need to take to become an architect?  You need to go to a

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.229
university which teaches architecture
and you need to do a three year

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.320
undergraduate degree, then you move into
your master of architecture then you

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.620
work in an office for a number of years,
then when you feel you have enough experience

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.229
and scale of contracts to then take your
architecture accreditation exms which

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.919
actually very difficult exams
but once passing that then you become a

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.240
registered architect. There's a bit of work
involved? It is its kind of that it

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.590
comes in some small sections.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.889
Well thanks so much for talking to us today
i have learned a lot but I kind of want

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.099
to put a moat around my house, can I talk to
you about that? I would like to talk to you

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.580
about moats but also refer you to 
the local council in regard to

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.810
the water safety, ok.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.110
So if you liked building Lego or playing
The Sims as a kid then maybe you've

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.370
got the mix of design and creativity
needed to be an architect. For more info
