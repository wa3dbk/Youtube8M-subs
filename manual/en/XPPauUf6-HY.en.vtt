Hi, I'm Amelia and I'm going to show you how
to apply a hair relaxer. For all intensive

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.629
purposes, we're going to pretend like this
mannequin has never had a relaxer before.

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:16.710
So, first we're going to apply a base. A base
is basically a petroleum based product that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:25.910
you apply to the hairline and to the scalp,
and that protects the skin from any burning

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.430
from the chemical. We're using a sodium based
relaxer today, there is another kind that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.050
you don't really need a base with and I think
that's called guanidean based, and then of

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.680
course, the traditional immoniumsyigaliate
which is your basic perm, you don't want to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.370
mix that one with any other kind, or the hair
will fall off. So you just apply the base

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.729
and you do apply it all the way through, each
section, about a quarter of an inch sections,

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:06.979
you apply it to the scalp. Keep going like
that through all of the sections, and then

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:16.740
this is when you apply your relaxer.
First, I always like to apply the relaxer

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.850
first to the areas where it tends to be the
curliest, except the hairline, the hairline

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.689
around the front since it tends to be the
weakest, I always leave that out first. And,

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:35.290
you see I'm using a flat brush, I like to
use a flat brush cause it doesn't get the

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:43.250
product caught in the bristles and it's really
good for smoothing out that hair. Now, with

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.679
a relaxer, it's all about speed, because with
a relaxer, as soon as you start applying the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.850
product, your timing begins, so I have with
this particular clients hair about thirteen

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.400
minutes to get this product on all over. Now
that I've applied the relaxer to the area

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.591
that I want it to be in, I'm just going to
work the hair for the amount of time that

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:10.440
I have left. If I have no time left, then
it's done. You don't want to leave it on any

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.080
longer than the manufacturer directs. So,
at this point, I'm going to take her to the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.560
shampoo bowl and apply a neutralizing shampoo.
A lot of neutralizing shampoos have got color

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.659
coaters in them, so that way it tells you
if the relaxer is completely out of the hair.

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:32.319
You shampoo two, three, four times, as many
times as is needed, in order to get the relaxer

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.010
completely out to stop the processing. Then,
once you've shampooed, you're done, you style

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.860
and your client is ready to leave and that's
how you apply a relaxer.
