00:00:01.973 --> 00:00:03.964
The Boarding School Black Lagoon

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.933
an elite school in a privileged environment.

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.253
It seems to be a peaceful place.

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:13.924
It does...

00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:16.124
but strange things happen there.

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:47.946
So that's why ghosts appear, right?

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:51.346
To tell us something important.
*HELP*

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:56.980
And till they tell us, they won't rest in peace.

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:08.126
First there was a light

00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:11.809
and then crimes began.

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:34.349
Tell me what you want from me.

00:02:19.143 --> 00:02:21.717
They kill students.

00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:34.269
Marcos, look, this girl looks like me a lot.
