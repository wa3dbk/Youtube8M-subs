00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:03.430
mrs parker

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.470
bob suffers from low c_d_

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.169
were over unity compulsive disorder

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.919
coupled with a touch of free energy
audits

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.239
bob is a real handyman

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.720
he thinks that you can create already
promoter

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.109
cannot sleep that night because he keeps
saying that what

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.539
his mind to change the station

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.949
he needs to get ally for the very least
wife

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.410
nothing but over unity will do

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.660
i feel sorry for bop

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.480
watch if you want to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.320
carers bobby explaining one of its cold
prototypes that obviously did not work

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.320
but he keeps i'm trying and never gives
up not as long as he has to be rinuskoe

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.310
brocade

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.800
this is just the setup of my magnetic
generator

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.660
i'll just give you an idea of what's
going on here i'd basically have three

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.400
status one too

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.400
three can't make each have magnets on
them starting with five minutes going

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.990
nowhere eighteen magnets over here and
three o'clock two o'clock

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.990
the negative tapered back down sixteen
fourteen eight uh... six and five again

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.520
and then i'll have a many here on top

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.530
and we don't want to go

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.840
public magnus from here to hear third of
the wheel will be taken up magnets

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.210
antoine attracted the most strongest
part glow in the last minute and these

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.100
will be down here and that and then that
that will stop but i'll have the same

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.280
thing

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.070
behind it

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.830
artsy on the second one

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.100
and then in the third one all offset by
a third civil all want to do the same

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.450
thing you reach the strongest magnet no
health flywheel in between each of these

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.380
these are attached as insurance against
racial purposes i have to all tomorrow

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.520
leonid

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.500
make moma perfect families these other
ones will spend as well and though cause

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.260
it to be like a flight we all have have
you heavyweight hopefully be enough to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.599
get it from the so the locking face

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.619
over to beginning face again now each of
these ideas are squaring incident circle

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:27.399
the square has opposed both both bumps
truett he sends a goes around so that

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:32.089
the kit is a quarter weight at the top
of each square

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:33.599
there'd be a magnet

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.309
which will be a bar going across from
the and to the top hovering through

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.290
reports of magnus is covering their
screwed at the back

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.040
and then every time this was around it
because this little part about spock in

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.629
repulsion and what oscillate up and down
up and down up and down now there'll be

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.509
another

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.279
feel way out here

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.340
magistad further

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.579
now this thing will be bouncing
up-and-down annenberg hall champaign

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.599
upbeat pushing this other we all wrapped
bouncy bouncy bouncy bouncy reference

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.840
that's my basic idea now i do have other
ideas to build upon that are using a

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.019
magni double

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.129
that i'm going to get from this weed
whacker

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.509
dismayed needle and hook it up to the
magnets on the balance you we'll so

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.949
every time the magnet school past look
like a spark

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:33.949
charge now i'm circling that charge to a
uh... spark plugs

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.950
i will put it to an electromagnetic

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.150
which will also be on here in a
horseshoe fashion wishful up push it

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.339
down an attractive for work so i'll put
it around tunnel two o'clock or so

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:54.799
so it'll track it from twelve o'clock to
one o'clock at two o'clock it ought to

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.689
be be a horseshoe magnets repulsive i'm
using a oslo clip from a sheet

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:01.900
uh...

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.390
you know horseshoe clamp for your most
persistent aka wires all wrapped around

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.109
his little turn intellectual magnus one
side will be positive or something

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.230
negative values that one side to attract
in the other side to repulsed now turned

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.340
the wheel as well now have left the
space over here for

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.430
for pendulum to swing now this pendulum
when its wings

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.599
it will create a popping action i'm also
might do it on top not sure yet but this

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.710
is this will cause this arm i can turn
linear motion into rotor motions so the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.009
back-and-forth is linear motion i can
turn that into rotary motion which

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:36.389
wrecking
