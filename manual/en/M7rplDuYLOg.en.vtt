00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.640
Hi everyone, Scott Lewis here for Wirefly.
Today I'm here to bring you an unboxing

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.080
of the brand new Samsung Galaxy Note II for
T-Mobile. The Galaxy Note II has been given

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.340
a lot of buzz especially off the success of
the Samsung Galaxy S III. The specs in the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.570
Note II are actually even better than Galaxy
SIII. Let's go ahead and dig in and start

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.570
our unboxing.
I'm cutting the box because I tried to slide

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.670
the sleeve off earlier and it is stuck on
that. I didn't want to spend all your time

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.059
trying to slide a sleeve off so that's why
I cut it off. Let's go ahead and break the

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.620
seals now, we can see this one's a little
broken already; and that one.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.170
There's the 5.5 inch Super AMOLED display
that's on the Galaxy Note II. Just going

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.170
to pull that out; and our T-Mobile micro SIM
card; underneath the flap here we have all

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.630
the manuals; and this long -- looks a little
longer than normal -- micro USB charge cable;

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.840
micro USB charge block; and the battery. The
battery in the Galaxy Note II is a 3,100 milliamp

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.390
hour powered battery -- should last you a
very long time, almost as long as the Razr

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.080
Maxx HD. The last thing in the box here that
I'll pull out are the ear buds; so you get

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.520
some ear buds with the Galaxy Note II, as
well as some replacement ear gels or some

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.290
different sized ear gels. That's everything
that you get from the box for the Galaxy Note

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.220
II.
Let's get the charge block and charge cable

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.900
off to the side; and the replacement ear gels.
We'll go ahead and take a look real quick

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.900
at the headphones, let's slip and slide
them out. They're a nice looking set; you

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.070
have your volume control, mute controls in
line. See there, an in-ear set of ear buds,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.530
and just your standard 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.530
Let's go ahead and install the battery in
the Galaxy Note II. The Note II comes with

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.640
16 gigabytes of internal storage, but you
can add up to a 64 gigabyte micro SD card

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.910
if you would like some additional storage.
As I'm putting the battery in, I want to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.440
make sure you see the micro SD card slot as
well as the micro SIM card slot that's underneath

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.640
the back cover. Underneath the back battery
cover you also have NFC technology built in.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.640
NFC technology allows you to use your phone
as a form of payment at retailers that accept

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.920
PayPass. You can actually make a purchase
with your Galaxy Note II, and then it's

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.090
built to a credit card that you have linked
to your Google Wallet account. I'll go into

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.560
a little bit more depth with NFC technology
in the full review of the Note II. Let's

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.990
put the back cover on.
On the back here we have the 8 megapixel rear

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.730
facing camera with an LED flash. Here's
our speakerphone speaker, and you can see

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.910
at the bottom it's the spot for our S Pen.
So the Galaxy Note II comes with a stylus,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.970
it's called an S Pen; the S Pen has a little
button. I'm going to show you a lot about

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.959
the S Pen in the full review.
You can also see the color; it's this steel

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.860
grey or titanium grey; it also comes available
in white if you prefer white. And have I told

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.040
you that it's a 5.5 inch Super AMOLED display.
The screen resolution is 720 x 1280, which

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.150
gives it an overall pixel density of 265 pixels
per inch. Overall thickness is 9 millimeters,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.819
so it's not very thick; and it has an overall
weight of 6.34 ounces. Let's go ahead and

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.190
take a tour real quick; we have our 1.9 megapixel
front facing camera, and you can see there

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.560
is a physical dedicated home key. On the top,
we already saw it, but we'll show it again,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.630
here's the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack;
the volume up and down, the rocker switch

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.280
is here on this side; and then on this side
it's the power and sleep button.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.260
Let's go ahead and turn on our Galaxy Note
II. The Galaxy Note II is running Android

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.190
4.1.1 right out of the box, along with Samsung's
TouchWiz user interface. The Note II is powered

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.190
by Exynos quad core processor, it's clocked
at 1.6 gigahertz, it has 2 gigabytes of onboard

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.400
processor RAM, and like I already said it
comes with 16 gigabytes of onboard storage,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.120
but it does have that spot underneath the
battery to add additional micro SD card storage.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.529
We'll be doing a full review of the Galaxy
Note II but I want to show you my favorite

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.449
feature on the Galaxy Note II real quick,
as well as show you the white version of the

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.020
Galaxy Note II. This is the white version
and you can actually have a split screen on

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.050
this. This is just a regular YouTube video
-- not split screen -- this is the YouTube

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.479
app, you press and hold the back key and you
get this split screen option right off to

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.650
the side; and let's say you want two; pull
the tray back out, and you wanted to look

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.889
at the internet while you're watching a
Wirefly YouTube video; and you want to shop

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.770
for phones on Wirefly. You can do that; and
I really like it in landscape mode. Because

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.490
the large sized screen makes it easy to see
both of the options, or both of the things

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.339
that you're doing. You can adjust the size
of the screen, so if you want the video to

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:23.759
be a little smaller and your web to be a little
larger you can do that. Or let's say you're

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.960
done shopping and you want to get full screen
again, you can tap the full size and you go

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.599
right back to your video. That's my favorite
feature of the Galaxy Note II so far, and

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.999
there's a lot of other things that I'll
cover. Like I said I'll show you a full

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:42.479
review on the S Pen, as well as S Beam, Share
Shot, and other fun features that you have

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.309
on the Galaxy Note II. Like Samsung says in
their commercials, "The next big thing is

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:49.349
here."
That wraps up our unboxing of the Samsung

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.639
Galaxy Note II for T-Mobile, my name's Scott
Lewis for Wirefly, thanks for watching.
