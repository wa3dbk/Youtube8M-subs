Hi my name is Dave Andrews and today I am
going to show you how to keep track of changes

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.440
in an Excel document. Let's open up Excel
and I am clicking on the start button and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:30.900
go to all programs. Let's find Microsoft Office
and let's just open up Excel.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.370
Now we are going to enable the feature in
Excel that tracks changes. To do that let's

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:45.379
go to review which is a tab on the top here
and under the changes area let's pull the

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:54.370
little drop down here next to track changes.
Select highlight changes. This brings up the

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:02.619
dialog that is going to enable to change tracking
for us so just click this box and for when

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.170
we want to leave that on all because that
is the type of change that we want to track.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.750
We want to track every change ever made to
this document. You can also track the changes

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.009
since the document was last saved. For who
I am going to leave that on everyone and say

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:26.020
o'kay. Now it is going to prompt you to save
this because in order to track the changes

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.159
the file must be saved. I am just going to
keep the default name of book one and we are

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:49.359
going to save them. Now let's make some changes
to my document. As you can see the cells that

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.850
I have changed have a little arrow up here
in the top let hand corner. If I move my mouse

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.429
over them it pops up a little box that tells
me exactly what was changed in the document.

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.340
It will do this for all cells that are changed
all the time because those are the options

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.750
that will be selected. My name is Dave Andrews
and I have just told you how to track changes

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.770
in an Excel document.
