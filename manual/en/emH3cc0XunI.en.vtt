00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.350
Today on our 2005 Chevrolet Express Van, well
be installing the Hopkins Adaptor 4 Pole to

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.830
7 Pole and 4 Pole, part number 37185.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.650
As you can see here, this particular vehicle
already had a factory wiring harness connected

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.650
at one time.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.550
But somebodys already gone and cut the ends
off so we just have exposed wires.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.420
Were going to go ahead and use our test light
to see whats working.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:51.800
Well have someone run through the running
lights, figure out which 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:04.640
wire 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:02:43.150
does which.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:03:04.380
With 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:24.540
using our test light, we 
found 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:56.010
that 
the brown wire 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:05:22.020
is the running light circuit.
