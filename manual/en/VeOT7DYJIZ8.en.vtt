00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
"Ginger for Migraines"

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.100
Many successful herbal treatments start like this.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.023
Some doctor learns that some plant has been used

00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:17.654
by some ancient medical tradition, like ginger for headaches

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.297
and figures, hey, they've got patients with headaches

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.632
and since its just some safe common spice

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.196
advises one of their migraine patients to give it a try.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.639
At the first sign of a migraine coming on,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.671
the patient mixed a quarter teaspoon of powdered ginger in some water,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.822
drank it down, and poof, within a half hour

00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:35.420
the migraine went away.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.580
And it worked every time, no side-effects.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.917
This is what’s called a case report,

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.566
which is really just a glorified anecdote,

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.388
but case reports have played an important role

00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:49.220
in the history of medicine.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.060
AIDS was first discovered as a series of case reports.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.397
Some young guy walks into a clinic in Los Angeles

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.600
with a bad case of thrush and the rest is history.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.440
Or reports of an unusual side-effect of a failed chest pain drug

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.960
leading to the billion dollar blockbuster, Viagra.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.028
Case reports may be the ‘lowest’ or ‘weakest’ form of evidence,

00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:14.065
but they are often the ‘first line of evidence.’

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:15.380
That’s where everything begins.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.820
So a report like this isn’t helpful in and of itself,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.260
but it can inspire researchers to put it to the test.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.140
The problem is, who’s going to fund it?

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.180
The market for migraine drugs is worth billions of dollars.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.218
A quarter teaspoon of powdered ginger costs about a penny.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.100
So who’d fund a study pitting ginger

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.818
versus the leading migraine drug?

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.640
No one...

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.300
...until now.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.837
A double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.200
comparing the efficacy of ginger to sumatriptan,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.345
also known as Imitrex, one of the top-selling

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.058
billion dollar drugs in the world,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.780
in the treatment of migraine headaches.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.820
They tried using just one eighth of a teaspoon

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.300
of powdered ginger versus a good dose of the drug.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.200
And they both worked just as well, just as fast.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.040
Most started out in moderate or severe pain before,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.590
but after the drug or ginger,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.300
ended up mild or pain free.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.536
The same proportion of migraine sufferers reported satisfaction

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.156
with the results either way,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.480
and so as far as I’m concerned ginger won,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.439
not only because it’s a few billion dollars cheaper

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.140
but because there were significantly fewer

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.460
side-effects in the ginger group.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.325
On the drug people reported dizziness, a sedative effect,

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:34.833
vertigo and heartburn.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.288
The only thing reported for ginger was an upset tummy

00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:38.960
in about 1 in of 25 people,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.304
though taking a whole tablespoon of ginger powder

00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:44.484
at one time on an empty stomach

00:02:44.484 --> 00:02:47.020
could irritate anyone’s tummy,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.700
just as a note of caution.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.620
Sticking to an eighth of a teaspoon

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.300
is not only up to 3000 times cheaper than the drug,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.460
but you’re probably less likely to end up as a case report yourself

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.720
of people that have had a heart attack

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.580
or died after taking the drug.
