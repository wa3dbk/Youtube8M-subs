00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.629
I’m Joe Marshall with expertvillage.com,
and today we’re going to discuss flourishes.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.910
This next move is just a one handed spread
with a cut involved. It’s just a fancy way

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:21.970
to show a cut and put the deck back together.
Again, it’s one handed spread. Cut the pack

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.350
and let it tumble on. In slow motion, broken
down it looks like this. You take up the deck.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.040
Again, as all the moves are done, middle finger,
ring finger, thumb on the back, pull of the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.940
packet, you get it into the ready position
to do a one handed spread and that’s there.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.300
First finger on top, two middle fingers on
the side, pinkie on the bottom, thumb goes

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.870
down the corner, spreads, do your one hand
spread. What’s happening over here is this

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.890
packet comes up, your thumb peels off a portion,
you stick your spread into that portion so

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.739
that this cut packet is on top. Essentially,
you’re just going to turn your hand over.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.999
This packet is going to fall over the back
of your hand like so, and land onto the packet

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:16.649
that’s waiting below. Again, comes up over
the top, gets into the one handed fan. This

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.020
packet is broken into two, you separate there,
you let that packet fall over the back of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.290
your hand and tumble onto that packet, and
then you’ll close the fan up on top of it.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.969
The only thing you really have to look out
for once you’ve mastered the one handed

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.779
fan and you can cut the pack and let it sit
there is the distance at which you’re going

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:42.039
to want it to fall. If it’s too high, it’ll
tumble one and a half times; if it’s too

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.950
low, it’ll only tumble half. You just have
to get the knack down for actually where it’s

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.709
going to do one complete revolution and fall
back down.
