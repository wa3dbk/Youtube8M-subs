00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:22.440
Dr. Bozidar Mitrovic: Here's the Earth again,
North Pole, South Pole, equator.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:31.440
The
observer is now sitting on the equator.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.370
The Earth is spinning from west to east.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.210
As a result, it appears
that all the stars are revolving from east

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.170
to west.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.500
Along the
paths, they're always parallel to celestial

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.249
equator.

00:00:54.249 --> 00:01:13.030
A star here
would be moving like so.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:26.580
Or the one located here 
would be moving

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.980
like so.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.870
Agree?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:51.670
This is the horizon of the observer sitting
on the equator.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.930
Every
single star that this observer sees, it rises

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.540
and then it sets.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.869
When you talk about the location of anything,
you always have to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.870
specify, relative to what?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.250
What is the reference point?

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.580
We are
talking now about what different observers,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.860
when I say different,
located at different spots on the Earth's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.870
[inaudible 02:29] .

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.450
We look first at the observer sitting at the
North Pole.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.380
Now, we
are looking at the observer sitting on the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:49.280
equator.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.790
This observer will actually see the two celestial
poles would be on

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.310
his horizon.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:13.099
As a result, every single star that he observes
will

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:19.340
be rising above the horizon and setting below
the horizon.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.090
Namely,
no star that he can observe is always visible.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.920
They all rise and
set.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.629
No star is circumpolar stars.
