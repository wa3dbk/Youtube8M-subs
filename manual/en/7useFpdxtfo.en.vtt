00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.140
Rovio has been an interesting company to watch.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.360
In the space of a few years it has gone from
being an unassuming Finnish studio on the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.870
edge of bankruptcy to the custodians of one
of gaming's most famous franchises.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.869
Now the world is watching with bated breath
to see exactly how Rovio plans to follow up

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.930
its billion-download hit.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.519
Bad Piggies is the latest, tentative, rather
reserved step towards a true follow-up.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.980
It's yet another physics-puzzler, still set
in the world of Angry Birds, but with the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.630
pigs as heroes rather than villains.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.850
It's certainly something new.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.520
In each level you're given a toolbox of building
blocks - like crates, wheels, desk fans, helium-filled

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.350
balloons, and motors - and you've got to assemble
a vehicle that will ferry your pig to the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.350
finish line.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.789
You hit 'play' and gravity takes over.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.430
Wheels roll, balloons lift off the ground,
and unbalanced vehicular monstrosities fall

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.219
flat on their faces.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.430
Depending on the tools available, you'll also
be given any number of buttons so you can

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.489
turn on fans or detonate boxes of TNT at will.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.559
It doesn't quite have the simple, kinetic
thrill of Angry Birds, but there's something

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.530
quite attractive about seeing your home-made
creation trundle down a hill - especially

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.300
when it's some wobbling great jalopy with
a wheel on its roof and a spring on its bumper.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.429
And especially when it cartwheels into a spectacular
crash and ejects your pig passenger through

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:13.820
the windscreen.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.300
It's playful and creative, even inside the
quite restrictive boundaries of each level.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.240
You get to try out ridiculous ideas, and flash
an ear-to-ear grin when your madcap plans

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.520
actually work.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.660
Bad Piggies is a bit like the best physics
lesson you had school, but on every day of

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.550
the year and with no theory in between.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.480
It's also more predictable, and far less finicky,
than Rovio's previous puzzlers.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.280
In Bad Piggies you have to place your tools
within a strict grid - which is in stark contrast

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.869
to Amazing Alex, where you could shift toys
by tiny amounts, for dramatically different

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:42.869
results.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.950
There's a lot of content on offer, with about
100 levels available from launch.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.649
But that's not the end of it.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.680
Each stage has three goals which all require
very different vehicles and strategies.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.840
You might want to build a land speeder that's
tuned for the timed goal, or a dependable

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.220
buggy to get over the line without breaking
into bits.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.800
There are goals for collecting crates, and
ones for making a vehicle that doesn't use

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.899
the most obvious tool in your collection.

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.220
This system gives you good reason to replay
certain stages, and forces you to try new

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.220
tactics.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.310
It's just a shame there are no real social
features, aside from Game Center achievements.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.250
It would be brilliant to show off a particularly
insane contraption to a friend, but short

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.490
of physically lugging your iPad to his house
it's not possible.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.910
Now, Bad Piggies is certainly good fun.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.420
It's better than Angry Birds, far better than
Amazing Alex, and of the same quality - in

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.590
imagination, personality, and smarts - as
the wonderful Angry Birds Space.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.410
It's possibly the best game that Rovio's done
yet - but the formula is starting to feel

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.720
a tad stale.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.090
With so many physics-puzzlers on the App Store,
with quirky cartoon graphics and three-star

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.129
scoring systems, maybe it's time for Rovio
to try something new.
