00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:14.609
Signore e signori, buona sera! Oggi abbiamo per voi uno 'special show' di Moderno Medicino, Dieci Milliardi Di Lire! OK!

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.789

Yo! It's the tall jack the lad that doesn't at all lack pizzazz, Big baller? For sure, I'm the mack of macks,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.530
that's a fact,
We ransack the bank, act gangster, and splash the cash...
Back to back living life in a cyclone,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.950
Campagne, flash dames in my home
House so big it crosses two damn time zones,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.200
So many chicks no space in the iPhone!

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.040
I don't give a care in the world what anybody
thinks,\

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.750
Buying any girl plenty frothy drinks\
\

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.649
She drop a wink, face says she got a kink,\
hottie minx, spending the night with a proper

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.899
pimp.\
\

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.649
No time to stop and think, let the shots begin
cos we got 'em in\

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:07.399
\
They like "what's with him? He the boss on

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.209
top of things,\
Enter Bobby but Bobby like "I got a quid"\

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.929
\
And every time I'm out it's true I'm just

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.039
gonna give it up\
So let's just get with this and come on people

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.069
live it up\
I'm feeling good, I do, and this is how it

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:22.069
is\
I ain't got much to spend, but I feel like

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.119
a million quid.\
\

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.119
I feel like a million quid, do you feel like
a million quid?\

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.090
\
Every quid I made is getting paid to play

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.319
my games, never seeing the red,\
Big rings and chains,fast cars and planes

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.850
this life is going to my head,\
Everything I say, everything I see, everything

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.850
I do's the main event,\
I have got pounds, I have got pence,\

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.499
But ain't got cash to pay the rent,\
\

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.399
Make that money, Fake that money,\
Got it or not just waste that money,\

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.649
x2\
\

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:04.979
Me and my compadres do it big grande,\
Wrist on freeze like a cup of iced latte,\

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.840
Can't make sense of what anybody at the bar
say "good"!\

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.750
we cam here to partake in pataying larger
than scarface, Half baked, \

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.400
Nightlife shake off hard day,\
Can't wait to rave off my arse straight my

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.400
cigar shaped part parked on a tarts face,\
Spend a million quid on a brilliant crib,\

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.510
Bobby and Dylan shoot sharp like Billy the
Kid,\

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.510
You know whose city it is, It's our town,\
Ballin'! Rediculousness!!!!!\

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.920
Big rings and things that shine,\
Bling kings sip vintage wine,\

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.900
Mr Rich and Mr Nice,\
"Winning"!!\

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.370
If only we could live this life...}
