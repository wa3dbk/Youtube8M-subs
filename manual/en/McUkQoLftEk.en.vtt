Hi I am Amelia and on behalf of Expert Village.com,
I will be talking to you about using thermal

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.900
styling tools. Whenever you are using hot
tools and trying to worry about hold for your

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.080
hair always remember that you need something
on your hair when it's wet. You need to style

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.460
your hair with something. Now we prepped Lauren's
hair with a volumizing spray and I am going

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.900
to go over that again. We're just going to
pretend like it's wet. Whenever you are using

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.520
a volumizing spray always use it at the roots
cause that's where you are going to get your

00:00:34.520 --> 00:01:10.790
volume. That's where you are going to really
want your lift. So, turn on your dryer. Another

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.270
trick is your going to want to use that cool
shot button, which is the little blue button

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.610
on your blow dryer and that's going to really
help hold that hair as well. So, I am letting

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:34.320
that cool down So I got a little bit more
body there. Now hairspray, most people just

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.969
don't know how to use hairspray. They just
spray it all over and that?s not really what

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.119
you want to do. If you are wanting to give
yourself more body and more volume at the

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.890
top, you're going to want to really lift that
hair and spray it from underneath. And hair

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.939
spray is also a great thermo protectant as
well. So, you could spray your hair a little

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:02.780
bit and then use your flat iron or your curling
iron and just bump the ends under, or whatever

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.530
you are wanting to do that particular day.
And that's going to help give you some hold.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.540
Cause you have sprayed a product on there
that is specifically for hold and then you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.570
have locked that hold in with heat. So you
are going to get a lot more hold that way.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:29.930
And when all else fails give yourself a little
scalp massage and you can really plump that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.790
up. So that's how you get hold for fine hair.
