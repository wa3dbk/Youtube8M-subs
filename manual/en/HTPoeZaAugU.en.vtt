00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.820
Hey I’m Stephen Schweickart with this episode
of Reel Rebel and today we’re going to show

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:19.140
you another way to control your image with
ND Filters.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.390
The first video of our Advanced Lighting series
taught you how to slap some gels on your lights

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.680
and keep your color temperature in check.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.599
This time around you’ll be slapping even
more gels on your lights to keep their intensity

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:30.599
in check.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.840
Jeez, these lights sure take some policing
to get right, eh?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.190
Anyway, we’re talking about ND or Neutral
Density filters and their job is to keep parts

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.969
of your scene, or your whole scene as we’ll
get into later, from being too bright.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.039
ND gels work a lot like color temperature
gels in that you just clip them onto your

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.270
lights for them to do their job, but obviously
we’re dealing with brightness, not color,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.460
so they have very different functions.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.010
These gels are available most commonly in
three grades, .3, .6 and .9, each getting

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.000
darker as the number rises.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.640
So the higher the number, the more it’s
going to knock down the intensity of the light.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.479
If your backlight is putting too harsh a rim
on your talent, stick an ND on there to help

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.840
bring it down a notch.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.840
Simple.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.310
But what if your whole scene is too bright?

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.310
Well there’s a solution for that too!

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.220
And I don’t just mean that you need to suck
less at lighting.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.000
That’s not doable.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.700
There are ND filters available that screw
right onto the end of your lens bringing the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.299
brightness of your entire scene back from
that “surface of the sun” look we’re

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.470
trying to avoid.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.600
The ND lens filters come in the same intensities
as the gels, though you can find different

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.950
grades if you try.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.810
Let’s look back on one of our old videos
about depth of field.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.450
We tell you here that one of the factors that
determine your depth of field is your aperture.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.079
So if you have to close down your aperture
to knock down the brightness, you start to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.520
deepen your depth of field and lose that filmic
look that blurring parts of your scene gives

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520
you.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.090
Sticking an ND filter on your lens saves you
from having to do this and preserves that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.909
deliciously shallow depth of field all amateur
movie makers, including you newbies are looking

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:01.909
for.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.581
If you want to get real fancy, you can even
find gradient ND lens filters that start at

00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:09.130
a certain intensity on one side and taper
off at the other.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.020
These are perfect for keeping your skies from
being totally blown out when filming a landscape

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.670
or any scene where you’re seeing a lot of
this bright blue dome around the Earth.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.160
When it comes to exposure, the name of the
game is CONTROL.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.880
If you can’t control your light, it will
control you and let me tell you, it will NOT

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.110
be gentle.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.580

knowledge, you go ahead and control that cursor
