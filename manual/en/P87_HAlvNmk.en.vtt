Howdy folks hows it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen today i'm showing you how to make

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.310
a 2 ingredient nutella hot chocolate.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.430
Good, good times.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:21.960
OH my gosh guys this recipe is so easy plus
it's smooth, delicious, rich, creamy, velvety

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.590
I don't know where i'm going with this but
it's customisable you can put your own spin

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.750
on it and when you think of hot chocolate
do not think of that band from that stripper

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.970
movie what everyone dances to at weddings
'I believe in miracles, where you from etc'

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.970
you know what i'm saying?

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.970
Pushing that joke a little too far?

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.199
yep... ok think of something that's a pleaser
for you anytime of year particularly in these

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.829
cold Months I live by the sea in the UK and
we are getting battered not like a fish battered

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.129
we are getting by waves of up to 2 foot high
so everyones freaking out and going aghhhh

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.329
stay indoors drink nutella hot chocolate.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.399
First up grab your mug of choice then dollop
in your nutella I used about a tablespoon

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.129
which is quite a good amount but you can tweak
that anyway you like and then you wanna pour

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.760
in your milk now if you're lucky enough to
have a cow and you've got an udder to hand

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.189
just imagine this is an udder not syrup you
wanna sort of milk it in there not gonna do

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.420
that but you know what i'm saying or just
pour your milk in little bit of gap there

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.299
so you can stir it around later on otherwise
it'll spill all over your hands and you don't

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.299
want that.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.119
Plonk your mug into a microwave for around
about a minute to warm up the milk and loosen

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.920
the nutella carefully take it out of the microwave
and give it a darn good stir together until

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.800
it's thoroughly combined now at this stage
you could add anything you want you could

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.460
add cream, marshmallow, hazelnuts, cinnamon
whatever you want but it's pretty darn amazing

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.460
on it's own.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.759
Place your mug back into the microwave to
warm it up to the temperature of your liking

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.950
now of course you can do all of these steps
on the stove but it'll just take a little

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.320
longer but once it's ready your mug should
have a nice swirly effect on top or if not

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.299
you can just make that by swirling a spoon
and it's ready to be drunk.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:02:11.360
So that my friends is how you make a delicious
two ingredient nutella hot chocolate - good

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:31.440
times.
