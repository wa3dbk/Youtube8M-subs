00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.780
I grew up as a dancer.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.840
My whole life I've been dancing since I was three.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.240
I did gymnastics as a kid

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.900
and then I basically had to choose which one

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.555
I was gonna become really serious in

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.740
and um I chose dance

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.980
and I don't regret that decision at all 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.940
because it's brought me to so many places.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.180
The last couple years

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.320
ever since I graduated high school

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.220
I started auditioning.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.140
Took four or five years until

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.900
something actually happened.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.180
They contacted me at the end of March and um

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.660
they asked me if I was available

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.700
and I just immediately said, "Yes! Let's go."

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.860
While I was there we pretty much

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.860
attacked the role right away.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.780
It was just me and one of the acting coaches there and

00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:49.953
we were working on a lot of uh...

00:00:49.953 --> 00:00:51.925
character analysis with the Trickster and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.580
how I can bring myself as a dancer

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.020
into that character.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.160
It's been two months...three months

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.340
since I've joined and uh...

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.320
I'm enjoying everything.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.400
It's still kind of unreal.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.220
Yeah it's...a dream come true.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.040
Cirque has helped me become the Trickster

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.240
not only...figuring out how the Trickster acts

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640
and how he moves

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.300
but almost how he thinks.

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:24.235
In a way that almost helps the character

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:26.054
number one stay fresh

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.585
but number two be real.

00:01:28.098 --> 00:01:30.198
I think that's what really keeps the audience

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.640
into the show and...

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.640
keeps the show interesting for me.

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:38.032
There's some days when uh...

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.260
I'm performing and I'm looking into

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.140
people's faces it's...it's the way they light up

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.760
that lights the fire in me.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.640
If I'm looking at somebody

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.320
and I'm seeing a dull face

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.700
I know I'm not doing my job right.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.680
The second that you lose your artistry

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.080
and your wanting to create

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.240
it's almost like you've become neutral to the show.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.680
I feel like I almost jump into character

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.020
as soon as stage lights hit me.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.954
Almost as the pre-show announcement is happening

00:02:04.954 --> 00:02:06.254
I'm always waiting back there.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.000
It's almost then when I'm not talking to anybody

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.060
and I can barely see anything.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.940
I'm in the dark and it's just like okay...

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.620
I'm not Joey anymore, I'm the Trickster.
