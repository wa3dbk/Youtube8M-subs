00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.220
- Hi, I'm Jerry James Stone,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.920
and you're watching Cooking Stoned.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.509
On today's episode, we're gonna make a

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:16.271
green chili baked egg, I
think you're gonna love it!

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:19.935
Removed the husks and
the silk from the corn,

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:22.981
cut the kernels off as close as you can

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.841
without actually removing any of the husk.

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:30.841
So now we're just gonna sweat
our 1/4 cup of red onion

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.964
and our clove of garlic.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.921
Just we don't want to saute
'em, we don't want to brown them

00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:39.137
we just want to start to pull
out some of the moisture,

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.998
which is what you do when
you're sweating them.

00:00:41.998 --> 00:00:44.752
We're gonna do that just
for a couple minutes

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:47.093
and then we'll transfer
this to the ramakin.

00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:52.018
Now, using the same pan we're
just gonna cook our corn.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.955
Just for about, probably four minutes.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.155
You might need to add a
little bit more oil for this.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:00:59.175
Just when you kind of start to see them

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:02.254
go from yellow to gold, they're ready.

00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:04.261
Since we're gonna be baking these

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.074
we don't want to do all
of the cooking here.

00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:08.767
Alright, add in our seared tomatoes,

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:10.740
and now the green chili's.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.560
You could chop these up, I
like kinda how they look whole.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.173
So, I'm gonna leave the
little stem hanging out

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:18.041
over the edge, there.

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:19.681
Now we're gonna crack an egg into

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:23.028
each one of these ramakin's
and bake it at 375 degrees

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:26.763
for about 10 minutes or just
until the whites are set.

00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:28.183
Looks pretty good, huh?

00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:30.325
Just go ahead and top it with some

00:01:30.848 --> 00:01:35.316
chopped cilantro and some
fresh pepper and salt.

00:01:36.823 --> 00:01:38.038
And enjoy!
