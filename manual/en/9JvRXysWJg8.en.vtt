00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:26.039
I’ve never played Super Stars Wars, but
I’ve heard a lot about it.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.130
I’ve heard it’s the best, I’ve heard
it’s the worst.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.230
It’s a game that got great reviews, it’s
a game that got terrible reviews.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.100
I wouldn’t know, this is the first time
I’ve ever played it.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.910
But I can already tell…

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.270
The Force is strong with this one.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.790
It’s Super Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi,
for the SEGA Game Gear.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:58.860
So I’m not sure what everyone else was playing,
but…game’s pretty freaking good, you guys.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.509
And I’m not even like the world’s biggest
Star Wars fan, or anything.

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.440
Like, I’ve seen the movies, they’re good.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.800
Even liked the prequels, too.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.360
But I’m not some biased Star Wars super
fan.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390
Those people want to kill me right now.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.160
Come on, Natalie Portman in face paint, what’s
not to like?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.560
Actually, that was definitely the wrong thing
to say.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.530
Now, no one’s gonna believe me that this
game’s good.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.890
“Yeah, but he said he liked the prequels,
he’s not to be trusted.”

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.890
Oh, calm down, nerds.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.670
You’re gonna sit there and tell me, Darth
Maul wasn’t the coolest guy that ever lived?

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.300
And Jar Jar Binks?

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.820
Okay, now I’m being a bad person, but the
game’s better.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.890
So basically, it’s an action platformer
that lets you play through key Star Wars moments.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.780
So everything from rescuing Han Solo from
Jabba The Hutt, to the Ewok battle, to battling

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.880
Darth Vader himself.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.130
It’s all there, and it’s all awesome.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.880
Well, mostly, but more on that later.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.990
In the game’s best parts, it’s a fantastic
side-scroller, especially for the Game Gear.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.520
It controls great, the platforming is solid…the
only real issue I had was with the hit detection,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.079
which can be pretty charitable for the enemies.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.420
It’s like sometimes, you get hit even when
you didn’t get hit, and your hits have to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.390
be perfect, or they’re actually misses.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.420
So I don’t know, maybe your lightsaber needs
new batteries or something.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.849
But other than that, no issues with the platforming
gameplay.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.200
You can do double jumps, a la Metroid, and
all the different characters have just the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.470
right sense of weight and momentum.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.779
So these parts definitely play well.

00:02:46.779 --> 00:03:08.409
Now, where I did have some complaints…is
the game’s design.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.159
I mean, as well as the game plays, the levels
are actually kind of a disappointment.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.359
They’re tall and kind of aimless, where
you’re not really sure where you’re going

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.700
or what you’re doing.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.700
Or they’re hallways.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.409
Just like, straight hallways, that you walk
down.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.180
It’s like walking to the bathroom.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.340
Only there are droids in your way.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.059
Which actually, sounds a lot like working
at Classic Game Room, going to the bathroom

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:36.059
is a nightmare sometimes.

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.279
But the point is, for a game that plays so
well, I wanted the levels to be just as good.

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.219
To be memorable, and creative.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:47.950
But unfortunately, they’re just kind of
plain, standard, average, aimless…not exactly

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.709
bad, but…far from great…

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.780
Actually, these are bad, I take that part
back.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.849
I mean, the control in these race levels?

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.109
It’s like buying a condo on Alderaan.

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:06.870
Soon as you get there, blows up in your face.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:21.430
Fortunately, though, the game is very, very
Star Wars.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.360
Might even say it’s Super Star Wars, imagine
that.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.360
It does a really nice job of bringing the
license to a video game.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:43.500
I love some of the sprites, the game animates
well, there’s some music from the films,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.150
you get to play as a bunch of different characters,
and even different versions of characters,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.430
which is awesome…and actually, each character’s
a bit different, too.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.009
Like, in terms of gameplay.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.169
I know Chewbacca’s different, I’ve seen
the movies.

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.600
I made an Alderaan joke.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.900
Point is, there are a few flaws, but this
is a very good Game Gear game, and it really

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.430
makes me want to try the console games.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.270
I’ll have to see if I can dig one up somewhere.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.350
Classic Game Room is so vast, it’s hard
to find things.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.710
And there are dangerous, rogues, all over
the place, it’s like Tatooine.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.080
We’re in a binary star system.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.060
See, I’ve seen the movies.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.139
It’s Super Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi,
for the SEGA Game Gear.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.620
Thanks to Daniel from Randolph, Vermont, for
sending this to the show.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.400
I bet Daniel likes trade tariffs.
