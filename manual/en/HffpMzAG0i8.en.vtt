00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.020
 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.040
On my journey to explore making it in the art world I'd discovered a unique character.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.070
Fritz's work explored each man's quest to carve out

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.110
a spot for themselves on an individual level. Something I suppose

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.170
I looked for in making films. 
 The seed paintings they represented birth.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.220
And Fritz argued that the birth of everything came from the seed.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.280
His NY Times pieces embodied man's quest to be recognized. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.320
But like the very printing press he was emulating, the beauty was less in the individual piece and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.340
more in repeating the job over and over. Year after year, with minor tweaks. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.390
In a way, like humanity.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.420
As our friendship grew, I also explored the modern day art world machine.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.490
POWHIDA: You know there's no real formula for how you make it.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.550
It just has a lot to do with luck.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.650
It is incredibly competitive because there is just a limited

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.710
number of exhibition opportunities. You know grant opportunities. Everyone's applying

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.810
for the same things. People are trying to get into shows. They're trying to sell their work.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.900
And there's just not that many slots. In some cases

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.930
it's the artist's network and who they have access to that just kind of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.050
can open doors that just aren't accessible to an artist that has some talent

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.220
some product. The art market is much like other cultural industries. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.280
It's based on a star system. There's really not that big of a

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.320
difference in talent for example. It's just, you know...

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.340
it might be who you know. It's not a system that favors

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.360
people who don't have connections to society.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.400
Trying to achieve some level of success in the art world it just seems like it's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.460
always right there. But it just keeps moving

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.490
away from you (laughs.) 
 I think the hardest part of being an artist is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.580
keeping it going. Trying to make new work. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.700
I'd like to make it clear that most artists, even if you think they're famous, are still 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.710
probably struggling. They're maybe teaching full time. They might have a second job.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.770
I mean for very few artists they...

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.850
actually don't have to work. Maybe there's like 100 or 150 artists in New York

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.880
that can just live off their work, that you know of.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.130
DOUKE: Publicity and marketing plays a big part. 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.250
I'm certainly, at this point in my career, really wanting that.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.270
I always call it, you need the big machine behind you.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.300
The big machine is a gallery that will do publicity

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.320
and marketing. I've never felt like I've

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.340
you know, achieved the goals that I want. Or

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.360
the success. But there are intermediate successes,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.400
sometimes I'll have an intermediate success here in the studio.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.420
I'll have a great day of painting where everything happened to go right.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.480
A lot of people look in the art history books and go wow

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.500
but think, a lot of artists are only known for one work.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.570
There's only one work in the art history book. What have they done the rest of their lives.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.620
You know to keep going. 
OUTLAW: New York's a very...

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.700
a very large place (laughter.) That's one of the main things. 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.760
New York is essentially the center of the universe, especially when you talk about art.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.790
It's where everybody comes. Everybody knows what's going on.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.860
Everybody is happening. It's an intimidating place. 
 CATRONE: There are a lot of artists first off.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.890
OUTLAW: It's very daunting to think of how to break into

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.920
that world and how to get people to notice you and recognize you.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.970
It's a huge undertaking for anybody to come here and anybody to try to make some waves

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.990
in the giant ocean of an art world. 
 CATRONE: Because every gallerist we have spoken to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.020
has been like, you know what, we show people that we know.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.060
They don't just randomly look through some different slides and be like, oh I want to show them.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.130
Like they want to, as it is with anybody, you want to get to know that person.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.190
We're on a career path that's not smart.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.220
CATRONE: And we're smart people (laughter.) 
 OUTLAW: It's not a good gamble. We're not playing

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.260
the numbers correctly. Or making the safe bets.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.370
Or going into a career field that's got a guaranteed margin of profit for the rest of our lives.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.440
From an economic stand point. 
 CATRONE: It's dumb.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.500
OUTLAW: Probably the worst decision ever. But there's something about us

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.550
particularly that we have to do what we're doing because

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.590
Whatever inside of us makes us go against the smart choice.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.630
(laughter) For whatever reason we have to do this and we have to continue doing this.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.680
You could be an outstanding artist and if no one ever knows you

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.730
Or knows to talk to you. Or you never get the opportunity to

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.780
invite them to see what you do on a personal level,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.890
then you may never be discovered.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.010
But not everyone recognizes that chance. Or they don't do the things that are necessary to

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.040
capitalize on their chance. And they may end up living the rest of their life

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.090
and dying and not even knowing that, that was their chance.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.200
Because it was something small or mediocre or

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.230
they didn't feel like it was worth their efforts or something like that.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.280
 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:24.638
