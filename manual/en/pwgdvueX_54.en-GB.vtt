00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.200
The climate control in this car has lost it's ability to maintain a cold temperature in the cabin.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:18.580
To remedy this I will be refilling the air conditioning with an R-134a Air Con Gas refill!

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.320
..and using a dispenser with it to get it into the system.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.900
First we need to run the car engine.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.840
This will also let us see what temperature we can get the air conditioning down to at the moment.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.580
So we'll set it on the minimum

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.260
and we'll need to leave this running for about 3 minutes

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.000
During this time you can also check to see if there are any leaks in the system. 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.320
If there are any leaks then you don't refill it, you'll need to get it repaired first.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.860
Even after a few minutes with the engine running

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.500
the inside temperature has not dropped significantly like it should of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.660
so we will be refilling the system

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.880
First of all locate the Low side port on your air conditioning pipes

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.520
and remove the cap.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.200
Then with suitable safety goggles and gloves

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.020
get your R-134a Air Con refill gas and a dispenser.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.500
Screw them together.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.240
..and then set the dial to the temperature

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.220
and then we want to refill to within the green but within the temperature lines 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.060
Use the quick release.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.740
Fix that on to the air conditioning.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.260
Now we are in the white zone, so we need to put some in.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.860
So we squeeze the trigger.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.840
Give it a shake every few seconds, release the trigger to check where you are.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.360
Bit more.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.100
..and we're in the green.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.040
That's fine.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.280
That was easy.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.020
Release that.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.800
..and then we'll leave the car running but we'll put the cap back.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.500
and we'll see if that cools the cardown any further?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.400
hopefully it should!

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.820
Only a few seconds later and back inside the car

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.460
the temperature drop has been immediate.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.880
Later the same day, and after checking with the manufacturer's recommendations for this vehicle

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.560
we decided to add a little bit more refridgerant.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.300
The air conditioning is now blowing icy cold in this vehicle.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.380
..and it's just getting colder all the time!

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.700
I don't think I can stay in here much longer!

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.200
Bye!
