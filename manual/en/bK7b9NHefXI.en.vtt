Another week, another video, another favor.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.799
I ask that you please like and share this
video because it could be for you or for someone

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.520
that you know. I want to send a special thank
you for everyone that shares my videos. They

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.250
reach so many people and I don't know that
many people, so I know it has to be because

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.410
of you, so thank you. Today is the day that
you let go of that hurt and you release that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.309
pain forever. Your tears have served the ground
for far too long. It's time for you to practice

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.719
that smile daily. It's time for that smile
to no longer be a stranger and it's time to

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.210
let go of the things that are stripping your
heart of its happiness. You can't heal

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.999
by going back to the hurt. You can't
receive your future by holding onto your past,

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.370
so stop pressing replay on the things that
need to be deleted from your life. Stop getting

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.800
upset with God for not closing a door that
you choose to keep reopening. You can't get

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.210
your life together by staying involved with
the things that are tearing your life apart,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.890
people. So why complain about the situation
that you aren't willing to change. Talking

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.730
about it just makes you feel good about doing
nothing about it. Sometimes, we can't control

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.250
getting hurt. I understand that, but rehearsing
that same pain is always a choice. Driving

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.540
down that same road that led you nowhere is
a choice. Living that same lifestyle that

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.390
led you to heartbreak is a choice. Giving
your trust back to those that have abused

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.720
it is a choice. You may not be in control
of what they give you, but you're always in

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.080
control of what you accept. So stop asking
if it's love when it's tears that are flooding

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.500
your pillowcase every night. Wake up! Stop
asking if it's going to be different when

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.840
you know nothing about that situation has
changed. Wake up! Love isn't abusive. Loyalty

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.530
isn't occasional, so stop ignoring those red
flags that are waving in your face. Stop overlooking

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.040
what you see. You should never have to question
something that's real. You go through it to

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.060
grow from it. You go through it to learn from
it. You don't go through it just to go back

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.690
to it. That's like putting your hand
on a hot stove that you know is hot and expecting

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.220
it not to burn. Wake up! Stop teaching yourself
the same lessons that you should have learned

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.289
from. You will never move forward in your
life if you're living your life through the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.430
rear view mirror. You know, it might hurt
to leave that situation, whatever that situation

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.749
is. It doesn't have to be relationships. It
might hurt to leave it, but it's a lot less

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:23.140
painful than staying in it. Your heart isn't
a punching bag, so stop letting people treat

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.140
it like one. Stop rehearsing that same pain
and release it for good. But like always,

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.790
it all starts with you. Protect your heart.
It's Rehab Time.
