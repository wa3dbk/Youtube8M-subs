Hello my name is Luis Estrada and I am a software
developer. In this video I'll show you how

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.860
to create your own internet radio station
probably the easiest way to include audio

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.250
broadcasts on your website is to use a free
hosting service for your radio shows. This

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.789
service will provide you with a free audio
player that you can embed on your website

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.990
and audio streaming technology to play back
the files. Audio streaming means that your

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.940
users can start listening to your audio files
instantly and without having to download them

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.340
to their computers. Another advantage of using
the internet to distribute audio is the ability

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.769
to provide on demand services unlike traditional
radio stations where you can only listen to

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.619
whatever shows is playing at the particular
time, on demand services allow users to listen

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:56.830
to their favorite radio shows at any time.
To create your own internet radio station

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.430
you need to sign up for an account on a free
audio hosting service like the one found at

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.320
Gcast.com then you will be able to upload
your radio shows as mp3 files to your account.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.960
You could also record audio using your cell
phone and dialing a free number. This is a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.330
great feature if you need to record on the
road. Gcast will then provide you with a customizable

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.210
audio player. You can select the color and
size that works best for your website's template

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:42.690
then you can include a player on your website
with just a few lines of code.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.130
Another great feature about the service is
the possibility of distributing your radio

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.520
shows as podcasts. Your listeners would be
able to subscribe to your radio station and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.270
have your radio shows delivered directly to
their computers, ipods, or portable audio

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.549
players using a computer program like itunes.
I am Luis Estrada and I have just showed you

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.540
how to make money with your websites.
