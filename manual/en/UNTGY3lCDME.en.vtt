Our next guest hails from Dallas, Texas 
and has a large online community.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:13.000
He's ranked 20th in the most inspiring people on the web, 
along with Oprah at #1 and Bill Gates at 21.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:22.000
So please put your hands together for Trent Shelton.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:41.000
[instrumental music]

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
You've got something you believe in? At that point in time
in my life, I knew what my purpose was.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.000
My goal is to make the name of Jesus 
Christ more famous each day.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.500
[instrumental music]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, let me tell you, from the bottom of my 
heart, that you can do it. No dream is too big.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.000
You know, people would laugh at me when I would say, "I'm 
gonna go across the world and go speak."

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.000
They looked at me with my tattoos and stuff and said, 
"Nah, you're not a speaker. You can't do that."

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.000
But at the end of the day, I believed in myself. I believed 
in that dream. I believed in the fact that I could 
do something great with my life.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.500
As I told you in there, each and every one 
of you out here has a seed of greatness planted inside 
of you. Whether you know it or not.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Whether people tell you that you can't be nothing. 
You have to believe it yourself.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
They say that you have to know where you're going in life.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Do you always believe that When people tell you you're broken,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.200
you're always going to believe that you need to be fixed, 
that there's something wrong with you.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.500
You've gotta have a vision. You've gotta know where you're 
going because if you don't, you're just living life.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Taking whatever comes. Believing whatever people tell you.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.500
Hey, you can be who you are. Embrace your flaws. 
Embrace who you are.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.000
You know, you can be that person. You can still live for 
Jesus Christ because at the end of the day, it's about what
you're living, not necessarily about what you're talking.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.500
A lot of people, when I'm wearing this shirt or talk about this 
book, they look at me like, "Oh, what have you done in your past?"

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.500
It's not about having a bad past. It's about growing daily.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Making your todays better than your yesterdays, and having 
faith that your tomorrows will be better than your todays.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.000
So don't get discouraged where you're at because our 
ultimate goal is eternal life.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.200
Rehab Time is life changing. It's inspiring.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It's a place where people can meet together.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.000
It just opened my eyes to a whole 'nother 
world of different things.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.000
We were very happy to be able to invite Trent Shelton, 
CEO of Rehab Time, to part of our women's conference.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
I'm Miles Austin of the Dallas Cowboys 
and I support the movement.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.000
This is Jesse Holley of the Dallas Cowboys giving a 
big shout out to Trent Shelton.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.800
It's Rehab Time. Rehab Time.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.000
Go get your t-shirt. See my heart, not my past.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.000
It's the movement. Get with it or get left behind. We're 
changing lives. We're definitely changing lives. Go get some.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.000
Trent now is a person that lives for Jesus Christ. I always 
tell people my goal is to make the name of Jesus Christ more 
famous each day.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.000
I'm a person who cares. A human being who cares.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.000
I want you to understand that He's going to take you places 
that you might not understand just to bring you to the place 
where He wants you to be.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:30.000
And after all, you know, He's never gonna leave you, despite 
all the sins you commit. Despite all the wrong things you do, 
He always has your back.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:41.000
