00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.600
Sola experientia is one of the terms
that we might use to contrast with sola scriptura.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.560
And it is a way of identifying
how we've arrived at a place where

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.000
personal experience competes with biblical
wisdom in the lives of so many people.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.320
It explains why among other things to use
the terms that Ed Shaw introduces in his

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.970
excellent book why there's a bit of a
plausibility problem with biblical wisdom.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.310
So again, I'm going to bring you back. The
problem with sola experientia isn't some

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.610
kind of a 21st century problem. It isn't
something that happened with the sexual

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.300
revolution. It actually brings us all the
way back to the 18th century and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.600
specifically during a world view called
German romanticism. And it was the first

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.990
time in the history of the world that
personal experience was connected to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.600
epistemology. Prior to this time in the
world personal experience was something

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.890
that informed your thinking. But it was
not ever considered itself a vestige of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.370
epistemology. That is a truth claim in and
of itself. But today that is what we have

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.248
and that is why people can say, "I'm a
Christian, I just don't believe The

00:01:31.248 --> 00:01:36.800
Bible is true." That would have been an
unthinkably, internally, implosive and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.870
contradictory statement and you know why?
Because it is. Because the word of God and

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:50.570
the person of God are not disconnected.
But we do live in a land where personal

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.400
experience is more than just an informing
process in a person's worldview and epistemology.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.270
It is often
the defining focus.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.530
And that is what sola experientia is. It
simply will not co-exist in a biblical

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.100
world and life view.
