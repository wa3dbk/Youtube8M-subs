00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.816
"Prostate vs. Plants"

00:00:04.286 --> 00:00:05.985
According to a recent review,

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:07.782
“The most notable development

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:11.678
in the [epidemic of prostate enlargement 
and lower urinary tract symptoms]

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.065
is the recognition that 
modifiable lifestyle factors

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:19.025
substantially influence the natural 
history of these conditions.”

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:21.836
These are the factors 
associated with increased risk:

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:24.735
obesity, diabetes, meat and fat.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.495
And some associated with decreased risk:

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:29.959
exercise, moderate alcohol 
consumption, and vegetables.

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:31.628
Which vegetables?

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:34.864
Garlic and onions appear to help—

00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:38.330
I like how they call them onion “users.”

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.355
Cooked vegetables appear 
to work better than raw,

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:44.110
so maybe it’s the carotenoids.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.867
And legumes were also found protective:

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:49.042
peas, beans, and lentils.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.615
And flax seeds appear so powerful

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:56.834
that they may be used to both 
prevent and treat the condition.

00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:59.914
A randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled clinical trial

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:04.242
that found that flax phytonutrients 
not only alleviate BPH symptoms,

00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:09.479
but their efficacy appeared comparable to 
the drugs we spend a billion dollars on—

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.647
without the side effects.

00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:15.616
Flax seeds also work 
against prostate cancer.

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:19.441
These researchers had men who were 
about to get their prostates removed

00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:25.121
eat three tablespoons of flax seeds a 
day for the few weeks before surgery.

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:29.703
They were skeptical that they would 
observe any differences in tumor biology

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:34.075
between the flax seed-fortified, diet-
treated patients, and the controls,

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:37.603
with such a short-term 
dietary intervention.

00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:40.993
But they found significantly 
lower cancer proliferation rates,

00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:45.031
and significantly higher rates 
of apoptotic cell death—

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.488
the cancer cell suicide I’ve talked about.

00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:51.046
Thus, these findings suggest that a 
flax seed-supplemented, low-fat diet

00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:55.834
may have an effect on 
prostate cancer biology.

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.953
Just a few things have 
been found associated

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:02.155
with significantly increased 
risk for the disease:

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.397
refined grains, like white bread;

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:07.249
also, eggs, and poultry—

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.158
which appeared even worse 
than red meat or desserts!

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:14.557
“Although these data are observational
and [more research is necessary],

00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:17.053
there is little, if any, downside

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.488
to promotion of healthy 
lifestyle interventions -–

00:02:19.488 --> 00:02:22.524
weight loss, exercise, 
decreasing meat and fat intakes,

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.323
and increasing vegetable intake -–

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:26.761
among those with [prostate problems],

00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.612
particularly since these 
interventions possess proven benefits

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:32.832
to overall and cardiovascular health.”

00:02:32.832 --> 00:02:36.219
And how about before 
you’re a prostate patient?

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.624
“Lifestyle habits associated with a 
decreased risk of developing clinical BPH

00:02:40.624 --> 00:02:43.683
are also highly likely to be 
beneficial in reducing the risk

00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:47.613
of erectile dysfunction, 
cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.

00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:51.456
For this reason, urologists 
should encourage all men

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:55.777
to undertake a prostate-
healthy lifestyle.”
