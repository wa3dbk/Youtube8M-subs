00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:08.476
[ Silence ]

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:13.696
&gt;&gt; Well, there are approximately 500,000 spine operations done per year,

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:20.706
and these are a spectrum from what we call simple back surgery for a lumbar disk

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:25.786
to more a complex procedure, such as lumbar spine fusion surgery.

00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:32.996
And lumbar spine fusion surgery makes up a minority of all of spine operations,

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:38.946
but at the same time, it's one of the most serious operations you can do, and certainly,

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:43.196
in that context, you want to be absolutely sure that you need that surgery.

00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:51.916
The vast majority of patients get better with conservative measures, such as physical therapy,

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:55.786
lumbar spine injections, or other types of treatments.

00:00:55.786 --> 00:00:59.666
But for that small percentage of people who, in fact, do need spine surgery,

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:04.856
and that's typically when they have persistent pain and x-rays or other types

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:10.156
of radiographic studies that demonstrate either abnormal movement or an injury to the elements

00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:13.436
of the spine that make it stable.

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:19.436
And in that instance, when all other measures fail, surgery is really indicated.

00:01:22.336 --> 00:01:28.526
Typically, when one does a spinal fusion surgery, at least in quote unquote,

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:33.726
the old days, it would require a very large operation and disruptive of a lot

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.186
of the elements of the spine itself.

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:40.056
The muscles are pulled widely apart, there's a significant blood loss,

00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:44.296
and the recovery period can be six months to a year.

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:49.776
Over the last decade or so, new techniques have been developed, and we're fortunate

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:55.146
in that we have a number of surgeons at El Camino Hospital who specialize in spine surgery;

00:01:55.146 --> 00:01:59.486
specifically, lumbar spine surgery, and now we're able to do these surgeries

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:02.736
in a manner we call minimally invasive.

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:09.136
And that's where small incisions are used, minimal blood loss, minimal tissue disruption,

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:12.826
and for many of these patients, they go home the same day or within a day

00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:20.066
or so after surgery compared to what used to be five, seven, to even ten days to two weeks

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:26.496
in the hospital prior to this time.

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:30.576
Well, the period of time for the fusion to heal hasn't changed.

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:34.386
Typically, we use the number around 12 weeks

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:38.946
when the patient's bones have really healed and the fusion is solid.

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:42.966
But for many of these people, they begin a physical therapy regimen

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:47.426
and start becoming quite active within three to four weeks after the surgery,

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:51.836
and essentially all of them are up walking the night of the surgery.

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:58.976
For the right indications, the vast majority of patients, 85 to 90 percent,

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:04.756
have what we say is an excellent to good result, and that means they're able to return back

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:11.076
to an active lifestyle, they're taking minimal medication or completely off of medication,

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:14.706
and they've returned to a full life.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:20.446
Well, certainly having appropriate training is important.

00:03:20.446 --> 00:03:22.986
Experience is important.

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:27.586
And I would say that they should feel comfortable with their surgeon,

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:32.226
and because this is a major operative procedure, they should obtain more

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:38.616
than one opinion regarding having such a surgery as this.

00:03:38.616 --> 00:03:43.586
And the patient should also feel that the physician is interested

00:03:43.586 --> 00:03:47.626
in giving them all the information and will spend adequate time with them

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.316
so that they feel comfortable with their decision

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:54.086
and that they should not feel rushed to make a decision.

00:03:57.346 --> 00:04:01.766
One of the nurses at El Camino Hospital, she had sustained an injury at work,

00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:04.936
and as a result, had an unstable spine.

00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:08.756
And while she was treated for about a year with conservative measures,

00:04:08.756 --> 00:04:11.966
it became obvious she was not going to get better.

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:17.716
And she ultimately underwent spinal fusion surgery and has now returned to work,

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:23.826
is essentially off all medication, and is back in the gym exercising every day, and so,

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:28.146
I would say that is more of a typical rather than an atypical story.
