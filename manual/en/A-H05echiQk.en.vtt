Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.430
[pause]

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.230
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.849
Fillers, like collagen and Restylane and Juvaderm
are very common and very

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.730
popular for correcting lines and wrinkles,
some scars, creases and lots of

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.999
other contour problems. But to determine whether
filler treatments are

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.410
right for you, like any other procedure, you
need to know what are the

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.929
advantages and what are the disadvantages
and what are the pro’s and con’s.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.239
So let me tell you. There are many advantages
to fillers. First of all,

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.260
they’re fast. Treatments can take five minutes
to fifteen minutes, and

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.839
maximum a half an hour you’re in and out
of the office. Second, they’re

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.390
relatively inexpensive for cosmetic procedures
compared to any type of

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.239
cosmetic surgery. Third, there’s no general
anesthesia, so you don’t have

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.730
to be concerned about side effects from general
anesthesia. Fourth, because

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.659
many of the fillers are not permanent, if
you’re unhappy with the result,

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.720
you have you don’t have to live with it
for the rest of your life, it will

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.390
wear off over a period of a couple of months.
Next, there’s just not much

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.830
pain involved with the injection of fillers,
particularly with the new line

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.330
of topical anesthetics that we have that diminish
discomfort and also some

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.501
of the new fillers actually have anesthesia
right inside the filler

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:28.049
material so that makes it less uncomfortable.
And last, there’s very little

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.320
downtime from filler treatments and usually
you can go right back to work.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.009
You may want to put a little make up on, but
usually you can go right back

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.539
to whatever you were doing in life. In terms
of disadvantages, well, a lot

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.080
of advances in decreasing the discomfort but
there is still some pain

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.780
involved in filler treatments and that’s
very personal as to how you judge

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.969
the severity of that pain. Because most of
these are not permanent you do

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.920
have to have repeat treatments somewhere between
three and nine or twelve

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.070
months later. So, it’s an ongoing treatment
which of course involves

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.900
ongoing cost. In rare occasions there can
be allergic reactions which

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.751
result in red bumps at the location of the
filler that go away after a

00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:16.330
couple of months and that’s annoying. And
you can get bruising as a result

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.390
of the injections and that’s not a function
of the technique of your

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.750
doctor, it’s because the filler injections
go deep and you just can’t tell

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.890
if there are any blood vessels there. But
last and most important there are

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.860
just certain limitations to what fillers can
do because fillers restore

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.980
lost volume but they don’t restore lost
elasticity so as your skin

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.890
continues to sag there’s a certain point
when fillers just don’t do enough

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.790
for you and if you want that corrected than
you do have to have cosmetic

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.510
surgery. So those are the pro’s and con’s
of fillers to help you decide…

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.981
are filler treatments right for you.
