00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:01.659
How to Get Your Kick Serve to Drop Like a
Boomerang!

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:02.659
Hi guys, I’m Clay Ballard with Top Speed
Tennis.

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.160
Today I have a great drill for you guys who
are struggling with your Kick Serve.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.339
Do you feel like you tend to push, even on
your kick serve?

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:13.009
You’re not really getting that snap, the
ball’s not really diving down into the court

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.230
the way you’d like it to?

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.850
I have a great tip for you guys to really
help you get that ball to dive.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.850
It’s pretty easy to do.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.380
We’re going to go over the proper motion
and then give you some drills to help ingrain

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.380
this.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.140
Let’s go ahead and get started!

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.000
When we’re getting the Kick Serve, the key
to a great Kick Serve is to really have that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.620
racket snapping upward, so you get a lot of
topspin on the ball as it’s making contact.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
To go ahead and demonstrate this, as we’re
getting this Kick Serve we want the racket

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.980
not only to be moving forward...

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.399
If I’m going this direction, I want my racket
to be moving forward, but I also want it to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.949
be kicking up and really grabbing these strings
to put a lot of spin on that ball.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.840
Most of us understand that, but it really
comes down to the technique and how we do

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.840
that.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.289
There are two pieces that are really going
to help you to do this, but first let’s

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.090
demonstrate the incorrect motion.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.910
A lot of times what I’ll see people doing
when they’re trying to get the Kick Serve

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.560
is they’ll get their racket loaded up.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.200
Instead of letting the racket drop down and
then kick up, what they’ll do is take the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.720
racket back and then immediately try to push
up on the ball.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.980
It just doesn’t have that snap.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.971
If you look at the tip of the racket in relationship
to the butt end of the racket, the racket

00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:25.170
comes here and then from there it immediately
goes up.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.710
They’re just pushing through that shot.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.240
What we need to have happen are two things.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.040
Number one, we want to go ahead and let the
tip of that racket drop down.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.970
That’s what they call the Racket Drop; you’ll
hear people refer to that many times.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.790
As we’re going up, the racket comes up and
then the racket tip drops down behind my back.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.360
Now you can see the butt end of the racket
is well above the tip of the racket.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.610
From there, that’s so crucial because now
we can kick up with some good force as we

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.020
come on through.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.030
That racket is really snapping as we’re
coming into that ball.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.310
It’s getting a lot of speed on that upward
motion, and the strings are really going to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.860
grab the ball and get a lot of spin.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.410
The second thing I see that people really
struggle with on the Kick Serve, that goes

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.890
hand-in-hand with this, is getting their arm
far enough behind their head.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.930
As you’re doing the Kick Serve, you want
this hand to be moving behind your head so

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.350
that you have plenty of room to let this racket
drop.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.130
If I get the racket over top of my head, if
I let it drop it’s going to hit my right

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.230
on the top of the head.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.100
Obviously, I don’t think you’d do that
more than once!

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.621
If you go ahead and get this hand going behind
your body enough, let that racket tip drop

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:35.450
down, then you can kick up really, really
nice.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.610
What I want you to do to get used to this,
is first just go slow motion.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.680
We’re going to do this in three pieces.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.190
First off, we’re going to go ahead and get
into the trophy pose.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.180
As you’re doing this, when you’re getting
in the trophy pose you want to make sure that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.460
your hand is getting well behind your head.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.180
This would be in line with my head.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.330
Now this would be behind my head, where the
racket’s actually moving back this way a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.540
little bit more than you would with your first
serve.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.840
That’s the first piece.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.210
Go ahead and do this a few hundred times,
to really get comfortable with that racket

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.570
moving back behind your head in that direction.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.940
The second piece is going to be the drop.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.260
We’re going to go ahead and go Piece #1,
pause.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.020
Piece #2, I’m going to let that racket drop
so my hand is rotating until now the tip of

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.500
my racket is pointing down toward the ground.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.381
Piece #3, we’re going to go ahead and just
act like we did on the normal serve, like

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:29.760
we’re going to throw that racket up toward
the ball.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.280
I want you to imagine the tip of that racket
kicking up in this direction to help get that

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.360
spin.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.040
Piece #1...Piece #2...Piece #3, we’re really
getting that to snap as we come on through.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.780
Do these three pieces in slow motion.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.770
Once you get comfortable with that -- at least
a few hundred reps.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.720
Once you get comfortable with that, let’s
go ahead and do all three of them together.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.170
I’m really letting that racket kick up into
the ball.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.940
Once we’re comfortable with all three of
those and we’ve moved them into one fluid

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.530
motion, now let’s go ahead and practice
with the racket.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.910
We’re going to do this by making it a little
easier on ourselves at first.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.360
I’m going to grab this racket a little bit
up on the handle here.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.120
I’m almost to the end of the grip, so I
have more control over the head.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.560
I’m going to simply do a couple of these
drills and practice getting that ball to snap

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.920
down into the opposing side of the court.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.080
There we go, that ball is really dropping
down.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.910
Once I’m comfortable with that, slide all
the way out to the end of the racket.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.690
You’ll have a little more speed, maybe not
quite as much control.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.389
Gradually build up that speed until you become
very, very comfortable with this.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.389
Hey, guys.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.110

Good luck to you guys, and good luck with
that serve!

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.940
...bow and arrow, like an Indian bow and arrow.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.410
I’m going to go ahead and hold this racket
out, going directly across the court.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.360
I’m going to pull this racket back just
like I’m shooting an arrow.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.420
I’m going to get this racket to load back
as far as I can go.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.100
The tip of the racket is going to pull back
as far as I can.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.570
My elbow is now going to pull away from my
body and I should feel a good stretch in my

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.890
right pec, and in my right shoulder.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.360
I should be fully loaded here.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.100
The only difference between this and the trophy
pose, is two things.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.980
Number one, I’m going to do this again and
instead of my racket facing forward, now my

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.990
racket is going to be facing up at about a
45° like this.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.990
Again, I’m going to pull this arrow back,
turn my racket up to a 45°, and now I’m

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.750
in the correct position.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.600
Number two, instead of shooting this arrow
directly across the court, now I’m going

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.680
to shoot the arrow toward the ball that I’ve
just tossed up in the air.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.240
Let’s again imagine that I’ve just tossed
the ball, and now I’m going to...
