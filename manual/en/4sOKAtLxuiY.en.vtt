00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.840
When you set out to hire the chef for your
restaurant, you're looking for one of the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.709
most significant people on your team, and
you're also embarking upon on of the most

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.650
important relationships that you will have
at the center of your restaurant.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.220
When looking for a chef, you need to read
what's going on.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.570
You need to read about chefs.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.230
You need to learn what different chefs are
doing.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.260
You need to eat different chefs' food, particularly
chefs who cook the style of food that you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.430
want in your restaurant.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.730
You almost need to collect a bunch of memories
of food and who cooked it.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.210
You need to understand what chefs care about
and what they're doing.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.421
When it comes time to actually start looking
for candidates for your chef position, you're

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.980
going to have to advertise.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.920
You're going to have to use word of mouth.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.280
Often times talking to vendors and others
in the restaurant industry lets you know who's

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.780
out there and who's looking.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.530
Sometimes you'll find someone who's a number
two in a restaurant who's ready to become

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.050
the executive chef and they'll be looking
for that next opportunity.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.860
Culinary schools can also be a great source
when you're looking for a chef.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.720
When you're selecting the chef, it's important
to remember that it's not just someone who

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.140
cooks great food.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.010
Obviously, that's where it all starts.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.340
They need to make food that you're going to
be proud to serve and food that matches beautifully

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.909
with your idea of what the restaurant is all
about.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.450
They also need to be a leader.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.869
They need to be someone that people want to
work for, someone that people want to follow

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.200
and learn from.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.229
If your chef is a great cook but they can't
get along with anybody, they're not going

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.230
to do a very good job for you and they're
not going to be able to run a successful kitchen.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.729
It's also very important that when you look
for a chef you remember that they also need

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.689
to be a business person.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.340
They need to be someone who understands that
you're in business to make a profit and that

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.870
their food and how they purchase and prepare
and handle food will have a vital impact on

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.170
the success of the restaurant as a business.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.209
They also need to be someone who is willing
to manage labor costs and understands the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.410
vital role that it can play in the profitability
of a restaurant.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.840
Bottom line, this chef better be somebody
you enjoy working with very much.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.560
There should be a synergy of creativity between
you and your chef that is very exciting and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.810
very enjoyable for both of you.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.730
You're going to spend a lot of time working
together and that energy between you will

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.819
translate into the food on the plate and the
guests' experience in your restaurant.
