00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
How many times have you heard someone
say, or how many times have you said, "God

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.280
just doesn't do that anymore." We say that
God doesn't heal people anymore because

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.780
we have modern science, or that God
doesn't fill people with His Spirit

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.490
because that was for the early church, or
that God doesn't speak to people anymore

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.680
because we have the Bible to read. We
have spent so much time thinking up

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
things that God won't do
and yet we wonder why we see no power at

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.370
work in the church, but the power is not
going to be there if God is not there

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.120
and why do we expect Him to show up if
we created beings are telling Him what

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.700
He can and cannot do do? Do you know why we
limit God? Because we want to limit the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.460
effect that He can have on our lives. We
want to give Him our hearts but we don't

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.949
want to lose our time, energy, money and
ultimately our lives for His name's sake.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.229
We want enough of God to make us
comfortable but not enough to make us

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.680
usable in His Kingdom. Salvation is the
first step but we have a generation of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.049
church-going saints who are wondering, "Is
this all there is?" And feeling like they

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.020
were made for more -- because we have made
salvation the end goal when it was never

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.750
meant to be that.
It's like an escalator, in that as long

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.740
as you are saved or take the first step
you eventually reach heaven, but the more

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.050
steps you take the sooner you get to the
next level and, in this case, the sooner

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.130
you're able to bring heaven down to
earth and make an eternal impact on

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.120
those around you.
I'm talking about walking so close to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.200
God that when you touch someone it's
like God has touched them, and when you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.400
speak to someone it's as if God is
speaking to them, but we're never going

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.220
to reach that point if we don't let God
be God and we be the vessels. In John

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.729
14:12 Jesus says, "Truly, truly I say to
you, he who believes in Me,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.300
the works that I do, he will do also; and
greater works than these he will do;

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.670
because I go to the Father." You want to
live a life that's filled with power? Ask

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.890
God to fill you with His Holy Spirit and
seek Him with your whole heart because

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.600
there's not going to be any power apart
from Him. You want to do what Jesus was

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.700
doing? You can only do that if He is
living inside of you

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.320
and working through you. And He sent His
Holy Spirit to fulfill that role in us

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.620
to fill us with power.
Stop telling God what He can and cannot

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.800
do and let Him do what He wants to in
you.
