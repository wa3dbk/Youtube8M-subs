00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.530
All potatoes have different tastes

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.322
It depends on 
what do you do with the potatoes

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:20.389
You can steam them,
boil them

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:23.133
roasted, fried

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:25.563
mash it

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:27.914
There's so many things
you can do with potatoes

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:30.530
I sometimes do ice cream potato too

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.731
I did that too, two years ago

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.171
I was doing ice cream potato

00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.082
But I think it's time to find 
a new way to cook potato

00:00:38.462 --> 00:00:39.965
My chefs in France

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:44.801
they taught me first 
to go hunting everyday

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.328
for ingredients

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:53.052
If I don't have the unusual ingredients,
the best quality ingredients

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.093
I have nothing

00:00:54.093 --> 00:00:55.285
Nothing

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:58.329
There's nothing I can do 
if I have a bad chicken or a bad potato

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.292
or a bad carrot

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:00.494
I'm not a magician

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.726
I'm not

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:06.886
Today I'm driving to see Alex Wesier

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.243
I worked with him for a long time

00:01:09.313 --> 00:01:12.141
and for me, 
he breeds the best potato

00:01:17.813 --> 00:01:19.080
Nice one here

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:22.636
There's a big one here

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:27.454
You need to pick the potato,
talk with the farmer

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:31.640
and ask him 
what this potato is good for

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:37.555
I get a lot of inspiration
from where I get the ingredients

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:43.167
I want the ingredients I plate
to look exactly where it came from

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.857
And I'm lucky, I trained
with all the best chefs in France

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:50.014
I was working at least 14 hours a day

00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:51.729
And no complain

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:52.815
no crying

00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:53.962
You cry at home

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:55.292
You don't cry in the restaurant

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:56.907
That's what I say when I cook now

00:01:56.907 --> 00:01:58.896
I say, "Don't cry, you cry later"

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:00.977
You cry in your house, in your bed

00:02:00.977 --> 00:02:02.379
not in the kitchen

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:04.074
Trust me, I've done that

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.736
Are we on time?
Are we behind or what?

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:07.785
What do you know?


00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:08.773
Are we good guys?

00:02:08.773 --> 00:02:09.959
How is mise-en-place good?

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.773
Feel good?

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:11.794
Do you feel good guys?

00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:12.573
Good

00:02:12.573 --> 00:02:16.223
What I want to do is really 
to seared the potatoes the way it is

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:18.679
with not too many manipulation

00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:21.294
It's all about of course,
the ingredients

00:02:21.294 --> 00:02:22.861
technique and execution

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:25.881
The potato needs to be cooked perfectly

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.438
hot with the right temperature

00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:30.259
and cooked in a minute

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.062
You cannot cook potatoes the day before
and just warm up in water

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:39.783
For a simple dish like this,
it needs to be done to order

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.272
That's what makes the big difference

00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:45.989
Of course it will be 
about texture definitely

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.688
I'm gonna go with the taste

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:50.056
What tastes better for my dish
was making more sense

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:51.462
But the interesting thing is

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:55.259
we have three different colors of potatoes

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.633
It's really amazing

00:02:58.283 --> 00:03:02.150
Riced potato, the fingerling potato
the purple potato

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:07.838
This color make me think more
about where we went to get the potato

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:11.447
almost looks like a mountain
where we went this morning

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:13.656
You can see [inaudible] 
when you touch it

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:16.773
[inaudible] really stuck together

00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:19.015
that's because of creaminess

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.287
A little more dry to the touch

00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:30.710
- [inaudible]
- It's really good too

00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:32.996
-This one's good too
- How about this one?

00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:35.027
Well, I don't like that one

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:36.052
It's too starchy

00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:38.054
It's very starchy

00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:40.296
I think this one will be great
to do some chips

00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:41.683
So guess what?

00:03:41.683 --> 00:03:43.767
We're gonna go 
with the French fingerling side

00:03:45.213 --> 00:03:46.173
Of course!
