Hey, I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I'm taking a closer look at these pre-painted

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:35.630
MMD Quarter Window Louvers fitting all 99-04
Mustangs.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:55.640
MMD is a company that specializes in unique
aftermarket styling parts for your Mustang.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.149
Whether it's retro or modern, chances are
MMD has something from your ride.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:13.830
These louvers draw their inspiration from
the classic window louvers found on the late

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.920
60s Shelby GT 500s, most notably that famous
Hollywood GT 500 named Eleanor.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:31.000
Taking a closer look at the louvers themselves,
you'll find a durable ABS construction along

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.050
with that 
pre-painted finish that I mentioned earlier.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:56.970
Now since these 
parts are painted right here in house, they

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.930
are always in stock, ready to be shipped the
same day as your order.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:15.960
Included in the package you'll find everything
needed for the install, including the pre-painted

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.820
louvers themselves, the honeycomb inserts,
the 3M adhesion promoter, the alchohol prep

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.260
pads, the 3M automotive tape, and finally
the detailed instructions.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:55.400
Before getting started with the install, you'll
want to first clean the area on your ride

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:07.540
where the scoop will go using the supplied
alchohol wipes.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:20.090
After that grab the actual scoop and that
3M adhesion promoter, and go ahead and wipe

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:34.370
it along all the edges where the 3M tape is
gonna go.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.860
This will ensure a nice secure bond between
the 3M tape and the actual scoop itself.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.860
After you get done installing the 3M tape,
go ahead and adhere the scoop to the side

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.410
of your car, and that's it.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.690
This entire process should take you no more
than 30 minutes.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.410
So if you're looking to introduce a little
bit of that classic Shelby GT 500 styling

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.730
on your new Edge Mustang, then be sure to
check out these pre-painted MMD Quarter Window

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.019
