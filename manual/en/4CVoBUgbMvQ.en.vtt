GTA 5 Online Merry Weather Jeep Spawn Location Modified Mesa Spawn Location "GTA 5 Rare Car"

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.750
near I miss gavin year

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.290
on every issue you this spawn location
for the merrier where the trip

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.940
although Mesa on them up in free roam
you don't have to spend seven thousand

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.539
all said and people have to marry
weatherzone that stuff

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.970
initially way to go and get it where
this bonus and then I'm gonna show you

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.670
how to put a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.960
in your carriage disease in a little
tiny methods the way you want to do is

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.070
come to use a map location where I am

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
just next to the army base between the
hours of 8 o'clock in Midnight

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.739
at night obviously so basically you can
see that I'm close by

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.469
just gone eight o'clock and I'm gonna
drive around to the location of school

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.239
officially

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.390
Jesse don't have to wait to see me drive
around but once you get a you'll notice

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.360
that their is

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.090
a little red circle which means there is
a mission here I know you want to do is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.930
kill the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.239
fifteen or sixteen people I'm not
exactly sure how many it is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.770
killer fifteen or sixteen people and you
will know is that the sometimes 10

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.489
sometimes

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.289
to you modified meriwether jeeps all
Masses whatever you prefer to call them

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.560
at this time there's only one but either
way you and a friend of this to you both

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.479
get one so you gotta do you start here

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.250
kill the people start a gang attack
until they are dead

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.500
and then once last one's dead helped a
lot I actually think I kept on the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.299
screen CeeLo how many people easily

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.979
kill but I'm pretty sure is only 15 of
16

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.830
it's not like a huge amount it's not
really hard

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.360
there he is so it's kill 15 so I was
close 15

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.450
so once you kill them all you want to do
is head over to you

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.780
the moderate car the Rexall on just
getting and drive it to y'all home

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.520
location

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.300
now you will notice when you first try
this warm that'll say

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.910
this vehicle cannot go any carriage but
I'm not sure your way around I

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.690
unique on the seconds so this was
recorded on export Swan

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.740
I have to leave it actually works on 360
as well

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.630
so it's quite a good little died for you
to get the cars are you want

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.910
Israel all this car school so already
you can see I'm now back at my carriage

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.800
and I'm just gonna jump in I love this
new first person view it's absolutely

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.590
fantastic

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.649
and you can see that air even the broken
windows stuff a lot shows on the screen

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.590
so there you go there's my character
with a drive in and I'll say that don't

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.140
you can't do it so you want to do

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.950
is just drive around the corner from
where I am now to the back where there's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.010
a parachute jump

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.300
I'm not sure it's just this parachute
jump because this is where

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.580
done all my previous videos or any
parachute jump up basically if you just

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.300
drive up here

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.230
it's not far away from everywhere so
it's not contiguous too long

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.570
so you can see there just around the
corner under the parachute jump

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.760
and then get out this will start the
mission

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.930
don't accept the mission or any of that
stuff just get out

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.959
let it go through the screens to that is
you gonna start

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.180
the vehicle and you'll disappear book if
overall right it should respond

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.820
seeing see that out backed out
straightaway and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.250
than to give it to the second in the
vehicle will spawn around here somewhere

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.060
are on the road

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.120
there it is if you get it now you will
be able to drive its training carriage

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.470
