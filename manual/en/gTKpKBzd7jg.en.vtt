00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:09.747
Made pretty good time.

00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:13.383
[wolf howls]

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.255
Russ: Dad, didn't they
invent christmas tree lots

00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:21.758
So people wouldn't have to drive
all the way out to nowhere

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.760
And waste a whole Saturday?

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.261
They invented them,
russ,

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:26.763
Because people
forgot how to have

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:28.532
A fun, old-fashioned
family christmas

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.699
And are satisfied

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.301
With scrawny, dead
overpriced trees

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:32.903
That have
no special meaning.

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:34.337
Audrey:
My toes are numb.

00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:35.806
You see, kids, this is
what our forefathers did.

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:37.908
Audrey:
I can't feel my leg.

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.208
They walked
into the woods,

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:40.544
They picked out
that special tree,

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.111
And they cut it down
with their bare hands.

00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:44.347
Audrey: Mom,
I can't feel my hips!

00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:45.682
Yes, honey?
Clark?

00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:48.151
Audrey's frozen
from the waist down.

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:50.487
It's all part of
the experience, honey.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.824
There it is.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.793
[choir singing]

00:01:12.543 --> 00:01:15.645
The griswold family
christmas tree.

00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:22.819
Isn't it
a little big?

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.055
It's not big.
It's just...Full.

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:28.892
Dad, that thing wouldn't
fit in our yard.

00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:31.194
It's not going
in our yard, russ.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:34.063
It's going
in our living room.

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:35.932
[teeth chattering]

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:38.668
Ah. Look at it.

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:41.671
It really is
beautiful, clark.

00:01:41.672 --> 00:01:42.806
Something else,
huh, russ?

00:01:42.807 --> 00:01:43.807
Yeah, dad.

00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:45.208
Isn't it a beaut, audrey?

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.743
She'll see it
later, honey.

00:01:46.744 --> 00:01:49.278
Her eyes are frozen.

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.948
The most enduring traditions
of the season are best enjoyed

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:54.217
In the warm embrace
of kith and kin.
