00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.460
Hello and hi there, hope you’re having an
awesome day today!

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.410
This is Marc here from BaldingSerum.com again
– it feels great to be back… to be here

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.380
to share some more tips on hair care with
you here…

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.200
OK lets get straight down to it…

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.110
Now, one of the most common questions I get
asked these days is “So Marc, what is the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.980
best shampoo out there that I can use right
now to treat my hair loss?”

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.349
This by the way, is a very good question…

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.489
Because it personally took me years upon years
of ridiculous experimentation and trial-and-error

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.489
to figure this out!!

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.100
And lucky for you, I’m going to spill the
beans, I’m going to spill everything out

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.789
to you right now!

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:50.440
I’ve found that the best and most effective
hair loss shampoos have the ingredient “ketoconazole”

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:00.920
in it – this ketoconazole is an agent that
blocks the synthesis of DHT (or dihydrotestosterone)

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:13.960
in the scalp that causes male &amp; female pattern
baldness.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.390
Studies suggest that ketoconazole shampoo,
when used either alone or in combination with

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.780
other treatments can be effective in reducing
hair loss, preventing or slowing androgenic

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.549
alopecia.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.750
Now if “ketoconazole” sounds familiar
to you – it might be because you have seen

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.780
or heard f it somewhere before.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.770
Ketoconazole was in fact, first and originally
used as an anti-fungal medication to treat

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.350
fungal infections of the skin, such as athlete's
foot and ringworm, amongst others.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.380
Scientists have even found that ketoconazole,
when topically applied, was as or more effective

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.789
than the famous 2 percent-grade minoxidil
at combating androgenic alopecia.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.039
(If you’re not familiar with minoxidil and
it’s use in growing back your hair, feel

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.070
free to check out our previous videos as I
dig deep into the details of what it’s all

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.410
about).

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.130
To date, there are only a few mainstreams
shampoos that contain ketoconazole.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.660
The most famous and well-known one is of course,
Nizoral shampoo.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:42.110
Nizoral is usually marketed as an antifungal
shampoo for people with dandruff.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.660
Now apart from being an antifungal shampoo,
Nizoral also comes with androgen blocking

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.770
properties.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.160
This makes it an effective anti-inflammatory
agent for hair loss sufferers.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.650
Understand that the root cause of thinning
hair is a sensitivity to the hormone levels

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.460
in your body.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.110
Therefore Anti-androgens work to block or
inhibit hormone (androgen) activity in your

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.110
scalp.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.080
In this case, Nizoral is acting as the “anti-androgen”.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.180
And while Anti-androgens block the hormonal
activity in your scalp, Anti-inflammatories

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.500
play an incredibly important role in calming
the *environment* of your scalp.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.840
This is imperative for the two treatments
to work effectively (as in both anti-androgen

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840
and anti-inflamation).

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.850
Inflammation is an extremely common biproduct
of thinning hair, and can literally double

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.690
the speed at which you lose hair.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:05.040
And this “inflammation” can come in the
form of itching, tingling, intense irritation

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.570
and even pain in your scalp.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.250
Calming that inflammation is probably the
most important aspect of hair loss treatment.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:23.289
It is with this reason that the “ideal”
hair loss shampoo should also contain a variety

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.990
of anti-inflammatory ingredients.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:38.370
Why should it contain anti-inflammatory ingredients?

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.409
Because you want to prevent dry scalp, that’s
why!.

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:48.400
Ketoconazole, while moderately to extremely
effective at preventing androgen-related hair

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.150
loss, is often quite harsh on the scalp.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.199
Nizoral is effective, but unfortunately, it
does not contain anti-inflammatory ingredients

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:06.360
and even the label suggests that it is not
ideal for daily use.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.860
If you read the instructions carefully, you
will realize that Nizoral should only be used

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.479
once every 3 days, and NOT everyday.

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.530
And there’s a reason for that, like I’ve
just told you a while ago.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.919
Most guys who use Nizoral (and especially
the 2% strength Nizoral) report having dry

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.460
scalp or non-dandruff flakes.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.150
Now I’m not sure whether you’ve actually
had dry scalp or non-dandruff flakes before,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.169
but I can tell you right now that it is NASTY
baby.

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.419
You don’t want to have dry scalp and the
flakes.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.509
Because you’ll just gross people out when
they see them. Seriously.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:55.680
People will just think you’re dirty, that
you don’t shower and you’re just downright

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680
filthy.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.050
It also because of side effects like these
that turn me off from using any form of ‘chemical”

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.509
to treat hair loss.

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:14.569
So yeah sure, Nizoral works, finasteride,
propecia, monixidil, all these have been proven

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.979
to treat hair loss, but even if they do work,
so what?

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.509
Are all the side effects that comes together
with it worth it?

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.689
Hell no! What’s the point!

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:34.110
But of course, these are all subjective, if
you’re totally ok with them, then by all

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.680
means do give them a go!

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.060
But if you’re looking for an alternative
treatment that is just as effective and one

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.599
that is 100% all-natural, pure herbal based
and chemical-free with ZERO side effects,

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:54.810
