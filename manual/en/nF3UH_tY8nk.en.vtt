00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040
cars.com auto review hi I'm Joe wiesenfelder with cars.com we are taking a look at the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.130
2011 infiniti m37 that's their mid-sized
rear-wheel drive luxury sedan has been

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.789
redesigned for this year a lot of things
have changed including the exterior

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.600
styling which is kind of Japanese
looking very infinity it's not

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.900
everyone's taste some people love it
will concentrate here on what has

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
changed for 2011 some of the highlights
and lowlights definitely a highlight the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.250
interior quality has improved a great
deal

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
the materials are nice the leather is
high-quality some of the things like

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.480
this bow metal looks pretty convincing
some of these things there are options

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.750
including the leather-clad page hood
here a suede-like headliner material and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.030
also this silver powder Dashwood
replacing a regular wood trim some

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.190
people like this couple of writers do

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.020
I'm not too crazy about it now I like
the seats real comfortable in the sport

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.140
edition of this car they're actually
more bolster these are nice and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159
comfortable if you're not into the sport
thing i do find the controls really hard

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.490
to reach with the door closed of this
car happens to have the optional

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.030
navigation system which is an 8-inch
screen interesting you can't really

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.540
reach the screen while you're driving
that's why the knobs here but if you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.939
want to enter a city named for example
for the navigation system you can use

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.369
the touchscreen I think that's really
good to have

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.909
and while you're driving you're better
off using the controller knob instead of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.329
trying to reach the screen i prefer that
were closer instead of here may be here

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.520
but there's something else here this is
the infinity drive mode select knob and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.420
what it does is let you choose from four
different modes for the way the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.439
drivetrain responds there's snow which
i'm not talking about because it's too

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.149
nice out now I think about it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.070
eco which is the economy mode regular
and sport and what it does is it changes

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.820
the responsiveness of the pedal how
quickly the transmission shifts and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.729
downshifts and also comes with an
optional feature called little pedal

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.259
which actually varies the resistance of
the accelerator so while you're stepping

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.190
down it pushes back to remind you not to
accelerate too quick

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.150
I got to be honest this stuff gets to be
so intrusive the cars a bit of a nag

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.069
I would end up turning it off but then
why are you paying for the office

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.640
you have to go ahead and turn it off
another quick pro and con about the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.749
incident

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.439
the backseat is nice and roomy now
ostensibly it holds three people back

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.540
here i have to say though the center
with this giant floor hump here what

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.950
would not be particularly comfortable
and then the downer here is the trunk

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.469
and 14.7 cubic feet is actually kind of
small for a car this big now again check

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:44.620
out the full review at cars.com for more
details in general the 2011 m37 is a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.060
good choice especially with 333
horsepower v6 it's more powerful than

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.859
the outgoing v8 version more than enough
power promote ends up being a good and

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.669
somewhat cheaper alternative to the
e-class mercedes and the BMW 5-series
