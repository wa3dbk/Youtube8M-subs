00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.500
in this video cringe discuss similar
triangles

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.480
nursing a similar triangles

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.929
history she other sides are congruent

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.240
what that means

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.579
is if we have to similar triangles you
don't have to be the same size

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.880
so for instance in these two triangles

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.590
side day

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.849
does not equal sidi

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.070
they are not the same size

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.070
but i think the ratio of two sides their
smaller triangle say a to b

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.820
that will be equal to the ratio of the
corresponding sides

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.840
the bigger trying

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.320
let's talk about what we mean by
corresponding sides

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.970
notice workdays

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.190
decide a corresponds to the sidi in the
bigger triangle

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.490
sometimes you'll see this medication

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.360
corresponds to the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.760
so that means and side b corresponds to
be

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580
so there would be

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.320
is going to be equal

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.939
to do you agree

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.270
that's a nice property of similar
triangles

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.470
there's another way we could set up our
proportion

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.740
died it small triangle people's big
trouble

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.380
but it turns out we could actually do

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.520
let's say we wanted to do

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.610
sightseeing which corresponds to side
effects

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.840
then i can look at the ratio

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.560
lucy over a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.130
that'll be cool to ratio of other
corresponding sites

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.829
immediately recognize

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:45.809
favor de

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:48.020
or be overtly

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020
schools too

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.130
delivery

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.890
here's what's important when you're
setting these up

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.650
notice that day over being

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.990
as part of the same triangle

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.910
they're both part of a little triangle
on the same side being here part of the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.629
big triangle members inside

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.339
saying look this way noticed that cnv

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:16.719
are part of the little triangle

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.329
indefinite leave are part of the big
triangle

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.900
so they have to be

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.520
matched up horizontally

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.860
see their financial vertically or
horizontally as part of the same

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.279
triangle

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.489
i would not have wanted to do this

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.149
when i wanted to say

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.039
tse overpass

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.870
peoples

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.509
eat overby

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.079
these are not part of the same triangle

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.359
that is not a tree statement

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.290
selection is set up a similar triangles

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.889
now how this works looks duties from the
sizes

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.930
let's say that any equals too

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.319
it be deposed really

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.119
and

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:02.129
d

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.169
equals six thing they want to know

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.959
but is equal to

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.139
this is how it set up a this problem

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.809
well electric duration of my sides ever
be

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.899
six

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.739
equals

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.169
let's set up a over big splash setup d
overeat

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.559
is equal to

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.079
six over

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.799
densities in question mark of what we
used a very

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.949
say acts

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.669
we now have a proportionately consult

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.949
to solve this proportion i'd like to do
cross multiplying which is multiply the

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.529
denominator

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.399
by the other side

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:47.700
that leaves me with

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.979
to pax equals

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.009
six times three

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.009
which is eighteen

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.119
seconded by both sides likes you

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.539
and i get that that's what missing side
eat

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.909
is not

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.909
now let's just take a look at the center
of the other way make sure we get the

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.859
same thing

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.949
so i know that side is to inside its
corresponding side is these six

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:20.060
i could set that up here but what do you
don't have the suspects

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.400
over to soces delivery

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.810
taken note of that delivered eat

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.070
equals

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.290
you know usually looking for

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.180
imperial so no

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.689
he india corresponding sides

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.679
notice

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:39.780
script blue glare here this week

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.720
notices

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.090
that d near part of the same triangle
they have to go any of the same

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.270
horizontal in vertical

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.169
i did vertical so the my question mark
which were using tax for

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.839
has to go on top

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:57.880
now the site he corresponds to the side
b

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.339
which is three

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.119
we don't think he's crosswalks playing
every time we feel a bit of a way of

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:07.520
solving this

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.150
because i a six over to you

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.870
i can't read that the six divided by two
united three

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.949
equals exit over three

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.460
now i need to get rid of this tree in
order to solve so what we're doing that

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.490
this multiplying both sides by three

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.219
those canceled

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.660
and yet once again i get xy cause i know
that side he is nine

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.590
and we look at a couple differ when
setting a proportion

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.849
and a couple different ways of solving
our portion
