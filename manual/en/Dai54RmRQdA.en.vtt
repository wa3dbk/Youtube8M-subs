00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.960
Songhaï is not an agricultural project or an industrial
project or a marketing project.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.120
It is a project where all these aspects are integrated.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.600
It is a rural growth project that is going to help…

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.160
There are big cities like Cotonou or Abidjan but in these cities,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.480
there is a mono-activity based economy that is dangerous.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.280
What we need is a diversified economic activity built
on both big cities and Green Rural cities.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.080
In Green Rural cities there is farming and industry,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560
but not that many services because there are
less people living there.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.440
But thanks to these economic activities, people can choose
either to live in the cities

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.520
or in the healthier green towns.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.120
Parents and children have a good living there and eat well.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.840
How is the farming market nowadays?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:09.040
Our agriculture produces enough diversified foods,
foods that help live longer…

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.080
We live very well! That means we don’t eat poison,
we have proper meals.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.360
So it’s farming that is going to meet the needs
of today’s stressed population.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:33.080
We'll be able to find diverse quality foods that help prevent
diseases and that are easy to work with.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.280
Our current conventional farming cannot address this market;
there is a lot of diseases, etc.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.680
With the Songhai agriculture we can meet the real needs
of today’s population

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.880
by providing good quality traditional food in proper quantities. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.200
That means that comes from short circuits.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:10.360
Instead of having the food travel for a thousand miles,
as is does from Tel Aviv to New York.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.960
Here, Africans have the capacity to produce
local food that is healthy,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.480
fresh and that will make them live better.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.360
Because the poor Africans cannot wait for
agricultural production

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.720
from New York to fly in Cotonou and then be distributed.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.320
There are no roads.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.680
The only solution for a development that I call
broad and comprehensive.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.720
Yes, a local food producing sector.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.720
Exactly. That's what we are looking for today;
that’s the real development.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.920
One of the essential bases is empowerment:

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.560
to give self-confidence to people and show them
that they are able to achieve things. 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.960
This is exactly how you say it. As I always say we must build.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.560
Songhai is not a super man and the rest are his servants.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.720
I say: if I can do it, you can do it too and I’m challenging you to do it.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.840
I'm no smarter than you are. 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.400
If you are motivated and you work hard, you can make it.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.160
That is the culture of success.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.240
Energy is at the heart of it all.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.280
When you told me you were coming, I said that
I absolutely had to meet you 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.520
because electricity is at the heart of the Songhai project.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.080
It's the key.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.440
People say that for Africa to achieve
the Millennium Development Goals, 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.400
we need 6 % agricultural production growth to achieve
the 8 % economic growth needed.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.680
I say we must have energy.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.480
But what sort of energy?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.560
No polluting energy, no expensive energy;

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.640
we don’t want to have that type of energy for our villages.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.160
The only solution is modular decentralized energy.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:07.560
This is modern! Each African city can freely decide
how it wants to produce its energy.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:17.320
It will help each locality, each municipality
to be socio-economically viable.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.160
Today they are not because they don’t have proper means.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.960
But today we have everything available, within reasonable reach.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.680
We can produce what we need; we don’t have to import everything.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.240
Go to Cotonou it’s unbearable, go to Lagos it’s intolerable;
in Abidjan it’s the same.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.920
Why live such a life? It is crazy.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.000
Songhai is not a demonstration centre. 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.080
We created it as an industrial park and we call it
economy of communion:

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:56.160
we trained people here; they then generate resources,
invest and start a snowball effect.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:04.560
People come here, get a general training because all of the aspects
of a project must be profitable:

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.040
not only financially viable, but also ecologically
and socially profitable.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.200
It goes way beyond the idea of profitability.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.040
We are profitable where others are not.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.400
As you can see, our project is ecologically, socially
and economically profitable.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.160
That's true profitability.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.880
The UN Secretary General visited our project
and was very excited about it.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.080
He wants Songhai to become a regional project, a UN project.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400
There are five UN agencies that are currently helping us: 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.680
UNDP, FAO, UNIDO, IFAD, ILO.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:57.760
They help Songhai grow to become big enough to increase
our capacities and help other communities.
