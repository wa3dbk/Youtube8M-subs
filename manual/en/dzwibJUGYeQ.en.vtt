00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.370
TODAY WE'RE GONNA DO A VIDEO ON THE OVERVIEW
OF THE SIMMONS BEAUTYREST HYBRID COLLECTION.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.060
THE HYBRID COLLECTION IS A COMBINATION OF
MEMORY FOAM AND SPRINGS.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.769
IT COMBINES HIGH-END MEMORY FOAM WITH AN INDIVIDUALLY
WRAPPED, SUPER-POCKETED COIL SYSTEM.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.500
THE RESULT IS IDEALLY THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.340
YOU'RE GONNA GET THE SUPPORT OF AN INNER SPRING
SYSTEM, WITH THE COMFORT AND BODY CONTOURING

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.030
EFFECTS OF MEMORY FOAM.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.460
LET'S GO OVER SOME OF THE KEY FEATURES AS
YOU MOVE UP IN THIS LINE.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.340
STARTING WITH THE COMPORT PADDING LAYERS,
EVERY SINGLE BEAUTYREST HYBRID MATTRESS IS

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.210
GONNA USE SOME FORM OF AIR COOL MEMORY FOAM.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.030
AIR COOL MEMORY FOAM IS AN OPEN-CELLED MEMORY
FOAM THAT RESPONDS VERY QUICKLY.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.960
SO WHEN YOU MOVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
WHERE YOU WERE SLEEPING RESPONDS QUICKLY,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.090
AVOIDING THE QUICKSAND FEELING THAT IS COMMONLY
ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER SLOW-REACTING MEMORY

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.090
FOAMS.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
AS YOU MOVE UP IN THE LINE, THE AMOUNT OF
AIR COOL MEMORY FOAM AND THE STYLE BECOMES

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.110
DIFFERENT.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.610
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, YOU'RE GONNA GET
MORE AIR COOL MEMORY FOAM GENERALLY SPEAKING,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.590
WITH A HIGHER END MODEL THAN YOU WILL LOWER
END.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.219
BUT THE TYPE IS GONNA CHANGE TOO.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.330
THEY START TO INCORPORATE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF MEMORY FOAM LIKE DYNAMIC RESPONSE AIR COOL

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.979
MEMORY FOAM, WHICH IS JUST A HIGHER GRADE
VERSION OF THE AIR COOL MEMORY FOAM THAT'S

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.240
USED IN THE ENTRY LEVEL VERSIONS.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240
AND YOU'RE ALSO GONNA GET THINGS LIKE MICRO
GEL TOUCH INFUSED INTO THE MEMORY FOAM, WHICH

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.660
BASICALLY USES GEL AS ANOTHER INGREDIENT TO
GIVE THE FOAM A MORE SUBSTANTIAL, I.E., SUPPORTIVE

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.010
FEEL, AS WELL AS TO HELP ENHANCE THE OVERALL
DURABILITY OF THE MATTRESS AND FURTHER AID

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.070
IN PRESSURE RELIEF, WHICH IS GONNA HELP REDUCE
TOSSING AND TURNING FROM PRESSURE POINTS.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.270
ABOUT THE CENTER OF THE LINE INTO THE TOP
OF THE LINE, THEY START TO INCLUDE A REALLY

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.260
IMPORTANT FEATURE IN MY OPINION, WHICH IS
THE LAYER OF MICROCOILS.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.100
MICROCOILS IS A ONE AND A HALF INCH COIL SYSTEM,
THAT IS ACTUALLY BUILT INTO THE COMFORT PADDING

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.840
LAYERS, WHICH ESSENTIALLY DOUBLES THE COIL
COUNT OF THE MATTRESS, AND IT ALLOWS THE MATTRESS

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.461
TO CONTOUR TO YOUR BODY BETTER THEN THE MODELS
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LINE BECAUSE, IT'S

00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:55.540
A COIL THAT IS VERY RESPONSIVE AND IT'S ALSO
SOFT, YET VERY SUPPORTIVE.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.799
IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT'S ALSO CUTS DOWN ON
MOTION TRANSFER, WHICH ALL THE MATTRESSES

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.970
IN THIS LINE ARE OUTSTANDING AT DELIVERING
MOTION TRANSFER REDUCTION.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.480
SO IF YOU'RE A LIGHT SLEEPER OR SLEEP NEXT
TO ONE, IF ONE PERSON MOVES, YOU'RE NOT GONNA

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.079
DISTURB THE OTHER PERSON'S SLEEP.

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.479
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SLEEP UNDISTURBED.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.080
THE TOP OF THE LINE MODEL USES ONE OF THE
MOST ADVANCED COMFORT MATERIALS THAT SIMMONS

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.419
HAS IN ITS ARSENAL, AND THAT IS KNOWN AS THE
MICRO DIAMOND INFUSED MEMORY FOAM.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.290
MICRO DIAMOND INFUSED MEMORY FOAM ACTUALLY
USES DIAMOND DUST AND INCORPORATES THAT INTO

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.650
THE MEMORY FOAM TO CREATE A COMFORT MATERIAL
THAT'S NOT ONLY VERY SUPPORTIVE FEELING, IT'S

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.299
ALSO GREAT AT REDUCING PRESSURE, BUT IT ALSO
USES DIAMOND DUST AS A CONDUCTOR TO HELP PULL

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.209
HEAT AWAY FROM YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU SLEEP
TEMPERATURE NEUTRAL.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.870
ALL THE MODELS IN THIS LINE DO HAVE A GREAT
EDGE SUPPORT.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.530
YOU CAN SLEEP ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE WITHOUT
NOTICING A BIG FLUCTUATION IN COMFORT OR SUPPORT,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.319
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR COUPLES WHEN THEY
SHARE A QUEEN SIZE OR EXTRA SLEEPING SPACE

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.319
MAYBE DESIRED.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.760
OVERALL, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MATTRESS
LINE THAT COMBINES THE SUPPORT OF AN INNER

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.290
SPRING SYSTEM WITH A COMFORT OF A HIGH QUALITY
MEMORY FOAM, THEN THE BEAUTY REST HYBRID COLLECTION

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.980
IS AN OUTSTANDING CHOICE.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.829
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR COMFORT PREFERENCE, WHETHER
IT BE VERY FIRM OR VERY SOFT, I THINK YOU'LL

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.409
FIND SOMETHING IN THIS LINE THAT WILL WORK
VERY WELL FOR YOU.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.379
I HOPE THIS HELPS ANSWERS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS,
BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHERS, PLEASE DON'T HESITATE,
