00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:06.250
good day

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.219
Now almost everyone has
home grinder and here

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.740
arises
problem it

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.719
ceases

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.159
good grind meat

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.429
but the problem is
that

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.179
knives tupyatsya

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.579
here is on general
not really

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.239
a knife, normally
pay attention

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.109
Here is such a kind of

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.599
and their two knives

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.130
this is also a knife

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.230
and it turns out
that the edges

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.080
should be no sharp
Only on this knife
15
00:00:40,080 --&gt; 00:00:43,840
but here's here on these
round holes

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.560
and to hone their
here in general is

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680
great complexity not present

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.440
Well I'm like,
adapted to sharpen

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.270
using this here
great circle

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.160
Now he went a little

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.730
here's my boarding
diameter of 32 millimeters

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.690
so I found

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.489
such a large drive

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.060
flat

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.420
which is just
can be sharpened

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
things like here
it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.660
решетку и нож

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.500
Well, the technology is very simple

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.210
see here

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.159
note that
where the knives go

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.170
there slightly
bright in here

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.260
is generally dark
has covered

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.200
already oxides

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.380
sharpen it very
just

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.570
finger here look like this in the middle part

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.720
and apply the
short-term

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.820
such

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460
starts

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.590
not until the end of

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.920
spinning this disc

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.920
begin to sharpen turning it

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.729
strongly do not need to press

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:16.399
control as
it, so that's already

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.209
Look, see?

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.839
as if it
trimmed

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.439
starts to shine on
the entire surface

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.029
should be fully
shiny, then you can

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:27.979
assume that

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:34.979
sharpened

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:17.799
some more

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.029
Well, in general it is ready

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.829
also sharpen knives
similarly

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.879
presses the slightly

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.129
strongly do not, in general
is not pressed

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:48.129
practically

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.299
so, but that

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.319
knives, of course, faster
because a small area

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.079
Well, it turns out we

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.689
is such a thing

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.869
blades are very smooth
walk

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.859
without hooks

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.079
that's all, so
way to sharpen

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.489
knives

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.669
and can serve as a grinder

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.490
still a very long time

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.110
of course
manufacturers probably

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.409
dissatisfied

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.499
that you will sharpen knives and
buying a new one

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.979
buying a new grinder

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:35.969
bye
