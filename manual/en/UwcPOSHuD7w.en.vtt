Hey There!

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.440
What's up?

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.440
How's it going?

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.670
I have a quick English tip for you that will
help you to make your telephone conversations,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.669
or Skype conversations, whatever you use to
call people up these days.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:21.290
It will make them even better -- one big mistake
to avoid -- so, if you want to know, keep

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.290
watching.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:29.520
Now, I had an experience where I was talking
on Skype with a friend of mine -- actually,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.039
now she's a friend but I guess you could say
when I called her, it was the first time that

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:41.249
we spoke so I didn't really know her at all,
and when we were talking on Skype, I experienced

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:48.460
this weird feeling because every time that
I said something she was kind of silent.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.839
Actually, she was silent.

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:57.819
She didn't say anything so I had to again
say something more, or ask a question to see

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:05.980
if she would respond but her silence made
me realize that in American English telephone

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.960
conversations, we're always making some noise
or small comments to show that we're listening,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.310
that we're interested, and that we're really
engaged in the conversation.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.790
So, without even using any new words, it's
important to use these phrases like "uh huh",

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.700
"yes", "I see", "Okay".

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.100
These kind of phrases make a huge difference
and they'll make your partner, or the person

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.420
you're speaking with feel like you're really
interested and part of the conversation.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.890
Now, I am not sure about this silence in other
cultures or other languages, but I think in

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.820
American English we don't like silence.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:59.400
So, try to be aware and observe how your conversation
partners are feeling that silence or if they're

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.760
not feeling that silence.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.380
It's all about observing and learning from
your surroundings and that's the natural way.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.670
