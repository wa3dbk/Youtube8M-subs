00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.000
Counter conditioning involves changing the
underlying emotions a dog has about a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.629
specific object, animal, person or environment.

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.500
Changing the emotions changes the behavior.
The reverse is also true.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.330
Emotions occur on a continuum. In this
example,  we will use fear and excitement to

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.919
show how counter conditioning works because
these are the two most common causes

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.550
of perceived mis-behavior in dogs.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.039
Fear is at one end of the continuum.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.340
Fear varies from  extreme to moderate to mild.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.980
Excitement is at the other end.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.580
Excitement also varies from slight, to moderate to extreme.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.580
During counter conditioning a dog passes
through a neutral point.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.400
When counter conditioning is done, a dog changes her emotions about a trigger from a negative one

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.100
like fear, to a positive one like 
excitement.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.000
An example would be when a dog is fearful of a  child but learns through counter conditioning

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.540
that children can be fun to play
with.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.790
A dog can also start at a point of
neutral feelings and move to one of

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.270
pleasure or excitement.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.490
An example of this is when a dog is
neutral about water but learns though positive

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.340
experiences that playing in water can be
pleasurable.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.950
With counter conditioning, a dog can start
at a level of  fear and move through the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.750
continuum to any level of excitement.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.739
With systematic desensitization, the change in emotions may be in either direction

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:39.720
but the goal is for the dog
to become emotionally neutral in the presence of the trigger.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.250
He behavior reflects that.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.250
An example is when fa dog is fearful of
visitors and learns that they are no threat

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.030
once they come into the house.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.560
At the other end of the continuum is the
dog that jumps for joy on visitors

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.630
but learns to calmly greet them with
four feet on the floor.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.110
Desensitization is a type of counter conditioning.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.030
The opposite of counter conditioning, called
'aversive county conditioning',

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.549
can also occur.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.920
An example would be if the dog was given a
correction in the presence of another

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.349
dog then becomes fearful of other dogs.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.609
Or if a dog that is excited about going to the
groomers is handled roughly

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:27.579
becomes fearful of going to the groomer.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.139
Unlike counter conditioning and desensitization, 
which may take many positive exposures

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.470
to make a change,

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.060
aversive counter conditioning can occur
after only one exposure.  What unwanted emotions and behaviors can you counter condition?
