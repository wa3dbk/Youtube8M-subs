00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.820
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.759
Michael here with The Daily Note II/3 YouTube
channel.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.120
Welcome to part 1 of what's new in Android
4.4 for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.099
So I've been hard at work trying to find all
the new and cool things that came with the

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.099
update.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.310
So I'll start off these series of videos with
what I think is the coolest feature on Android

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.120
4.4 which is screen recording.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.099
So as a matter of fact this video you're watching
this very second is a direct screen recording

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.060
off my Galaxy Note 3.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:42.579
And as you can see, the quality is flawless.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.571
Screen recording was a feature that we first
heard about during the announcement of the

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:50.820
Galaxy Note 2, however, about a day into the
launch of the device in the initial countries,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.030
the feature was removed virtually out of existence.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.320
Eventually, 3rd party apps with the screen
recording feature became available for rooted

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.269
and unrooted devices.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.910
But the quality was ok at best.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.280
Definitely not up to HD standards.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.450
Well, that has changed for the Galaxy Note
3.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.479
With the Android 4.4 update, the screen recording
feature is built into the OS.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.840
To get screen recording working, you need
3 things.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.010
One, you need to have updated to Android 4.4.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.970
Second, you need to have the official USB
drivers for your Android device.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.229
It's true that you can connect your galaxy
note 3 to your computer with generic drivers

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.369
that came with your computer, but for something
like this, you need the official usb drivers.

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.680
You can get them at samsung's support site
by providing your model number.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.140
And last, you need a command line tool called
adb.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.960
You can officially get them by installing
the free android software developer kit from

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960
Google.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.860
I'll provide the links below.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.570
But it is a gigantic package for the little
file that you need, so it may be worthwhile

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.180
google searching for just the adb.exe file
and download it from unofficial sources.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.320
Next, 2 things you need to enable on your
Android is Developer options and usb debugging.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.860
If you haven't enabled it already, you can
enable developer options by going to settings

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.230
-&gt; general -&gt; about device and tap on the
build number 7 times.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.510
Then go into developer options and enable
usb debugging.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.450
If want to record and show where you are touching,
you can enable that here.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.470
And finally connect your device to your computer.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.000
After you got that set up, open up command
prompt.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.330
Find adb.exe.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.340
It will be where you installed the android
sdk and in the subfolder here.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.890
Then type this command you see on the screen:
As soon as you hit enter it silently starts

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.890
recording.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.050
So perform the actions you want to record.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.430
And here are the results.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.110
So there are 3 things you can change in the
command line.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.410
The bitrate, time limit, and filename.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.040
The bitrate, I'm not sure what the limit is,
but higher the better.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.850
The downside obviously is that the higher
the bitrate, the bigger the filesize.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.160
I've tried 24 megabits or 24000000 and it
looked beautiful.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.140
You can probably even go higher if necessary.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.660
But keep in mind, this slows down the bitrate
as well as you go up in bitrate.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.680
The time limit, you can specify up to 3 minutes
or 180 seconds.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.880
For longer recordings, at the moment, you
can only do it with paid apps that require

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.760
your phone to be rooted.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.730
But I wouldn't be surprised to see unrooted
apps doing this in the future as long as you

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.290
are tethered to your computer.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.050
Last, the filename.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.950
From my tests, whenever you do a recording,
always make sure you change the filename.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.180
If you start a recording and the filename
exists, it seems to erase the file that you

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.740
had before and the new recorded file never
appears.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.620
So if you did video1.mp4, just change it to
video2 and so on.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.650
Also, if you try to copy the file to your
computer too quickly after it appears, especially

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.200
if you're doing a high bitrate capture, the
file seems to get corrupt.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.280
So after a screen recording, make sure you
wait a few seconds before trying to copy the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.930
file over.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.930
One last thing.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.400
This feature does not record the audio.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.290
To record the audio, you can get one of these
4-pole 3.5mm minjacks and route the audio

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.079
channels to the appropriate channels.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.280
Samsung likes to switch these audio channels
from the standard configuration, so you will

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.650
need to try a combination of these to find
which channel is for the right and left speakers.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.170
Then simply feed it into mic jack into your
computer.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.550
So for some of you looking to do the highest
quality screen recordings which is 1080p at

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.290
near 60frames per second, this is the only
way to do it, and it's free.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.550
For me, I am excited about using this feature
to provide higher quality content for this

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.550
channel.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.200
So anyway, that's the end of the first video
of what's new on Android 4.4 for the Samsung

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.520
Galaxy Note 3.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.520
Many more to come.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.120
