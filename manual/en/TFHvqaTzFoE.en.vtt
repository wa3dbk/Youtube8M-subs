00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.867
The President:
Now, I just want to point out
that I got the memo and dressed

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:06.667
appropriately in the gray suit.

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:09.300
(laughter)

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.633
Welcome to the White House, and
congratulations to the Colorado

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.667
Rapids on winning
your first MLS Cup.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:22.967
(applause)

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:26.400
I want to begin by recognizing
Stan Kroenke and Coach Gary

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.300
Smith for building such
an extraordinary program.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.600
And some of you know, I
am a soccer dad myself.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.533
(laughter)

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.967
I have watched my share
of games over the years.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:40.567
And I'm used to seeing everybody
gather around the ball,

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.867
and then it kind of
pops out somewhere,

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:44.633
and everybody runs
over to the ball.

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:46.000
(laughter)

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.567
And so I want to congratulate
all the players behind me for

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:53.467
coming so far since those days,
because I'm sure your parents

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:58.166
were thinking the same thing
-- that these guys can't play.

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:04.700
(laughter)

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.934
They may not be household names,
but the great thing about sports

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.967
is that, in the end, that
doesn't really matter.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:16.834
What matters is how well a team
can pull together when the chips

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:20.533
are down, and that's exactly
what the Rapids did.

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:23.567
This team had the second-worst
record of any team in the

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:25.600
playoffs last year.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.066
But they showed
up in close games,

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.400
they clawed back from behind.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.600
They just kept on winning.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
And when the clock ran out,
the Rapids were the best team

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.500
in American soccer.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.266
So this is a testament to
players like Pablo, the captain,

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:47.233
who played 286 games over
13 years before finally

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:48.000
earning a title.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.367
Where are you, Pablo?

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:50.734
Right here. Congratulations.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:57.166
(applause)

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.333
Players like Omar
Cummings and Conor Casey,

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.100
who were the highest-scoring
forward combination in the league.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.800
Where are you guys? Omar?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.300
(applause)

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.934
And players like Mac Mandji who
fired the cross that led to the

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.767
championship-winning goal,
even as he tore his ACL in

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:17.567
the process.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.800
Mac, where are you? You doing okay?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.934
All right.

00:02:20.934 --> 00:02:24.900
(applause)

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.900
But what really sets this team
apart is not how they play only.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.233
It's also why they play.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:35.233
They have a love for the game
that has brought them together.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:38.400
This team, obviously,
has overcome quite a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.066
few cultural differences.

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:42.300
This is like a mini United
Nations right here.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.266
(laughter)

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:46.033
You've got players from
Argentina, England, France,

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:52.533
Ireland, Jamaica, Japan,
Scotland, and Senegal.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.500
In fact, I heard that the
night before the championship,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.133
Kosuke Komura --
where is Kosuke?

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:00.867
Right here.

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:04.867
I understand that he made a very
inspiring speech to the team,

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:06.967
but it was in Japanese,
so nobody really --

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:08.300
(laughter)

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.533
-- understood what
he was saying,

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:12.700
but it was really inspirational,
was what I heard.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.633
(laughter)

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.667
This is also a team that makes
due without the high salaries

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:23.567
and perks that some other
professional sports teams enjoy.

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:26.800
Players can sometimes actually
be seen eating at local

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.400
restaurants together
after practice.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.500
A few guys chipped in to buy
a fishing boat that they keep

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.367
hidden in the
stadium parking lot.

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:37.367
(laughter)

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.767
But while life in the
MLS isn't always fancy,

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:43.000
it serves to bring players
closer to each other and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.433
to their fans.

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:47.033
Wells Thompson likes to take
food from the stadium and give

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:49.567
it to the homeless on
nearby street corners.

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:51.233
Where is Wells? Right here.

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:57.333
(applause)

00:03:57.333 --> 00:04:00.433
If a fan wants a player to show
up at a charity event or help

00:04:00.433 --> 00:04:03.233
out with a nonprofit, all
they have to do is ask.

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:05.033
These guys show up.

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:09.600
More often than not, the Rapids
staff only finds out about these

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.633
visits after they happen.

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:12.800
So these aren't
just good players,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.266
they're also good people.

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:17.767
And I want to thank them for
teaming up with MLS today to

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:20.834
put on a soccer clinic here
at the White House for kids

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:22.433
from military families.

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:24.600
You will make their summer and
you will make their parents

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.700
happier when they actually know
what to do on the soccer field.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.700
(laughter)

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.266
So congratulations again to
the players, to the staff,

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:35.600
the fans back in Colorado,
everybody who is part of

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600
this program.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.266
Good luck again this season,
and we hope to see you back

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:40.066
here soon.

00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:40.867
So thank you very much.

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:41.800
Give them a big
round of applause.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:51.033
(applause)

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.400
Coach Smith:
So real quick, on
behalf of our owner,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.767
Stan Kroenke, everyone
associated with the Colorado

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:57.633
Rapids Soccer Club and
Major League Soccer,

00:04:57.633 --> 00:05:00.233
all of our players, fans,
it's our honor to make you

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.900
an honorary member, and present
you with your very own jersey --

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.433
The President:
That's good.

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:04.633
Coach Smith:
-- commemorating the
2011 Championship.

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:05.433
The President:
That's a good-looking jersey.

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:08.767
(applause)

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.800
Coach Smith:
As you know, the number
10 is the leader, so --

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.367
The President:
Absolutely. That is me and Messi.

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:15.867
We're right up there. Absolutely.

00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:16.500
(laughter)

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.100
Coach Smith:
So thank you very much.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.867
The President:
Thank you so much.

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:18.834
Thank you. This is terrific.

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:20.133
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:21.467
Thank you so much.

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:28.700
(applause)

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.800
(applause)
