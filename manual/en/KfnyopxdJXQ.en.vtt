00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:05.279
hello, I'm going to show you how to make a paper origami Crane and

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.079
What I'm gonna do different in this tutorial is I'm going to use highlighters to

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.059
Emphasize and illustrate  each crease so it's just gonna be a little bit easier

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.909
step-By-step for and maybe the first time or if you're new to do an origami so first you're gonna need either origami paper or

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.579
Printer paper that you can make into a square and which we want to do to do that is basically take

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.310
this corner and fold

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.349
It down

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.669
along that Edge and then take a pair of scissors and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.649
Cut the excess paper off just like that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.029
And then when you open it back up

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.859
You have a perfect square, and then this is going to be the first of your fold you're going to want to do

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.680
So I'll go ahead and illustrate this one

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.920
On the next slide this fold you're going to take the other corner and two

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.909
And fold it the other way

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.229
Just like that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.610
And then now you want to flip it over

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.830
And you're going to fold it now into in half the other way

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740
to basically two rectangles

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.029
And then you'll want to do it the other way as well

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580
So now on this side

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.509
now have a folds basically going the other way and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.580
Then once you get to this point. You're Gonna want to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.319
Tilt it like that and these two folds right here

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.110
It's going to kind of naturally want to come together, and you want to fold along those edges and bring these two points

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.910
Inward down to the bottom and then when you do that at the top

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.869
Hold those crease down just like that, so then now you have the square basically. They're kind of like four

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.419
little triangular flanges coming out, and then you want to always keep the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.390
flaps on the bottom

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640
And then now for the next step

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.649
once you get that creased real good if you want to take this corner right here this edge and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.220
Match along the center crease you have right here

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.600
basically just fold these in

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.059
And then once you do that flip it over and do the same thing on the other side

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.679
I'm going to go ahead and illustrate those for you and actually there's one more thing one. So you get those folded on both sides

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.120
And the step isn't necessary, but I like to do it as an extra

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.209
Step is when you take the top part right here

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.899
And give it just a little bit of a crease on top and that'll help help guide a fold later on

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.869
Then you want to go ahead and open up all four sides. I'm going to illustrate all these for you

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.289
You'll fold their fold and fold

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.260
down

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.739
Right there and the crease we did

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.700
Right on top and so now

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Go ahead and illustrate the unit side

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.330
fold

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400
Just like that, so you have folded like this

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.220
And when you did that also full of the inside which then what you want to do is take this bottom flap?

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.129
and push it up and

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.619
Crease it right there where this fold is and then on the two inside creases basically fold those in

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.070
Crease the bottom and then just kind of let this fall together

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.829
into a crease just like that and then flip it over and

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.919
Do the same thing and then you're gonna want to take this and Kinda. Just give it a little bit of crease the other way

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:25.399
And open it up now along these two folds right here. Oh

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.260
Fold those in and let this all just kind of fall together. Just like that crease it real good

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.020
And once you have that you'll see the split part down at the bottom. I'm gonna keep that there and

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.290
now what you're going to want to do is take the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.620
Corner Edges and this right here and fold it in to the center. Just like this

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.350
get on both sides

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.160
It looks just like that

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.149
Then fold it up. I'll flip it over and do the same two folds just

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.810
Like that so it looks like that

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.869
Well, then now you don't want to take

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.750
the two flaps

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.440
pinch them together

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.580
At the same time pinch the other two together, so you're basically just

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.760
inverting what you have and

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:48.619
You'll get what looks like this and then from there look I already see a little bit of a crease right here

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.380
Go on to fold up

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.170
these parts on both sides flip it over fold it up there at the bottom and

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.360
then now

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.420
Basically invert it again so pinch these two together and pinch the back two together just

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:17.299
Like that so then you'll get this and then down at the bottom fold these over to get your wings

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.180
Same thing on the other side

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:31.129
And now you can see you have the wings and the last second last step we want to take these and along this edge

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.518
right here, basically just kind of pull them out and

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.388
Then pinch it and refold it right along that edge

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:41.569
Same thing on this side

00:07:43.049 --> 00:07:50.419
then last step I'm gonna take the four the head basically push this down and

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.009
pinch it in

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:03.289
Just like that and there you have it you have a origami Crane
