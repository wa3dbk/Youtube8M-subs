00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:56.449
I\'92ve gone for 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.320
Richie Gray and Joe Launchbury. Richie Gray,
everyone knows about, not only in terms of

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.260
the big blonde locks but his general energy
and qualities that he brings. It may seem

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.800
a little bit uncontrolled at times but it\'92s
just the intensity of the collisions he has

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.440
and certainly a tall man within the line-out.
Joe Lauchbury, you know, very relatively inexperienced

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.174
but I\'92m sure by the end of the 6 Nations
he\'92ll have more caps that I will have had

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:29.040
before going on a Lions Tour and he\'92s very
much impressed me with maturity, energy again

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.170
around the pitch, great in terms of the kick-chase,
quite prepared to go up and win balls in the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.330
game and, again, a line-out option. You know,
there\'92s a couple of players that are going

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.870
to return from injury who\'92ll feature in
the 6 Nations and I\'92m sure a number of

00:01:44.870 --> 00:02:39.040
them will desperately be wanting to impress
on their return and when they get 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.040
the opportunity.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri720\sl360\slmult1

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:04.939
\b0 \cf0 The half-backs I\'92ve gone for are
Danny Care, a man who has very much re-shaped

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.810
his career over the last 12 months, has got
a huge appetite back and we know that he brings,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.639
you know, great energy to the game. Yeah,
he\'92s quite happy to tap and go if he believes

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:21.880
it\'92s the right option and there\'92s an
opportunity within their defensive line and,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:30.139
probably as we speak, probably almost the
Lions-elect would be Johnny Sexton. You know

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:36.189
a man who\'92s had a great success with Leinster,
Ireland, controls the game well, good kicking

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.900
game. Obviously Owen Farrell will want to
put pressure on him, had an outstanding game

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.630
against New Zealand, but Care and Sexton at
this stage should be my starting pair.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri720\sl360\slmult1

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.630
\b0 \cf0 I mean everyone\'92s gonna be pretty
keen to see Brian O\'92Driscoll come back

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.390
into rugby and there\'92ll be a huge emotional
desire to have a man of Brian\'92s outstanding

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.139
qualities into the test team, but at the moment
I\'92ve decided to go for Jamie Roberts and

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.769
Manu Tuilagi. I think Manu Tuilagi gives you
a great platform, someone who can go into

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:16.109
the very tight defensive walls and makes dents
into it or get over the game line, had some

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.240
outstanding contributions against New Zealand
in attack and defence, so you know very much

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.400
big collisions. Jamie Roberts did feature
in 2009 and featured very well so, you know,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.430
another man who can provide the platform,
can go over the game line. I think someone

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.520
like Jonathan Davies will put pressure on
them. I think he has got some attributes of

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.090
releasing the ball out of a tackle, but you
know certainly those four would be the four

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.930
I would be selecting from at this stage.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri720\sl360\slmult1

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.289
\b0 \cf0 I\'92ve been very impressed with
Simon Zebo, the Irish wing. Having seen him

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.280
perform recently in the Heineken Cup first
hand I thought outstanding in terms of his

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.479
kick-chase, aerial ability, whether he was
chasing onto a kick or receiving a ball onto

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.539
himself, has got a great try scoring record
at the moment and just seems to be popping

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:20.409
up in the right places. That would mean for
me, he would be one of the selections on the

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.120
wing. My other selection on the wing would
be George North. He\'92s played some good

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.840
rugby for Wales, again very strong in the
air, a big physical character, so therefore

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.780
is prepared to take people on but also is
able to use physicality to get through them,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.860
and then finally a full-back, I\'92d go for
Rob Kearney, had a great 2009, Lions Tour,

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.480
was very safe under the high ball, got a great
left foot, is going to be able to relieve

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:57.060
pressure or return, with considerable interest,
the ball back down into Australian territory,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.375
quite prepared to put the ball up and compete
in heavy contact himself. So, at the moment,

00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:02.375
that is my back 3. \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri720\sl360\slmult1

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:08.375
\b0 \cf0 Back row, you know it might seem
that this is my area of expertise and I think

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:09.375
it\'92s the fact that there are so many quality
players around that I actually found this

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:10.375
probably one of the more difficult areas and,
there were potentially players that, if we\'92d

00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:11.375
selected this team you know 6 months, 8 months,
10 months ago who\'92d be in it. Sam Warburton

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:12.375
obviously had a tremendous World Cup and if
he can find the form and fight of the challenge

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:13.375
of Tipuric for Wales, then certainly he\'92s
a man that you would like to see pushing for

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:14.375
a place but the back row that I\'92ve gone
for at the moment would be; Sean O\'92Brien

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:15.375
at 6, Chris Robshaw at 7 and Jamie Heaslip
at 8. So there\'92s plenty of physicality

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.375
in there, there\'92s plenty of work-rate,
but obviously some of the finer details of

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:17.375
the intricacies scrum, line-out, you know
will all be addressed within that combination.

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:18.375
Certainly, Faletau I\'92m sure is going to
want to put pressure on them with his athletic

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:19.375
and dynamic ability with ball in hand and
certainly I think it\'92s an area or positions

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:20.375
on the pitch where we could see some huge
competition throughout the 6 Nations.\
