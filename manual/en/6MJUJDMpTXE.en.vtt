00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
Hi all, my name is Christine Byer 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.100
and I am a licensed master esthetician 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.100
here in Austin, Texas.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.660
I wanted to talk about 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.940
a good candidate for microcurrent. 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.840
I started doing microcurrent in 2004, 2005 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.280
and bought my jade machine in 2005 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.280
and really got into it seriously 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.280
about seven years ago. 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.800
I've done a lot of faces since then 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.900
and I have decided that 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.980
who's a good candidate for microcurrent? 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.320
Everybody.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.020
If you think about what your body looks like 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.320
when you have been doing regular workouts, 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.020
if your body feels better, it looks better, 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.240
it's oxygenated, the muscles are pumped, 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.180
if you think about that, 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.500
that's exactly what's happening with the face 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.980
when you do a series of microcurrent sessions. 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.720
I look at people who've had Botox, 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.940
who's had injections, 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.420
I work on clients that have Botox and injections, 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420
[?] and all that stuff, 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.420
and it is not contraindicated. 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.000
I know how to work around the area, 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so that's not an issue, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.160
but I look at people who've had even facelifts 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.580
and I'm looking at them and I'm like, 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.100
"I can make their face look better."

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.980
Microcurrent makes everybody's face look better. 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, if you have a lot of extra skin 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and a lot of sagging, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.980
know that it's going to take longer. 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.540
It's going to take longer. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.480
There are limitations 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.480
as to what microcurrent can do; 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.660
it doesn't eliminate lots of extra skin 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.380
caused by years and years of sun damage. 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.680
Really, the only thing that can do that 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.980
is a facelift. 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.600
But I still have clients like that that look better 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.280
after a good microcurrent session, 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.160
because microcurrent lifts the cheeks, 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.440
it lifts the neck, it lifts the eyebrows. 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.960
Who doesn't look better when all that is lifted?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.340
So, if you're considering microcurrent, 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.340
come and have a session, 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.960
we'll talk about your facial tics. 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.980
Everybody has some asymmetry in their face 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.520
and I try to level that out a little bit. 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.800
Chances are if you have a go-to emotion, 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.100
or a go to facial tic, 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.280
that there's a lot of spasming in your face. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.760
People have amazing amounts of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.120
tension in their face. 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.420
My machine is special in that it helps release 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.960
that while it helps build muscle fibers. 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.280
There's a lot in microcurrent.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.740
There's a lot of people getting into it, 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.980
so you really have to choose your microcurrent 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.300
professional wisely 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.500
because there's a lot of bad education out there 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.960
and there's just not a lot of education out there. 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.380
I've had to seek it out myself 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.580
and I've had to perfect my method over the years. 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.740
I actually teach microcurrent to other rustys. 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.660
So, come and get a really good session, 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.760
know what you're missing 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.000
in your skincare anti-aging routine, 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.840
and check it out. 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.840
Thanks for watching and I hope to see you soon.
