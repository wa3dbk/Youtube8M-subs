00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.910
LES MCGEHEE: So, let's try another little
scene with the expert. We're going to put

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.820
an expert in this one, something we're going
to talk about in the last segment, we're going

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.440
to do for you in a minute. But in this expert
scene, why don't I go and ask advice. What's

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.429
from our producer? What's something that very
few people are experts in, maybe nobody? MAN:

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.119
Archery. LES MCGEHEE: Archery. Very good.
So, I'm going to show up to ask some questions

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.520
of an archery expert and we'll see if we can
develop this as a scene for you. Let's try

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.480
that. Excuse me, professor. Is it okay if
I ask a question now? Or do I need to wait?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.609
JOE PARSONS: No, no, it's [INDISCERNIBLE].
It's just good as any. LES MCGEHEE: Well,

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.570
I've waited for years to come here to visit
you to ask you archery questions and I've

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.059
got a long list. I'll just start. Triangular
heads versus diamond heads. I find myself

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.109
more partial to triangular heads aesthetically
[PH], but the diamond heads have a special

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.961
way of cutting through meat when hurled at
prey. JOE PARSONS: Mmm. JOE PARSONS: And so,

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:11.130
I'm wondering if you think that one has to
have an identity with only triangular heads

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.821
or? JOE PARSONS: I'm guessing you're from
Minnesota? LES MCGEHEE: Yes absolutely. JOE

00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:18.979
PARSONS: Well, then you're obviously from
the diamond camp. See, a triangular head is

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.500
more for the meats that you'll find in the
southern regions. And up north, up there where

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.240
they use diamond heads to cut things like
elk and beaver, then yes we would use diamond

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.600
heads, but both are very, very valid forms
of arrow heads. LES MCGEHEE: When the diamond

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.880
heads pierces the beaver though, the beaver
shrieks, and I've often wondered if that's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.390
out of surprise or out of distress, and could
it be the distress of surprise like I was

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.729
heading to a book of the month meeting and
now I have to go to the beaver doctor instead.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.159
I meant that in a nice way. But when it first
hit the beaver and he shrieks, does it hurt

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.310
him? Pain or just surprise? JOE PARSONS: Well,
you know I was just having this very debate

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.020
with Geena Davis and as it turns out that
surprise is very real to beavers. But, pain

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.900
of course exists in all sentient beings. LES
MCGEHEE: But when you say beaver's butt, I

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.090
didn't mean to imply that I was only shooting
at beavers that were retreating so to speak,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.100
but say a beaver coming right at me which
I guess would minimize the surprise it have

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.030
to know it was coming. JOE PARSONS: That's
a very good point. Yes, the debate's on whether

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.750
in north bound or south bound the beaver that
being shot from one of those-- LES MCGEHEE:

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.150
Okay, Joe could go on forever and be very
funny. In meantime, we'd like to come back

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.600
and teach you another segment on a new improv
thing. So, it's Les McGehee from Plays Well

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.760
with Others with Joe Parsons here at Expert
Village, see you next clip.
