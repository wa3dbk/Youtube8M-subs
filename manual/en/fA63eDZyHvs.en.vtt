00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.160
Hey youtubers it’s charlie and welcome to
another edition of Anime Club.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.779
This one is all about Attack On Titan.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.040
Since it’s been out for a long time on Crunchyroll
and now Netflix hopefully most of you have

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.709
had a chance to see it and I know a bunch
of you have read the manga too.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.410
Before we get started, quick shout out to
the winner of my Forever Evil edition two

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.410
weeks ago.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.939
Congratulations to Chloe Wright you win a
Twenty Dollar Amazon Giftcard and ItsybitsyIrishGirl

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.660
you get to pick a future topic for Anime Club.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.340
I’ll be messaging you both on your channels
for details.This week I’ll be picking two

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.669
more Random subscribers from the comments
for the same prizes.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.640
So first let’s talk about our top 5 Attack
on Titan anime moments, then I’ll do an

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
update on the live action film and season
2 of the anime series.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.230
Careful for spoilers if you haven’t seen
season 1 of the anime yet.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.699
Everybody bite your thumbs and let’s do
this!

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.550
For anyone that's curious I'm drinking Brainless
IPA during this.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.460
Hopefully I won't be brainless by the end.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.929
Number 5 - The Colossus Titan In Episode 1.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.140
The promotional material had already spoiled
the titan’s for non-readers but just like

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.949
Game of Thrones Red Wedding, all of that did
nothing to dull the shock of seeing the giant

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.250
titan appear at the wall for the first time.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.790
The other titan shifters would gradually appear
over the series and they were definitely WTF

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.870
moments, but after we got used to the shock
of the skinless steaming pile of scary.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.670
The biggest thrill morphed into the mystery
of their identities.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.010
Isn’t it funny that it’s one of the first
titan shifters we see, but we didn’t learn

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.310
who it was till way after the other titan
shifters.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.210
Number 4 - The Female Titan Reveal.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.840
I didn’t read the manga before seeing her
for the first time in episode 17.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.950
There were so many red flags about the female
titan.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.270
Mostly the fact that she looked like she was
designed to fight in close combat.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.110
I really loved the flashbacks we got of Annie
being trained by her father later in episode

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.270
23, so much of the series is this really dark
psychological drama.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.810
But unless you’ve read ahead in the manga,
she’s still stuck in that crystal cocoon.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.960
The biggest questions I always had when each
of the titan shifters identities were revealed,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.180
at least the sinister ones, was a big fat
WHY?!

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.700
I guess you could call it rage why.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.310
Number 3 - Eren Gets Nom’d by a titan.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.520
Worst cliffhanger in the history of cliffhangers.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
It was such a huge moment I just screamed
in my chair for a week until we found out

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.780
what happened.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.250
This actually brings up a minor complaint
of the series in that the intro’s and the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.930
outro’s make it feel like each episode has
very little new content.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.290
Like almost half the episode is spent talking
about the previous episode and the next one.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.030
So this became a meta WTF moment because of
what happened to Eren and the giant middle

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.180
finger they gave us with that cliffhanger.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.769
Number 2 - Eren is revealed as a titan shifter.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.099
He was the protagonist of the series, so he
had to come back somehow.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.019
Before the epic shifter reveal I thought he
would just cut his way out from the inside.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.310
The series doesn’t do a good job of explaining
the Titan’s digestive systems.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.269
In my head I kind of thought they were like
mini sarlacc pits.

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.329
Where people would usually just die from the
impact of falling down their throats, or they’d

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.590
die from starvation if the Titan’s didn’t
vomit them back up.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.650
Somebody should start an extra credit course
at school for Titan Biology.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.620
I could do an entire video just for Eren,
he’s not my favorite character.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.159
Mostly just because he seems so reluctant
to embrace his new abilities.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.659
He spends the rest of the season up to his
fight with the female titan just trying to

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.940
decide how he feels about it.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.490
Which is why he’s such a terrible fighter
when it comes time to lay the smack down on

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.490
Annie.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.430
Something every Anime, Science Fiction and
Fantasy series needs is a montage where the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.700
hero tests their abilities and learns how
to control them.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.409
I feel like Eren waited a little too long
to do that.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.940
It’s like his montage happened while he
was getting his ass kicked by Annie.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.889
I was actually kind of surprised that he was
able to defeat her.

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.469
But to be fair he had the help of the survey
corps.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:36.200
And my number 1 WTF moment - Titan in the
wall.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.889
This raised so many questions like are all
of the walls made of titans?

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.819
Is the city just wall to wall titans?

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.549
Who put them there? and most importantly why
are they there?

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.600
It seems like now someone has a grand plan
for all the people.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.749
They’re not the only city in existence,
so we still need to learn of all these shifters

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.650
came from another group trying to subjugate
the city.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.709
So many questions for Season 2.

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.099
Let me know what your biggest WTF moment was
from season 1 and what is the biggest question

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.640
you want to see answered in season 2?

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.120
We should all go ahead and pour one out for
fallen comrades.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.980
Here’s a quick update on the live action
movie before we start talking season 2.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.140
Right now they’re getting ready to start
filming this summer with an expected release

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.069
date of Summer 2015.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.540
If you saw the Subaru Commercial with CG titan’s,
the movie director worked on it.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.940
But they don’t know if the titan’s in
the movie will look the same as those.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.970
No cast has been announced, but since were
getting so close we should find out who they

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.970
are pretty soon.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.760
Now here’s an update on Season 2 of the
Anime Series.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.160
The studio that produced series 1, Wit Studios,
isn’t going to start working on Season 2

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.380
till either late this year or next year.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.870
Meaning it’s going to be a while before
we see it.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.060
They said this year they’re actually producing
a different anime series called Hōzuki no

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.060
Reitetsu.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.600
So if you liked the animation on Titan you
should check it out.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.270
I probably won’t wait a full week to post
my next anime club video.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.100
I want to do a review of Miyakaki’s The
Wind Rises.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.450
It just opened in theaters wide this weekend.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.600
So you should all be able to find somewhere
to see it where you live.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.700
Remember I’ll be picking two subscribers
randomly from the comments to be this week’s

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.700
giveaway winners.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.140
I’ll announce who you are in that review
video.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.120
I’ll try to post it Tomorrow Morning.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.500
Right now click here for my top 5 evil anime
characters and click here for my top 5 Miyazaki

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500
films.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.740
Thanks for watching, see you guys tomorrow.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.340
High Fives!
