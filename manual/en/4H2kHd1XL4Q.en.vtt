Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I’ll be showing you

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.730
how to make Beef Wellington with crushed Yukon
Gold Potatoes and Haricot Verts. The next

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.509
step we’ll do our onion. We’ll just take
the knife and cut this end of the onion off,

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.130
and leave this end on because this end holds
it all together. I’m just going to take

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.980
a little bit off of there, we’ll only need
about a quarter of this onion. Obviously I’ll

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.570
cut it in half first and then cut that half
in half, and there we have it. I’m going

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.250
to do with the onion; I want this onion to
be really, really small, so this is going

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.010
to be part of the stuffing that goes inside.
So we’re going to take our knife, and right

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.390
across the top you’ll see, I’m going to
cut in vertically like this and then I’m

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.820
going to cut them across to dice it. So you’ll
see that I’m cutting very, very, very thin

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.230
pieces. You know, you can also do this in
a food processor, I just don’t believe in

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:10.570
it, you lose the uniformity of it, you run
the risk also of turning it into mush and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.640
no one likes to eat mush. Those food processors,
you can take an onion from perfect to perfectly

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.610
terrible in just a couple of seconds. So I
turn it on its side here, now you see as I

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:33.070
slice it I’ve got little tiny dices of onion
there. And you’re going to want, you don’t

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.330
want to force the knife, you’re just going
to let it kind of fall through there, it’s

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:47.680
not really hard to cut. And when you get to
the end here, you don’t want to run the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.770
risk of chopping your fingertips off. Just
take your little onion stub here and you can

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.480
just cut little tiny dices just like that.
That way all you lose is just this little

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.549
tiny piece. So, and that becomes part of our
stuffing.
