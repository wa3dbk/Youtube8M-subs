00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Jay Barbree:  Senator Glenn

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.001
John Glenn:  I'm not sure I got the whole thing being the age I am.  [laughter]

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.002
Jay Barbree:  Courage, the right stuff.

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.003
John Glenn:  Repeat the question.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:12.004
Jay Barbree:  She wants to know where you get your courage from.

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:16.005
To climb on an Atlas rocket that has probably blown up

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.006
more times than it flew right,

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:20.007
and you rode it into orbit.

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.008
She wanted to know how you got that courage.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.009
John Glenn:  People say during launch, you know,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.010
that's the most crucial time and where you're changing things the most

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:29.011
and where all the thrust is on there

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:31.112
and what do you think about when you're getting ready to launch?

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:35.113
And I think the question goes back to,

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:38.114
"How do you think you'd feel if you new you were on top of 2 million parts

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:40.215
built by the lowest bidder on a government contract. [laughter]

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:48.216
That's the flippant answer.

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:54.217
I think you develop courage in a couple of areas.

00:00:54.218 --> 00:00:57.218
One, you develop this by what your purpose is,

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.219
the mission, your dedicated to the mission

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.220
and by the preparation and that gives you confidence

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:06.221
you can really do this thing that you've really tried

00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:10.222
to see all the aspects of it and all the things that can go wrong.

00:01:10.223 --> 00:01:12.223
You try to take care of all these things before you launch.

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:14.224
John Glenn:  So I think it comes from two things.

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:18.325
One, dedication to the country and what you think is important for the country.

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:21.326
Back in the early days it was the competition with the Soviets

00:01:21.327 --> 00:01:26.327
who we weren't sure then they might be taking over the world.

00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:30.328
And then its preparation, and preparation, and preparation

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.329
that gives you confidence to go.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.330
Jim Lovell: Well, sometimes when you're confronted with a problem

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:38.331
and there is no alternative,

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:46.332
you either had to have the courage to continue or your lost and consequently,  on Apollo 13,

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:50.333
when the explosion first occurred, and we didn't know what happened,

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:54.334
and at first we didn't think we were in that danger

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:58.335
until I saw the oxygen escaping from the spacecraft

00:01:58.336 --> 00:02:02.336
and then I realized that we were in serious danger

00:02:02.337 --> 00:02:04.337
and we looked around to see what we had to use

00:02:04.338 --> 00:02:09.338
and the Lunar module, fortunately, was a part of our system

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:13.339
and then we worked very closely

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.340
with a dedicated group of people at the Mission Control Center,

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:21.341
which indicated to me that the good leadership

00:02:21.342 --> 00:02:25.342
and the team work that evolved from that

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:28.343
was the initiative of the perseverance and the motivation

00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:30.344
of these people working with the crew

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:38.345
crew indicated that Apollo 13 was not just another space flight

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:44.346
of dangerous situations but really a classic case of crisis management.

00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:48.347
Jay Barbree:  Neil Armstrong, you started to land Eagle on the moon.

00:02:48.348 --> 00:02:51.348
You found out I believe that they were heading you

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.349
toward a crater that you didn't want to land in 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.350
and you had to fly your ship across the surface of the moon 

00:03:00.351 --> 00:03:03.351
until you could find a spot to sit it down.

00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:08.552
I think you had sixteen seconds of fuel left, can you tell us what that was like?

00:03:08.553 --> 00:03:14.553
Neil Armstrong:  No Pilot likes to land in a bad place.  [laughter]

00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:16.554
Jay Barbree:  Great.

00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:25.555
Neil Armstrong:  Pilots, by nature, will go to any extreme to find a good place to land.  

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:28.556
And that's what we did.  [laughter/applause]

00:03:28.557 --> 00:03:29.557
Jay Barbree:  And that's what you did.

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.558
Jay Barbree:  What we would like to know from you, Neil, 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.559
what it was like to step onto that moon

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.560
and turn around and take your first steps, 

00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:45.561
and really learn how to walk into reverse on that surface.

00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:51.562
Neil Armstrong:  We had a few people that thought it was going to be very difficult 

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:56.563
to walk on the surface for whatever reasons they believed that to be true.

00:03:56.564 --> 00:04:00.564
In our simulations sometimes were a little difficult.

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:04.865
But the human is remarkably adaptive 

00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:08.866
and what we found out was that by the 

00:04:08.867 --> 00:04:12.867
time we had just stood around in the cockpit for a couple hours 

00:04:12.868 --> 00:04:14.068
we were completely adapted 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.069
and when we walked on off of the craft onto the surface, 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:26.070
we already were right at home and you'd really like it. [laughter/applause]

00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:31.071
Mary Ellen Weber:  You know, a lot of folks have asked me, well you must be a real risk taker, 

00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:33.172
and I really don't think that's true, 

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:35.173
I think I'm one of the most safety conscious people that I know.  

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:39.174
What I think I am is an opportunity seeker 

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:44.175
and I think that's what has lead me to be a part of the Astronaut Corps. 

00:04:44.176 --> 00:04:47.176
and to some of the other things I've had an opportunity to do.

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:50.177
And so I guess my only words of inspiration 

00:04:50.178 --> 00:04:57.178
to an aspiring engineer and an aspiring astronaut is to seek out those opportunities.

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:00.179
I recently had a newspaper ask me,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.180
What was a key formative thing that happed to you

00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:09.481
that you think lead you to where you got to?

00:05:09.482 --> 00:05:13.482
And I recalled being in college, at Purdue University,

00:05:13.483 --> 00:05:17.483
and I remember seeing in the Purdue newspaper

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.484
a little article about the Purdue Skydiving club.  

00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:23.485
And it really consisted of one guy with a car

00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:26.786
that would drive out to the drop zone each weekend. [laughter]

00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:29.487
But it turns out so I called that number 

00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:32.488
and I started that and that's what got me into aviation

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:35.489
and I'm still involved in aviation and skydiving even today.  

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.490
But had I not seen that little ad,

00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:44.491
had I not responded to it, had I not sought out that opportunity,

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:50.492
this whole world that became open to me a decade later

00:05:50.493 --> 00:05:52.493
would not have become open to me.  

00:05:52.494 --> 00:05:54.494
And so I guess that's my only words of inspiration

00:05:54.495 --> 00:05:56.495
is keep your eyes and ears open. 

00:05:56.496 --> 00:06:00.496
Look for the tiniest opportunity to try something new, 

00:06:00.497 --> 00:06:04.497
to seek out new people, new events even like this, like today,

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:13.498
and keep yourself open to that because you have no idea where it might lead. [applause]
