Are you looking for an excuse to have people
over? Well, my name is Lori Randall, with

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.990
Simply Divine Events, and I'm going to tell
you how to throw a dessert party. Maybe doing

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.900
a dessert party might be something a little
bit different, than your just typical ,come

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.940
on over, and have some appetizers, hors d'oeurves,
and drinks. Think of it a little bit outside

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.160
of the box, and do a dessert party. Your dessert
party could be something that's later in the

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.749
evening, after dinner. Maybe 7:30, 8:00 o'clock,
till like midnight, 11:30. The dessert party

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.500
that I'm going to be talking to you about
today, is basically, more of a holiday dessert

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.180
party, around the holiday times. You might
want to think about having people come over.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.240
People are so busy, and they're having to
just go to so many parties and open houses,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.360
typically during the day. Think about doing
a dessert party in the evening or at night,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.851
so people can stop by their last minute shopping.
They can come on over to your dessert party,

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:56.540
and enjoy some time with friends and family.
When you're throwing your dessert party, if

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.710
you're doing the holiday theme, which we are
here, you want to think of using like your

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.989
reds and your whites, to stick with the whole
Christmas holiday theme. You might want to

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.400
set up a buffet table, or different little
stations, throughout your house, of having

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.850
different types of candies. You have licorice
here. Like some red hots, some white, like

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.890
chocolate covered mints. Pull in some of your
little like votive candles, and get a little

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.930
holder that has the berries, and kind of brings
in your reds, with your roses. You also want

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.759
to have a station set up for your alcohol
as well, which is very important around the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.670
holiday times, to keep you a little stress
free. You want to have a bar. Make sure that

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.939
you have all your cocktail attire that you
need up here. You want to make sure you have

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.319
your rums, and your vodkas, all your liqueurs.
Also think of your dessert liqueurs, as well.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.179
Maybe think of doing a red velvet cake. Anything
that kind of sticks with your red and white,

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.520
or your Christmas theme. Crystals, you might
want to hang, and maybe as the guests enter,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.209
you might want to have like a nice red and
white wreath on the door, just kind of sticks

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.069
with the whole atmosphere and party. If you
don't want to do it during Christmas time,

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.869
say you want to do it at some other time of
the year, come up with another theme. Say

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.269
you're doing it in the fall, like autumn.
You can have the fall leaves, the pumpkins,

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.150
squash, that sort of thing, and do your dessert
party that way, so I hope I gave you some

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.860
ideas. My name is Lori Randall, with Simply
Divine Events, and I wish you the best of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.840
luck in planning your dessert party.
