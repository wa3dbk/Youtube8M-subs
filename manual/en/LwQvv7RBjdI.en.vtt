[Tim talking]

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.260
Tim is a two-eyed tall minion with sprout cut hair.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020
He's usually seen dressed as a dad.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.600

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.520
And he also giggles.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.980
Just shake him up and down.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.980
You can combine Tim with other McDonalds Happy Meal Minion toys for more fun.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.780
