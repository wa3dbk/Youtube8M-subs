00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.730
GIFs were established as a free and sort of like usable part of the web.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.309
GIFS are great because its

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.239
a low barrier entry, anyone can play around, and it's fun.

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.369
The animated GIF for us was just a photograph that can move

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.489
and existed forever. This is a photograph that is still alive and so we were

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:25.489
already thinking beyond the limitations of the file name.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.689
An animated GIF is

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.390
an image that's been encoded using the
graphics interchange format, where it has

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.030
multiple frames encoded into a single image
file and a web browser or other piece of software

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.930
will play those images back in animated sequence automatically. The original GIF

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.900
specification came out in 1987. Early example of GIFs that

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.839
you see are flames, like flames are very
popular, and the waving american flag is all

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.619
over the place. Most notoriously is the
under construction GIF.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.049
But then by the time you get to like '95/ '96,
you get the release of the Netscape browser and these web browsers 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.939
that can

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.079
automatically animate them and all of a sudden
you see this new spike in popularity.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.720
But, following that, there's a sudden division
between the web 1.0 of the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.000
seventies and eighties and nineties and
then web 2.0 of like the two

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.499
thousands

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:24.429
moving forward. So the idea of using GIFs becomes way less fashionable. But, around 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.560
2007/2008 popularity is swinging back up. People then start to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.999
realize that you can use gifs for tons of different things. Like now that we're in 2011/

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.569
2012, there's more GIFs online but you also have

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.659
way more places to put them; things like
reddit and tumblr, wordpress. Even like

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.299
twitter to a certain degree. So you're seeing
actually this like post modern GIFs.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:50.299
And the tools for GIF creation are
becoming more widespread.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.150
GIFs can be anything

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.659
but what unites the GIFs is that they're short and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.189
they are something that most tumblr users
can create themselves. People are sharing

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.680
more and I think tumblr definitely has a part of that. Humans really like repetition, we feel comfortable with it.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.779
And sometimes just, the longer you watch something,

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:15.639
the funnier it gets or it'll actually change meanings. You have the glitch art, you have pixel art,

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.619
TV, movies, and you have stuff that you can't
even

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:23.029
really categorize. I think it's mostly young
people driving the form, definitely, because

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.359
it enhances their online persona. Just being
able to make some of those,

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.819
makes you so cool. It's uncharted
territory right now and

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.139
I think really anything has the
possibility, the potential to be an art form

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.519
but certainly, around animated GIFs, we've seen a

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.909
transformation. We've seen them go from just people

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.209
taking tv shows. We've seen people making
original stuff with them.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.479
Mashups between videogames and movie
characters and even tumblr memes. I think

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.059
there's other new

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:51.029
art forms waiting to be discovered in there

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.709
that we just haven't figured out yet.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.980
So we were doing fashion editorials and that's all at magazines and things like that and the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.079
fashion world really didn't latch on to the internet, so we wanted to push that. It

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.329
makes sense that the web is there, why 
put a still picture online. The

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.139
image can now move. So instead of making
still pictures you would make

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.129
animated pictures and they would just go on,
infinitely, forever. Everyone always describes our

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.980
work as

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.980
creepy. What's creepy about it? But our work
is very playful. So, I mean, I think the two

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.990
biggest inspirations is, one, the web. We work off of memes and memes are in our work.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.620
That they're just a kid making something
funny with their friends and tossing it up

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.249
online. That's where the best memes come from, you know.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:42.730
It's accidents. But besides that, video games. It lends itself to like video game

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.230
culture, like playing a game and, you know, blowing people up on the moon and slaying

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.529
dragons and things like that. It's just this idea that you could be anything and-

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:56.569
you can become anyone, yeah -go anywhere.
I mean, these are possible in games. We get

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.819
bored really really quick and it's
always about doing the next thing and

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.559
technology and it used to be that art was

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:08.430
in museums on walls and now, all of a sudden, with this thing of the web and art on

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.169
screens, all of a sudden, you go to to the MOMA and there's a screen with art on it. So,

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:20.319
we just want to be there.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.789
I think there's opportunities with this kind of

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.940
hybrid medium to show people something
they've never seen before, to have these

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.639
moments that can just exist forever. It's just like this little magical warp of time.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.619
We can live within a moment within that moment, like to

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:38.569
dream of something and then create it in a camera and share it with people and let them dream with you,

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.500
just for a moment. It allows a moment
to

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.669
live on and there's something kind of fascinating about that. Whatever that

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.060
one thing is that is alive is what your eye's gonna go to.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.319
It sets the emotional impact of what the cinemagraph will be. It's a big creative decision for us, like

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.830
what moment to focus on. We have a cinemagraph called "Anna Sees Everything." She's

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.630
watching this show and it's kind of like a little portrait of her. This is what she does for a living.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.480
So like watching the footage of Bill Cunningham, he didn't take a picture of every model that

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.650
walks by. When he

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.319
likes them and he likes it and he shoots it and when he doesn't, he doesn't and he doesn't even think about it.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.389
So like we get to learn something in

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.360
watching somebody

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.210
for hours on end while we work on it.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.469
We understand them.

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:20.300
It's so voyeuristic. You look but then you feel

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.070
like you should look away but then you can watch it and so then you can watch it some more

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.439
and it's like "ohh."

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.469
The simplicity of it, I feel, is

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:28.899
really beautiful and

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:31.729
we see it as an evolution of photography.

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.509
If you think of all the ways that photography
is displayed these are areas that we want to

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.139
go into.

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.349
There's the parts of it that are alive and you can choose to engage in depth into the art or you can

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.479
choose to just glance at it and it's there as if it's a photograph.

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:44.989
And,

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:47.919
essentially something you've never seen before.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.779
Who is for people whom like they think in GIFs, or like they almost speak in GIFs and I think once you get

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.340
to that point, yeah, sure,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.690
it's art. The idea of art has changed.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.690
And we've always seen what we could get away with. It's fun. When we started making these we were calling them 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.069
animated GIFs but it

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.949
was so much more than that. It's just
too new and I love being a part of this at a time when

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:14.949
we're just figuring it out.

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.280
We should say "gif". It's not a "gif" it's a "jif". It's a "jif".

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.470
"Jif" is how I learned it first. The founder of the
format of "jif", the compuserve guy- This is ancient

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.139
internet history here. -he said, "choosy 
developers choose jif" like the peanut butter.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.779
We can talk about why you should say "gif" because it doesn't sound like peanut butter.

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:40.999
Let's find this guy. My understanding is that
this guy

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:45.339
prefers "jif". So you gotta represent, for
the creator. I say we gotta go with the

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.889
inventor of the format. Giraffics.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.469
Everyone says "gif". It's "jif".
