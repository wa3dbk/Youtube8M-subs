LYNN EPSTEIN: Alright, now, I said I was going
to go get the monster toast, I lied. I want

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.040
to make sure that you understand that it is
not only a cooking activity. It's not just

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.129
the recipe. It's an opportunity to serve up
some language and new concepts, a new vocabulary.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.700
So I'm going to talk to you now, as I would
talk to my kids while I'm doing the activity.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:30.070
Alright, "Hi, we're going to be making some
monster toast. This is what we need. We need

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.989
a toaster oven. We need milk, can you say
milk? Milk, that's it. We have bread, what's

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.090
this? Who knows what this is? You're right.
We need a spoon and who knows what this one

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.530
is? Very good. It's a paintbrush. I know.
We're going to be painting on our bread, isn't

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.371
that silly? It's also fun. Okay, here we go
kids. We're going to pour milk. What am I

00:00:57.371 --> 00:01:02.229
doing? I am pouring." That's called scripting
when you kinda give it to them, the answer,

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:09.000
and then ask them the question, "What am I
doing? I'm pouring. What did I do? I pour.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.140
And now, let's mix some more. I drop it, one
drop, two, three, four, five. Look what's

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:27.090
happening, it's changing colors. Do you see?
What's happening? You're right. Now, it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.901
time to mix. What do I need to mix it? You're
right, I need a spoon. Now, I mix it. Oh,

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:41.520
look at the milk, we have blue milk, how cool
is that? Very. Now, we're going to make some

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.360
other colors. We're going to make yellow and
purple and red and now, we're going to paint.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.350
I'm going to give you a paintbrush--not yet.
I'll give it when we're ready to paint. First,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.870
watch me. I'm going to make a monster. That's
his eye and what else does he need? You're

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.730
right. We can make a mouth, that's his scary
mouth. What else does he need? Alright, let's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.739
give him a nose, and how about another eyeball?
Oh, he's so scary. Alright, we can add another

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.780
color, blue nose. Alright, now we're done
and I'm going to give you the supplies that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.320
you need. You ready? Who needs a plate? Oh,
raise your hand. Now, I know. You do. And

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.090
we need to give you a brush and a piece of
bread. Alright, I'll help you, here's a color

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.689
for you. Let's get started." And then they're
mixing and you're helping. And remember, when

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:48.629
you have the one that's too soggy, no problem.
You just going to scoop it up and tell 'em,

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.709
it's ready to put into the toaster. And don't
forget those safety tips, okay? You're working

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.299
with toddlers. They're curious. Keep the wires
out of the way and make sure your toaster

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:05.060
oven is in a high shelf away from curious
hands. Okay, now, let's see what our monster

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.169
toast looks like when it's done.
