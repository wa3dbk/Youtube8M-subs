Hello and welcome back to module 3.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.980
We are talking about Learning Games.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.160
We have already discussed games to help me
develop language, games which might get your

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.500
heart rate going by improving a bit of movement,
and now what we are going to be thinking about

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.930
in this unit is games that get your brain
moving a little bit as well.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.350
We are going to be thinking about some brain
training games.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.710
Now I should probably say that like many of
the other games in this section, some of these

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.879
types of games can be really good, but some
of these types of games might not be as good

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.280
as others as well, so it is really important
that you try out these different games.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.140
There are lots of people these days claiming
to be able to improve your brain power or

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.460
your mental arithmetic, but the reality is
that there is no kind of scientific proof

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.239
for that.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.449
There is a bit of proof though around this
game here, it is a game called Dr. Kawashima’s

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.300
Brain Training: How Old Is Your Brain?

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.760
I refer to it because it has been one of the
top 10 bestselling games for about the last

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.390
5 or 6 years now, it always still seems to
be up in the charts, and it is available for

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.950
the 3DS as well as the Nintendo DS.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.450
There has been a lot of work done around it,
in terms of actually how it does improve your

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.370
brain and your processing power, and we did
a little project with it up here in Scotland

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.440
around how it can be used to improve your
mental maths.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.040
The activities inside it are actually very
simple.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.470
One of the activities is around being able
to do 20 sums as quickly as you can, or 100

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.390
sums as quickly as you can, or about trying
to improve your cognitive ability by joining

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.760
the different dots in a certain order to do
things.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.020
So all the activities are basically designed
to improve your cognitive power through practice,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.190
and it has also got Sudoku which is built
into it as well.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.440
A number of years ago, the Learning and Teaching
Scotland Consolarium, the Scottish Centre

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.080
for Games Based Learning, did a project using
these Nintendo DS in school to help improve

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.650
mental maths and it was really successful.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.810
Here is an example from one of the schools
that was taking part in a DS project, and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.630
what you can see is that you can see that
the children are using the DS, they are using

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.630
the computer game along with their traditional
learning resources as well, so again, the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.560
game is not replacing traditional learning
resources, it is complementing the different

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.580
learning resources.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.310
Anyway, this specific project that I was telling
you about, looked at putting a number of these

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.360
devices into primary schools from across Scotland
and the interesting thing about it was that

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.780
the results were very positive in terms of
improving the mental maths scores of these

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.970
different groups of children.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.310
In fact so positive the article was written
up by the main researchers Dr. David Miller

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.270
and Derek Robertson, both from the University
of Dundee, and that was published in the British

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.920
Journal Educational Technology, so really
a good example about how games and game play,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.530
if you have got the right game and the right
methodology behind it, can have a real impact

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.350
on learning and a real impact on attainment.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.590
As I have mentioned before, there are a number
of different Brain Training Apps.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.050
I have mentioned Dr. Kawashima is one that
we know works, but there are lots of other

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.459
ones that are available, some for free and
some that you have to pay for, and again I

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.720
would encourage you to go away and test out
some of these apps to see whether they are

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.739
any good or not, or whether they are relevant
for your class or not, and again this is a

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.070
screenshot from the Android app store, so
you can start to see some of the range of

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.810
different apps, the range of different many
games that are available.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.400
These are some that we have used with schools
here.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.440
Math Workout is very good, not only is it
free, but there are a lot of activities inside

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.510
that are very similar to Dr. Kawashima’s
Brain Training, and therefore I think it is

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.989
valid because it makes a link between the
2 in terms of activity.

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:13.321
Sudoku is also very good we know for improving
maths, improving mental arithmetic, and there

00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:17.720
are lots of good examples of Sudoku games
that are available as well online.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.979
And one that the kids really enjoy using here
is one from Android which is called Math Duel,

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.190
sorry it is also available for Apple iOS,
I had forgotten about that, and that is where

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.430
you have to compete against the people in
terms of doing different sums, and of course

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.580
because the game learns with you, the sums
get more and more complicated as you progress

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.910
with the game, or if the game knows that you
are maybe not quite as good at adding and

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.930
you are better at subtracting, you will start
to get more adding sums there as well.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.980
The game is really looking after you and it
is building on your prior knowledge.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.590
So why don’t you go away and have a think
about exploring the App Store, perhaps there

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.810
are some brain training games, perhaps there
is a maths game, and think about how you might

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.760
be able to use those in your classroom with
your children.
