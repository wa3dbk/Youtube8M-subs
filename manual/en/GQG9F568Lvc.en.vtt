00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.840
What's going on guys?

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.550
My name is ZaziNombies and today

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.400
We adventuring around in a new LEGO Minecraft world that I built

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.029
this time It's the jungle biome

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.560
complete with skeleton mobs and massive jungle trees

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.480
it was sort of based off the jungle M biome

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.319
with the large flowing waterfall and

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.820
All the cliffs as well

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.380
It was built with over 400 smooth tiles alone

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.869
the total piece count for it was over

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.560
3000 bricks and was built on a 48 by 48 stud base plate

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.280
It's got seven jungle trees

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.090
and I used blue bricks for that deep blue jungle lake

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.260
Also, it has some melon blocks as jungles

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.980
are the only place that naturally grows

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.520
melons

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.219
for this set

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.289
I wanted to give it some playability features

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.200
So it has some

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
removable blocks as well the vines hang down

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.740
also Steve has a tree house

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.860
and the roof comes off and there's a light brick as

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.649
Well that actually lights it up, which you'll see here in a second

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.239
It's got that kind of orange torchlight

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.080
So that when night falls and all the zombies and skeletons come out

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.639
Steve can be all safe and cozy in his tree house it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.230
Was built with dark tan Lego bricks

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.280
And it's got a double chest, a furnace, a bed

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.180
and some bookshelves as well in it so for accessories

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.780
We have 2 skeleton mobs

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.439
we have a crafting table, a block of gold, and a block of TNT

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.140
Also a boat for Steve to go sailing around his nice jungle lake

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.840
and it can slide along the river

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.529
as well, since it was

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740
Built with lots of smooth Lego tiles

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.919
for tools we have a bow and arrow

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.580
We have as well a map to find our way around

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.639
as jungles can be quite

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.920
Dense and very easy to get lost in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.200
so we have a Lego compass as well and a fishing rod

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.020
to go catch fish and keep our food bar full

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.189
also a couple Lego fish

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.680
were added. So for alternate skins for Steve

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260
We have Steve the Barbarian

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.760
we have monkey Steve and Steve in Jungle combat camo

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.709
complete with an axe

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.790
Also, we have a shovel and a gold sword for Steve to go around

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.280
I guess beheading all the hostile mobs and zombies

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.470
and kicking them into the river here

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.360
You can see a sort of a 360 view of it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.920
I used lots of tan for the beach as I want to get lots of different

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.339
elements of the jungle in there we have some

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.705
Torches as well as potions.

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:51.580
For food we have an apple, a bottle of water, a chicken

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.020
a carrot as well as a cake and some bread.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.869
so as you can see

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.049
An absolutely massive amount of accessories in this Lego jungle also

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.380
we have some flowers and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.329
cookies and cocoa beans as minecraft

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.580
Jungles are the only place where cocoa beans grow

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.599
and also vines and ocelots are exclusive to the jungle too

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.069
And we have an enchanted book, too

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.760
But if you guys are looking to build your own Lego jungle

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.378
the three main colors for this were: Green, blue

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.640
As well as gray and then of course tan for the beach

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.339
so sort out your 2 by 2 bricks for that

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.600
But there you have it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.940
I hope you guys enjoyed the LEGO Minecraft jungle

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.609

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.180
a great place as well to store

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.120
LEGO golden coins

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.890
