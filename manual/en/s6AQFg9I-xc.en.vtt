Hi, I'm Thierry Rautureau, the Chef in the
Hat, owner of Luc in Madison Valley and Loulay

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.710
in downtown Seattle.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.019
Right now, we're going to talk about sea scallops.
What you're looking for, and you need to ask

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.179
your fishmonger, yes you need a fishmonger,
is for dry-packed scallops. These will be

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.199
the scallops that you will be able to sear
in the pan and get this beautiful sear on

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.669
the outside like you find in restaurants.
The number one thing is to turn on your pan

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:36.650
and walk away from it. Let it get hot. Don't
be scared, it will smoke, that's what you're

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.550
looking for. The only treatment for the scallop
is a little bit of oil, canola oil, which

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.290
sustains the heat a little bit more than olive
oil, obviously, a little bit of salt and pepper.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.590
Toss them nicely around. There we go.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.989
Let's see how hot this is. Ah, it's pretty
hot, as you would say. Look at that, the water

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.989
just jumps right on top of that pan. Alright,
that's all you need for the scallop; a little

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.140
dollop of oil. Just right away, drop in your
scallop right on top of that, just like this.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.439
Do not touch your fish until it's cooked.
Turn down the heat to medium and let it sear

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.700
a little bit. You're looking for the protein
to caramelize right on the outside of that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.770
scallop. Look at this beautiful scallop.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.609
If your pan gets a little bit dry, all you
have to do is just put a little dollop of

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:43.609
that canola oil again right on top of that.
No flame allowed. Let's turn off the heat.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.819
Now scallops do not cook to medium-well, OK?
Otherwise you have a piece of rubber on your

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.399
hands. You want it to be almost raw in the
middle. And one of the best secret ingredients

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.279
in the French cuisine is of course, butter.
A nice little nugget of butter melted right

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:06.170
on top of your scallop, and that's how you
finish cooking your scallop. Just keep putting

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.820
that butter right on top of that scallop like
this. And that, my friend, will finish to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.700
cook it. But one thing I like to do from here,
is to drop it right in here, and just toss

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.580
my scallop like this with all of that fresh
herbs. That was a nice little salad, and voila.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.200
Bon appetit, mon ami.
