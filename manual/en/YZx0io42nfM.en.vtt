00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.360
" Augmented Reality "

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.070
so-called AR technology.

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:15.210
I think curiosity or game is the reason of using it.

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:20.410
But in our daily life,

00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:24.720
it might be useful for us.

00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:28.420
Now I'm in the SONY building Ginza.

00:00:28.421 --> 00:00:33.930
I'll go to the press event of the AR technology.

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:42.230
[ Welcome to the "New AR technology and its application" ]

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:47.880
recognized it? "Yes." and touch...

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.820
"turn over the page"

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:56.320
recognize, touch, zoom...

00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:06.530
It has stopped like a photo, but it is interactive menu.

00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:18.840
It can put an object on center automatically.

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.070
For ex. in front of the restaurant,

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:25.040
it has recognized the door,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.670
you can read tweets about that restaurant.

00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:34.840
It displays the additional information of the products.

00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:39.340
It may display the optimized menu for only you.

00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:44.490
It was possible only in the E-comerece before,

00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:49.280
But it will be in even the real world.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.160
" They looks like balls of the real world. "

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.700
SONY kept on developing these AR technologies.

00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:03.930
And the AI of the QRIO, AIBO,

00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.910
The "SmartAR" was born on their technologies.

00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.340
"It's called SmartAR. "

00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:19.640
" SmartAR needs no markers. "

00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:23.670
" can recognize any photos, paintings "

00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:29.880
" Shaking or close up, "

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:34.550
" It can recognize an object "

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.690
" Rapidly chasing AR "

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:43.390
" turning around, but it can display soon. "

00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:48.790
" Before, AR couldn't recognize objects out of sight. "

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:57.170
" SmartAR can keep recognizing, though an object moved out of camera frame. "

00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:02.140
Wow It's amazing!

00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.780
" Why can it do that? "

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:12.820
" Because it can not recognize only a target object, "

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:18.820
" but also other objects and space as a 3D space. "

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:25.860
Before, I thought AR was just only interesting.

00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:35.540
After this presentation, I thought it would be useful for our life.

00:03:35.541 --> 00:03:41.240
SONY "SmartAR" technology
