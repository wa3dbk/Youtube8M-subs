00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:08.340
Gluten Free 4 flour, vegan bread

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:14.199
Hello Friends! Today we will make a vegan bread,  but this has the difference

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.630
that it is made with 4 flours

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.869
and It is basically, for you to have the option of making changes

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.099
because I know it is very complicated for everyone finding this kind of gluten free flour

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.079
that are not widely consumed and therefore, are usually not found in grocery stores

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.190
So let me show the ingredients and then the directions

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.510
Friends, the ingredients to make the gel are: 200 ml of water at room temperature

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.270
35 grams of cassava starch, cassava in other countries is known as tapioca or yuca

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.480
This step is crucial because with it we will make a gel

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.840
which will replace the gluten that has the wheat flour

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.700
with this, we will be making a kind of glue that is going to be perfect

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.840
to mix all ingredients and flours that this preparation has

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.600
The flours that we're going to use to make the bread are:

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.620
Well, in this case, we did not
find quinoa flour [quinoa]

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.660
therefore, we will use the raw material, which in this case is quinoa

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.590
and we're going to show how the procedure is done

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.590
because it usually happens that we do not find the flour, but we do find the raw material

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.190
so we are going to show you how the quinoa flour it's made, here are 60 grams [of quinoa]

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.620
We need 100 ml of warm water

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.360
70 grams of chickpea flour

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.720
125 ml of vegetable oil

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.640
2 teaspoons of dry yeast

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.470
1 teaspoon of salt

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.250
1 teaspoon of sugar

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.960
210 grams of cornstarch

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.490
and lastly, 160 grams of rice flour

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.610
Friends, the preparation is as follows

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.770
in the bowl  where we had warm water, we will place the sugar, yeast, we will mix well

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.339
and we reserve

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:19.139
we will grind the quinoa in a food processor, you can also use a coffee grinder

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.969
we will process well

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.819
in the meantime we already weighed the flours

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.059
we left them in a bowl and then, we mix well

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:34.739
we will add the salt and continue incorporating well the mixture

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.539
we will sift the quinoa that was processed

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:43.159
and if we get residues, we will process them again

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:52.659
and we will then return to sift them and what doesn't pass through the strainer, will be removed

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.449
because if not, they are going to be some stones on the bread and that's not very nice to eat

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.829
so we discard those little stones

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.739
we mix well the 4 flour mixture

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.399
and now it is time to make the gel: we mix well the cassava starch with the water at room temperature.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.200
Once they're well blended, we put it over low heat

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.759
and we keep mixing with a wooden spoon

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:23.239
once you see the preparation is thick and has a transparent color

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.619
remove the pot from the heat

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:31.019
in a bowl, we'll add the oil and the yeast that is already activated

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.909
and we will be slowly adding the flours

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.449
we will mix well, we'll keep adding flour

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.420
and this is the time to add the gel

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.100
we will add all with the help of a wooden spoon

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.939
we will mix it a little bit

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.089
and we will add the remaining flours

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:02.449
and this is the time to knead the dough, but it is more like join it with your hands, because this dough doesn't need to be kneaded

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.919
we will mix well by hand because we neet to feel that the dough is perfect

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.239
and once we've incorporated well all the flours

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.659
we'll grease a rectangular pan (with regular oil)

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.079
we will place the dough there and we'll put it away for 1 hour or 1Â½ hours in a warm place

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.180
we will put over a washcloth

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.419
10 minutes before the hour has pased, we will pre-heat the oven

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:36.519
we will cook the bread the first 25 minutes using the bottom heat

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.680
and the remaining 20 minutes, we use the upper and lower heat, we cook the bread for 45 minutes, in total

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.980
After that time, we remove the bread from the oven, and wait for it to cool completely

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.980
and unmold

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.160
and we will enjoy a delicious bread with 4 flours

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.509
Well friends I hope you liked this recipe, with this recipe we give a solution

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.099
to all of our friends that couldn't find some specific flours

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.719
with this, we can replace some of the flours and have several options when we're making gluten free bread

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.120
I hope you liked this recipe and enjoy this bread, because it is very yummy

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.220
when we add the quinoa, we increased the "crunchiness" of the bread

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.260
and this bread the following day you could toast it if you want, or you can eat it as is and is really delicious

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.080
It is ideal for vegans, and it is obviously gluten and dairy free

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:35.680
