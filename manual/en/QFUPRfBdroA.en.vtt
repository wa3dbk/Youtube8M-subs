00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.310
Now, we have a good source of water here,
which is a creek, here in the wilderness.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.860
As a general rule, a creek, or running water,
is generally ok to drink, especially, in the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.800
wilderness. The only thing that you shouldn't
do is drink running water if it's a tropical

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.151
environment or a jungle but, as a general
rule, running water is always ok to drink

00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:30.330
in the wilderness. There are exceptions, as
a general rule, water doesn't stay in one

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.790
place. For example, we have this creek right
here, water is not going to stay right along

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.760
this creek bed it is going to absorb into
the land outwards. If you are in a situation

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.381
where you find a stagnant pond or lake, you're
going to want to make sure that that water

00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:49.650
is purified. Now, you don't have water tablets,
you don't have a homemade purifier, how are

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.240
you going to get pure, clean water? What you're
going to do is you're going to take your shovel,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.010
which I have in my survival kit, you're going
to go inland, usually, about ten to fifteen

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.660
feet but since we're at a creek bed I'm going
to show you, right here at the end of the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.850
creek bed, how we're going to do this. What
you're going to do is you're going to dig

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:16.260
down into the ground until you get to a good
source of water. Now, the further you dig

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.750
down, the more water you're going to get.
Wait until you have about six inches of water

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.900
before you actually test it to see if it's
ok to drink because, otherwise, it's going

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.120
to be a little too murky and a little too
muddy. Dig down, let it sit, let the little

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.549
pond sit for about ten to fifteen minutes,
just so all the sediment will settle back

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.580
down to the bottom then you can use your hands
or a cup or a bottle, if you have it, to fill

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.770
up and drink. Now, almost always you're not
going to get the cleanest looking water but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.430
I assure you it is all purified through the
ground and it's perfectly ok to drink. Even,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.759
if you're at the ocean, if you go far enough
inland, you can dig down to where that ocean

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.960
water seeped in and it is completely fresh
water, completely absolute of salt and chlorine

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.160
and sodium. So, that's the basic way to purify
water using the ground. Let's move onto this

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.270
next way of purifying water.
