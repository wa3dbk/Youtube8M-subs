00:00:06.158 --> 00:00:08.677
There are things
you can get away with in this world

00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:10.777
and there are things you can't.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.786
Gailin says it's been here a while.
He thinks the last flood did it.

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:26.043
Here is it.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.629
- Who else knows about this?
- Just me and Gailin.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:30.714
Good.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.174
This boat's ours.

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:38.638
- Someone's here.
- What?

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.932
Someone's living in our boat.

00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:43.685
You know that guy?

00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:45.874
I've never seen him before.

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:47.814
What did you say, boys?

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:50.442
- You got crosses in your heels.
- Nails,

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:51.772
shaped like cross.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.434
What for?

00:00:53.684 --> 00:00:55.155
Ward off evil spirits.

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.256
I'm waiting on my girlfriend.

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:01.814
She's go these birds tattooed
on her hands here.

00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:03.163
Nightingales.

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.124
Good luck, birds.

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.044
I just,

00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:11.373
can't spend the rest of my life
running away with him.

00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:13.286
She don't care about nobody
but herself.

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:15.247
Are you stuck off on that island
because of her?

00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:20.013
- Mam, have you seen this man?
- No, sir.

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:21.640
Son, have you?

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.891
What did he do?

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:24.706
This river brings light trash down here.

00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:28.063
You got to know what's worth keeping
and what's worth letting go.

00:01:28.718 --> 00:01:29.981
You never said your name.

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:32.859
Mud. You can call me Mud.

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:36.988
I want to drag this boat into water.

00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:39.741
He's my best shot. I made a list
of things we're gonna need.

00:01:41.865 --> 00:01:43.338
You boys need to watch yourself.

00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.581
What Mud's into is something
you don't wanna be involved in.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.805
There are a lot of folks
looking for me.

00:01:50.752 --> 00:01:52.838
She's mine! You hear me, trash?
Where are they?

00:01:54.724 --> 00:01:57.421
- He's not dangerous.
- The state trooper think different.

00:01:57.828 --> 00:02:00.303
We're gonna pray for the death
of the men who killed my son.

00:02:01.263 --> 00:02:03.682
You have been good to me.
You're the only friend I got out here.

00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:06.518
You did it for her.
To protect her.

00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:10.605
- Don't expect any help from me.
- We got to much riding on this.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.026
- You know you don't know him, right?
- What have you been doing?!

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.403
Everything you told me was a lie!

00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:21.880
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it?

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.780
It's a hell of a thing.
