00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.220
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with a review of the Google Nexus

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.220
10.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.140
As Google’s first major competitor to the
full sized iPad the Nexus 10 has a

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.200
lot to offer but is it worth it?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.410
Take a look at the hardware and you’ll see
it’s

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.830
quite nice looking with the 10 inch display
up front and a soft touch back.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.650
There are several nice touches, for example
there are two front facing

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.939
speakers which do a significantly better job
with sound and the perfectly

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.470
sized bezel to rest your thumbs while using
the tablet.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.189
It’s also slightly
thinner and lighter than the iPad which while

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.789
not a huge difference is an
improvement nonetheless.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.589
The build quality is quite good for the most
part

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.719
although I’m not a fan of the back as the
tacky surface feels cheap and is an

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.090
absolute fingerprint magnet.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.989
You’ll find a full complement of ports including
a headphone jack, USB port along with HDMI

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.109
out hiding on the top right edge.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.649
The power and volume buttons are up top which
are a bit awkward to reach

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.440
for but it’s something you get used to pretty
quickly.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.879
The screen is excellent.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.989
With a resolution of 2560x1600 it’s sports
four times the pixels compared to

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.809
the Nexus 7 and even beats the iPad 4 on pure
resolution.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.429
In reality I can’t
notice a significant difference between the

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.460
iPad and Nexus 10 screens but
that’s not a bad thing at all: these are

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.980
by far some of the best looking screens
period.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.860
Text is incredibly sharp with lots of detail
even when viewing it up

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.860
close and even 1080p videos don’t take full
advantage of the screen.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.420
The
Nexus is running Android 4.2 Jellybean which

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.320
has a few new features like a
quick settings menu, multi-user support to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.690
share your tablet with other
people and a new keyboard which works like

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.240
Swype to speed up your typing.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.620
There’s also a new camera UI which is a
huge step up and allows you to

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.990
change settings extremely quickly instead
of digging through menus.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.680
Performance is generally very good, even with
pushing around a huge

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.910
amount of pixels the tablet stays nice and
smooth.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.040
You can run into issues
occasionally in some apps like Chrome but

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.600
overall it’s solid and the
benchmarks back this up.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.310
With a 1.7GHz Exynos 5 dual core processor
and 2GB

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.400
of RAM this delivers excellent scores thanks
to the brand new Cortex A15

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400
architecture.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.470
Gaming is no problem either with plenty of
horsepower for

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.850
even more graphically intense titles.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.800
Speaking of apps, this is by far the Nexus
10s biggest weakness.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.730
The Play Store has a good amount of apps,
most of

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.990
which work here but as far as apps made for
tablets the selection is almost

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.080
embarrassing.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.350
The Twitter app is a great example of this,
it’s nothing more

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.920
than a phone app comically stretched out on
the 10 inch screen.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.420
That’s not to
say there aren’t decent apps that work well

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.370
but compared to the iPad it’s a
major downside.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.370
Battery life is excellent.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.600
In my testing I was able to easily
make it through several days of casual use

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.130
although gaming does take a pretty
significant chunk out of the battery.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.640
For only $400 the Nexus 10 brings the
best of Android along with good hardware and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640
excellent specs.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.370
It’s
comfortable to use, has a spectacular screen

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.700
and plenty of battery life to last
for days.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.730
The poor app selection is a big issue but
that doesn’t stop the Nexus

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.780
10 from being by far the best 10 inch Android
tablet out there.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.240
