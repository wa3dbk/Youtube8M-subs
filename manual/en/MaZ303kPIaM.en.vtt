00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.820
Let's send a mail-merge letter to several
of our RealtyJuggler Contact records.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.820
I'll sign into RealtyJuggler, click on the
"Mail" icon, and then click on the "Mass Print

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.130
Letters" icon.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.640
For "Print Letters For", I'll select
"All Contacts Matching Show Category", which

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.029
means that I am going to print letters from
my Contacts database.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.640
If I wanted, I could print letters from the
Prospects database instead by changing this

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.040
drop-down.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.129
I next select the "Show Category" drop-down
in the upper-right corner of the screen.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.079
I'll select the category of "Buyer".

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.629
What should we do with Missing Addresses?
I'm going to "Skip any records with No

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.110
mailing address".
If you like, you can choose to print those

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.080
letters anyway, or you can skip any records
that have no email address.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.880
Typically, the "Sort Order for Letters"
is going to be alphabetical, but you can sort

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.520
your letters by Postal Code, as well.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.490
If I want, I can add a note to all of the
contact records, so I know that I printed

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.090
a letter.
Lets add a note saying that I sent a Prospecting

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.110
letter to these people.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.600
Finally, let's choose the letter to send.
We can use our own Custom letter, or use a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.009
letter from the Standard library by selecting
from this first drop-down.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.170
I'll choose the "Standard" template
library.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.170
I'll select one of the letters in the Standard
library.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.100
I'll choose, "Prospect - Looking for a fast
sale?", and I'll click on the "Download

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.060
Letters" button.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.020
RealtyJuggler does a mail merge with all of
the contacts I choose, and downloads all of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.600
those letters as a Microsoft Word document,
with each letter on a different page.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.980
Lets open that Microsoft Word document.
You can see that the letters have each person's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.650
contact information merged in.
I had installed a graphical letterhead earlier

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.810
and you can see that it is at the top of each
letter as well.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.800
Once I have my letters opened in Microsoft
Word, I can print the letters out.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.250
Additional information on how RealtyJuggler
works can be found by going to the "Main"

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.209
screen, and then clicking on the "YouTube
Video Tutorials icon here.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:54.200
A good follow-up video to watch would be Video
tutorial 42 which shows how to send bulk mail.
