00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.330
I absolutely love to flip and pitch.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.430
One of the things I think is always a question
on my mind is how long do I leave my bait

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.680
around that target or in that spot where I've
pitched the bait before I reel it in and make

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.430
another cast.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.770
I read an article on Tommy Biffle who is obviously
one of the legends of our sport and especially

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.520
one of the best ever to pick up a flipping
rod.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.239
He said the thing to do (especially in the
spring time when those fish are protecting

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.429
an area like a bed or anything) is he would
pitch up there and he would hop that bait

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.879
in place and not really moving it horizontally
but just shaking the rod tip.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.730
He would count on it 1-2-3-4 and wherever
he got that bite whether it was the 6th hop,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.070
6th shake of the rod, 10th, or 12th.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.590
This would tell him how long he should leave
that bait in the cover or in that spot before

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.950
he would reel in and make another cast.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.950
That would kind of give him a pattern within
a pattern.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.649
How long to leave that bait in the area before
moving it out and making another flip.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.439
You can be more efficient like that if you
know typically you've got to leave that bait

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.560
a little bit longer specially when the water
is colder before you reel it in and make another

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.560
flip or pitch.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.420
So that's something I always keep in mind.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.479
I'm not always counting it, but I'm always
trying to see how long to leave it in there.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.820
But the count method is good because it gives
us something to kind of focus on well we're

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.090
flipping and pitching everyone of these targets.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.130
Next time you're out there flipping check
that out.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.810
It definitely works and it's a great way to
keep your mind focused on what you're doing

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.630
as well so you're not wandering off mentally
and you're in tune with your bait wherever

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.420
it is in the cover.
