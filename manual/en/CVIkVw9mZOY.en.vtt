It's a wedding or mothers day and our next
guest is going to show us how we can

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.970
preserve those beautiful bouquets

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.420
to use as decorative centerpieces.  With me
now is Sally Strauss from ACTIVA

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.939
Sallie I'm so glad that you could come.  Thank
you Susan it's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.290
I understand you can show us about this
beautiful wedding bouquet.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.320
Yes, I would like to show you using

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.970
flower drying art Silica Gel 
how one

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.790
preserves a wedding bouquet.  And then
we're going I'm going to introduce you

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.829
to another exciting product Forever
Natural which preserves green leaves

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:49.670
and foliage.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.000
And...first I think lets just take
one flower and show you the steps from

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.960
beginning to end. Please do... You take your
fresh flower and it must be fresh-fresh.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.220
You're gonna cut the stem off, and
insert it

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.430
in a microwave-safe container,  in
about an inch and a half a Silica Gel.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.450
Then,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.479
slowly cover your flower.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.420
You want to be very careful you don't
really want to dump it from the can,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.939
because that can crush petals.  So if your
gently shake it,

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.790
and make it... and cover it completely.  And
in a microwave your drying time

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.540
is one to three minutes.  That's certainly a lot
faster than what we're used to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.340
in drying flowers.  Yes.. The conventional method is seven to ten
days.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.750
So you see the drying process is
lessened.  Once it is dry,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.150
ah... and the Silica Gel has cooled.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.110
You very slowly with a paint brush,
brush away the Silica.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.850
You take your flower out and if there is
any residue 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.170
still on the flower,  you very gently
brush it,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.590
and then and it will come right off.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
There is one thing

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.489
you've no stem.  What do you do?  That's
right... You take... Yes

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.720
you e...you can dry the stem and rewire
the stem or if you choose not to do

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.690
that use florist wire.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.070
And with florist tape you make a new

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.849
stem.  That's easy enough... That is very easy.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.069
Now all this information is in your
Magical Microwave Book.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.510
Yes... It has all the uses for Silica Gel, and
an all,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.640
all of the drying times and everything
appropriate for each flowers is that right?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.040
Yes, 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.330
absolutely there's a table that tells
you the specific amount of time for each

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.080
flower.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.550
Now one question that comes to my mind,
can we try out different types of

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.370
flowers

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.190
at the same time?  It is better if you not
to do it.   If your drying roses dry all

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.160
roses or dry all

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.370
ah, pansies or orchids you should
not mix them because obviously each one

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.129
has a different drying time.  Ok...

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.430
Now I see that you've used these dried
flowers in lots of different ways not

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.410
just putting together the wedding
bouquet again, I guess you just copy the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.349
original bouquet.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.290
But also by framing them and this is
certainly

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.379
a new wrinkle down here tell me about
that.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.400
If you're having to luncheon and it could
be for bridesmaids luncheon, it could be a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.159
Mother's Day,

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.900
any occasion.... you use dried flowers

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.840
as a napkin ring.   And with something

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.680
of that size, you really don't
necessarily need another huge

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.650
centerpiece.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.959
So its...It is so a beautiful!  A nice way with the tapestry ribbon it adds

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.780
a nice touch.  Ok so now when  we're done
drying flowers were going to preserve

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.390
greenery, is that right?  You're going to need some background foliage a filler material. 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.500
How do you get that?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.299
With forever Natural Foliage  Preserver.
And this

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.250
is a liquid that you heat to about a
hundred and thirty degrees.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.980
And you add this a... you take your
fresh green plant material.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.200
And if you're going to do individual
stems

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.230
and leaves,  you put it in a 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.799
ah... container because its warm so I

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.609
generally suggest a, you know, some sort
of the heat proof container.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.640
And you want to cover the foliage

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.460
with the Forever Natural.  Now please make
certain

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.479
that it is totally submerged.  So if a
leaf floats and I

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.580
purposely left this ivy leaf.  A...

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.870
what you'll want to do is to get a glass
jar or you could use a plate

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.240
or something and you want to weight your
foliage down.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.639
So that it stays underneath.  This is  
just are gonna stay green forever and

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.280
forever.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.320
It will become very soft and very
subtle, 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.240
and here's an example Susan of an
ivy leaf,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.690
and you can say it feels like a ladys
kid-glove. And,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.690
it will never dry or crack.  And they
are cured in seven days to three weeks.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.060
Well can I do it all on one stem,  or do I
have to do each leaf

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.660
at, at a time?  No,  you can do stemmed
material just crush it,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.699
and put it in the forever natural the stem,

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.419
and it works beautifully. Isn't that wonderful.  Sallie, thank you so much for coming in! You've

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.639
really brought a lot of wonderful ways to
use and preserved flowers.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.130
Thank you for having....
