00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.060
We're not done talking about OG clocks because
they're important for another reason. The

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.080
wooden works clocks even though we could make
them cheaply we couldn't export them very

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.930
successfully. Once you put a wooden works
clock on a boat going to England or going

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.720
anywhere else, that wood wheel is going to
swell and those clocks probably wouldn't work

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.499
by the time they got to where ever they were
going. Brass clocks on the other hand easy

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.590
to export. They're probably going to run fine
when they get there. Chance Jerome had the

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.519
idea of trying to export these to England.
England clearly had its own very large important

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:39.079
clock making industry but they weren't very
good at making inexpensive clocks. You could

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.670
get great clocks in England but they were
expensive and a lot of lower or middle class

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.949
people couldn't afford clocks. Chance Jerome
saw that as a business opportunity and he

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.539
began exporting OG clocks to England. England
at the time was worried as the other countries

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.539
are and have been about dumping, exports hurting
domestic industries and obviously the English

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.250
clock makers weren't happy about imported
OG clocks. The way the English dealt with

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.660
this was by seizing the imports, assuming
that they were being dumped and that they

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.800
were being sold under the cost of production.
So Chance Jerome just sent a boat load over,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.750
claimed that the clocks, that he was going
to sell them for 3 bucks. The English said

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.250
you must be selling these for under cost,
we're seizing the whole load and paying you

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.030
the 3 bucks each. Cost him about 2 dollars
each to make them so he was happy, sent another

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.640
boat load that got seized, he made a dollar
a clock. By the third boat load the English

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.950
figures out that maybe he wasn't dumping these
and that explains why in England even today

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.980
there's a lot of OG clocks. If you go to boot
fairs and antique shows in England you'll

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.670
likely see a number of American OG clocks.
There are also a number of, number of books

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.810
on this subject as well but here these two
are really a book by Chance Jerome about his,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.500
about his years as a clock maker and book
about Chance Jerome by Chris Bailey who is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.970
one of the countries experts really on American
clocks, who's the curator down in a museum

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.450
down in Connecticut that we'll talk about
later.
