00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:04.414
(fast paced, high energy techno music)

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:11.149
- Good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.301
It's truly a privilege to
have all of you here today

00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:16.548
for a very special announcement.

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:18.881
(applause)

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:21.311
Our President, James F. Barker.

00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:23.873
- We thought we ought to
make this announcement

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:26.490
in a very important
place, and Bowman Field,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.450
and this circle, and this statue behind me

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.178
are dear to the hearts
of every Clemson person.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:34.954
We are very fortunate and very proud

00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:37.323
to be able to announce today the launch

00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:39.515
of the public and national phase

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:42.586
of The Will to Lead: A
Campaign for Clemson.

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:45.767
As of today, the gifts and commitments

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.085
to our campaign exceed

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:49.752
433 million dollars.

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:53.930
(applause)

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.453
Now, we call this
campaign The Will to Lead

00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:59.011
because our founder, Thomas Green Clemson,

00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:01.064
created this institution through

00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:03.225
his last will and testament.

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:07.004
He had a fierce determination
to improve education

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.436
and prosperity for all South Carolinians.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:13.132
He spent his lifetime
demonstrating that commitment

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:15.572
to bring Clemson
University into existence.

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:17.997
Our mission has been and always will be

00:01:17.997 --> 00:01:20.941
intellectual development for our students,

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:24.337
economic development for
our state and nation.

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:26.743
Fortunately, for us,
we have a whole family

00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:30.698
of alumni, donors, investors,
faculty, staff, and students

00:01:30.698 --> 00:01:33.853
all whom understand the vital importance

00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:35.235
of Clemson's mission.

00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:38.029
The goal of The Will to Lead campaign

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:39.946
is 600 million dollars.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.710
(applause)

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:50.572
- It's a very very big day,
a very great day for Clemson.

00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:52.922
- It's a wonderful thing, 600 million.

00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:54.994
If you look at the past campaigns,

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:57.423
it's more than we've ever raised before,

00:01:57.423 --> 00:01:59.210
all the previous campaigns combined.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.993
So, it's amazing.

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:02.710
- I love the fact that it's concentrated

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.956
on the core values at Clemson:

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:07.789
students and faculty, more facilities.

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.123
We'll have better
students, better faculty,

00:02:10.123 --> 00:02:12.068
and that's how Clemson's going to grow.

00:02:12.068 --> 00:02:15.134
Not just in number, but in quality.

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.736
- It's going to be amazing.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:19.151
I know it's a lofty
goal, but I have no doubt

00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:20.723
Clemson people will come through,

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:21.903
because that's just what we do.

00:02:21.903 --> 00:02:22.878
It's going to make a difference

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:26.378
in a lot of lives when we reach that goal.

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:31.404
- There's so many students
that will be impacted,

00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:34.053
you know all deserving of scholarships

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.890
and things that this capital
campaign is going to provide.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.138
- We love Clemson!

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:39.951
- We love Clemson!

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.278
If we've ever needed money, it's now.

00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:43.677
- It will enable us to attract

00:02:43.677 --> 00:02:45.494
some of the best faculty members.

00:02:45.494 --> 00:02:47.718
It will enable us to offer scholarships

00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:49.568
to some of the best
and brightest students.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:51.085
And it will, I think, really spur

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:53.053
economic development for this state

00:02:53.053 --> 00:02:54.893
because we really need to keep

00:02:54.893 --> 00:02:57.685
some of our best resources,
which are students,

00:02:57.685 --> 00:02:59.506
in the state of South Carolina.

00:02:59.506 --> 00:03:01.092
- We love Clemson!

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:02.092
- Go Tigers!

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.231
- We are thrilled to be able to give back,

00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:07.935
and hopefully make a difference
in someone else's life

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:11.326
to help them realize their
dreams and their goals.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:12.998
- We want their education
to be just as good

00:03:12.998 --> 00:03:14.990
as ours was when we were here.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.900
We're better.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.182
- The people that are here need support,

00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:20.098
and they really need it in a big way

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:23.121
because they've really dedicated
their lives to these kids.

00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:24.516
- It's an opportunity, certainly I think,

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:26.372
to be able to hire new faculty,

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.165
and to bring in really
top-notch faculty, but also

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:32.149
to retain many of the faculty
that we currently have.

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.047
I think students are
going to benefit greatly

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.062
from the campaign.

00:03:36.062 --> 00:03:37.983
- The capital campaign will make us

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:39.902
that world-class university.

00:03:39.902 --> 00:03:43.103
- We look at this as a continuation

00:03:43.103 --> 00:03:47.165
of a life-long commitment
to this university.

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:49.498
Clemson has come a long ways

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.896
in the last few years,

00:03:52.896 --> 00:03:55.711
and it's just beginning.

00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:59.396
(fast paced rock music)

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:03.563
- C-L-E-M-S-O-N T-I-G-E-R-S,

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.971
fight Tigers, fight Tigers,
fight, fight, fight!

00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:10.304
(applause)
