Hello everybody, I'm Idil. Welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:07.308
We're making cacao banana muffins today.

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:10.648
You guys have been asking for a good muffin recipe a lot lately.

00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:14.757
I also like muffins very much, especially with coffee.

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:18.735
Muffins are very easy to make. I love the flavor or cacao and bananas in them.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.865
We will also add some chocolate chips.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:27.821
I like this recipe very much. It's not too sweet because of the banana. Banana balances the flavor of sugar.

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:32.125
I think it's an ideal muffin recipe.Let's have a look at the ingredients.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:42.500
100 gr sugar (8 tbsp) 200 ml milk

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:48.533
165 gr flour (1 cup). 25 grams Cacao.

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.625
2 eggs. We're using both yolk and the white of the eggs.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:57.472
3 tbsp butter (melted). A banana. I crushed it with a fork.

00:00:57.672 --> 00:01:03.940
a teaspoon of baking powder. Very little cinnamon. Like a half of a teaspoon.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.482
And some chocolate chips (approx 1 tbsp) to dress the muffins.

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:15.316
First of all, whisk the eggs, butter and milk together.

00:01:15.516 --> 00:01:18.261
All of the liquid ingredients.

00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:25.844
The milk is at room temperature and the butter too.

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:32.664
Add the butter.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.611
And the milk.

00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:45.000
Whisk everything for a minute until everything becomes blended.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.654
Yes everything is blended.

00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:54.649
Let me put the mixer aside.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.630
Now add the flour. Sift it in. Let me take the sieve.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.231
Sift also the cacao powder.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.877
Add also the sugar and everything except the banana.

00:02:34.077 --> 00:02:39.792
Now add baking powder. These packages are only 10 grams.

00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:44.268
And one package is ideal for this recipe.

00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:46.968
OK.

00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:54.577
Add just a little cinnamon. We won't get the taste of cinnamon, but it well enhance the cacao taste.

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:59.905
And now beat everything till blended.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.893
Finally we add the banana.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:25.184
I crushed the banana. We just want everything to be completely blended.

00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:29.313
A 30-40 seconds more with the banana.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.081
The batter is ready. It's in the texture of a cake.

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:46.367
Now let’s pour them in muffin cups. Then bake them. And they will be ready.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.965
I bought these cups from IKEA. I buy them whenever I go and store them.

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:59.151
The trick here is to fill the cups completely.

00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:05.031
If you don't, the muffins will not puff up. That's why you should fill them up to the brim.

00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:07.885
Now, fill all the cups.

00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:16.322
There are 6 completely filled cups and one half filled.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:24.255
I put it too to show you how it's not puffing up if you don't fill it completely.

00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:27.000
Finally put some chocolate chips on the muffins.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.232
A few are enough. I want them to look nice and fancy.

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:37.949
And I think the more chocolate, the merrier.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.530
If you don't have chocolate chips at home, you don't have to do this part.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.598
Put the muffins in a preheated oven at 180C (356F). Turn your fan off.

00:04:54.798 --> 00:05:01.600
They are baked in my oven in 20 minutes. After they're baked, I'll show you how they should look like.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.329
The muffins have been baked for 20 minutes.

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.872
They are puffed up well. They seem very lovely.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:27.000
When you find this texture, it's done. It took me 20 minutes.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.014
It depends on your oven. The one that we didn’t fill completely is less puffed up.

00:05:33.214 --> 00:05:36.286
I like the muffins when they're puffed up well.

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:42.999
That's why I think filling the cups completely is an important point. They're too hot. Let me taste it.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.147
I can't bite because I'm afraid I will burn!

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.759
This is an amazing recipe. The flavor of the banana comes slightly. The sugar is balanced with the banana.

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:07.028
It's absolutely not a very sweet muffin.

00:06:07.228 --> 00:06:11.967
On the contrary, it's a light muffin. I hope you try this recipe at home.
