00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.270
I'm Travis Steglich with Steglich Farm Supply
Incorporated and we are going to do a float

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.090
test on these acorns that we picked up while
ago. Supposedly the acorns that will germinate

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.640
are the best germinaters will sink. The ones
that float have air in them or they don't

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.920
have enough moisture, not solid enough so
therefore they float and are not likely to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:30.920
come up. So we are just going to take the
Live Oak acorns, the Burr Oaks and the Spanish

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.570
Oak acorns and we are just going to dump them
in here and see which ones float. We will

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.969
pour off the floating ones and leave the sinking
ones in the bottom. You can see just a multitude

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:51.300
of them have floated and so what we will do
is I will slowly pour off the floaters, oops,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.870
well I said I would. Those are floaters anyway.
The sinkers are on the bottom and I will pour

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.289
out the ones that float, the majority and
I will take off the rest of them by hand.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:18.270
We will be able to see the ones laying on
the bottom. There is not very many. There

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:37.919
appears to be like 4 of the Burr Oaks and
oh a dozen of the Live Oaks. None of the Spanish

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:49.999
Oaks have floated. We will put these back
in there. I am going to pick up these because

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:57.789
we are going to plant especially the Spanish
Oaks, I know that some of those will come

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:05.911
up and I know that a lot of these Burr Oaks
will probably come up. So we are going to

00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:09.539
see. We are going to take them back and we
are going to pot them and see how many of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.310
them actually come up.
