Hey Space Cadets!

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:13.130
I'm gonna show you guys a trick which is a
variation on a trick that already exists called

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.769
The Typhoon.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.730
It's also known as a Vortex Break.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.140
It looks like this.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.080
Um.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.439
And my version, instead of having the break
at the bottom of the vortex you have the break

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.560
at the top of the vortex.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.960
So, because it's a reversal of a trick called
The Typhoon, I'm gonna call it The Hurricane.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.710
Or you can just call it a Reverse Vortex Break,
but, that's kind of a mouthful, so.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.710
uh.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:53.199
Yeah I'll just show you what that looks like.

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.789
Okay?

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.100
And let's do that again in slow motion maybe?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.100
Yeah.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.100
So let me break it down.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.340
You have your hoop, you're hooping.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:22.840
I hoop to the left, but I'll show you to the
right as well after this.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
Pull it up.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.450
And then with your other hand that you would
be pulling it down with usually, grab on the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.799
outside of the hoop and stop it.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.350
And then pull it back down.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.020
So let's do that in the other direction.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.790
This hand.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.430
Pull it up.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.430
Grab.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.079
Back down.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.079
Up.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.079
Grab.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.079
Down.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.079
Up.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.079
Grab.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.079
Down.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.079
Grab.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.079
Grab.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.079
Grab.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.670
Bam. Bam. Bam.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.659
And if that's hard for you, pretty much like
every vortex move, you can make it easier

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.190
by turning in the same direction as the hoop.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.720
So um I'll demonstrate that.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.020
Ta-da!

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.450
I hope you guys appreciated that, if this
trick has already been invented by someone

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.150
else, I'm sorry I've never seen it before.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.900
If you have any questions about it go ahead
and leave a comment aaaand subscribe if you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.900
like me!

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.900
wuhhhhhhh.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.900
Are we done?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.760
Let's be done.
