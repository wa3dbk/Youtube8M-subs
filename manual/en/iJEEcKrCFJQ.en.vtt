00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.170
In 1859 Charles Robert Darwin published "On
the Origin of Species".

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.879
Which contained the most compelling evidence
to ever support the theory of evolution.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.750
Since then Darwin's theory has been widely
accepted within the scientific community.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.190
If Darwin is to be believed, it took the human
race 6 million years to evolve from chimpanzees

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.510
to modern day homo sapiens.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.560
But will human's ever evolve again?

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.000
Or has the human race reached its physical
and mental peak?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.780
Let's find out.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.820
Many skeptics argue that humans have reached
their evolutionary peak.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.710
Because evolution is about a species adapting
itself to its environment.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.239
But humans have learnt to adapt the environment
to us.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.720
For example, instead of the body having to
adapt to living in a cold climate we instead

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.400
build a house around us and install heating.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.110
And there you go, instant warmth, with no
further evolution needed.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.820
Thousands of years ago humans evolved to run
faster and see further away in the distance

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.330
to aid us when hunting animals.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.880
But now we buy our food from the shop, and
we don't need to run anywhere because we have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.880
cars.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.540
We also don't need to see long distances because
we spend all day staring at computer screens.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.850
So based on this, the rules of evolution state
that humans have no further need to evolve

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.700
and therefore will never evolve again.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.640
There's also the issue of modern medicine.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.350
As wonderful as it is, it does prohibit evolution.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.700
Before modern medicine the weak would die
out and only the strongest and fittest would

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.630
pass on their genes to the next generation.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.510
However today, weak individuals who previously
wouldn't have survived a disease or an injury,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.950
now survive, thanks to modern medicine.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.600
The downside to this is that their weak genes
get passed on, just as much as those with

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.030
strong genes.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.880
This essentially makes the theory of "survival
of the fittest" null and void in the modern

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.880
day.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.220
But all that sounds awfully boring!

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.840
Some leading anthropologists entertain another
school of thought which is far more titillating.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.460
They believe that there are ways we can, and
will evolve in the modern world, and the results

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.940
will be quite shocking.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.260
And it's not just speculation, there is hard
proof that humans are still evolving.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.879
A study by the evolutionary biology team at
Yale university revealed that due to the size

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.730
and shape of their ovaries, shorter and slightly
plumper women tend to have more children than

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.270
their taller, skinny counterparts.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.530
This is an example of evolution happening
right under our noses.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.530
Many scientists agree that if we do evolve
in the near future the first thing that will

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.480
change will be the size of our brains.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.060
The biggest evolutionary changes have come
from the brain, such as abstract thinking

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.209
which led us to new inventions, and of course
language.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.030
So it makes sense that in our modern world
where information rules, the brain will be

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.150
the next thing to evolve.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.459
But can our brains, physically, get any larger?

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.459
Well the biggest factor that has limited human
brain size up until now has been the birthing

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.959
process.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.710
Baby's heads must be able to fit through the
birth canal, which has stopped their brains

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.040
from growing any larger in the womb.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.870
But with the massive rise in Caesarian sections
in recent years, this could all be about to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.870
change.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.940
Today, over 50% of babies in China are delivered
via C-section.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.750
And of course a C-section means no more limits
on the size a babies head can grow.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.470
Some anthropologists believe this growing
C-section trend could give way to babies being

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.400
born with increasingly larger brains and heads
in the future.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.220
Some theorise that in a few generations down
the line, humans could have huge heads and

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.940
scrawny bodies, just like aliens in science
fiction films.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.129
But what about our physical appearance?

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.900
Surely there's no further need for humans
to evolve any more in this respect?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.310
Well there isn't a need in terms of survival,
but scientists think in the future we will

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.339
evolve to look different nevertheless.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:24.330
This is because, more so than ever before,
males are choosing their sexual partners based

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.509
on looks and intelligence levels as opposed
to their ability to produce healthy offspring.

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.839
Therefore, more attractive and more intelligent
females will get more chances to reproduce

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.879
and pass on their genes.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.900
The consequence of this is that the human
race will ultimately evolve to be smarter

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.289
and well, generally more pleasant to look
at.

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.740
This type of selection based on attractiveness,
does of course happen with both genders, but

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.490
research has shown it's considerably more
prominent amongst males.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.969
This is a newly emerging evolutionary phenomenon
which scientists refer to as "artificial selection"

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.409
as opposed to "natural selection".

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.970
Because it's no longer mother nature and our
environment that chooses how we evolve, it's

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.189
now humans themselves who are deciding which
genes get passed on and which don't.

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.629
But natural selection isn't dead just yet.

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.419
Our environment still poses a massive risk
to us.

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:31.080
As the population of the human race increases
and we become a more globalised community,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.110
traveling back and forth to every corner of
the planet.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.000
We are spreading pathogens easier and quicker
than ever before.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.979
Biologists predict that were going to get
a lot more virus epidemics in the coming years

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:50.159
and huge chunks of the population with weak
immune systems and poor access to modern healthcare

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.439
will be killed off.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:56.809
The result of this is that humans will evolve
to have stronger immune systems naturally

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:01.770
and become less dependant on medicine and
the global life expectancy will rise.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.279
But changes such as this will take thousands
of years before we really start to notice

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.869
the difference.

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:13.789
So yes, humans are still only in their infancy
when it comes to evolution.

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.419
There's a lot more weird and wacky mutations
to come in the future.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.369
But there's one thing you can guarantee, the
human race a million years from now will look

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:31.499
remarkably different and function in completely
different ways than they do today.
