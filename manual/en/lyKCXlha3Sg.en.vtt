Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to take a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.840
few minutes and show you how to make pot roast.
Next up, celery. And you're probably going

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.762
to be asking me, man why did you get such
ugly celery? You can see this celery is a

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:18.990
little narly looking on the end. First of
all, I can cut that off. That end is no longer

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.010
narly looking. But you can see there's a couple
of nicks in it and it's kind of scratched

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.660
up over here. Reason why, is because I believe
the only time you should use really attractive

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.801
produce, it's you know, physically attractive
is if it's important to the dish. This is

00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.920
going to get cut up so small in the dish,
we're talking like little slices, that it's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.780
going to cook out and it's going to turn into
you know, it's going to turn into a texture

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.390
and flavor ingredient. Not a primary visual
appeal ingredient like the potato or the carrot

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.010
or the beef. So, it doesn't matter if I use
a piece of celery that's got a nick in the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.050
back or it's got a dent over here. So what
we're going to do is we're going to take our

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.930
celery and we're going to cut it from top
to bottom, just like that. We're going to

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.230
split the rib, all the way up. Then we're
going to flip it around like we did the carrot.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.051
Same kind of rule, same rule applies. And
then, I'll just cut all these at once just

00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:20.250
to make things go faster. So we're just going
to go with a nice, I go for a nice diagonal

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.060
cut just to make it look a little bigger,
just add a little depth to our dish. But for

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.780
the most part, woopsie, we're just going to
go with something kind of small. The reason

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.440
being that, like I said, this isn't, this
is an aromatic. This is going to be like your

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.820
onion. This isn't going to be something you're
going to seek out in the dish and get a big

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.790
bite of celery and go Um that's some tasty
celery! You know, something like this is fine

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.080
because as this cooks out along with our onion,
it's going to become one of the base flavors

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.830
of the dish. It's not going to become you
know, a primary part of the dish. So with

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.150
that being said, let's put our celery aside
and and I've got some potatoes I've got to

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.680
cut up next. So, on with the potatoes.
