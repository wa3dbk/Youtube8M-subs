00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.559
 and giving heat with a candle as I have I in this case 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:27.358
 you can use it to consecrate candles in rituals that have to do 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.189

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.339

 if things go wrong financially you you you can spread through the body 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.300
 and you can even throw him in the water to clean the floor 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.189
 if you have a business and the business does not work very well 

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.250
 good because this oil is to attract good fortune 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.990
 to attract money 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.469
 like all rituals have represented 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.969
 the air 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.479
 the fire 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.500
 water and land 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.769
 and kingdoms, the vegetable kingdom 

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:07.439
 the mineral kingdom 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.459
 and the animal kingdom with this pen 

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.509
 and materials that will be needed for this ritual 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.400
 this ritual 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.690
 It is to have a white candle 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:17.959
 one white candle 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:21.109
 that have to be turned on whom you're asking are you 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.950
 can be 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.200
 lady luck 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.090
 may be the archangel Uriel, may be the universe 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.840
 giving light a candle to that force 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.549
 this force that you're asking, we'll need to do this 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.850
 this oil 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.069
 a cinnamon stick if these big 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.709
 one, if small three 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.739
 remember that everything has to be in odd numbers 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:45.709
 one or three or five or seven 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.309
 all also it depends on how big it is going to be the bottle 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.950
 where we go to make oil 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.409
 cinnamon we use it because it is a symbol 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.009
 is a symbol of luck is a symbol of well-being 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.149
 and furthermore also 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.650
 the economic situation is very good cinnamon, cast 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.790
 three sheets 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.949
 laurel representing success triumph 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.519
 We use 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.879
 three grains 

00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:17.108
 of coffee 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.319
 represents 

00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:22.288
 a sharp mind 

00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:27.678
 so that we have an open mind, the mind wakes up to find that 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.028
 work or to find that situation we 

00:02:31.028 --> 00:02:34.959
 do earn that money we need and possibly want 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.338
 incense must be natural incense is not worth 

00:02:38.338 --> 00:02:43.609
 not worth the wand or incense cone has to be natural incense 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:50.609
 in this case we would use a pinch 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.899
 also we use 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:03:00.899
 a pinch of saffron is also a symbol of wealth and welfare 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.739
 also we use 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.058
 white quartz 

00:03:06.058 --> 00:03:08.348
 as the bottle has 

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:10.418
 has very small mouth then 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.669
 quartz stone will not go, then I will use 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.259
 three small stones 

00:03:18.258 --> 00:03:20.148
 quartz, a quartz longer have 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:21.989
 cleansed 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.929
 and loaded 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:28.158
 down'll leave a link where I say as cleaned and loaded 

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.138
 amulets, plus 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.229
 also use 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:34.859
 Three types of essences 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.109
 essence cedar 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.459
 patchouli oil 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.789
 and orange essence 

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.178
 and to finish filling the pot 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.558
 we have to use almond oil, the almond oil 

00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:50.748
 comes in handy for the body is very nutritious then why 

00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:54.989
 It can be used even to take that oil poderte 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.128
 in the body, with all these elements 

00:03:57.128 --> 00:04:00.098
 what we do is 

00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:06.468
 we break well 

00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:08.718
 and we put 

00:04:08.718 --> 00:04:15.538
 within this small boat 

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.620
 We put the laurel 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.548
 the cinnamon 

00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:25.528
 we put the saffron 

00:04:25.528 --> 00:04:28.098
 coffee grains 

00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:30.378
 we put the incense 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.599
 quartz crystals 

00:04:33.598 --> 00:04:35.199
 once we've gotten 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.189
 all these elements within 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.400
 we need to take 

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.299
 the essence 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.728
 first orange essence 

00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:50.188
 the whole small boat 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:57.189

00:05:05.418 --> 00:05:06.588
 the essence 

00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:13.588
 cedar 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.639
 and we ended up filling the little boat up 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:29.639
 almond oil 

00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:38.649
 close the pot 

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:44.989
 shake it well 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.819
 oil with all 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.939
 elements within 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:55.229
 once we have the oil prepared uncover what 

00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:57.889
 and alumbramos 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.978
 with three white candles 

00:05:59.978 --> 00:06:04.028
 need not be large candles can servelas small 

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.569
 forming a triangle 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.338
 and oil in the center 

00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:13.978
 and we light the candles with wooden matches 

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:20.978
 starting from the vertex is above 

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:26.490
 and you leave the oil 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.228
 and uncapped 

00:06:28.228 --> 00:06:30.389
 with candles forming the triangle 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.490
 until the candles burn completely 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.900
 once the candles have been completely consumed and can 

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:40.769
 use this oil, well, oil is already prepared 

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:41.949
 I've posted here 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.709
 It puts up a sign that oil fortune with a green symbol lazito is 

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:46.649
 money 

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:49.348
 and with the passage of time 

00:06:49.348 --> 00:06:53.918
 oil anger will change color, taking the color of coffee, azafran 

00:06:53.918 --> 00:06:57.288
 because every time you do get you your needed a little 

00:06:57.288 --> 00:07:00.288
