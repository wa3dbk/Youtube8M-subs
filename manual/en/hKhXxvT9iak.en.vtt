00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:15.570
Phew, you sure got to climb a lot of steps to get to this capitol building here in Washington.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.859
But I wander who that sad little scrap of paper is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.779
I'm just a bill! Oh yes! I'm only a bill

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.919
just trying to get through on
capitol hill. I thought the power of my ideas

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.819
would carry the deal

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.199
but i've been told that it doesn't work that way

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.700
Cuz the lobby game has come to town, with lots of money to pay

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.580
To pay

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.520
They hail from K Street, with influential thoughts

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.150
that roomies and TV spots

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.680
Hired to make opinions sway

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.199
now red or blue

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.670
their parties are sustained

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.390
Listen to all that noise

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.540
who are they all arguing about

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.880
That's my friend health care reform

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.110
He wanted to ensure the masses

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.790
He was a bill yes only a bill

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.260
but lobbiers spent 700 mill

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.810
to give their ideas some extra clout

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.870
and now the 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.340
result of public option is out

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.600
Oh no that's awful!

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.740
You think that's bad? Wall st lobbyist have Main st deranged.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.700
Half a billion later, regulations unchanged

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.689
They meet for tea and say

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.430
no to taxes

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.649
Some say they have

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.570
caused financial collapses

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.599
you know what's funny 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.750
even with all that money, they can't rob your ballot, your vote keeps their jobs

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.430
Yeah a bill is just a bill, 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.440
but your vote

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.070
can get it through

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.490
With strong public will

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.740
Hold your reps accountable, you have a say
