00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.580
Hey Everybody, I'm here today with my good
friend Vanessa and what we're going to show

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.500
you how to make is an all natural tinted lip
balm - it is absolutely to die for, it moisturizes

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.480
the lips, there is some really nourishing
product in it and the tint makes it really

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.390
nice so it can replace your lipstick, your
lip gloss and Vanessa is going to show you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.520
everything that we need to make it.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.359
It's a fantastic gift for your friends, we
will get going.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:33.500
Items you will need to make the lip balm include
some little jam jars or even left-over cosmetic

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.170
containers, you will also need some coco butter
chips, these are very inexpensive.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.551
To add a scent to the lip balm, I've chosen
a 100% pure peppermint essential oil, some

00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:54.950
beeswax, again very inexpensive, to add color
to the lip balm we are using red beet soluble

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:03.960
crystals, you will also need coconut oil,
some olive oil, and also a double boiler.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.320
And Vanessa is going to show us the amounts
that we need for everything and how we prepare

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.320
it.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:26.920
Great, so we put in three tablespoons of olive
oil, and we are going to use two tablespoons

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:40.350
of coconut oil, and we're also going to use
about 15 grams of the coco butter chips, approximately

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.650
10 of these little chips.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.220
Where did you find these?

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.560
At a health food store.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.080
And then we're going to use about 15 grams
of beeswax.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:06.180
You're looking at a thumb size chunk of beeswax.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.860
I'm just going to cut it in slightly smaller
pieces to help along the melting process.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.440
And this must be an essential part of the
lip balm.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.790
Yes, this is what is going to solidify it.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.530
And then from there we are going to melt this
down and once it is melted we'll add in the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.590
essential oil and the beet crystal.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.360
Alright, let's get her cooking.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.570
So you need about an inch of water in the
bottom of your pot and then put your bowl

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:47.850
over it and put it on medium heat until it
starts to boil.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:03:01.430
Show them what that looks like.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.450
So it all melted and has come together now
and it's starting to cool so it is hardening

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.720
back up again.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.800
What we're going to do now is just put a couple
of drops of peppermint oil (optional) and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:29.430
the 
last ingredient is going to be the beet crystals.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.459
So we're actually just going to dissolve it
first and i'm going to start with two teaspoons

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.270
and then we're going to just add a little
bit of water in, you really don't need very

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.530
much to dissolve it.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:52.160
We can do like a quarter of a teaspoon of
water and we're just going to mix it up until

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.580
it's a nice smooth liquidy paste.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.440
It's starting to come together, it is such
a beautiful color.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.230
We're just going to add the color.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:19.590
This is obviously good to do when the lip
balm base is still warm.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.930
I picked this one for you, I noticed it's
your favorite.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.960
Can we call it Katie Stiles Lip Balm?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960
We can!

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.580
There should be a high demand for it.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.850
So then I guess this is probably a good time
to fill the jars, before it solidifies.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.100
So Vanessa came up with some really good ideas
for containers for the lip balm -- this is

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.920
one of the cutest because it is a great gift
size.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.380
Vanessa will show you how she skillfully fills
them.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.220
She is using like a wide popsicle stick.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:09.880
It just makes them so much easier 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.880
to fill.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.440
Do you keep them uncovered?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.500
No you can just put the top on.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.530
And then what I would do for gifts is I would
put little labels on it and call them Katie

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.500
Stiles Berry Kiss or something like that.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.580
That is awesome.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.310
Thank you for sharing your secret!

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.620
I'm going to run with it and with the rest
of my youtubers as well.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.630
I really appreciate it.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.250
It smells delicious!
