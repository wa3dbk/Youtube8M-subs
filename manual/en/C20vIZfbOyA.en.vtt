00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A lot of the brain games that are on the website, they can't hurt.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They're fun to play, they do stimulate the brain.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Many of them are not scientifically based.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They're kind of intuitively based and developed by people who develop computer games.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Again, they don't hurt; they stimulate the brain.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you're looking for something that's going to be more therapeutic,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you need to do some research to find out what the science and the evidence is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
behind the brain games, and I would also suggest that you do that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in conjunction with a cognitive rehabilitation specialist

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because the particular skills that your daughter may need to work on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
are going to be very specific.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And obviously, games that are out there for the general public on the Web

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
are fairly general.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They improve memory.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But if you're not sure exactly why your daughter is having trouble with memory,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
then the games may not be addressing specifically what her issues are.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
They do have a role and a purpose

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
because, as I said, they do keep your brain moving,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
they help you work on some tasks in between.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I would not do it instead of cognitive rehabilitation;

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I would do it in conjunction with a cognitive rehabilitation therapist.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And I would also be very careful to not let her use computer-based cognitive games

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
as a substitute for interacting with the world,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
engaging in other rehab activities, social activities, getting back involved.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It becomes very easy, especially for teenagers,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to get sucked into the Internet world,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
so I certainly wouldn't allow her to do that for hours on end.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You still want to have her engage in other activities and engage in the world

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and socialize with people and learn new skills and all that kind of thing.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So as a piece of the total picture, they can't hurt.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Some of them may help.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The research is kind of equivocal on how helpful they are therapeutically,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but it certainly is something that keeps people's interest 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and does stimulate the brain and does keep the cells moving

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in the absence of anything else.
