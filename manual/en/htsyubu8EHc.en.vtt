00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.570
Today we're going to show you techniques on
how to properly tie-down the bow &amp; stern of

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.250
a canoe or kayak on the roof of your vehicle.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.130
To reduce the chance of serious damage to
vehicles and/or cargo, it is imperative to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.990
tie-down any type of cargo extending past
your vehicles windshield and rear window.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.590
Before using bow &amp; stern tie-downs, it is
important to properly secure the canoe or

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.470
kayak to your vehicles roof rack system. Please
Note that Bow &amp; Stern tie downs are NOT to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.140
be used as a stand alone tie down system.For
this demonstration we will be tying down a

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.539
kayak with ratcheting bow &amp; stern tie downs.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.020
When tying down the bow, use a secure point
on the front of your canoe or kayak and a

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.420
secure point on the front of the vehicle.
We will be using the grab handles on the front

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.199
of our kayak and the tow hooks on the front
of our vehicle.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.280
Please Note that you should NEVER attach the
tie downs to plastic parts of your vehicle.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.840
Keep the tie downs loose yet snug. Over tightening
can damage your vehicle and/or kayak.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.640
If you don’t have a secure point on the
front of your vehicle to tie down to, Hood

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.399
Loop Straps can be used as an alternative
solution.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.570
Each hood loop simply attaches to an available
bolt head located under your hood.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.520
An advantage to using Hood Loop Straps is
that they can be permanently attached to your

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.659
vehicle.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.140
Once properly installed, close the hood with
the loop strap exposed. Now you can use the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:02:02.600
hood loop as your secure bow tie down point.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.310
When tying down the stern, use a secure point
on the rear of your canoe or kayak and a secure

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.730
point on the rear of the vehicle. We will
be using the grab handles on the rear of our

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.220
kayak and the chain loops on the hitch of
our vehicle.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.190
Keep the tie downs loose yet snug. Over tightening
can damage your vehicle and/or kayak.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.170
Once secure, tie up any extra slack.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.470
If you don’t have a secure point on the
rear of your vehicle to tie down to, Quick

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.250
Loop Straps can be used as an alternative
solution.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.470
Simply pop the hatch or trunk and lay the
Rubber side of the Quick Loop inside. Close

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.750
the hatch or trunk and the Quick Loop Strap
is installed.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.720
Now, secure the Stern tie down strap, tie
up any extra slack, and your ready for the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:00.150
road.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.000
For added safety check the tie-downs after
driving the first 5 to 15 miles and every

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.370
25 miles after to ensure that they are still
properly secured and that the kayak or canoe

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.480
hasn’t moved.
