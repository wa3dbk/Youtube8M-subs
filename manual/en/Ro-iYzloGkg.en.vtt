Well CGR viewers, this is Gabe from Undertow,
and today’s review marks my final day at

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:25.380
Classic Game Room before I head off to college.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.470
I decided to do a game that, like my upcoming
experience, is completely new to me.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.360
The Gauntlet series has become a classic hack
and slasher with tons of pop-culture references

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.540
in both movies and television shows, and I
thought that it would be great to give this

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.930
one a try before I head out.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.640
I was pleasantly surprised to find that this
game is a difficult but rewarding experience

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.290
that has a great old-school feel to it.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.460
This is Gauntlet: Dark Legacy for the GameCube.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:00.960
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy was originally an arcade
game before getting ported to different home

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.780
consoles, and it feels like it.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.740
You start off by choosing any color of a variety
of character classes like archer and a dwarf

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.470
who looks like Mr. T in junior high.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.950
You’re then sent into a level as you progress
through waves of enemies and collect items

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.020
like keys to help you make it to the end.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.790
Unlike more modern western RPG’s, Dark Legacy
is a game that really feels like it wants

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.040
you to play it in short spurts, emphasized
by its sort of “drop in” gameplay style,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.880
instead of trying to play it for hours and
hours at a time.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.759
Throughout each level, there are also little
scrolls of paper that give you vague hints

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.080
of what’s to come, and this adds a fun tension
to the experience.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.770
Along with a sort of stripped down RPG style
that Dark Legacy uses, it also features a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.570
fairly simple control scheme.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.330
The A button is for a weaker attack and the
Y button uses a stronger attack, while X is

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.140
for magic and B is for a block that’s really
hard to use.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.429
Different abilities can be earned by moving
through levels, and choosing where and when

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.240
to use each one is easily the best part of
the combat.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.911
The game can get a tad button-mashy at times,
but boss fights, especially when you’re

00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.110
using the sorceress like I was, usually require
you to do some kiting so you don’t get absolutely

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.860
destroyed.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.750
In addition, pieces of food are scattered
throughout the level to raise your health

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.200
in tough situations.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.980
The game can go from being fairly easy to
extremely tough in a matter of seconds, and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.340
busting up barrels and opening chests to find
a piece of fruit or a steak also adds to the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.340
excitement.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.200
However, poison food items and explosives
are also available and these can be a pretty

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.500
big middle finger to you if you’re desperate
for some health.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.360
But hey, that’s kind of what old school
games are about.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.780
For a GameCube game, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy
doesn’t exactly amaze with its visuals.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.661
The camera angle it uses doesn’t really
allow for too much detail to be shown, but

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:35.220
the graphics still do the job.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.420
Audio is a little, um, suggestive, especially
with a specific character, and the music is

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.420
excellent.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.840
It also features some classic lines that fans
of the series, and even some who aren’t,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840
will recognize.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.830
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy shows that you don’t
need to make a hack and slash game super-complex

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.860
to make it entertaining.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.910
I expected to enjoy the game, but I didn’t
expect for it to be just as addictive as it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.910
was.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.560
It’s always nice to find an older gaming
gem that you missed from the last generation.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.450
Well, that’s it for me, guys.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.820
This is Gabe from Classic Game Room.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.920
Take care.
