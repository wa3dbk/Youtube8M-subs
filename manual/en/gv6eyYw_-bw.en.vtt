00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.720
the San Francisco and Monterey Bay areas.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.220

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.810

impacting the San Francisco and Monterey Bay

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.140
areas over the next several days with rain,
wind, high surf, and possible flooding.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.870

the second will be Saturday into Sunday.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.319
Rainfall totals from the upcoming two storms
will be heavy in many area.

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:42.579
Across the north bay, significant rain is
expected with the highest amounts falling

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.929
in the coastal mountains on the Westward facing
slopes where rain over 10 inches is possible.

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.870
High amounts will also occur in the Santa
Cruz Mountains of possibly over 10 inches.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.769

county will approach 8 inches.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.369
Elsewhere, rain totals will be generally 3
to 6 inches, except lighter amounts south

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:01.769
of the San Francisco bay.

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.970
In the far south, only 1 to 2 inches will
occur in the inland valleys of Monterey and

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.150
San Benito counties.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.670
The graphic here shows timing on the arrival
of the heavy rainfall on the storm moving

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.860
into the area Thursday night and early Friday.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.530
The storm will impact the North Bay first

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.470
the afternoon hours Friday.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.770
This storm system will be much slower moving
than the storm we saw earlier in the week

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.820
and this will help it to produce heavier rainfall
totals.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.290
Use caution on the morning commute tomorrow
in the San Francisco Bay area as it will be

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.320
a wet and breezy one.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.040
With the expected heavy rainfall there will
be flooding concerns in the area.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.290
A Flash Flood watch is in effect across the
Bay Area.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.710
This is for the North Bay and then the coastal
Peninsula and the Santa Cruz Mountains.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.230
This watch goes into effect 7 PM Thursday
through Friday afternoon.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.390
This watch means that heavy rain falling can
produce areas of flash flooding.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.979
The greatest threats are in steep terrain
areas.

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.890
In addition, small creeks and streams are
expected to flood with the heavy rainfall

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.450
arriving tonight and into Friday.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.530
Additional flash flooding concerns will exist
with the next storm over the weekend which

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.159
will bring more rain.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.230
High surf will accompany the storm system
tonight and tomorrow.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.400
Seas of 15 feet or higher will impact the
coastline, first from the North Bay and then

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.109
spreading south by Friday morning.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.599
It will be hazardous at the beaches with the
large surf and breaking waves, possible sneaker

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.700
waves, strong rip currents, and possible beach
erosion.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.370
Winds will also increase with the approaching
storm system.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.749
Wind advisories are issued for the northern
areas first later today and then south for

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.049
the day Friday.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.450

Brown shading, and in the high elevations

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.890
can be expected to gust up to 70 MPH or higher.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.379
With the strong winds, some tree damage and
downed power lines can be expected.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.069
With the rainfall, the ground will be wet
and this will make for an increased risk of

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.529
trees to be downed especially in the high
terrain.

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:04.239

would be for a few lightning strikes, and

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.689
locally gusty winds.

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:18.040
Do not expect severe weather or a lot of thunderstorms
â€“ as they are expected to be isolated.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.719
