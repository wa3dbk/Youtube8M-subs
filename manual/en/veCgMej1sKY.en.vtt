00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
- HOW MANY OF YOU HERE
DRIVE A CAR?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.600
INTERESTING, INTERESTING.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.200
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT MANY OF YOU.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.300
UM, LISTEN TO THIS.
IF YOU DRIVE A CAR--

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.000
YOU KNOW THE COMMERCIALS ON TV--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.733
HAVE YOU SEEN FOR THE CARS
THAT BRAKE ON THEIR OWN?

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.533
NOT BREAK, LIKE THEY'RE BROKEN.
BECAUSE...

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.300
BUT, LIKE, BRAKE--THE--
THEY JUST STOP ON THEIR OWN.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.433
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE?

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.100
all: YES.
- OKAY, NOW FORD HAS ANNOUNCED

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.966
THAT THEY'RE GONNA ADD THAT
TO THEIR CARS.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.833
SO NOW, IF THERE'S SOMETHING
ON THE ROAD THAT YOU DON'T SEE,

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.933
THE CAR JUST STOPS FOR YOU.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:32.933
IT'S AMAZING.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.000
HOPEFULLY.
UM...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.400
IT'S PRETTY CRAZY THAT
CARS STOP AUTOMATICALLY

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.466
BEFORE THEY HIT SOMETHING.

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.333
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS...

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:46.333
THE CAR BEHIND YOU, IF IT
DOES NOT HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY...

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.166
GET YA IN THE OL' KEESTER,
RIGHT AWAY.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.333
SO THERE ARE CARS
THAT BRAKE ON THEIR OWN.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.466
THERE ARE CARS
THAT PARK ON THEIR OWN.

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.766
THERE'S A TESLA NOW
THAT ACTUALLY CHANGES LANES

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.900
ON ITS OWN WHEN YOU TURN
YOUR TURN SIGNAL ON.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.166
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU--

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.066
YOU KNOW HOW YOU FORGET
TO TURN IT OFF ACCIDENTALLY?

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.666
JUST END UP GOING IN CIRCLES
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.433
"WHAT AM I DOING?
I GOT OFF THE HIGHWAY."

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:13.233
THERE ARE EVEN SOME CARS
THAT DRIVE THEMSELVES.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:16.366
BASICALLY THE ONLY THING LEFT
FOR YOU TO DO IS TO--

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.733
WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR CAR--
LIKE, PUT ON MASCARA AND SMOKE.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.833
THAT'S ABOUT ALL...

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.066
THIS WILL CHANGE THINGS.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.633
WHAT ARE THE DRIVERS' TESTS
GONNA BE LIKE?

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.566
"OKAY, IF YOU CAN FIND THE CAR
AND UNLOCK THE DOOR,

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.866
"HERE'S YOUR LICENSE.

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.733
AND NOW YOU CAN DRIVE YOURSELF
TO KINDERGARTEN."

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.700
LITTLE.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.200
YOU'RE SHORT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.766
THEY WOULDN'T BE THAT BIG.
"TO KINDERGARTEN."

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.033
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, MARY.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.866
I AM ALL FOR TECHNOLOGY, BUT WE
ARE GETTING LAZIER AND LAZIER.

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.233
EVERYTHING IS DONE FOR US.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.066
WE HAVE SMART THERMOSTATS
THAT ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.833
WHILE WE SLEEP,
WE HAVE COFFEE POTS

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.400
THAT MAKE US COFFEE
IN THE MORNING,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.700
AND THEN WE GET TO WORK,
AND THEN WE'RE CARRIED AROUND

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.833
ALL DAY UNTIL WE GET HOME AND
OUR CHEFS MAKE US DINNER...

00:01:57.833 --> 00:01:58.866
IS THAT JUST ME?

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.900
JUST...

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.733
THIS TECHNOLOGY ISN'T JUST--
IT'S NOT MAKING ADULTS LAZIER.

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:05.133
IT'S--EVERYTHING.

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:08.200
THERE'S AN APP NOW THAT WILL
DO YOUR KIDS' HOMEWORK.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.500
IT'S CALLED PHOTOMATH.
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.666
THIS IS TRUE.

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.966
YOU HOLD YOUR PHONE
OVER A MATH EQUATION,

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.633
AND IT INSTANTLY SOLVES IT.

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:17.166
THIS IS TRUE.
LOOK AT THIS.

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:44.433
THAT'S BLACK MAGIC
FROM THE DEVIL.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.066
THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.500
WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHEN I WAS A KID.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.800
YOU WOULD HOLD YOUR HEAD OVER
THE PAPER OF A SMART KID

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800
NEXT TO YOU...

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.833
IT WAS CALLED CHEATING.

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:07.566
AND IT MADE ME THE SUCCESS
I AM TODAY.

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.333
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS
FOR YOURSELF.

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:10.733
YOU HAVE TO PUT IN
YOUR OWN LEGWORK,

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:12.400
LIKE I'M ABOUT TO DO RIGHT NOW
WITH THIS DANCE.
