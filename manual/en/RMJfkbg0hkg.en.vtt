00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:08.389
Wait, How do I steal the puck from you?

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.889
So, hey Kesler's coming back by the way

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.840
oh yeah? Is that a good thing? or?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.350
yes it's a good thing he's a great player
but more importantly

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.560
I'm really excited about his interview bombs after the
games

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.770
Interview bombs? Does he

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.910
moonlight as a

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.359
terrorist or something?

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.940
No, no, it's just that

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.140
they interview players and Kesler kind of shows up after the game.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.710
Oh... ok, and then what happens?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.930
Stand up, I'll show you.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.950
So after the game, someone will interview a player and Kesler will show up in the background

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.530
you know, just hanging out, do something silly, it's an interview bomb

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.210
so what we're gonna do. You interview me

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.879
just one question, then you sneak off
and you're gonna try to interview bomb me ok? So let's see.

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.300
Let's say there's a camera just over here

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.790
k, so has a question, k hold. Get a stick here.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.510
and uh... we'll see how this goes. Go ahead

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.530
Alright, uh.. how many lizards are in Spaine. What is that?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.110
I mean it's a question. It's a stupid question, I'm a hockey player, ask me a hockey question. Ok, um...

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.990
what was the score of the game

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.210
Like you can't look at the scoreboard? Just...

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.870
How did I feel about the game?

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.279
How did you feel about the game?

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:13.619
Oh you know I thought we worked pretty hard. You know we're just trying to go out there every night,
order to try to go to every night it's a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.779
long season trying to get the "W"

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:19.049
and uh... we're just working hard - you're too
close! What are you doing? You're too close.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.200
It's just... I'm hockey bombing. You're? No!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.730
that's personal space, it's not... Hockey bombing?

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.630
You know I thought our goal tenders played pretty well and
we're working really hard out there

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.340
You know it was just a great night and, what are you, that's too... what are you doing? What? I'm. You're blowing up the interview!

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.130
That's not a bomb, that's a... blowin' up! No one can see me!

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.479
You're.. take... background!

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.510
Background!

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.550
Yeah I was pretty happy with that goal I scored, you know I really dangled around a few players.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.829
and then it's worked really hard... You're touching me, why are you touching me?

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.360
I... I... I don't know. Ugh, I'm going home.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.810
Alright, so I'll just keep practicing then?

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.140
So I was teaching him about uh...

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.340
you know, interview bombing, you know Ryan Kesler..

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.340
Yeah, on the Canucks games, after the game on tv... you've seen him. Oh yeah yeah, it's pretty funny. Yeah.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.080
He wasn't very good at it though.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.669
No?

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.369
Ahh!
