00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.020
 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.040
Such talent, you can have people with, let's just say equal talent.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.060
One can make it and one doesn't. You know there's a lot of hardness

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.140
a lot of hardship in it. There's a lot of meanness in it. There's a lot of politics in it.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.250
That people on the outside don't see. 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.320
Because they see the front. 
 It's very easy now for very good artists to 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.340
be completely lost in the shuffle. And maybe nothing will ever happen

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.380
to their careers. Three quarters of the students, their work

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.410
is technically as good if not better,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.430
then most of the art you're going to see around Chelsea and SoHo and the Bowery

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.440
but their all dressed up and they got no where to go. You know, most of those people

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.500
are not going to become artists. They simply don't have the will power

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.610
and whatever it is that they want to express.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.740
I think the hardest part about being an artist is judgment. Self inflicted

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.870
and socially inflicted. 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.890
You know you're parents saying, hey why aren't you making money?

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.960
Support is extremely important for the artist.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.980
That's why artists hang out with other artists. We need to have that energy

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A lot of times people aren't going to understand, if they aren't an artist, 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.120
it's hard to understand that internal process. 
 This whole thing's like fishing or gambling.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.150
That's what I consider art to be. Like the business part of it.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.180
It's like those two things combined. You know you're fishing, you've got this little 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.230
rare thing on the end of your line. You're hoping it's going to attract a fish and stuff like that.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.250
But it all depends where they are. Is it hot out? Are they at the bottom? The top? 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.330
It's the same thing, where you're fishing, at what level are you trying to sell you're work at.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.370
In society. And it's gambling because, yes there's a luck element

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.430
There are so many talented people, I mean, 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.430
that nobody ever sees. Because they don't have the persistence. They can't deal with

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.460
the rejection. I mean you got to get rejected pretty much 98% of the time

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.500
for years and years. For shit to happen.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.580
It could be really fantastic. It could be good enough to have been marketed all along

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.620
and this person could have been Eric Fischl's contemporary

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.740
but they weren't, they're not and now it's basically like a room out in back

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.800
of their house filled with paintings that there's no market for.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.830
There's just like a dumpster filled with some artist's work because they're no longer here,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.900
there's no legacy, there's not a gallery to market that work, their kids don't want

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.020
to put it in storage for twenty years with the hopes that maybe some day

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.040
someone will discover it and it's just like, it's gone on the dust heap of history.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.080
And you know there are successful artists that didn't even graduate from college so,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.130
the other fallacy, is that you know if that, you know some how if you haven't

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.170
had some sort of artistic achievement by the time you've reached your late twenties then

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.190
that means some how you're done.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.240
We live in a wunderkind culture. I think it can be easy to feel that way.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.300
There are a lot of very interesting artists that make work late into their lives.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.370
I was at a dinner, a small dinner.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.390
I was seated across the table from Dave Hickey.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.410
He said, in the art world their is no such thing as climbing the ladder. 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.450
You have to start at the top.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.490
And when he said that, even though I'd been a practicing artist all those years,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.510
It hit me in the head like a brick. There is so much truth to that.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.530
And I think that's what a lot of young artists think about themselves,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.590
and they kind of have to, if you think about it. I will be the exception.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.770
And as you get older and you're in the game longer

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.820
you begin to realize, if you were the exception you would know by now.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.890
So then a different kind of hopefulness takes over and that would be

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.900
If I can just stay in line. If I can just stay the course.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.930
But I think the general misconception of the young artist is

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.990
that they will be the exception.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.070
I think talent plays very little role in the success or failure of a work 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.150
of an artist. I think it's really a question

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.170
of persistence...

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.190
hard work and...um...

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.200
and...uh...luck (laughter.)

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.270
You can't make the assumption that because

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.330
work is seen in a museum that it is better or worse

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.440
then work you might see in another situation. 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.490
I don't think you can make that assumption. What's concealed from view,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.500
what's behind a work of art can become part of the work of art now.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.590
And can add great value.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.640
To you experience of it.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.760
 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.820
An artist is someone who gets you to see the world differently.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.930
Because their work has such power to it. And such an understanding

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.040
or grasp of the human condition. There's something special.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.060
It provokes you. It takes you somewhere else. It's transcendent. 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.080
99.99% of the art that's out there

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.110
will not survive the test of time and have no value.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.210
You know why an artist makes it and why another one doesn't.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.250
Who the hell knows? 
 You've got to find these people out there.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.270
Who's opinion will make everybody else believe.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.310
People want to buy a piece of your experience

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.360
So if your experience is interesting and you're experience

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.440
leads them down a road that they find fascinating, then the work's a

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.520
representation of that. It's like I was so idealistic in my younger part of my life,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.540
up until even like 35, I just all you had to do was,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.570
be talented and be honest and put your shit out there.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.770
And like some body would recognize it. And it's a terrible moment

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.950
to come to, believe me. It's crushing. Cause the artist that get involved

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.130
in it for the real like, you know soul, which is what I did

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.180
The need to express something or whatever. Or the beauty of it.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.210
You're world comes crashing down when you realize, OK this is what I did with my life.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.300
I better start getting good at trying to sell this shit. 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.320
Or get somebody that's good at selling it for me.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.410
 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.440
When something unexpected comes along in your life and opens you up to an

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.510
experience that you didn't expect to have. You couldn't have imagined in a way.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.580
And all of a sudden some body has done something

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.630
that amuses you, intrigues you, revolts you,

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.670
you walk away in some tiny way, changed.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.700
For that experience. I think that...

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.730
makes your life richer. It's just a...a wonderful thing.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.780
It's thrilling.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.810
BEN: I got that exciting moment, four weeks after not talking to Fritz.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.850
It was a phone message where he sounded like he was getting back on track.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:17.284
FRITZ: I'm coming to say thank you for all you've done for me (volume fades down.)
