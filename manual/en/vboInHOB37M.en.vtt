Indonesian Fried Dumpling in Peanut Sauce

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:18.348
Hi Foodies, my name is Yuda Bustara/and I'm Putri Miranti

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:24.447
Today we're going to make the ultimate Indonesian street food snack called Batagor. Do you know what Batagor is?

00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:28.209
It's fried dumpling made from fish ball &amp; tofu!

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:31.889
Shall we start? This dish is very easy. All you need to do is blend, blend, blend.

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:37.292
Skin the mackerel fish to get rid of the fishy smell

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:40.807
So we will only use the meat for this dish

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:51.507
and we will get rid of the head, skin &amp; bone

00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:58.341
We only need 2 fillet (200 gr), 100 gr peeled shrimp

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:08.410
1 egg as binding agent, 75 gr of sago flour to make the dumpling soft

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:16.757
If you don't have food processor you can use blender instead

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:25.049
Traditionally, they would pound all the dumpling ingredients until it's soft

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.006
So now we put in 1 chopped leek

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:31.674
Add 1/2 tsp salt &amp; pepper, 4 cloves of garlic

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:36.591
Garlic is used to replace MSG in your cooking

00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:41.257
Ok, now blend away until soft!

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:45.450
The correct texture is for it to be sticky

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.007
Now we just need to put this mixture in the tofu

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:54.175
Cut tofu in half &amp; make a hole in the middle

00:01:54.175 --> 00:01:59.649
Now put in the seafood mixture

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:09.010
Hey, perhaps you'll be able to make your own batagor &amp; sell it after this!

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.168
If you ran out of tofu, let's start using the dumpling skin/rice paper (can be found in your nearest Asian grocery store)

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:25.651
Put the mixture in the middle of the paper &amp; wrap it around tightly

00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:30.749
OR if you want to make a triangle shape dumpling, use egg as a glue on the edges

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:38.327
Put the mixture in the middle &amp; fold

00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:41.076
You must steam these raw dumplings so the fillings will be cooked thoroughly

00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:44.607
After all is cooked, then we can deep-fry them

00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:50.053
Steam for 15-20 minutes, then cool it down before frying

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:51.691
Now we're gonna make the peanut sauce

00:02:51.691 --> 00:03:01.687
Blend in: 200 gr of peanut butter, 50 ml water, red chili to taste,

00:03:01.702 --> 00:03:12.612
60 gr palm sugar, 3 tbsp tomato sauce, 3 tablespoons chili sauce &amp; blend away!

00:03:12.612 --> 00:03:19.770
Now we're going to heat it on a pan

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:28.181
Add a pinch of salt, pepper and chopped kaffir lime

00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:33.406
The peanut sauce is ready, now we're going to fry the dumplings!

00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:40.328
Deep-fry in high heat until golden.

00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:44.296
And now we're ready to serve!

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:46.631
Use thick tissue paper to let the oil soak &amp; cool down

00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:52.547
Cut into piecee, serve with peanut sauce &amp; add 1 tbsp of lemon juice

00:03:52.547 --> 00:03:56.463
The batagor is ready! Smells so good!

00:03:56.463 --> 00:04:04.526
