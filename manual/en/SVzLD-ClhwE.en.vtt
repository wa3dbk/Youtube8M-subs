Hey, whats going on guys, It's me Vikkstar123
with some gold combat knife gameplay on Black

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.050
Ops 2.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.260
This took me 2 to 3 hours to get in total
and towards the end of this video I will be

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.310
showing you guys the class I use to get this,
explaining how I got it and how you guys can

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.029
get it for yourself, I think it's really cool
how they've added in camo's for the knife

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.410
which just makes the game alot more fun for
knife only players gives them something to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.599
work towards.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.670
I think they've done you know really well
in terms of knifing on this game just to make

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
it enjoyable with the greed perk set-up I've
got six perks on at the moment you guys will

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.250
get to see that just after this gameplay clip
finishes so that gives me quite a nice advantage

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.290
and its just a fun play style to incorporate,
the lunge can be a little bit inconsistant

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.280
but I think it's pretty balanced in terms
of the way it goes I mean I've sacrificed

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.710
pretty much everything from my class except
from my knife in return for perks so I think

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.690
through that It's not
overpowered it's quite balanced so it's a

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.050
lot of fun to do and you'll notice that you
can peice together a lot of kills like that

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.780
it is a lot of fun although a lot of the time
you will have to flank around the map and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.520
sneak up on people and another thing is that
this gameplay is purely knife only which is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.450
something I thought I do just to show off
the gold combat knife and it's something I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.479
don't usually do which is quite fun to do,
I've been trying to incorporate the combat

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.219
axing and knifing at the same time I'm not
too great at it but I probably will have some

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.259
combat axe gameplay for you guys too because
they are, absolutely awesome so that's just

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.109
about it, for this part of the video, one
more kill and we'll get on to the next part.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.619
So before this video ends guys I'm going to
show you the class I've been using to get

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.509
the gold combat knife and how exactly I went
about and did that so this is the class setup

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.430
I have got loads of perks on as you can see
these are the ones that I found to be the

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.799
most useful, got
the one concussion three perk greeds and now

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.200
lets see how you actually personalize it so
you just press the back button on the class

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.740
it took me a while to work out even this and
you go to this menu and you can get all of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.459
these different camos, going through like
this ten kills, twenty kills, fourty kills,

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.840
sixty kills, eighty kills then a hundred kills,
one twenty, one sixty, two hundred, then once

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.430
you've done that you have to get ten backstabs,
five survivor medals, then five revenge kills

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.000
now this is the tough one, five enemies killed
with their own weapon after killing them with

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.030
the combat knife so you knife them pick up
their gun kill them again and five bloodthirsty

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.750
medals, took me a while to work out how you
actually get this, this one is a five killstreak

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.250
so you need five killstreaks and then boom
you unlock gold for the combat knife so thanks
