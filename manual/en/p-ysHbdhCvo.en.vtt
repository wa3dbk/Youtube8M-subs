00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.170
Mixing Mortar.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.880
QUIKRETE Mortar Mixes can be successfully
mixed by hand or machine mixed.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.410
The size of your project will often determine
which method you choose.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.269
Hand mixing can be done in a mortar tub or
wheelbarrow, using a shovel or hoe, and is

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.960
suited for small projects.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.010
A mortar mixer should be used when machine
mixing mortar for larger projects.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.360
Mortar mixers are designed for fine sand mixes
and utilize rotating blades inside a stationary

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.839
tub.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.380
When working with mortar mixes, rubber gloves
and safety glasses should always be worn during

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.240
mortar mixing and placing procedures.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.080
When machine mixing mortar mixes, it is important
to add the water to the mixer before adding

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.480
the dry mix.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.980
Typical mixers can hold up to three bags of
80 lb. mortar mix.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.270
Measure the recommended water amount for the
number of bags to be added to the mixer and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270
pour half the water into the mixer.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.830
An 80 lb. bag of mason mix would require about
five quarts of water.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.250
Add the dry mix into the mixer, and allow
the mortar to mix for about a minute.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.750
Then, add the remaining water, as necessary.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.590
Continue to mix for three to five minutes,
until a uniform, workable consistency is achieved,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.600
and then, turn off the mixer.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.679
Letting the mortar to sit, undisturbed, for
about three to five minutes will allow the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.100
fine aggregate in the mix to fully saturate.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.229
If this step is not followed, the mortar can
quickly become firm and un-workable.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.780
If additional water is needed, add small amounts
of water, sparingly.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.131
Proper consistency is achieved when the wet
mortar will hang on a trowel, held at a 90

00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:38.869
degree angle.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.609
Adding liquid cement color to a standard gray
mortar mix can turn it into a decorative mortar,

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.880
to match or contrast the color of brick or
block.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.390
One 10 oz. bottle of QUIKRETE Liquid Cement
Color will color up to two bags of 60 or 80

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.869
lb. mason mix or mortar mix.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.530
To achieve a consistent color, mix the liquid
cement color into the mixing water, before

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.619
adding it to the mix.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.520
Using the same water-to-color ratio will help
maintain color uniformity from batch to batch.
