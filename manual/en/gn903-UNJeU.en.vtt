So you guys are looking for the iPad 2 today?

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.120
Yes, we're wanting to get the 64 gig with
the white color.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.320
And so you're here for the iPad 2?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.320
Absolutely.

Yeah, so you getting excited?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.680
I'm getting stoked, not gonna lie. I'm getting
stoked about it.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.320
So what are you most looking forward to with
the iPad 2?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.720
The biggest thing for me is the ability to
record video

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.120
and use iMovie because I'm a staff writer
for the fourth largest sports website.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
Oh okay.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.309
And I cover MMA so I travel across the country
doing events

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.339
and stuff and the ability to be able to record
and

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.460
have iMovie right there and edit video and
everything

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.590
is going to come in really handy for me.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.780
So have you guys owned iPads before I'm guessing?

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.900
Nope this is the first time.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.900
Oh really?

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.530
Yeah yeah. iPods of course.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.530
Yeah that's great.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.049
Have the first generation iPad?

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.460
No I've never had the first generation this
is my first iPad,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.190
decided to see all the possibilties, see what
all the hype is about.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.009
What's your perference, you looking for a
black one or a white one

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.580
or Wi-Fi, 3G what are you thinking?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.280
I want a 64 gig white Wi-Fi.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.530
Yeah? That seems pretty popular. A lot of
people are wanting the white one.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.299
Yeah, just because it's different, because
everyone had the black one, so you know?

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.299
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.710
You don't want to blend into the crowd nowadays.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.790
I figured why not, go for it, my laptop is
getting a little old

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.799
so I need a little upgrade and this will be
something good on the go.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.400
So you know, it's real light to carry around,
slick.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.510
So what exactly made you want to come out
here and

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.160
stand in line for your first iPad?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.380
Well I've been wanting to get an iPad for
quite a while

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.009
and knew that they would be coming out with
a new one around this year

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.313
this time of the year so just kind of been
waiting for it,

00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:11.313
wanted to get it on the first day.

00:02:11.313 --> 00:02:12.313
So have you been a big Apple fan for a while,
or?

00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:14.560
Actually the only Apple products I've ever
owned before this

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.799
was an iPhone and then once I bought my first
iPad

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.960
I liked it and decided that, you know, I'd
get the iPad 2

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.390
so it's a really handy device whenever you
know

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.920
whenever I can't lug my big laptop all over
the place.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.060
So you've been a big Apple fan before, or?

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.250
Oh yeah, used to have the iPhone, big follower
of Apple

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.260
I like how easy everything is to use,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.819
I love their interface, I love everything
about Apple,

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.359
big Apple fan.
