00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.660
So you need to replace a cartridge in your HP Printer. Letâ€™s walk through the steps

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.240
together.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.129
The first thing we want to do is turn the printer on, so press the Power button.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.000
Next open the cartridge access door. The carriage moves to the middle of the printer.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.029
Let the carriage settle into the dock, then gently press the cartridge down. The cartridge

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.029
releases, so you can remove it. Now, take the new cartridge out of its package.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.320
Using the pink pull tab, carefully remove the protective tape.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.960
Be careful not to touch the copper-colored electrical contacts or ink nozzles. This can

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.990
cause clogs, ink failures, and poor electrical connections

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.980
Make sure that you install each cartridge in its correct slot. Tri-color on the left.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.870
Black on the right. Place the new cartridge into its slot and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.679
gently but firmly push it until it pops into place. Use the finger holds on the top of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:12.259
the carriage as you insert the cartridge to prevent from lifting the carriage out of position.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.659
When the cartridges are in, close the cartridge access door.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.399
After you are done replacing the cartridges you must align the print heads to calibrate

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.219
the printer so that you can have the best quality printouts.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.159
To align the printer, you must first make sure that you have plain, unused white paper

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.219
loaded into the input tray. Run the automated cleaning utility by first

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.569
going to the computer your are printing from Click on the Windows Icon.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.149
Click Control Panel. When the control panel opens, click Devices

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.119
and printers. In the printers folder, right-click your desired

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.119
printer and then click Printing Preferences. Click on the features tab.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.619
Click Printer Services to open the HP toolbox. On the Device Services tab, click Align.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.640
Follow the onscreen instructions to finish the alignment process.
