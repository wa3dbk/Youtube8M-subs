00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:03.500
Once a chromophore absorbs
a photon of light,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000
very interesting
things can happen.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.033
One of which is
the reemission

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:12.333
of a new photon and this process
is known as luminescence.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.834
One type of luminescence

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:16.900
is a very simple process
of just light absorption

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.166
by the chromophore

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.467
to make our excited state
electronic configuration

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:24.233
followed by a return
to the ground state

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.667
by reemission of a photon.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:30.633
That process, the simplest of
the luminescence processes,

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.500
is known as fluorescence.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.033
And fluorescence is
a very powerful tool

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.233
that shows up in many
examples in molecular biology.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.266
Here's an example that
illustrates the idea

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.133
of molecular specific probes.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.333
This cell has been colored

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.667
based on the use
of two fluorophores

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.433
or fluorescent-
emitting molecules.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:55.333
One fluorophore that's
green is tagged with a

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.667
recognition element that's
specific for F-actin.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.600
Another fluorophore
that's red

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.667
is tagged with a
recognition element

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.400
that's specific for G-actin.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.567
And so we can
see, spatially,

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.166
where the F-actin
and the G-actin is

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:13.066
simply by noting the
colors in this image.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.266
Here's the molecular structure
of the F-actin probe.

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.867
The recognition
element for F-actin

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:21.033
is covalently attached

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.667
to the fluorophore
of the molecule.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.734
So wherever the
F-actin element is,

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.367
so is that fluorophore.

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:31.500
By making the fluorophore
specific to a particular color,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.867
we can spatially image where
the F-actin molecules are.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.834
If you'd like to know
more about fluorescence,

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:40.166
I'd encourage you to follow
the link in the notes.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.400
It'll take you to
the Invitrogen site

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.000
and there's a great tutorial
on fluorescence fundamentals.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.467
Or if you'd like to know
more about actin probes,

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:51.100
or for that matter, any
other molecular probes,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.300
go ahead and follow
the link on this page.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.433
This'll get you to
probes on actin,

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:57.000
but you'll see here
on this site

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.133
that there are many other
kinds of molecular probes

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.633
that have already
been developed.
