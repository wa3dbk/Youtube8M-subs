00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:04.840

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.300
(clap)

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.364
- Sophia, what are we making?

00:00:06.364 --> 00:00:11.356
- We're making the Harry
Potter Goblet of Fire.

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.285
(laughter)

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:14.356
- That was super cheesy.

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:15.157
Vodka.

00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:16.048
- [Sophia] Vodka.

00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:18.386
- [Skyy] O.K., woman.

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:19.526
Jesus Christ.

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:20.589
Blue Curacao.

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:23.272
O.K.

00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:24.935
Lemonade.

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:26.923
(laughter)

00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:28.256
Sophia, butchering this drink.

00:00:28.256 --> 00:00:29.140
- [Sophia] Shut up.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.471
- [Skyy] Keep going, keep going.

00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.689
- [Sophia] I didn't realize
lemonade was part of this drink.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.539
- [Skyy] O.K., that's it.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:34.571
That's it, that's it, that's it.

00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:35.290
- [Sophia] Do you make this from scratch?

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.091
- [Skyy] Yeah, how you know?

00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:38.060
(indistinguishable bickering)

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.536
I didn't have lemonade,
so you make it, O.K?

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:42.702
So you all know what this is?

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.283
Bacardi 151, O.K.

00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:47.246
The devil himself.

00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:51.151
More, there's more than
nice...O.K., O.K., O.K.,

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.357
because you got to drink this,

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:53.144
remember that.

00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:54.335
- [Sophia] Oh, that's a good point.

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.535
(laughter)

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:57.935
Let's light this baby.

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.207
- Grab the cinnamon and sprinkle.
(sigh of frustration)

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.418
- There you see it.

00:01:02.418 --> 00:01:03.734
There you see it, ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:05.135
You see the flames now.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:07.268
- [Sophia] Yep, just don't
light yourself on fire.

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:08.452
- [Skyy] Be careful with the cinnamon.

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:10.054
You see how much cinnamon
Sophia put in that?

00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:11.702
- I'm sorry, I just wanted
it to have that effect.

00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:12.344
- O.K., do it again.

00:01:12.344 --> 00:01:14.416
Do it again, do it again.
- [Sophia] I just wanted to see.

00:01:14.416 --> 00:01:15.808
- [Sophia] I will sacrifice
myself and drink it, alright?

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:16.572
Don't worry about that.

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:18.339
I just want you guys to be excited. 
- O.K, O.K.

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:20.568
- [Skyy] They're very excited.

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:22.902
- [Sophia] I'm very excited.

00:01:22.902 --> 00:01:24.938
And I'm wearing hairspray.

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.449
- And there you have it.

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:27.586
(laughter)

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:30.494
The Harry Potter Goblet of
Fire with Cinnamon everywhere.

00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:32.453
You owe me for a frick'n
tin of cinnamon, O.K?

00:01:32.453 --> 00:01:34.505
- Sure, I'll give you a dollar
so you can buy yourself --

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:35.419
- It's not a dollar.

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:37.785
This is handmade cinnamon, O.K?
- Frick'n cinnamon.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:38.505
- [Sophia] Shut up.

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:39.253
How about I drink it?

00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:41.553
This is made in the
mountains of Mount Everest.

00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:45.435
The special tribal people made that.

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:48.085
- Rite Aid pantry brand.

00:01:48.085 --> 00:01:49.369
O.K., alright, so.

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.135
- Alright.

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:50.936
Blow it out.

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:51.735
(air rushing)

00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:53.453
(laughter)

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:54.052
- Sorry.

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:55.728
(laughter)

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:56.802
I'll just stand back over here.

00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:57.489
(air blowing)

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:58.967
(laughter)

00:01:58.967 --> 00:01:59.802
Is it out?

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:00.368
- Yes.

00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:01.102
- O.K., good.

00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:01.660
Good.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.835
- So am I going to burn myself?

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:03.364
No, No, I think it's --

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:04.361
- You want a straw, man?

00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:06.176
- Yeah, fine, give me a straw.

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:07.885
- No, I don't want you to use a straw.

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:09.253
- Good, I don't want to use a straw.

00:02:09.253 --> 00:02:09.867
- Good, O.K.

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:10.468
- Alright.

00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:11.117
- [Skyy] Go ahead.

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:11.665
- Here we go.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:12.838
I don't know.

00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:15.304
(laughter)

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.135
- I'm sorry, but it tastes like there's

00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:22.203
a layer of gas on this drink right now.

00:02:22.203 --> 00:02:23.669
- A layer of gas or a layer of ass?

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.987
- Like a layer...gas and ass.

00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:27.469
(laughter)

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:28.535
Alright, maybe.

00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:29.852
You know what, I'll take a straw.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.888
Can I just maybe?

00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:34.036
(laughter)

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:37.410
- O.K., O.K., hold on, hold on.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.239
- I just burnt my tongue
on this fucking glass.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.372
Give me that.

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:42.804
- You want me to call the
paramedics just in case?

00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:44.536
- I think I'll be alright for just now,

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:45.635
but just have it on standby.

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:46.469
- O.K., go ahead.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.371
- Alright.

00:02:48.278 --> 00:02:49.137
And it's not funny,

00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:50.618
so please stop laughing.

00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:51.919
- Now, alright?

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.135
O.K., just hold on one second,

00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:54.053
and I will let you know.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.946
No, I think she's good.

00:02:56.946 --> 00:02:58.004
Never mind.

00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:02.135
(laughter)

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:02.844
- How would you rate it?

00:03:02.844 --> 00:03:03.868
Scale of one to ten?

00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:05.203
- It's not existent.

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:06.505
It's not even on the scale.

00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:11.186
This drink is negative 10
I would rate this drink.

00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:12.953
It tasted like ass.

00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:13.586
- Take another sip,

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:14.286
it may be better now.

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:15.002
- Go ahead.

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:17.245
Maybe you just have to let
it sit for a little bit.

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:18.196
Yeah, that's what I was just thinking.

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:18.885
- O.K., go ahead.

00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:19.619
- Really?

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:20.685
Do you want to maybe just have a go at it?

00:03:21.454 --> 00:03:22.203
- You go first.

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:23.185
- O.K., I go first.

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:26.703
Yeah.

00:03:26.703 --> 00:03:27.735
- No, it didn't get better?

00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:28.619
- I trust her judgement.

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:29.734
Tipsy Bartender.

00:03:30.518 --> 00:03:31.919
- Anyways, I love Harry Potter,

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.152
but this drink is wack.

00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:36.035
