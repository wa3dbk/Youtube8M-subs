Hello Otter Nation it's Sean from OtterBox.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.930
We know you love otters and we do too
obviously so in honor of Otter Weekend

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.440
here at Denver's downtown aquarium we took
a drive down to chat with some of the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.100
staff to see if we could get a glimpse into a day in the life of an otter here at the aquarium.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.300
We're here with one of the otter trainers
Christine and she is going to give us a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.019
little bit of insight on the downtown aquarium and the Otter program here at

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.250
the aquarium. Do you house river otters or
sea otters? That's a really good question.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.909
We only house river otters.

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.819
Okay and what's the difference? The sea otters live in the ocean.

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:36.310
And the river otters live in rivers.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.740
Perfect answer!

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.040
So we get a lot of questions through our social
networks about this whole "holding hands" thing.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.220
What's with the holding hands?  The
hands holding is a sea otter behavior.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.559
So when the tides come...

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.240
The water's really rough and they'll at least
stay with their family by holding hands.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.790
And OtterBox is known for its protection.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.000
Are these guys protective of their homes?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.920
They are protective of their homes. The
mother is the one that takes care of the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.120
babies so the mothers can be very protective over their young.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.150
We know that otters are called by a few
different names when they're in a group.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.810
We've heard romp. We've heard raft what do you call it here?

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.560
Um...

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.670
We actually call it a family. It can also be called a clan or a raft.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.230
Ok perfect and how many otters do you have
here at the aquarium? We have three males otters.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.219
Their names are Blue. Slater. And Emmitt.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.130
Um we think Blue and Slater are around
fourteen and Emmitt is two.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.450
And do they have different personality
types or do any of them have any quirks?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.810
They definitely have different personalities.
Emmitt definitely has the biggest personality.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.670
He likes to carry rocks on his head.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.980
And likes to really entertain the guests
with that.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.130
And  Blue and Slater are a little bit older but
they still really enjoy

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.700
the same things that Emmitt likes to do. Lots
of swimming, lots of playing.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.190
Okay Christine why don't you tell us
just a little bit about what Otter

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.850
Weekend is and and how people can get
involved. 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.760
Okay. So Otter Weekend is this weekend coming up Saturday and Sunday it's from 10 to 4.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.110
And it's free to admission. So you just pay your
admission and you get to do the activities and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.070
and really it's just to promote otters and tell people how awesomely cool they are.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.450
How can fans find out more information about Otter Weekend?

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.030
We have a lot of  information on our Facebook right now so if you like us on Facebook

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.690

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.260
