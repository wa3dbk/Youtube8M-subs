00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:01.919
Hey girl Hey!

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:03.209
Welcome back to my channel!

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.529
Today, we are going to do this requested makeup
look— this is specifically the eye look

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.029
that you guys requested.

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.619
This is my fourth time filming it.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.459
It's been a little crazy!

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.089
But to start it off, I'm going to apply a
primer and my foundation.

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:24.238
I'm not going to get deep into it, you see
me do this in pretty much every single tutorial,

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:27.929
so to keep it short, I just kind of skipped
it a little bit.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.768
I'm going to apply an eyeshadow primer to
my lids — and take a peach color, this is

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:34.768
peach smoothie from makeup geek.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.559
I'm just using this as a transitional shade.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.999
I've been using it so much!

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:42.759
And then, i'm going to take this color called
midnight blue by coastal scents.

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:48.379
It's a hot pot, and i'm going to place that
on the outer corner and inner corner.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.568
Making sure that I blend it out, pack on color
to intensify, and continue to blend out.

00:00:56.568 --> 00:01:01.478
I'm leaving the center of the lid open, before
I'm going to apply this color, it's called

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:05.429
cherry moss — also, a hot pot by coastal
scents.

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:09.179
And i'm sorry it's blurry, I did not know
it was out of focus, this was my favorite

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.179
part!

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:14.328
And, I'm just going to pack that into that
open lid space and blend out.

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:18.008
Then, I'm going to take a pencil brush with
the color corrupt.

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:20.289
This is a matte black shadow.

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.749
And just apply that on the super outer corners
and inner corners.

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:35.349
And then just highlight with vanilla bean
and apply a liner to the upper and lower lashes.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.258
I'm leaving, a little opening open…

00:01:37.258 --> 00:01:40.489
Hah, a little opening open…

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:45.569
I'm leaving that space open for a nude liner
that I did not show, but I did place a little

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.398
bit of a nude liner and then, i'm taking cherry
moss and applying that to the lower lash line.

00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:57.099
Then I'm taking perversion, one of my favorite
mascaras and of course, coating the upper

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.359
and lower lashes.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.269
Using these Kiss #11 lashes…

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:04.389
I'm kind of obsessed with these…

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.759
I'm not good at putting on lashes you guys…

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.509
So, bare with me.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.469
And then, I'm going to take more of that midnight
blue and I like to wait until I put on my

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:17.939
lashes to figure out where I add ore color
placement.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.409
And then, Apply a concealer — this is the
Miracle blur from LOreal.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.399
(Visible Blur)
In the color medium, by the way.

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:33.409
And i'm going to contour with this nyx pencil,
just a little bit on my nose and blend out

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.409
with a blending brush.

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:42.439
And 
apply a cream bronzer by Sonia Kashuk to the

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.528
parameter of my face and the sides of my nose.

00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:53.199
And just buff that all in with my complexion
sponge by real techniques.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:03:01.118
Taking my favorite contour powder and Sonia
Kashuk brush, I'm going over that cream bronzer

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:03.368
and taking that contour color with a…

00:03:03.368 --> 00:03:06.799
I don't know what to call this brush, but…
yeah!

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.009
This type of brush and just contour.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:15.948
Here, I'm adding banana powder and taking
my favorite sunlight trio collection 1; using

00:03:15.948 --> 00:03:21.889
this gold highlight color, highlighting everything
and making it blowy and beautiful.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.448
And taking my favorite lipstick — tipis
is my favorite nude lipstick by city color

00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:27.929
cosmetics.

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:32.289
Called Kiss me softly, and we are finished!
