00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.450
First, you want to start with a good, clean
hoof, so you've got to pick it out with a

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.700
hoof pick, and use a hoof pick with a brush
on it or else use a good stiff brush...

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.460
to get all the dirt out of all the nooks and
crannies. Magic Cushion works by coming into

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520
direct contact with the sole.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.400
Magic Cushion is very sticky, so you want
to be sure to wear gloves when you're going

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.920
to handle the product.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.610
Then grab a good handful of it, work it around,
then start working it in.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.320
A common practice is to wrap with a baby diaper,
that's going to draw the moisture out, you

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.860
don't want to use a baby diaper with Magic
Cushion.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.190
Cut a piece of brown paper or cut it out of
a feed bag, you just want to press that over

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.360
the whole foot.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.500
Then I'm gonna take the cotton,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.670
wrap it around here,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.240
and we're just going to wrap everything up
with some Vetrap.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.470
There's a final step to give it the ultimate
protection. We're just going to wrap with

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.970
some duct tape as an over layer.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.100
If you have a horse that's a little sore from
some overexertion, say a heavy trail ride,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.210
you can pack Magic Cushion into the foot without
having to over wrap it. You just want it to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.990
stay in there overnight or for twenty-four
hours or so.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.660
You just go in the stall, pack it, put that
foot down in sawdust, and as they stand on

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.050
it, it will hold the product in place.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.409
You can see the shoe holds it in place, so
I'm just going to be able to let her put her

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.869
foot down in her sawdust.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.140
I'll pick this foot back up, and you can see
now the sawdust in her stall has packed the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.760
product into her foot, and it's going to stay.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.970
One of the other tricks to help keep the lid
from sticking is to take a little bit of petroleum

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.920
jelly, and just run it around the rim.
