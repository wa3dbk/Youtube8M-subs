Today we'll do the "ninety", or also called "ninety-nine", as you know this is my specialty. It's my favorite power move.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Very important for the ninety is the start. Legs wide open, pose like a superhero.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.000
Ok it's a joke! When you lean on your left arm on the floor your right leg goes up.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:56.000
So I lean, I raise my right leg. As soon as the leg is over the ground, I lean on my right arm and at the same time the left leg goes up.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Step one: left arm, wide open legs, one, two, three, four

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.000
one, two, three, four.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.000
It's a very fast movement: Pum, pum, pum, um, left, right, left, right, ok? 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Try top repeat it many times trying to feel the circle, the rotation, Ok?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.500
Start, I rise my right leg, I lean on my right arm, I rise the left one, I close the legs, head down. 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:47.500
There are three steps: One, two, close. It's very important that you  spin on this spot.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.000
As soon as I touch the floor with the right arm I look for the position, boom, I block it. 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.000
While spinning, my hand is here. It's not here. If you keep your hand outwards you find it hard to keep your balance.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.200
By this way, I have just the legs which control the spinning and as quick as I close them quickly I become fast   

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.000
The start gives you the energy and the right push. And then I try to keep with the legs open
