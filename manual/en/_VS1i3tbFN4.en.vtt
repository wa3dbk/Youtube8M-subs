One of the Seabourn signature events is a
Rock the Boat Dance Party which we do out

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.860
on deck. It's a crazy night, it's one of those
things where absolutely everybody gets involved,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.040
including the crew. We've got the most spectacular
food service happening up there. Creative

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.590
cocktails just coming at you from every single
direction. Everybody in this department, everybody

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.930
in the entertainment department, every musician,
every singer is on stage all night. The nice

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.260
thing about Rock the Boat is that we take
it out on to the deck. We take it by the poolside

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.090
and give it some atmosphere and it's a nice
night because we start the evening earlier

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.440
on with our Seabourn epicurean, which is a
very special event full of fantastic delights

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.200
and it's under the stars, which is beautiful
and to be out in the fresh air it's a really,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.710
really special event. What I like about Rock
the Boat is not only is it a wonderful experience

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.610
for our guests, but it's such a wonderful
display of how Seabourn comes together as

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.240
a team. All of the departments synergize so
well to create that memorable Seabourn Moment.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.869
The musical breakdown of Rock the Boat, it
really encompasses the entertainment family

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.490
on board. We also try to incorporate something
for all different musical tastes because our

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.530
demographic nowadays, it's throughout the
whole spectrum. It's a lot of fun for us to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.499
because the entire department gets involved.
We have the band, who are phenomenal. Then

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:39.889
we've got Seabourn singers that are coming
out, the Seabourn dancers are out on the dance

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:44.399
floor. We'll hop up there and grab the microphone
every now and then. Tonight is the night where

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.229
we really encourage people to just let their
hair down; we have a really good time. You

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.399
kind of don't know what's going to happen.
Some things are very spontaneous. You might

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.819
have a few surprise guests that get up on
the stage and make the party happen, and dance

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.429
with the crowd. It's one of those things that
gets its own momentum, it's organic. It's

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.820
literally throwing everything on to a stage
at the same time to see what happens. Guests

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.320
just love it. That is a signature Seabourn
Moment.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.560
