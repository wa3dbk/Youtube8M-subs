00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:01.651
Through the years,

00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:04.200
We've had a bunch of laughs here on StacheBros.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.800
Who could forget the time we were all murdered by a turkey?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.100
Heh . . . Classic.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.450
But today, we're here to talk about a very serious manner.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.200
No, its not the obesity epidemic that defines my pal Wario's existence.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.000
Aww, you think we're pals?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.533
Its a fatal disease that plagues many of the people we love in the world . . .

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.200
Including those here on StacheBros.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.921
It's an illness called . . .

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.800
B.U.P. Disorder.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.296
Snif. Sorry, I think I need a second . . .

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:34.361
When we found out that one of our own was diagnosed with it . . .

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:37.220
Well, you can believe we didn't take it lightly.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.659
My name is Princess Rosalina

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.407
And I have B.U.P.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:43.849
Butt Ugly Plush Disorder.

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:45.789
What's it like to be called hideous?

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.815
Well, I get that all the time!

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:51.089
I'm supposed to be "Super" Mario, but I look far from super.

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.631
At least I'm not as repulsive looking as my brother.

00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:56.169
Yeah, I'll admit it: I'm butt-ugly.

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:57.829
My eyeballs are deteriorating

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.300
The L-emblem on my hat looks like a giant pickle . . .

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.400
Ehh, I just look plain dopey!

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.680
Eh, no, not like doped up . . .

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.280
Although my eyes . . .

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.540
Eh, never mind, forget it!

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.717
You won't believe the vision problems I have!

00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:11.785
Look how far apart these things are!

00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:15.689
I'm always flying into walls and decapitating people's heads: its terrible!

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.043
Everyone here on StacheBros has agreed

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:21.903
that I am the most hideous creature they've had the misfortune to meet.

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:23.160
I'm serious!

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:27.047
I can't even begin to count all the times people have thrown up in my presence.

00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:29.579
Eventually you just learn to tolerate it.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.123
Its not my fault though.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:34.728
Those schmancy Senai plushes didn't exist when I was purchased!

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:37.800
I'm just not one of the beautiful plushes I guess . . .

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.680
Yeah, I won't deny it . . .

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.400
I'm like the most attractive plush that ever existed!

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.557
Deal with it!

00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:45.368
I'm the face of Sanei!

00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:47.104
I'm pretty darn cute myself!

00:01:47.104 --> 00:01:49.284
Ehh, I wouldn't push it . . .

00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:51.865
Luckily, there is a cure for B.U.P. D.

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:53.065
Its quite simple . . .

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:55.279
STOP LEAVING COMMENTS SAYING WE'RE UGLY!

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.603
WE KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT!

00:01:57.603 --> 00:01:58.840
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH--

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.138
You just have to accept that on StacheBros, some of us suffer with B.U.P.D.

00:02:03.138 --> 00:02:05.123
Feel free to continue to ridicule us . . .

00:02:05.123 --> 00:02:06.497
Its actually quite amusing . . .

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:08.374
But it won't change anything!

00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:11.432
The only way plushes will ever be replaced on StacheBros

00:02:11.484 --> 00:02:13.804
Is if we all die in a horrible blaze.

00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:15.550
Now you're speaking my language!

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:17.726
Deadly fire conspiracy anyone?

00:02:17.726 --> 00:02:19.772
Huh? Huh? HUUUUH!!!!???

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.865
Well, at least its not all bad.

00:02:21.865 --> 00:02:24.847
Yeah, I mean our voices sound pretty true to what they should be!

00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:27.009
Its not like I sound like Mikey Mouse or anything!

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.714
Ah-ha!

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.300
Bro, thats a whole nother issue . . .

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.414
To support B.U.P.D. you should subscribe to StacheBros!

00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:36.320
And then check out some of these videos

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.480
Starring more hideous plushes, heh heh

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.253
And then in the comment section

00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:41.453
We'd love to know

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:44.800
Which of the StacheBros characters is the most hideous

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.040
I mean . . .

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.800
We kinda already know, but . . .

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.100
It doesn't help to hurt us more.
