00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.680
Hey, guys.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.560
So today, I've got
another new product

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.980
to show you all which
I'm really excited about.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.060
Today, I'm showing you the
GHD Classic Waving Wand.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.680
The other day, I showed you
the Creative Waving Wand

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.120
to show you that kind
of beachy hair look.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.115
And today, I'm
showing you this one.

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:32.740
It's got an oval-shaped
barrel, so it's

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.621
perfect for creating deep
waves and voluptuous curls.

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.600
So I'm going to use it to create
this old Hollywood-inspired

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.425
hair style today.

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:43.383
So if you want to find
out how to get the look,

00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:44.440
just stay tuned.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.250
So just like with the
Creative Curl Wand,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.870
I'm just going to section
my hair into two sections,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.080
a top section and
a bottom section--

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.536
put this bit up
and away for now--

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:00.280
and then, I'm going to
take a section of hair

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.385
from underneath.

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:02.960
So I'm just going
to take my wand,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.040
and I'm diagonally going
to wrap the hair around it.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.850
So I'm going to take
it in like this,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.442
wrap the hair around, make sure
it's flat against the hot iron,

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:16.150
and I just leave there
for eight seconds.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:21.750
So then literally,
I'm just going

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.525
to continue all the way around
the lower section of my hair,

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:27.861
and then I'm going to
fastforward to the top section.

00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:28.360
OK.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.480
So now I'm done cutting
the bottom section,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.070
I'm just going to take down the
top section of my hair again,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.970
and I'm going to do the exact
same thing-- so working around

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.898
from the front of my
face on each side.

00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:43.272

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.890
So just to transform my curls
into old Hollywood-looking

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.270
waves, I'm just going to brush
them out with my Super Looper

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.970
just to make them a little
smoother and less defined.

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:07.150
So I really love this look.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.262
I absolutely just
think it's amazing.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.720
It's so different
from what you can

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.150
create with other curling wands.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820
So I think that the
classic curling wand

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.969
is perfect for
creating this look.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.260
So anyway, thanks for watching.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.520
I'll see you guys soon.
