Hey, it's Joe. This one is from Clara Lao.
She says,

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.880
"Thanks for answering all of our questions.
If the property is currently tenanted, what

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.880
do we do? Do we still market the property
as per normal and take buyers to view it?"

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.400
Well, first of all, you need to find out what
the seller's plan is and what the tenant's

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.840
plans are. Some people say, 'Well, could I
just to go to that seller and sell it to them

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.640
on a lease option and take a lease option
fee?" I've never seen that work ever, so I

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.199
wouldn't bother with that situation. It's
possible they could have some extra money

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.360
but the likelihood that they want to buy that
house - I think it's unlikely.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.610
So don't mess with that. Instead, ask the
seller, 'When are these people going to be

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.670
out of the house?' If they're going to be
out in just a couple weeks, it might make

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.440
sense to wait for them to move out, or, if
the seller's willing to work with that tenant,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.059
and a lot of times a tenant maybe wants to
move out before the end of that lease.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.059
What you can do as a seller is offer that
tenant, 'Allow us to show the property, keep

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.659
it nice, and let us show it whenever we need
to, and then we'll let you out of the lease

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.590
as soon as that new person moves in.' That
way, they don't have to pay months and months

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.719
on their lease, you can get a new person in
there and you can get cooperation from them

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.880
to show it.
Sometimes you have a tenant in there who's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.229
not paying, and then you want to get your
seller to hire an attorney, and get them evicted

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.469
and get them out of there a quickly as possible.
Sometimes you want to say to the seller, 'Why

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.810
don't you give them $500 to move if they'll
leave by next Wednesday?' If they'll do that,

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.810
then you can solve the problem that way.
It's very difficult, well maybe not difficult

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.960
- it's more difficult to sell a property that
has a tenant in it than it is to sell a vacant

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.929
property because the tenant doesn't have an
interest in keeping it filled. So use some

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.579
of the techniques that I just gave you in
order to work with those tenants in order

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.149
to get them out of that property so that you
can get it sold.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.350
Now, the other thing that you can do is you
can go to the seller, and let's say we have

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.979
that tenant and we want to keep that tenant
because he's a good strong, solid tenant,

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.330
but he still wants to sell that house? - He
needs an investor to buy that property. What

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.220
we can do is take that property "Subject To"
or we could sell it on a land contract to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.480
a new investor.
That would be a very easy property to sell

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.269
and get $10,000 down from an investor who
will maybe get $200 a month income on that

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.730
property on his $10,000 - that's 24% return
on your investment - that's a great deal for

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.690
an investor plus he gets a property he doesn't
have to qualify for and he leverages out his

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.930
income and buys a nice property, so there's
that way as well. I hope that helps. Thanks.
