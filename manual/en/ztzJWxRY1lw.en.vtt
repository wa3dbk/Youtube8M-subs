00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.320
Hi, I'm Tam, and I'm going to show you how
to make these very simple bracelets with just

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.680
a few beads and string of any kind of leather
or waxed cord, which is what I'm going to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.910
use here.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.160
These are great for the summer because they're
colorful and they're summery, and we sell

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.090
a lot of these beads in our store.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.330
They're inexpensive.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.800
They start at like $25 for a strand of these.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.480
These are recycled glass from Ghana.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.520
These are old African trade beads.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.050
All these are considered old African trade
beads, and some of them are very, very old.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.980
These are not super old, but they're from
the '80s, and they're made from recycled glass.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.710
The colors are really, really great in these.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.329
So basically I'm going to just lay out the
pattern you'd like, so you can do something

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.379
that's very orderly, or you can do something
that's sort of more mixed, which I kind of

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.239
like better.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.710
Then you just choose your fiber color accordingly.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.729
Now I'm going to show you how to make the
end, so I like to just make these easy, button-type

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.780
closures because they use the same bead, and
it's not like a super contrast between the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.409
bracelet and where it starts and where it
ends.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:37.609
So basically you just make a loop like this,
and then you're going to string on the beads,

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.959
which I did.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:51.249
Then, again, you can place your knots in different
places, so you can do very evenly placed knots

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:55.249
after each bead, or every two beads you can
do a knot.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.509
It's sort of all up to you.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.130
Or you can even do lots and lots of knots,
something like this.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.400
This is a double leather wrap bracelet, which
is very popular now, like all these multiple

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:17.370
wraps layered together.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.870
Because these are all not calibrated, the
holes.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.110
Let me see.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.209
Because the holes are not all calibrated,
and sometimes you won't be able to get the

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:39.790
string through, you can just trim the ends
by cutting the cord at an angle.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.159
So it gives you a little sharper end, and
you can just stick the, and then use your

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:56.230
tweezers to just push the cord through.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.750
You don't want to force it because a lot of
times these are glass, and they won't break,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.670
but they'll chip, so you just have to allow
enough cord when you cut with the knotting

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.130
part.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:26.249
Basically I'm going to do an odd number of
beads, so it's one and three.

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:37.650
I 
just move my knot tighter, closer to the bead,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.230
before I tighten.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.549
Sometimes it's nice to have a mix of beads.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.769
You could get a few strands and split it with
a friend.

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.049
That's what a lot of people do at our store,
actually.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.590
We sell a lot of these beads, so the strands
usually look like this.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.560
Then we sell leather loose on a spool, so
a lot of people come, split a strand if they're

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.019
going to make a bracelet, and then just pick
out the leather there.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:16.120
I'm going to show you later on, but you could
even just do one bead on a cord, which is

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.690
what a lot of people also do for a choker.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.180
See, this is going to be my finished bracelet.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.810
On the last bead, I'm just going to knot,
but I'm going to leave a little space so that

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.360
the knot can move because I'm going to make
this the closure bead.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.200
You can choose a contrast bead or something
that matches.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.509
It just depends if you want something that
all blends together or not, but basically

00:04:52.509 --> 00:05:00.419
it would look like that, which here we use
a contrast lava bead with the blue glass beads.

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.750
This one, we bought a store bought clasp.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.920
It's like a lobster clasp that swivels, and
this is like a double leather bracelet.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:19.660
It looks like that, and I like to wear these
sort of all layered like that.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.650
On the leather, you want to make something
a little tighter than your finished size because

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.880
after wearing, it'll stretch a little bit,
just because that's the nature of leather.
