00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.459
Hi guys, in this tutorial i'm gonna be showing you 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:12.570
what

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.799
a gauge means when you see it on a pattern

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.609
typically most gauges will be one inch
by one inch

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.740
and if you're working with centimeters

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.550
one inch is 2.54 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.609
centimeters, so it about two and a half 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.380
centimeters per one inch

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.989
and to make it the most simple, most
people just do one inch by one inch

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.300
witch is exactly what these squaers are

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.380
i just  got a ruler

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.860
and mine is in centimeters

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.759
so

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:43.990
mine is...

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.940
about two and a half

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.780
now the best thing about a gauge is not
only does it tell you if you're hat's

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.570
coming out too big or too small

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.630
but you can see if your hat is going to come out too big or too small before

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.110
you ever make it by making a little
sample

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.010
so say if they're giving you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.610
the four stitches

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.930
what you do is you wann achain four, and then i 
usually what i do

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.590
five...six

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.190
so i'm going to be measuring four

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.520
but i'm gonna make it a little bigger just so i have
a better "feel"

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.880
so i'm gonna go ahead and do six, and for the step up i'm gonna do seven. so i got seven...

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.020
chains

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.940
i'm gonna go  in my second chain from the hook

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.550
using the stitch that the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.420
hat calls for witch is single crochet

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.780
for this hat so i'm going to do single
crochets

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.790
so what you want to do with it saying
in inch

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.270
and you know you're supposed to have at
least four stitches an inch i'm going to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.890
do at least four rows

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.700
of my little sample guage here

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.120
so you don't have to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.270
you don't have to wait to do the hat to
find out if you're doing too

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.440
big or too small

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.920
and that's one of the best things about the
gsuge

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.490
you can find out at the right off the bat if you're making it too big

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.409
then you need to reduce

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:10.989
one hook size

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.149
and then make another gauge and see if you're getting the right size then

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:19.549
it is coming out too small i would
increase

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.889
a hook size, so if you;re using five i would go up to six milimeters

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.599
and so on and so forth

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.039
some i'm coming up here on my fourth

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:37.039
row

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.929
and there we go

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.709
now i would just simply get my...

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:43.779
my ruller

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.239
and i would see if it's coming out the same

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.509
length or the same uh...

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:54.009
width is the hat, if i'm getting four stitches per inch which i am, i can tell

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.979
by the hat already that i mesuared

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:59.959
that i know that i'm good and i can keep the hook size that i'm using

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.979
and if it's like i said too small

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:03.770
then

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.129
you're hat's gonna come out too small so go ahead and go up one

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.139
hook size, and vice versa if your hat is coming out too big then go down one hook size and try it

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.199
that way you can get the perfect fit
with your hook that you should be using before

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.599
you never start attached that when we
start to have you know it's going to

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.609
come out the size that you what it to come
out

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.759
and that's why gaugers are very cool

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.639
i hope that this has been helpful
