Sing a little ditty you must.

GRODA: Helps take your mind
off the "you know what."

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.820
FLAN SOLO: "You know what?"

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.780

[SINGING] Twinkle,
twinkle, little star ship.

00:03:20.157 --> 00:03:21.990
LUKE PIEWALKER: I think
the singing strategy

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.655
is helping to distract Flan.

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:25.350

Up above the world

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.270

LUKE PIEWALKER: Oh, no!

00:03:34.886 --> 00:03:36.093
That strategy didn't work!

00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:40.190
How will we rescue
the princess now?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.400
NARRATOR: You'll feel the
tension as our heroes come face

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.160

DARTH BAKER: Aw, that's easy!

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.680
Just stop and pretend the
cookie is something else,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.370
something you don't want to eat.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.370

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.769
Uh, OK.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.399
