00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.390
What's up guys, hope you're doing well.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.909
If you're new to the show, in these videos
I talk about things that I hate...things I'm

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:04.909
just:

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:05.909
Not About That Life!

00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:06.909
For example, Donald Sterling.

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:07.909
Wow!

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.429
For those of you unfamiliar, NBA Clipper's
owner, Donald Sterling, made some racist comments

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:11.429
to his then girlfriend.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.829
What he didn't know was that she was recording
this conversation and recently the files got

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:15.829
leaked.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.470
He basically said "I don't want you taking
pictures with black people.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.550
You're a nice girl.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.010
I don't really want you to be seen with black
people."

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.650
This is not this guy's first infraction.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.240
This guy has had a list of discriminatory
actions in the past.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.880
So for people to just jump on to this now,
it's sort of weird.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.019
For me, I wasn't as shocked or enraged as
some other people were at this audio.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.010
The man thought he was in the privacy of his
own home.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.050
How many times have you said some messed up
stuff in your house when you thought no one

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.050
else was listening?

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.070
The bigger problem I have is with the NAACP,
who was about to give this man a 2nd lifetime

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.080
achievement award.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.530
A 2nd lifetime achievement award?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.550
Who's over the board?

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180
How easy is it to get a lifetime achievement
award?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.010
I feel like there needs to be some type of
audit or investigation of some kind before

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.390
you just give out lifetime achievement awards.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.390
D

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.390
DAHECK.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.390
Not About That Life!

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.359
Is it me, or are trash can lids just getting
smaller for some reason?

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.309
I can barely fit my tray into the trash can,
if at all anymore.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.680
Got food piling up on the trash can.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.070
Now I have Chick-Fil-A sauce on my hand.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.380
I didn't have that before.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.380
Not About That Life!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.660
Recently, I'm watching the NBA playoffs.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.200
My team, unfortunately, Go Magic, didn't make
the playoffs.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.200
Not About That Life!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.010
Then during a commercial I see an advertisement
for the LeBron app.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.320
I don't understand.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320
What's next?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.479
Is there going to be a Justin Bieber app?

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.720
A One Direction app?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.720
We see LeBron enough!

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.310
We don't need an app.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.310
Not About That Life!

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.310
I get it people.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.310
You like Floyd Mayweather.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.310
He's undefeated.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.310
Just won his most recent fight.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.310
Yay!

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.310
That's all great.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.119
This does not make you a part of the money
team.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.560
Ok, you don't have a job.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.740
You live with your mom.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.380
There's no money involved in this situation
right here.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.380
Not About That Life!

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.380
So I was in the gym the other day.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.200
I go to the locker room, watching the game
on the screen.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.409
And you know what happens?

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.840
This white dude walks in, makes eye-contact
with me, and proceeds to get butt naked in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
front of me.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840
Why would you do that?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.470
It's one thing to just walk in, get butt naked,
go about your business, change.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.000
But the second you make eye-contact with me...you
should not be allowed to take your clothes

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.650
off, in my opinion, or at least break eye-contact
before you start taking your clothes off.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.650
DAHECK!

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.650
Not About That Life!

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.101
When police officers speed, and I know your
speeding because I'm speeding...and you passed

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.101
me.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.101
Not About That Life!

00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.101
Women, we get it.

00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:19.101
You have a boyfriend.

00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:20.101
Good for you.

00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:22.720
Is it really necessary for you to remind us
every #ManCrushMonday?

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.201
It's really all the hashtags...which by the
way, if you're 14 years old...you should not

00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:28.700
be allowed to post a #ThrowbackThursday...what
are you throwing back to?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.990
The real problem with #ThrowbackThursday though
is that the girls are starting to look better

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.630
in their throwback pictures than in real life.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.470
And honesty, what is the difference between
#ThrowbackThursday and #FlashbackFriday?

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.610
It's getting out of control people.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.610
Not About That Life!

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.690
And you know what else is getting out of control?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.980
Buzzfeed articles on Facebook...because everything
on my timeline is a Buzzfeed article, talking

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.750
about "You Won't Believe What Happens Next."

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.830
I kid you not, on my timeline this week there
was an article "100 Things You Cared About

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.670
10 Years Ago but don't Care About Today."

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.940
If I don't care about it today, why did you
right an...

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.940
Not About That Life!

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.440
But what are you Not About That Life?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.080
I asked some people on Snapchat and here's
what they had to say.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.980
I hate when people only mean-mug in pictures.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.090
It's a picture.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.090
You're supposed to look happy.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.090
Why don't you give it a nice smile?

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.370
When basketball's on and people want to talk
about hockey?

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.370
Not About That Life.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.370
That is a killer.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.850
You know when you're craving cereal and you
open your fridge and you have no milk.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.850
Not About That Life!

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.840

Life, make sure to follow me on Snapchat:

and end it with Not About That Life.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.680
As always, new videos every Sunday.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.000
No Jugamos Juegos.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.430
Throw me the alley.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.150
I'm a grown man.
