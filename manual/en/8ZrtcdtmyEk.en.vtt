00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.680
Hi, it’s Steve from Partselect.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.340
Today we are going to talk about what happens
when your dishwasher won’t start.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.509
Remember, parts are specific to your model
of dishwasher and the ones shown today may

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.730
not be the right parts for you.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.850
To get the right part for your dishwasher,
be sure to search PartSelect.com using your

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.000
model number.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.440
If you need help finding your model use our
model number locater.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.030
The link is in the description.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.670
Any time that you have an appliance that won’t
function, the first thing to check is that

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.289
the appliance is actually getting power.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.200
You will need to check the fuses or breakers
and, if applicable, the power cord.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.460
If any of these are damaged or otherwise not
working, your appliance will not work.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.839
Since dishwashers are usually wired directly
into the household wiring you must be careful

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.829
when checking the power supply.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.460
Even if it seems as if your appliance isn’t
getting power, if it’s plugged in you must

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.260
always assume that there is electricity present.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.409
The door latch pulls the door closed tight
to prevent water leaking around the door.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.760
It also works in conjunction with the door
switches to stop all operations while the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.989
door is open.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.970
Closing the door does not depress the door
switches all the way, only by closing the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.130
door tightly, and activating the latch, does
the dishwasher become operational.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.320
When the door is firmly closed and latched,
an electrical connection is made that allows

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.800
the dishwasher to operate.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.460
If a door switch is malfunctioning due to
damage or corrosion, the power will not reach

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.030
the controls and the dishwasher will not operate.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.650
Most dishwasher door switches are about an
inch long with metal prongs on the body of

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.800
the switch called terminals.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.780
These can corrode due to the wet conditions
and result in a poor electrical connection,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.920
which may prevent the dishwasher from starting.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.530
If the door latch is not properly adjusted
with the catch, the switches inside may not

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.950
be activated.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.300
This will also cause the dishwasher to act
like the door is still open and will not function

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.750
at all.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.270
Door switches can be checked for continuity
with an ohmmeter.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.800
Insure that power is disconnected to the dishwasher
and remove the wires from the switch terminals

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.240
and check for a closed circuit with the door
closed and the latch activated.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.280
If your dishwasher won’t fill and you have
verified that you have power to the appliance

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.140
you should next check the fill valve.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.580
Verify that you have water pressure to the
inlet of the valve and that the inlet is not

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.580
plugged.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.590
Check for line voltage at the two terminals
of the valve with a voltmeter.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.970
Use caution as you are performing a live voltage
check.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.190
If line voltage is present then you should
suspect that the valve is defective.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.090
If there is no line voltage at the valve terminals
then you should check the float switch for

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.030
continuity, and the timer or electronic control
for output voltage to the fill circuit.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.500
The timer or electronic control on some models,
controls the individual components in your

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.760
dishwasher, such as the inlet fill valve,
motor, heater, soap dispenser and drain pump.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.910
If the timer or electronic control does not
function properly, it can result in a wide

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.090
range of problems including failure of the
dishwasher to start at all.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.360
The timer controls when and for how long power
is sent to components on your dishwasher.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.740
If these controls don't receive power, they
won't function.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.459
The cycle selector switches provide options
for washing, drying, and setting the temperature

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.020
of the water.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.069
A defect in one of these switches could cause
one or more components of your dishwasher

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.290
to malfunction including a no start condition.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.630
If your dishwasher fills but won’t start
washing verify that the selector switch is

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.040
not stuck between settings.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.690
If two buttons get depressed at the same time,
it could create a condition where no continuity

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.340
is present across the switch.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.569
If your dishwasher fills with water but won’t
start, and something is making a humming noise

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.480
you will need to check the pump motor.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.240
If there is a hum emanating from the motor
there may be something stuck in the motor

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.200
or pump impeller.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.660
Remove the pump cover and filter assembly
and check for any foreign objects that may

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.920
inhibit the rotation of the pump impeller
and motor.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.750
Now that you have a better idea of what your
problem could be and what, if any, parts you

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.620
need to repair or replace, go to Partselect.com.
