Hey, wait a minute. We're lost.

00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:06.347
- (howling)
- Ah, shit, David. What is that?

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.687
- I don't know. Come on.
- Come on where?

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:11.522
Anywhere. I think we should
just keep moving.

00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:29.541
It's moving.

00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:31.795
It's circling us.

00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:33.797
Ah, fuck.

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:38.048
- What's the plan?
- Plan?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.053
Let's just keep walkin'.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.008
That's right.
A lovely stroll on the moors.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.852
# Tra-la-la-la-la

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.224
Isn't this fun?

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:53.767
It's in front of us.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:55.815
Do you think it's a dog?

00:00:57.408 --> 00:00:59.282
Oh, shit. What is it?

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.075
It's a sheepdog or somethin'.
Come on. Turn slowly. Let's walk away.

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:04.998
Nice doggie. Good boy.

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:06.618
Come on, Jack. Walk away.

00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:08.909
Walking away. Yes.
Here we are, walking away.

00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:14.748
- Can you see anything?
- No.

00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:20.136
- Sounds far away.
- Not far enough. Come on.

00:01:20.264 --> 00:01:21.924
But, Jack, where are we going?

00:01:22.058 --> 00:01:24.975
- I'll tell you when we get there.
- OK, cos... Arghhh!

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:29.145
You really scared me, you shithead.

00:01:29.274 --> 00:01:31.432
You gonna help me up or what?

00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.196
Jesus! Jesus! Fuck!

00:01:38.242 --> 00:01:41.906
Jesus! Fuck! Oh, God! Help! Help!

00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:48.793
Jack...

00:01:58.428 --> 00:01:59.459
Jack...
