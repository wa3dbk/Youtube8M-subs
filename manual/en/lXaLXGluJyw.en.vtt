Hi, I’m Rachel for Expert Village. On this
cake we’re going to start with the egg whites

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.930
because we need for the egg yolks to mix with
the self-rising flour. Since it’s not good

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.060
for the self-rising flour to stand too long
in the mix, that’s why we’re starting

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.269
before with the egg yolks and now we’re
going to start with the egg whites. So as

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:33.040
I mentioned before we’re, I made sure that
there is no egg yolks inside, plus we are

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.720
going to add half of the amount of sugar into
the mixture after it starts to get fluffy.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:59.030
This is much quicker of course because it
has less eggs, so it will be quicker than

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:26.759
the other one. You can see, if you don’t
want to, if you are not sure if it is ready

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:39.119
or not, when it starts having these waves
and the waves just stay it means that the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.691
egg whites are hardening and ready to be combined
with the rest of the ingredients. (say that

00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:43.909
part again, about the mixing up) to know when
the egg yolks, when the egg whites are ready

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.109
you can see that when it mixes it has these,
it makes these waves and the waves just stay,

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:59.999
that means that the fluff is ready and hardened
enough to be gathered with the rest of the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.669
ingredients.
