00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.540
This is a game that we're going to introduce
to everyone. This is one that I've never seen

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.420
anywhere else. We only play this one in the
home game that we have at our house and it's

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.639
called Bon Appetite and it's a variation of
Seven Card Stud. It's a high low split with

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.670
the opportunity at the end of the hand or
towards the end of the hand to shock a card

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.699
and get a new card to try to make your hand
even better or to even try to make a hand.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.630
So let's see how this game is dealt out and
played out in its entirety. We've went ahead

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.470
and dealt out the game. Players had three
cards down, four cards face up just like regular

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.311
Seven Stud. Now you've got to remember this
is a high low split so each player is either

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:45.710
going for a high hand or a low hand. Now all
the betting is over and this is where the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.930
shock actually comes into play. The player
here to the left of the dealer will say yes

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.590
I would like to shock a card and they play
a determined amount by the house and they

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.370
actually get a free card. In that case he
traded a ten for a ten. If the player chooses

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.830
to shock a card from the cards face up then
the card comes face up. If they choose to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.350
shock a card from the three cards down then
the card comes to them down. Once everybody

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.110
has shocked a card, you now have to declare
and to declare what you do is you take three

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.130
chips from your stack, one, two, three, and
you put them in your hand and put them under

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.840
the table and when you come back up on the
table you're either going to have zero chips

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.930
in your hand for going low, one chip in your
hand for going high, or two chips in your

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.130
hand for going both ways. Now the trick with
going both ways is you have to win both ways.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.470
If you get beat or either ties on going both
ways then you lose it all. You do not win

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.610
anything. So in this case, it looks like this
person might be going low. They would come

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.171
up with no chips in their hand. Now the players
that come up with going low or the players

00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:58.100
that come up with going high, they're going
against each other to see who has either the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.140
better low hand or the better high hand. Once
those are determined, the pot is split between

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.750
the high and the low hand and the winners
are given the money and that's how Bon Appetite

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.170
is played.
