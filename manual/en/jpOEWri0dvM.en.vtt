[Review Coast HP2 66 Lumen Focusing LED Inspection Light,led inspection light,inspection light,led inspection lights,portable led lights,price,amazon,where to buy]hello this is reviewed the coast HP 266
lumen

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.980
flashlight now it comes in a little box
that you see here

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.810
it comes with battery included takes a
triple A battery

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.910
and it is surprisingly small and very
surprisingly bright which will show you

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.420
in a minute

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.490
it comes with instructions but it's
really self-explanatory you knock me

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.480
instructions and a little advertisement
guide the comes with

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.850
but the thing is small for example get a
sense of the size

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.580
about the size is compared to I'm
different objects around its

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.840
pretty small and you can pull it out in
you do the zooming

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.940
by just twisting the head of your so you
can twist it this way and that way and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.810
this is how you get

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.110
from a focused beam to you wide-angle
floodlight now signs ways

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.290
it is a surprisingly small for the
amount of power that compares that beat

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.410
sound most my flashlights but perhaps
not the absolute largest one with this

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.660
huge battery on it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.070
but compared all the rest minds think is
surprisingly bright

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.440
compared to I'm even the next one so to
be fair

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.380
you know you compared to the old style
for its size rated this thing is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.240
puny I'm which is significantly more
powerful

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.240
then the old-style here but may be more
realistic is to compare to the lead one

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.090
so this was

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.619
a 6-lead like to buy it here in its
surprisingly more powerful

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.740
but so much smaller you know I compare
the size and I'll show you a little bit

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.590
later with the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.599
with the lights turned off but this
one's a much wider flight

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:33.950
I so that's particularly nice even
compared to these ones

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.889
so it's extra compact and surprisingly
perfect

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.950
to surprisingly bright on but it feels
really good in your hands

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.919
it isn't so heavy time that when you
compare it to scale for example

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:50.639
it only weighs 1.3 ounces and mice

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:54.939
scale as an example here too but it has
some have to it it seems very well

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:55.950
constructed

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.079
it feels really good very solidly built
when you take the battery out by and

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.200
string and this and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.279
has a nice little quicker at this end
here on this a little rubber thing that

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:06.549
you can click to turn I'm

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.369
turn off I like that it comes with a
little belt clip

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.520
so our pocket clip whatever you wanna do
with it on as opposed to the pen model

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.920
which is another example

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.760
that they had I really likes that I can
just click the same here so here's the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.460
deal is

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.260
yes you can always have some gigantic
large flashlight from you really

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.180
searching around

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.470
gotta see this is 66 Lumines but
compared to turning around

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.550
something the old school style like this
of course which is very unique in

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.060
comparison to modern leads

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.380
but this thing here is really compact
you can throw this in a purse throw in

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.770
your pocket backpack bacon something you
barely have to think about

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.250
the only drawback to the entire thing is
the battery life

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.980
is only on something like I'm

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.590
2.5 hours so it's a 2.5 hour battery
life to get the time a flight out of

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.240
this thing

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.720
relative to you know here's another
crank version led light which is just

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.180
anemic in comparison

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.600
job that had a crane content by yet to
even

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.720
Ste you know here's a different style
here it's brighter in intensity

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.760
I by it's surprising there how bright
this little guy

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.800
yes so I'm let's be real I'm first about
the person like you can even see the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.520
size compared the pens and pencils

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.240
let's be realistic it is 66 limb and say
let's remind ourselves compared to earn

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.810
average like bob watch a light bulb you
know he's your

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.660
57 want like bob that outputs somehow
missed 800 lumen so this is 66 lemons

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.030
the white bob is 781 so don't think that
it's going to lie to politely

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.200
our room as much as a 60-watt light bar
with you %uh

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.650
but I'm for what it doesn't happen and
being able to

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.670
I'm find your way around being able to
screw this head down you can make a

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.430
pinpoint

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.750
in on large intensity area or white now
for Floyd

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.870
and it is remarkably nice nap
perspective

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.430
I was so impressed by this little guy
that I

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.420
honestly after receiving this item I
went online and purchased

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.350
a different one this one was actually
temporarily out of stock so I like this

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.440
so much that have trusted the brand that
I bought a different one there

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.680
there's worth one that's about three
told three AAA batteries

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.680
that had bought as a birthday gift for
I'm

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.099
for relative so I'm on another one for
relative immediately after having this

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.229
one it seems so nice that I thought I
would be

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.870
excellent so well let's take a quick
look with the lights turn off to see the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.740
comparison of some different flashlights

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.139
okay now let's do some comparisons in
the dark very damn so the cameras and

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.039
probably over it just for a dark cloud
but here's a

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.569
simple there's the anemic one that even
in pitch dark things look pretty bright

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.569
I by it and that's their than your usual

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.789
old cylinder style late which is really
in the making real life right it's real

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.919
haunted house 5 going on here

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.349
I'm a much better comparison is going to
be the I'm sick sled like they have here

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.819
and we see that focus on just

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.189
arm so the low light mode the camera
scan a definite pick up more things

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.990
but this is the closest comparison but I
had was the six light camera but now

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.169
let's turn that off in turn on this

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.419
little HP to light to look at the nice
white flight that we get here so I

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.900
really really like this if you want an
ordinary home

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.150
like that you see here i mean holy cow
right I'm you can really get some focus

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.710
here

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.080
I'm if you wanna task late in specific
things why you might you use a task is

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.909
if you're in the white

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.159
you're trying to focus on a car engine
are specific area they trying to work on

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.699
that's obviously a reason I why you
might do that so but if your gonna

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.169
really hunt around in the dark

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.460
walking on the words heard going out for
fireworks running airplane you know how

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.569
many times if you drop something under
the seat on a nighttime flight

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.169
I know I have that I realize that I will
not go on the plane without this

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.860
I'm against that really helps you find
those things on %uh let's compare to the

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.740
big guy that I got here to just to give
you an example difference

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.650
again this think is that there's gonna I
just for the light differently because

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.400
at the video cameras trying to be smart
in low light

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.419
but this thing is are totally not

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.550
a whole lot brighter cassidy wider a
beam with a bright center so you can get

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.389
a flight plus the center which is

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.150
to be fair something different so this
thing probably would do different for or

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.080
wider

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.210
by we had that and of course you have
this gives you about the difference

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.520
I'm it sa you know compared to an old
incandescent bulb of course

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.939
up the older flashlights you gonna get a
much warmer feel

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:34.900
so you're going to get the colour feel
out have led lights

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.289
but I have to say I am extremely
thrilled with this thing here so much so

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:39.789
that

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.370
I already went by another one from the
same Brandon only because this one was

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.319
out of stock

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.770
I'm birthday was coming up for relative
so I went ahead and purchased

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.879
a nother one had excellent reviews from
the same companies just the one that was

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.279
three times the thickness

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.520
because it had three AAA batteries and
that model so

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.550
I was so confident in this one I really
can't sing a whole lot more praises the

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.039
only negative to this entire thing is
the battery life is a

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:10.520
only 2.5 hours but what you would want
to do with that is probably just carry

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.789
around some rechargeables

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:16.110
AAA batteries I'm and Luke makes good
ones but so too are the other brands as

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.629
well

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:19.860
I'm feeling a modern I'm current one
that cannot

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.330
that doesn't burn down too quickly so I
hear nickel metal hydride batteries tend

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.319
to be better for these lights are based
on something other reviews

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:31.050
I bites overall x1

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.889
