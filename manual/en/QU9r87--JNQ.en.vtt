(footsteps approach)

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.413 size:47% position:23%
THEY SAY DOGS
CAN SMELL FEAR.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.883 size:75% position:38%
DID YOU KNOW THAT
SOME HUMANS CAN AS WELL?

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.753 align:start position:0%
YOU REEK OF IT.

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.055
TYSON.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.192 align:start position:0%
I PREFER 3XK.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:29.696 size:63% position:31%
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE I LEFT YOU

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.298 align:start position:0%
AND DETECTIVE RYAN
IN THAT MOTEL ROOM?

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.167 size:84% position:58%
SOMEBODY! HELP! SOMEBODY!
I NEED SOME HELP IN HERE!

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.601 align:start position:0%
THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.870 align:start position:0%
OR SEE YOU.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.572 size:75% position:38%
I'M AFRAID I'M MUCH MORE
THOROUGH THAN THAT.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.008 align:start size:38% position:63%
YOU DID THI.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.876 align:start size:56% position:44%
YOU KILLED TESSA.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.712 align:start position:0%
SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.
I PREFER BLONDES.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.581 align:start position:0%
REMEMBER?

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.449 align:start position:0%
HERE'S A MUCH MORE
BELIEVABLE STORY--

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.118 align:start position:0%
YOU KILLED TESSA.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.554
IT PRACTICALLY WRITES ITSELF.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:55.822 size:88% position:44%
AFTER ALL, YOU COMMIT MURDER
EVERY DAY IN YOUR MIND

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:58.124 align:start position:0%
FOR YOUR BOOKS.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.959 size:75% position:38%
IT'S NOT HARD TO IMAGINE
THAT YOU'D EVENTUALLY...

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.529 align:start position:0%
CROSS THE LINE.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.664 size:72% position:64%
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
TYSON?

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
FOUR YEARS, CASTLE.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.935 align:start position:0%
I GAVE UP FOUR YEARS

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.504 align:start size:34% position:66%
OF MY LIFE

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.572 size:78% position:61%
PLANNING
THE PERFECT VANISHING ACT

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:15.141 size:81% position:41%
SO THAT THE COPS
WOULD STOP LOOKING FOR ME,

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.742 size:88% position:44%
SO THAT I COULD BEGIN AGAIN,

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.544 size:78% position:39%
COULD BEGIN KILLING AGAIN

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.613 size:66% position:33%
SO THAT I COULD TASTE
THAT FEAR...

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.448 align:start position:0%
AGAIN.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.951 align:start position:0%
FOUR YEARS.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.852 align:start position:0%
YOU RUINED IT.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.254 size:84% position:58%
WELL,
IF IT'S REVENGE YOU WANTED,

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.689 align:start size:69% position:31%
WHY NOT JUST KILL ME?

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.858 size:75% position:38%
WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT?

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.994 size:78% position:39%
OH, NO, NO, IT'S MORE FUN
TO DESTROY YOU.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.229
WHY DO YOU THINK I LET YOU
LIVE THAT NIGHT IN THE MOTEL?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.532 size:78% position:39%
PEOPLE THINK IT'S KILLING
THAT I LIKE,

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.901 size:78% position:39%
BUT MURDER'S JUST AN ACT.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:47.740
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ANTICIPATION,
THE PLANNING.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.311
WATCHING YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER
TAKING A WALK,

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.646
YOU AND BECKETT MAKING LOVE...

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:58.651
STANDING IN YOUR LIVING ROOM,

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.754 align:start position:0%
BEING INSIDE YOUR LIFE,

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:05.691 size:88% position:44%
KNOWING THAT I'M GONNA
TAKE IT ALL AWAY FROM YOU...

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:08.528 align:start position:0%
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.496 size:63% position:69%
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS.

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:13.232 align:start position:0%
OH, PLEASE.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.201
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, YOU GONNA
TELL 'EM THAT I CAME HERE?

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.170 size:88% position:44%
YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE GONNA

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.239 size:59% position:30%
BELIEVE THE LIES
OF A DESPERATE MAN?

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:21.941 align:start size:44% position:56%
BECKETT WILL.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.778 size:78% position:39%
WELL, EVEN IF SHE DOES...

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.213 align:start position:0%
SHE CAN'T SAVE YOU.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.281 align:start position:0%
THERE'S NO TIME.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.350 size:72% position:36%
WHEN THE D.A.
FILES CHARGES TOMORROW,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.151 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE GONNA SEND YOU
TO CENTRAL BOOKING--

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.986 align:start position:0%
THE TOMBS.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:34.987 size:75% position:38%
I HAVE PEOPLE WAITING...

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:36.856 align:start position:0%
FOR YOU.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:39.492 size:88% position:44%
YOU WILL NOT LAST THE NIGHT.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.696
AND THAT'LL BE HER PUNISHMENT--

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.464 size:56% position:28%
BELIEVING THAT
YOU WERE INNOCENT,

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.467 size:56% position:28%
AND NOT BEING ABLE
TO STOP IT.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.103 size:78% position:39%
IT'LL HAUNT HER
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.141
LUCKY FOR YOU...
YOU'LL BE DEAD.

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:07.286
(door clatters)

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.621
