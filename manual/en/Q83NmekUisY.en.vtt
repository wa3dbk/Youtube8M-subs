00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.450
The building had been on fire since Thursday
evening. There were up to twenty fire engines

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.939
here and they were struggling to get to the
fire because the building had actually collapsed

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.450
onto the fire but was still burning underneath.
We removed the roof piece by piece just getting

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.329
it out of the way and the fire brigade would
go in and put that part of the fire out and

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.050
then we'd just repeat the exercise all the
way through the building.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.730
Well what I've been doing here with the
rotating grab and the shear since we arrived

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.380
is chopping up any steel that's got to be
sheared up, loading out, the majority of the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.070
scrap has gone now. So now it's down to
a case of sorting the rubbish that's left.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.250
There's a lot of little bits of metal and
what not left in the rubbish. So we can literally

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.790
pick anything that's, you know, very small
up, so we can get ninety nine per cent of

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.119
the steel out of the rubbish.

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.030
We can work hard to get metal out of the job,
if we get metal we can generate revenue which

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.340
will help pay the costs, keep the costs down
for the insurer and the customer.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.039
The company that own the building, we want
to work very closely with them as they're

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.409
going through a very difficult time. They
want to keep staff, skilled staff employed

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.560
and they want to keep, keep the business working
well and efficiently. The building owners

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.819
want to salvage as much as they can as there's
some valuable machinery in there that they

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.259
want to refurb. We've got to talk with them
on best methods of getting that out safely.

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.159
What's important to do is to make sure that
a customer finds an organisation like ours

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.069
that's going to do a good professional safe
job, doing all the recycling correctly, keeping

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.579
to all the health and safety legislation correctly,
all the environmental legislation correctly.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.459
Rain or shine, we'll do a good job, come
what may.
