00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.680
- The Joy Division project
is an absolute exploration

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.440
of the deepest recesses
of Ian Curtis's music.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.000
There are key musical motifs
that you'll hear,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.560
but it's not a slavish duplicate
of Joy Division.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.040
It's not a cheesy cover version.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.120
It's an absolute new piece of work.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.480
- # Love will tear us apart again

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.000
- It's pretty visceral, you know?
Their music is on edge.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.160
It's dirty, dark, brittle, brutal
sorts of music.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.720
We didn't want to make it, like,
a long, through-composed kind of suite.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.560
We instead wanted to keep it
to where it was,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.800
which is basically like
one smashing monster groove.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.960
Let's see what happens if we take that
and fuck with it. Oh, sorry.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.320

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.480
- The way that that was developed was
Robin Rimbaud, who's known as Scanner,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.480
actually did the first demos
and the dismantling,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.680
he ripped it all apart,
the music of Joy Division,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.600
and did his own version.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600
We then took that into a rehearsal room,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.400
got the band members,
which are a key part of the show,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.560
there's three people, Matt Calvert,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.000
Adam Betts and Rob Gentry,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.680
who are like this trio in the middle,
this electronic band in the middle,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.720
and in the rehearsal room
they took Robin's demos

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.600
and ripped them apart again,
so kind of dismantled them even further

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.040
and explored them, and then
those recordings of that rehearsal

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120
were then taken by the orchestrator,
Tom Trapp,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.360
who then expanded them
into full orchestra.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.160
The visuals are key for us
as an orchestra.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160
We always play in darkness and we like
to have very striking imagery.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.920
- I wasn't such a big fan
of Joy Division.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.200
I hadn't really listened
to their music. I was aware of them.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.920
So I was told to watch the documentary
called Joy Division,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.200
and after watching that, I realised that
they were one of the best bands

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.360
that Britain had produced

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.280
and I became a big fan.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.280
So I was very precious about

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.440
not losing their feel

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.920
or their message or their intensity

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.680
or, you know,
the tonality that they created.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.000
Because they were a punk band, you know,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.440
they weren't trying to be
big and clever necessarily.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.840
But, you know, they struck a chord,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.880
there was a bit of magic chemistry
going on with that band.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.680
- I think the reason why I'm probably
more understanding of this music

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.640
is cos I know about it.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.560
I know the history behind it
and the rhythms and the concepts.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.160
So that way you can imbue that knowledge
to the players.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.800
I think sometimes orchestras do gigs
where they get a conductor that comes up

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.800
and probably doesn't even own
an Eric Clapton CD,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.120
let alone Joy Division,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.480
and then there's no link,
you know, there's no translation,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.400
and then it sounds like this whole
ice-cream white-coat thing, you know,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.360
where they do, you know, like,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.200
you know,
"The so-and-so orchestra plays rock!"

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.800
And then they do this rock gig
in the park

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.040
and everyone has their lunch
and it sounds terrible.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.320
So we're trying to avoid that.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.680
