Hello,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.060
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.730
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.339
Today I want to share some startling new skincare
news,

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.469
that I hope you will share with your friends…

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.019
Yes, you hear a lot about skin cancer,

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.930
which is the most common type of cancer.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.580
And the most dangerous type of skin cancer
is melanoma,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.929
which sadly kills one American every 55 minutes.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.119
I’m sad to tell you that this month, the
alarming news has just been reported

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.300
that in the last three decades, in the United
States,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.030
the incidence of melanoma among non-Hispanic,
white women,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.879
aged 15 to 39, has almost tripled.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.890
That means the actual rate of melanoma has
increased

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.620
from 5 cases per one hundred thousand to 14
cases per hundred thousand.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.579
The worst part is that this disease is entirely
preventable.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.129
This study, beyond of course alerting us to

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.269
the increasing number of cases of a deadly
cancer,

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.320
also demonstrated with statistical certainty
that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.000
the cause of the increased incidence of melanoma

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.710
in this age group was UV radiation.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.500
Moreover, the study showed that the increased
UV exposure

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.760
was from both natural UV from the sun

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.080
as well as artificial UV from tanning salons.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.390
Of note, this increased incidence of melanoma

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.810
was correlated directly with the socio economic
status

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.630
of the people who developed melanoma.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.880
In other words,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.470
the increase in cases of melanoma was much
greater in females

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.390
from higher socio economic groups.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.390
The conclusion was

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.990
those females could afford to spend more time
on vacation

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.530
in the sun and were more able to afford to
go to tanning salons…

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.400
And they also clearly, weren’t protecting
themselves from the sun.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.280
I never tell my patients not to go in the
sun,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.320
because it’s neither practical nor realistic
advice.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.630
Instead, I tell them how to protect themselves

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.630
when they are in the sun,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.380
with the proper use of an effective sunscreen

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.270
and other sun protective behavior.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.850
Fortunately, stopping this epidemic is not
rocket science.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.950
Just protect yourself from the sun when you’re
in it.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.910
And as a random act of kindness,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.790
since as a member of the DermTV community
I know you know how,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.150
tell your five best friends how to enjoy themselves

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.560
in the sun while still protecting themselves
from it.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.379
This way you and they won’t become a statistic

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:39.090
in the next melanoma study.
