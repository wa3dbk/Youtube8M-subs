00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.460
 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.620
Hi everyone.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.120
So it's competition time. We're going to be giving away four Playpad Pro

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.210
game controllers by Nyco. Now these
controllers

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.570
are really fantastic because they work
across a  range of devices.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.869
They have HID built-in which is human
interface devices

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.779
which means that you can use it with
things like PCs and Macs you can also use it

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:29.449
with your

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.460
iPhone, your Android device or pretty
much

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.350
anything out there that has Bluetooth in it
and can accept a game controller

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.090
over Bluetooth.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.059
It works incredibly well and there's a
great range of games available now

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.559
that can fully support game controllers
on smartphones.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.960
Brilliant. So if you want to win one of these
fantastic game

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.280
controllers, all you need to do is leave a

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.070
open to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.090
those people in the USA and in Europe, I'm afraid other territories we

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.590
won't be able to accept your entry this time.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.149
We'll be giving away these controllers on the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.630

USA.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.220
All decisions are final, and when we pull
