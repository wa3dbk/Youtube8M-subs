Hi, I am Annaliese Dayes and welcome back
to Celebeauty on Videojug Beauty.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.360
Now, good girl gone bad Rihanna loves to tantalize
us in many ways, but most definitely, with

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.650
her styling and that is what we are going
to be recreating today.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.550
Her wild tom boyish style.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.000
[Music]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.150
So, for outfit one, Rihanna is breaking all
of the style rules.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.220
Believe it or not this is her smart casual
look and it starts off with a pair of ripped

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.680
jeans.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.000
These jeans are from Topshop.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.910
They are 45 pounds and they are from the brand
Moto.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.300
They are boyfriend slouchy jeans.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.750
As you can see loads of rips down the front.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.360
They have got some great turn offs and they
are literally, like, you just snatched them

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.660
out of your boyfriend's wardrobe.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900
All right, this has got to be the bargain
of the day.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.010
It is this wicked kind of overgrown cropped
tee shirt from Missguided and it is 13.99.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.900
So, I absolutely, love this Holographic tee
shirt just because of the shine you give when

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.740
you walk past somebody and it is all about
standing out which is exactly like Rihanna.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.000
I am going to team up this shirt with some
amazing holographic heels.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.180
They are from Boohoo and they are 35 pounds.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.320
This great holographic look is perfect for
the dance floor and they have got some great

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.780
chunky heels as well, so they are pretty easy
to walk in.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.640
It is all about matching your shoes with your
bag.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.130
I got this one from New Look at only 5.99.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.750
What is great about this purse is that it
fits your IPhone absolutely perfectly.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.909
So, outfit 2, is a little bit wild, a little
bit rebellious, definitely, like Rihanna.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.650
This awesome cropped tank is from Urban Outfitters.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.810
It is 26 pounds and it is by the brand, Lazy
Oaf.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.740
Rihanna loves her slogan tee shirts and loves
getting that mid-drift out, perfect combo.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.140
These acid wash hot pants are from Topshop
and they are by the brand, Moto.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.810
These are definitely, super short and not
for the super shy at all.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.680
She likes to grab a little bit of attention
or should I say a lot of attention and these

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.070
shorts do that perfectly.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.720
It is rugged as well.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.630
You know how she doesn't like that prim and
proper look.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.050
And you are definitely not going to be missed
in this amazing bomber that is from Topshop

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.980
at 60 pounds and it is from the brand Kuccia.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.790
This is the perfect tribute to the 80s.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.069
Very shell suit like, very in your face, very
grab attention, again, just like Rihanna.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.640
To add to this look, we have got this pair
of classic Converse, Chuck Taylor's.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.010
We love these and you can tell that I have
obviously been loving them because they are

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.010
totally worn to death.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.390
But, I have got to say that Converse look
much better when they have been battered up

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.390
a little.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.220
I got these ones at ASOS at 50 pounds, but
you can also get them from the Converse website.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.660
So, this is one of the reasons I love Forever
21.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.160
This necklace is just four pounds ninety.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
It is gold.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.180
It is chunky and it is fabulous.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.480
It really completes that 80s look.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.920
These sunglasses are just four pounds ninety,
again from Forever 21.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.840
Absolutely, loving these.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.780
Feeling very retro, very ready to go and very
Rihanna.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.260
So, there you have it our two Rihanna inspired
looks.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.450
Definitely, good girl gone bad and if you
would like to see a Miranda Kerr inspired
