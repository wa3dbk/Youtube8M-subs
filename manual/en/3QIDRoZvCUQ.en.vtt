Hi! This is Elise McMahon for Expert Village
and in this video series we’re talking about

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.460
how to travel with your dog. If you would
like to find out more about my services you

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.420
can visit website at canineheadstart.com.
In this clip we’re going to be talking little

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.640
bit more about traveling with your dog in
the summer time, it’s an extremely important

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.970
issue regarding summer time issue as your
dog is comfortable in the temperature that

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.869
is correct for your dog. Dog’s normal temperature
body temperature is much higher than ours.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.730
Normal dog temperature is between 100-102.
So they’re naturally hotter than we are.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.121
We sweat through our entire skin surface,
we have a much large surface area which we

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:49.290
can get rid of heat and dogs do not, they
sweat through their mouth from panting and

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.010
sweat in the pads of their feet. They do not
get rid of heat the same way we do. So it’s

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.640
really important that it might be warm and
uncomfortable in the car for us but it’s

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.769
potentially deadly in the car for the dog.
So one thing you really do have to think about

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.940
it if you are traveling with your dog in the
summer is that you can put them in a place

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.120
which is safe for them. If you’re traveling
with your dog in a crate and you’re in an

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.330
outdoor event which is safe you can leave
your car open the dog is safe in the crate.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.620
You can put an extra little locking device
on the crate to make sure that the dog doesn’t

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:35.250
get out somehow just clip a little lock on
the door like that. So I kept the back open

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.560
to come around this side. You can see that
I got the windows open and if your dog is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.440
safely in a crate you could in fact open the
windows a little bit more. If your dog is

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.720
not in a crate but are riding loose in the
car and you have to leave him in the car and

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.020
it’s summer you want to have the windows
open but not enough that they can get out.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.550
You can actually buy little screens that you
can place in your car. You can get that and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.530
use that if your dog is not a dog that’s
going to be jumping out. If you’re fearful

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.020
that your dog might jump out you can always
fasten them in the car but have the windows

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.070
down. Many, many pets die every year in traveling
in a summer with their owners and the owners

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.250
just go in some place for 15 minutes and crack
the window that much they come out and the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.040
dog is dead from heat exposure. So it really
is an issue of major concern, it does not

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.030
mean you should not travel with your dog in
the summer time it just means that you need

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.090
to be a little bit more careful and conscious
of where you’re leaving your dog parked

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.791
in the shade. If you’re going to be going
out and traveling around during the day and

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:53.640
you’re staying at a hotel might be better
leave your dog in the hotel. Whatever you

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.600
do make sure you have realized that the dog
could not tolerate the same type of temperatures

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.140
that we can and keep your dog’s health in
mind.
