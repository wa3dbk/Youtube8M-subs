00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:34.200
The Super Adventure surprises you right away for its lightness and for its balance

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.900
The engine is smooth and steady, but very responsive to the accelerator 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.800
Itâ€™s on mixed routes that it shows all its worth: braking, descent around curves, and acceleration reveal quite a sportsbike, a devil in disguise.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.800
The stability is excellent thanks to the WP semi-active suspension system, and the engine is awesome, 160 HP ready to race

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.200
Then there is safety, thanks to the MSC system, which handles the traction control, and to the ABS cornering

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
For me the Super Adventure is the best choice around today
