After way too many months or really years
of speculation, rumors, casting, delays, reverse

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.960
delays, set photos and actual photos, we finally
have our first look at the next film in the

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.510
DC Cinematic Universe.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.340
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.634
Also, the reason this video is coming out
way later than all the other breakdowns, and

00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:22.390
therefore it'll get like 3 views, the trailer
was supposed to come out on Monday.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.680
Then it leaked and it was released early,
and I was away for the weekend so I couldn't

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.100
talk about it, blah blah etc.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.120
Anyway, let’s break it down.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.190
*clip*
So in this trailer, the main gist that I got

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.300
in the beginning is that we see the repercussions
of Superman pretty much just wiping out Metropolis.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.879
Which I think is pretty cool, because there
would be consequences for that.

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.470
This is also clearly going to become a thread
in the superhero movie genre, as both this

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.739
movie and Captain America: Civil War are tackling
the ideas of death and destruction and all

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.739
that.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.700
So people are divided on whether Superman
is good or bad or a bit both.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.420
We here lots of voices debating this while
the camera zooms in on a Superman statue with

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.249
the words false god written on it.

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:11.730
The voices include those of Jesse Eisenberg
aka Lex Luthor and possibly Neil DeGrasse

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.730
Tyson.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.800
That’s a little weird.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.300
We also hear Jeremy Irons aka Alfred talking
about either Superman or Lex Luthor or Batman

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.520
or really anyone.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.490
So I’m assuming Bruce Wayne, who’s already
been fighting smaller crimes in Gotham, says

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.100
someone needs to take care of this guy.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.550
And so he goes to take him down.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.110
That’s pretty much the story from this trailer.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.250
The rest is visuals.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.860
We get to see the new Batmobile in action,
the Batman costume, and something that I found

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.500
interesting is this shot here, which is pretty
reminiscent of the Nolan Batman, who also

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.300
stood on big towers with his cape in the wind.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.550
There are other iconic Batman images of him
standing like this, but Nolan was the first

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.550
thing to come to my mind.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.110
Speaking of those movies, this Batman looks
like he’s going to be way darker than Bale’s

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.110
Batman.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.110
Which is saying a lot.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.400
And look, originally I wasn’t entirely sold
on Ben Affleck as Batman, but now I’m like,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.400
yeah, I see it.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400
That could be cool.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.280
We also get to see this shot here, which is
the clip from Comic Con that everyone was

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280
going crazy about.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.590
Then we finally here Ben Affleck’s Batman
voice and his last line in this trailer is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.730
hands down the best part of this trailer.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.110
Seriously, that is great.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.110
That was the moment when I was like this Batman
could be awesome.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.110
The Batman voice is good.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.700
I’m glad he’s not going full throat disease
like Bale but still making it pretty gravelly.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.570
I would’ve preferred something more like
Kevin Conroy, but oh well.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.640
It’s still pretty great.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.700
Then boom Batman v Superman logo, Dawn of
Justice, March 2016.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.690
Something a little disappointing is we don’t
see any Lex Luthor or Wonder Woman or Cyborg

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.980
or Robin who’s apparently going to be in
this, but it’s a teaser, so they can’t

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.980
show much.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.420
We do however get a couple of little easter
eggs, like these SWAT guys kneeling for Superman

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.280
with little Superman logos on their arms and
also in this shot of Batman we see a Riddler

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.990
question mark graffitied on the wall.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.490
So overall, if I wasn’t already super psyched
for this movie, this trailer gets me even

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.490
more excited.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.510
It looks really dark, which isn’t necessarily
a big positive, but it’s good to see them

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.230
keep a consistent tone from Man of Steel.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.460
I was one of those people who didn’t love
Man of Steel, but I thought it was pretty

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.460
and entertaining.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.650
Add my favorite superhero to that world, why
wouldn’t I be pumped for it.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.010
So that’s the trailer breakdown for Batman
v Superman.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.010
Did you like the teaser?

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.410
Do you think this movie will be good?

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.510
