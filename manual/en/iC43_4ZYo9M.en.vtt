00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.580
Queen Elsa of Arendelle

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.000
Princess Anna of Arendelle

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.590
Oh here? I guess I shouldn’t... but okay

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.590
Hi

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.040
Hi me?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.500
Hi

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.460
You look beautiful

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.260
Thank you! So do you!

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.590
I mean you don’t just look but you are really beautiful!

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.820
Thank you

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.260
Well, this is what a party looks like

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.400
It’s surprisingly warm

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.490
What is that amazing smell?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.290
Chocolate!

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.730
Your Majesty, here’s the Toiletless Duke

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.790
Weselton!

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.440
Duke of Weselton, Majesty

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.300
As your nearest trading partner I would like
to ask the Queen for a first dance

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.240
One, two, three, jump!

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.370
Thank you, but I don’t dance

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.360
Maybe my sister

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.290
Alright! Lucky girl!

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.900
Oh, I don’t 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.500
Say if you faint! I’ll catch you!

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.320
Sorry

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.890
Agile as a peacock!

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.570
À propos, excellent that you opened the gates 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.500
Why were they even closed?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.590
Do you know the reason?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.090
No

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.560
No… fine, oops!

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.850
I’m like the shaving whitecap of the dance floor!

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.150
And like a headless chicken I fly

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.580
Tell me when you’re ready for a new dance, miss

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.270
Wow! That was feisty!

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.550
You bet! Especially with those heels

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.050
Everything alright?

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.550
Really great! This is lovely!

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.350
How I wish it could always be like this

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.150
You said it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.050
But it can’t

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.650
Why not?

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.050
It just can’t!

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.550
Excuse me for a moment
