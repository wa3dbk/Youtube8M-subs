00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.133
WOMAN:
Many artists aren't content

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.667
to let their art
just sit there.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.033
They want it to move.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:11.800
If you take a look at
Alexander Calder's mobiles,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.500
or George Rickey's sculptures,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.400
you'll see examples
of art in motion.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.600
Taking inspiration
from these artists,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.500
I'm going to demonstrate
how to make kinetic sculptures,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.200
composed of a rotary hub,
rotating blades,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.967
and sails that move with
direct air currents like this.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:33.100
(blowing)

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.733
WOMAN:
Let's start from the bottom.

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.900
Styrofoam makes a great base.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.567
Next, take a piece
of sculpture wire

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:41.000
for a vertical hub.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.167
Towards the bottom,
I've formed a circular foot,

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:47.533
then bent the remaining wire
so that it can be

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.933
pushed into the styrofoam.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.000
I then form two small
U shaped pieces

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.633
which I'm using to
secure the wire to the base.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.900
(styrofoam cracking)

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.700
WOMAN:
To make it steadier,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.633
cut a cardboard circle
with a hole in the middle

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:17.200
to fit over the wire,
and glue that to the base.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.600
Next, cover the wire
with a paper straw.

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:25.367
As I apply the first bead,

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:29.167
I'm going to glue it
to the cardboard,

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:34.533
and then also to
the vertical hub for strength.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.500
Add a couple more large,
wooden beads,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.667
before creating
a rotating blade.

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:45.967
For the blade, I'm going to use
the same aluminum wire,

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:47.833
but you could also
switch to copper wire

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:49.733
if you wanted to add
some more colour.

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:52.833
Create a tight loop
in the centre,

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:55.600
just a little wider
than the hub,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.400
and then bend the edges.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.867
These can always
be reshaped later.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.367
Add the next bead
to hold it in place.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.267
For best rotation,

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:13.200
use round beads on
either side of the blade.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.367
A square bead
might catch on the corners.

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:25.533
Keep alternating beads and wire,

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.000
until you reach
the top of the hub.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.667
Now the beads
are going to make it ridged,

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.900
so the inner wire doesn't bend.

00:02:36.267 --> 00:02:38.200
Gravity's going to naturally

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.000
pull the beads down
against the blades.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.867
To prevent that,

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:49.600
glue the first bead
above each blade to the hub,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.300
and leave just
a little gap in between.

00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:57.433
The last step
is to create the sails.

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:59.900
A variety of lightweight paper
could be used.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.800
I like foil paper,
because it's easy to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.067
bend around the wire,
and can be reshaped later.

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:09.967
To make a sail, I fold it,

00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:17.233
and cut a shape so that
I have two matching sides.

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:23.833
Cover the inside with some glue.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.733
And wrap it around
the wire like this.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.733
Once everything is dry,

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:47.000
adjust all the wire blades
and all of the sails,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.200
so that they don't
run in to each other,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.033
and they can
catch the air currents.

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:53.233
The sculpture may be finished

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.000
by decorating
the sails with marker,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.967
or covering the base
with paper or acrylic paint.

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:00.400
There you have it.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.767
it's fun, it's whimsical,
it's kinetic.

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:05.333
Give it a try.
