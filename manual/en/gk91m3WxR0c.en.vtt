perception alberto i don't know but i couldn't
understand a word she said

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.550
but keep cool

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.459
you know well english-language learners for
more than twenty years

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.390
history university degrees

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.259
this is the first time she's been audited
litter and here is that the extra scrutiny

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.860
did have a p_h_d_ in tibet teacher state school

are you going after one particular except
we're not going to any expense including spanish

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.939
accent who has to be faulted with forces are
being taught english

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.549
and then refer to come as a comma

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.839
plea bargain a misunderstanding english professor
resembled palace disagrees saints that is

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:23.629
actually shelled that non-native speakers
make better english teachers for his critics

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.369
say he's going after immigrant teachers

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.780
obsolete

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.760
i grew up in across from a principal polish
and they certainly so thankful to have the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.789
answer

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.279
but here you are separate and uh...

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:42.279
started hurting out that the top of my teachers
spoke proficient in english ms really great

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:46.919
yeah i don't know what it is that good work
that this is about people learning from learning

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.290
english from people who were speaking

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.799
bush and certainly speaking a properly and
it's about this guy just called for

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.049
you know justin ask going after people because
he's a racist and this is racism

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.770
if yours for example arizonans dangerous for
me and he's in charge of children

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.959
an infinite sort of that again this is ridiculous
but isn't important

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.549
if it's so fricking important are these guys
teach our kids english

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.809
and i think we all agree with that it it's
because they want these kids to succeed

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.949
shouldn't someone who also speaks their language

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.829
teach them english

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.879
so that when they get stuff wrong you can
explain it to 'em note that since that time

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.299
either

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.589
what's wrong with the what the album dot obvious
is that i mean if your goal is to teach these

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:36.970
kids to succeed

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.060
so that they continue on so they finish high
school so they hopefully go to college so

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.750
they get jobs and they work in the economy
and they spend money and they keep things

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.730
growing so that we don't get stagnant we don't
have a result with a bunch of kids who drop

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.969
out of school at thirteen fourteen fifteen
sixteen years old

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.519
they need to speak english and we do

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.999
whatever it is

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.039
to make sure that that happens

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.499
immigrate to actually do

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.319
to put

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.749
a teacher with an english accent interrupted
school there

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:05.529
who spoke

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.069
you know it improperly

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.729
and see if they could sort of auditorium and
kick that teacher ilya right at bradley well

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.629
that you have right white person there i've
ever done

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.250
it's going to do this it will be a good since
they were over fair

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.779
arm

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.169
don't work
