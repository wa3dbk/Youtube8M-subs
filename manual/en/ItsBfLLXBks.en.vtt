00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.750
Apologies to our regular viewers - the holiday
season is still catching up to me and with

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.440
any luck we're back on track for consistent
Friday features.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.510
Sadly I'm not going to cover the entire month
I've missed, but there's more than enough

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.869
news in just the last seven days, so lets
jump right in.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.560
This is the Friday News Wrap-Up for the 13th
of January, 2012.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.700
Kicking off the week is some surprising news
as Nyrthos, a simply stunningly rendered 2D

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.620
Action-RPG, takes its project to mobile devices.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.329
Not only will players be able to follow the
journey of their character on a browser, they'll

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.010
also be able to load up on their iOS device
of choice too.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.500
The game is slated to sport unique ways to
unlock content including world changing events

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.929
dictated by the player along with the ability
to set up your own village.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.070
What do you get when you combine a shooter
with tower defense and zombies?

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.899
Insert a joke about the exploitation of the
zombie concept in gaming.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.220
But in all seriousness, Bye Bye Brain: App-ocalypse
by Weekend Game Studio and Plain Concepts

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.030
is making the journey to iOS and Android devices
and is slated to be free with in-app purchases.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.640
We'll see how things are going closer to the
release date.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.130
It's common to complain about the iOS's lack
of inherent physical controls for video games

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.470
- as a reviewer it's my obligation to point
out that developers should think more creatively

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.350
with what IS on offer, but then again sometimes
you just want a fast, simple arcade title

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.259
to waste your time.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.369
iControlPad, much like iCade, provides physical
controls to the iPhone, albeit with limited

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.369
support.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.280
However, those with jailbroken devices can
pick up Blutrol, a 'touch' emulator for your

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.829
device that adds support for basic controls
(analogue not yet supported) so you can now

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.320
play Super Crate Box the way it was almost
always intended.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.950
One thing that didn't feel like it was missing
from Madfinger's shooter Shadowgun was a multiplayer

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.950
mode.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.340
The game was much better for its focus on
a story driven experience, even if it stumbled

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.549
along the way.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.340
However, multiplayer is finally coming to
the Shadowgun universe, though fans of the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.569
game will need to pick up a separate App and
gameplay is currently slated to be restricted

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.730
to 8 player Deathmatch combat.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.650
Given the limited appeal of combat in the
original game I'm not sure how well this will

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.440
hold up.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.600
In retrospect, it almost seems like the addition
of Cthulhu to a JRPG game was always meant

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.200
to be and thankfully Cthulhu Saves The World
on Xbox Live's Indie store was ready and able

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.960
to fill that niche.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.540
Things haven't stopped for this well received
retro-tastic title and iOS gamers can hopefully

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.659
expect a port of the title some time in the
future.

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.599
More details when they're available.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.720
Those who have dipped their toes in to Galaxy
On Fire 2 by Fishlabs will likely agree that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.700
it is, by and large, a pretty game.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.510
That said, iDevices have come a long way since
its original SD release and so Fishlabs have

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.550
kicked things up a notch and are releasing
a 'HD' version for iPhone 4S and iPad 2's

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.129
later this quarter.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.670
Those who already own the game need not fear
their pennies being pinched as the upgrade

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.840
will be free to SD owners and progress can
be transferred.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.790
When you think of Studio Pixel, you think
of Cave Story.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.880
And when you think Cave Story you think of
solid metroidvania-like platforming with a

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.560
heart of gold and beautifully designed pixel-art
graphics.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.940
So when you hear about Studio Pixel on the
App Store, you expect more than well... a

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.170
mini-game.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.080
In fact their recent paid-for App, Azarashi,
is barely even that - if you saw this game

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.209
in Wario Ware you'd think nothing more of
it compared to the dozens of other similar

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.150
limited 'experiences'.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.489
The game itself is a skill-tester, rewarding
points for catching keyrings as they fall

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.640
and unlocking new keyrings to add to the set.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.370
There's a charm to its graphics, but unless
you're a die-hard fan of the company this

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.860
is more cash-grab than fun and substantial
gameplay.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.760
See here's the thing - when I had an opportunity
to talk to Vlambeer way back when Muffin Knight

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.290
was first released, the thing that struck
me most about the situation was just how calm

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.819
they were and how much they believed in their
product being (ultimately) superior.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.720
While Muffin Knight had had a head start,
SCB is quickly catching up, with updates already

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.090
rolling in thick and fast.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.080
In fact as of right now the second update
not that far off (that's 40 MILLION crates

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.820
collected worldwide!).

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.050
Super Crate Box is fast, fun, hard and only
getting better with time - at this rate we'll

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.140
have to reassess our review sooner than later!

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.470
Once again a big thanks to our viewers in
2011 - despite a rough patch at the start

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.530
of the year where I found myself suddenly
unemployed, we've jumped back in the saddle

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.300
and all of us at AppSpy are hoping to give
you our best in 2012.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.420
Don't forget to jump on Twitter, Facebook
and our website for more news and info (including

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.080
upcoming competitions).

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.800
Have a great weekend!
