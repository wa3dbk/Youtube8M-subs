00:00:00.376 --> 00:00:01.895
- Hi, we're Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:01.895 --> 00:00:03.051
- And today we're trying out

00:00:03.051 --> 00:00:04.677
from Little Live Pets,

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:06.829
the Lil' Mouse House.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.600
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.642
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers ♫

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:16.152
We were sent this Lil'
Mouse House to try out

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:17.393
and it sure looks cute.

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:18.976
It comes with a mouse toy

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.350
that runs around apparently,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.731
and when you put it in the house

00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:23.110
it does different things including

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.092
one of these mice wheels.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.090
I always like those.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.621
This you can get other mice for it.

00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:31.201
It seems to go for around $20.

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:32.311
If you can't find it locally,

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:34.365
I'll put a link to it
down below this video.

00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:35.708
Roxanna, have you tried out any

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:37.810
of the Little Live Pet animals?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.756
I haven't either.

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.454
So, the mouse will be our first one.

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:42.343
It does look cute.

00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:43.510
We've got the case here,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.454
very cute.

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:46.017
Got a handle on it.

00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:48.542
You'd normally keep your
mouse in here I believe.

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:50.993
It's got the hamster wheel.

00:00:50.993 --> 00:00:52.374
I don't know, do they
call it a mouse wheel?

00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:53.752
On the other end there,

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.623
and then here is a little door

00:00:57.087 --> 00:00:58.533
that there's a little locking latch

00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.937
so the mouse doesn't escape.

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:01.619
You can put that down
so the door won't open

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:03.727
and there's an add on section

00:01:03.727 --> 00:01:06.043
for outdoor play

00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:07.482
outside of the house.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.206
And here's the mouse.

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:10.823
Let me show you all these things up close.

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:12.061
Here is the mouse.

00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:12.999
This is very cute.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:14.491
Do you know if this one
has a name, Roxanna?

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:16.428
- [Voiceover] I believe it does.

00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:18.297
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:21.141
It's got batteries in it apparently

00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:22.955
because you can activate it and wake it up

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:24.599
so again, there's the mouse.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:26.458
We'll see how that works.

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:29.236
Here's that outdoor play zone attachment

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:33.302
and here is the mouse house

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:35.411
with the wheel on one end,

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:36.826
the floor inside,

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:40.298
some lines here that are
open so the mouse can breathe

00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:43.336
and then your little door
here that you can lock

00:01:46.116 --> 00:01:47.227
or unlock.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.356
Okay, Roxanna has found out
what the deal is on the mouse.

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:51.708
What's the name to start with?

00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:52.528
- [Voiceover] Blossom.

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:54.090
- [Voiceover] This is Blossom.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.988
Pretty appropriate name

00:01:54.988 --> 00:01:57.623
with those flower baby ears there.

00:01:57.623 --> 00:01:59.221
And, how does it work?

00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:00.177
How do you activate it?

00:02:00.177 --> 00:02:01.496
And does it have batteries?

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:03.973
- [Voiceover] Well, it's sort
of like the robotic fish.

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:07.054
On its back it has the
two little dots there.

00:02:07.054 --> 00:02:08.170
- [Voiceover] Oh the two little bumps.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.181
Yes, I see that.

00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.815
- [Voiceover] So, you pet it.

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:14.399
You need to go and like
press down on both of them

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:15.079
in order

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.399
to have the whole cycle.

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.859
- [Voiceover] All right.

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.730
I'm gonna put my finger on it.

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.763
- [Voiceover] There's
an on and off button.

00:02:23.763 --> 00:02:24.923
- [Voiceover] Oh (laughs).

00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:26.047
Thank you for that.

00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:27.485
Where would I find it?

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:29.098
Oh here!

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:29.946
Oh, it's the mouth.
- [Voiceover] In the mouth.

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:31.529
- [Voiceover] The mouth is on, off.

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:32.699
Okay.

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:36.847
(whirring)
Okay.

00:02:37.942 --> 00:02:39.316
I guess it was booting up there.

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:40.529
Now we'll try.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.349
(chirping)

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.914
Is it voice activated or
anything, do you know?

00:02:46.035 --> 00:02:48.745
- [Voiceover] It's not but
it does make mouse noises.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:49.617
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:49.617 --> 00:02:50.774
(squeaking)

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:52.775
It says it makes 25 different sounds.

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:54.066
I wonder if I touch the back here.

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:56.381
(squealing)

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:01.405
(chirping)

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:02.613
(Parris laughs)

00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:03.759
That's pretty cute.

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.740
(squealing)

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.664
- [Voiceover] The more you pet it,

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:08.967
the more excited and happy it becomes.

00:03:08.967 --> 00:03:10.193
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it
got pretty excited there.

00:03:10.193 --> 00:03:11.857
All right, let's see how
it works with the house

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.818
and with the play area and with the wheel.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.714
Okay Roxanna, show us
what this mouse can do.

00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:18.932
(squeaking)

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:20.543
Whoa!

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:21.473
It can escape,

00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:23.127
well that's pretty true of mice.

00:03:26.137 --> 00:03:27.636
Okay, now normally that would be hooked up

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:29.463
to the house so

00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:32.342
why don't we hook it up to the house here.

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:33.867
Can you open the hatch or...

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:34.758
Whoa!

00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:35.874
- [Roxanna] Oh my gosh!

00:03:35.874 --> 00:03:37.279
- All right, now if
you pet it on the back,

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.331
does that wake it up?
(squeaking)

00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:39.849
I see, so it probably goes to sleep

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:40.668
to save battery.

00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:41.454
Good idea.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.351
(squeaking)

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:45.295
All right, you let it go crazy.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:48.760
Crazy.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.578
(squeaking)

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.861
Huh.

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:03.526
Whoa!

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:06.583
Oh my gosh, it went right
onto the wheel, amazing!

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:08.493
(squeaking)

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:09.923
(Parris laughs)

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:19.756
Both the mouse and I are in trouble.

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:20.993
(Roxanna laughs)

00:04:22.893 --> 00:04:23.689
There we go!

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:24.819
- [Roxanna] Whoa!

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.918
(chirping)

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.721
Wow, it really goes.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.107
- [Voiceover] I think it
ran off all it's energy.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:34.827
- [Voiceover] I see,

00:04:34.827 --> 00:04:36.268
that could be exactly it.

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:38.656
(chirping)

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.687
Ready to explode now.

00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:46.227
(mechanical whirring)

00:04:52.468 --> 00:04:54.083
(chirping)

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:01.327
Do mice actually act like this?

00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:02.804
We've never had a mouse.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.432
(chirping)

00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:06.544
They're pretty

00:05:06.544 --> 00:05:07.500
intensive.
- [Roxanna] (laughs) It went

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.876
right into the wall.

00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:11.231
(whirring)

00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:18.601
Does it need some more help?

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:20.676
- [Voiceover] It's just not
quite at the right angle.

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.121
I assume it'll eventually back up.

00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:23.964
Yeah, there we go.

00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:25.655
It'll get out one way or another.

00:05:27.632 --> 00:05:29.560
You know the mice over at

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.949
PetSmart in the thing,

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.417
in the little display there,

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:33.669
they're never quite like this.

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:34.387
(Roxanna laughs)

00:05:34.387 --> 00:05:35.805
Have you ever noticed,
they're usually sleeping?

00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:38.428
Okay, let's see what it does

00:05:38.428 --> 00:05:40.650
when it's in free range mode.

00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:43.821
Goes to sleep.

00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:45.412
Like the PetSmart, it'll go to sleep.

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:47.725
(chirping)

00:05:58.743 --> 00:06:00.296
There it goes.

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.293
(Parris laughs)

00:06:07.852 --> 00:06:09.259
Whoa, whoa!

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:12.051
(chirping)

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:14.643
I can see the speed--

00:06:14.643 --> 00:06:15.819
- [Roxanna] Yeah it's...

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.050
I don't know where it's going.

00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:20.987
(whirring)

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.627
- [Voiceover] I can see
this being a lot of fun

00:06:23.627 --> 00:06:25.556
for little kids that
love to chase it around,

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:26.618
don't you think?

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:27.547
- Yeah.

00:06:27.547 --> 00:06:29.638
- The Little Live Pet Lil' Mouse House,

00:06:29.638 --> 00:06:30.878
what'd you think of this?

00:06:30.878 --> 00:06:32.593
- I thought it was pretty cool

00:06:32.987 --> 00:06:34.142
because, you see,

00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:37.096
even though I'm older and stuff,

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:39.361
I might not feel totally
like chasing it around

00:06:39.361 --> 00:06:40.364
all over the house.

00:06:40.364 --> 00:06:40.973
- Right.

00:06:40.973 --> 00:06:43.144
- Watch it run around in its habitat.

00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:44.935
- It does a lot of cool things in here.

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:45.951
It seems to work pretty well.

00:06:46.921 --> 00:06:47.988
You know though

00:06:47.988 --> 00:06:48.931
when Blossom grows up,

00:06:48.931 --> 00:06:50.593
you know what Blossom wants to do?

00:06:51.696 --> 00:06:54.196
Wants to be a regular cast member

00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:56.151
on The Big Bang Theory.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.506
Okay, nevermind.

00:06:58.506 --> 00:07:01.155
And Roxanna what ages is
this toy intended for?

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:02.175
- Five and up.

00:07:02.175 --> 00:07:02.901
- Five and up

00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:03.844
so we got quite a few

00:07:03.844 --> 00:07:05.930
kids I think would really like this toy.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.687
If you can't find it locally
we'll have a link to it

00:07:07.687 --> 00:07:08.718

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:31.055
♫ And you don't have to go too far

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:35.191
♫ Rainy day dreamers we're
always where you are ♫
