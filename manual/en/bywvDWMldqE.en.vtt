00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.039
Welcome back. I hope your break was refreshing,
that you were able to spend some quality time

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.230
with friends – and perhaps some time alone
with a good book. I have been reading Jean

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.220
Edward Smith’s, FDR. It reminds me that
the San Diego State we know is in many ways

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.050
a child of the depression.
Our predecessors broke ground for the construction

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:35.370
of this campus on Oct 7, 1929, about three
weeks before the stock market crash that marked

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.089
the beginning of the great depression. Soon
national unemployment was running at 24%.

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:48.420
There was no social security, no unemployment
insurance, no Fair Labor Standards Act.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.340
In the difficult years that followed, state
budgets were slashed, student fees increased

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.650
sharply, and, for a while, faculty and staff
were paid in script. And yet, through the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.310
hard work and dedication of our predecessors
(then) San Diego State Teacher’s College

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.390
survived and prospered.
You and I are no less able than they were;

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.450
no less dedicated or hard-working. Our university
is no less important or vital.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.729
We are in for a tough semester and difficult
year ahead, but San Diego State prospered

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.700
even in the face of the great depression;
it will prosper again. During the worst economic

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.590
time in our nation’s history, Depression-era
programs such as the Works Progress Administration

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.039
were employing artists nationwide to create
public art.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:50.350
Those artists produced murals such as the
one behind me, which was found on our campus

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.439
and restored just a few years ago. The murals
depict men and women who were the heart and

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.499
soul of San Diego’s recovery. In very much
the same way, San Diego State’s students,

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:06.789
faculty and staff are working to rebuild California’s
future.

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:14.780
It may be little comfort to know that new
student interest in SDSU has never been higher,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.140
but it is a great tribute to your work.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:27.530
SDSU received a record 61,632 undergraduate
applications for the coming fall semester.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.990
Unfortunately, we will have the resources
to enroll only about 5,500 new undergrads

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.560
from that pool.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.390
Many eligible applicants will be turned away
as we shrink our enrollment by 4,600 students.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.590
This is both a personal tragedy for those
hard-working students and a huge loss for

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.330
our region and state.
Had we reduced admissions proportionately

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.800
to the reduction in state funding we would
have been forced to turn away more than 7,500

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.060
eligible students. The hard work and creativity
of our faculty and staff (in spite of furloughs)

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.680
is allowing us to enroll and serve approximately
3,000 students on whom the state of California

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.680
has turned its back.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.230
Our society will surely pay for this shortsightedness
in future years. In the meantime, we will

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.860
continue to urge our state to once again invest
in its future and the future of its citizens.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.320
Financially, SDSU continues to operate with
an abundance of caution due to California’s

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320
budget challenges.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.310
In spite of an encouraging budget proposed
by the Governor, I am concerned that tough

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.760
times may still lie ahead.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.930
In preparing for those budgetary challenges,
we will continue to be open in our decision-making

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.870
and information-sharing. I encourage each
of you to participate in this conversation.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.030
SDSU’s shared-governance structure has served
us well and resulted in wise recommendations

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.410
from the President’s Budget Advisory Committee.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.120
This proven collaboration provides the best
vehicle to maintain San Diego State’s momentum

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.350
into the new decade.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.590
Moving forward, San Diego State will continue
to provide high quality education. Because

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.930
of your many individual sacrifices, San Diego
State begins the spring semester with a class

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.240
schedule that allows students to stay on track
to graduate in four years; We will do our

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.069
best to protect the jobs of our talented faculty
and staff.

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.250
You are SDSU – and while California’s
lack of resources may at times challenge our

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.699
best intentions, it does not diminish our
commitment work together to preserve and defend

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:03.789
this great university. Thank you for all you
do in spite of furloughs and budget cuts to

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.899
serve our students and the future of California.
