00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.580
You. Got. Booze!

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.580
Shut Up! Cartoons

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.910
Too much you make noise!

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.890
The legend is true!

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.910
I give up! You win, stinky fish man!

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.640
I have heard of you, Wise One. Your inebriated
style is known throughout the seven kingdoms.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.920
Will you honor me by sharing the knowledge
of your martial style?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.210
You got booze?

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.010
Yech. There's a penny I'm not picking
up.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.170
Ms. Jess! Little warriors! Gather 'round.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.520
I want to introduce you to an important man.
A champion of a style so impressive that I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.520
witnessed it even best Master Park. Young Samurais,
meet the legendary Drunken Master.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.520
Ned! He's homeless, he smells - he only
You can't just bring him to a daycare 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.550
full of children. You don't know what he's
capable of.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.590
How judgmental. Just because a man has no
domicile doesn't mean he can't flower great

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.909
blossoms of wisdom.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:46.470
Princess.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.580
Hey. HEY!

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.909
Do something, Ned!

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.909
Okay, okay, fear not. A solution presents
itself!

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.360
Ahh, applying ceremonial war paint I see...
I have the elixir you require to start my

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.200
training.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.350
YOU GOT BOOZE!

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.360
YOU got booze.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.190
Master, I've never taken alcohol before...

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.410
You. Got. Booze!

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.640
Well, if it is what you require for this training,
then... I will endure it.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.110
it.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.069
I'm pretty sure it's a felony for a daycare
teacher to drink on the job.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.069
Jess, Jess, Jess. Without great risk there
can be no great reward... Bonzai!

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.420
I love you, man. You're so much better than
Master Park. I mean, would it kill him to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.700
say "Good job! Hey, Ned, Ned, you're really
coming along with this Samurai stuff."Å¥ 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:13.330
But you man, it's like we never run out of new
things to talk about, you know?

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.200
You got booze?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.020
The booze!

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.580
Let go you smelly freak!

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.470
Master is this part of the training?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.010
Ned, get it off of me! OW!

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.610
So, it's come to this. The student must
defeat the master!

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.580
I'm not changing his diaper.
