00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.930
Popularly associated with black plaid,
teenagers, and gothic rock musicians,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.550
Gothic style is actually an important
influence on high fashion. Several years

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.960
ago, Alexander McQueen and did a
collection called "Boss," which was about

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.689
beauty and horror. Boss was a collection
set in a kind of glass box, where the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.970
models represented inmates in an insane
asylum--bandaged heads and birds of prey.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.570
It was a collection that shocked fashion
journalist because it was so extreme and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.920
frightening and yet also so beautiful. If
you look closely at this dress, you can

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.379
see that the bodice is made of many
microscope slides dyed red, which is a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.329
brilliant way of avocating science, and
yet also the kind of imagery of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.879
vampirism, of blood and disease.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.970
John Galliano looks back at the French
Revolution and particularly at what the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.860
Marquis de Sade said about the terror in
the late stage of the revolution when

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.500
the guillotine was hard at work in Paris.
Here on one poniette of this skirt, he

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.150
has a picture of the Marquis de Sade
in black and on the other side he

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.800
has a quote by de Sade: "Was it not by
murder that France became free?"

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.119
Ever since Frankenstein the idea of
laboratory is a place where new

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.490
monstrous life was created has become a
real part of our collective unconscious.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.250
The extraordinary dresses in fact
were made by a young designer called

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.340
Cake. Agama, Japanese by birth, is based in
London. They represent a kind of

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.509
steampunk synthesis of Victorian ideas
of machine civilization with a kind of

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.640
quirky vision of the future. They are
monstrous and extraordinarily beautiful.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.940
The Gothic is influential because it's
such an important part of popular

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.709
culture in general. I've been working on
this exhibition, a book, for the past two

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.410
years and it's lucky for me that right
now there are TV shows about vampires

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.400
and new movies about vampires. In back of
me, you see a costume from the 1990s film

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.780
"Graham Stoker's Dracula," as well as a
high-fashion ensemble by Thierry Mugler.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.610
Gothic is a word with a strange history.
It always does more than just describe

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.590
something like a Gothic cathedral; it
always implies that something is gloomy

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.610
and macabre.
