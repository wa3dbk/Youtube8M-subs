00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:06.540
Hi, I'm Karen for Expert Village. We would
be making our sufganiyot batter in a electric

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.309
mixture. Let's start with our water. Remember
you want that water to be warm to the touch

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.590
but not hot. Too hot water would kill your
yeast. So you want that to be just warm to

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.289
the touch. We are using a half a cup of warm
water. I'm going to add that to our mixing

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:32.829
bowl. Then one tablespoon of yeast and we
would add that to our mixing bowl. I'm just

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:42.489
going to stir that around a little to get
the yeast mixed in and set that to dissolve.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.579
While we are waiting for our yeast to dissolve,
I"m going to separate one of our eggs. Cause

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.469
our recipe calls for one whole egg and one
egg separated. So we would just crack that

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:02.250
egg and I'm going to crack the egg open very
carefully like this. Let the bottom shell

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.720
to hold the yolk and let the white sort of
drip out into our bowl. You want to make sure

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.820
that it is easily to catch that. We are going
to use that white; we would set that aside,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.620
we would use that in another recipe. We are
not using it in this recipe. We are going

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.230
to use our yolk. The yolk the extra yolk gives
the dough a little more richness, a little

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.730
bit more yellow color, and a little bit more
richness. So we have one whole egg and one

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:42.150
egg yolk. I would add that to our yeast and
our water. I'm going to add the two tablespoons

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:58.640
of sugar. A quarter teaspoon of salt and I'm
just going to mix that up to get the egg and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.930
the sugar and everything incorporated before
we add our flour. (mixing the mix) Just a

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.701
little bit to get that incorporated and then
you want to add about two cups of the flour.

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:18.750
Don't add all of the flour the recipe calls
for two and a half cups. We don't want to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.860
add all the flour because you might make a
dry dough. You want to first incorporate most

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.110
of the flour while you have it in a nice moist
dough. Then if you feel like it needs a little

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.590
more, you add a little bit more at a time.
So put that up and we would just mix that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:47.390
with a regular mixing beater and you want
to you would see. Let me show you what the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.360
dough looks like. It would start to stick
together and then I would show that in a littler

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.630
while that it would come together as a nice
soft smooth ball. Now when you are making

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.560
a small amount of dough like this, you don't
need to use a dough hook. A dough hook is

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.689
for larger amounts. The paddle is just fine
for a small amount of dough that we are making.
