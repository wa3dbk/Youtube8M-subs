00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.480
Welcome to SewVeryEasy, my name is Laura.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.000
It is August and time for the block of the month.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.160
This is a free pattern that you can follow along with

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.540
from Quilting Confections. The block of the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.560
month program is called Shades of Grey, so they're all

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.700
grey or black with a hint of blue.  Just like all the others,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.040
this is another really striking block. It is a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.300
pinwheel block. What's really great about it, it only takes

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.140
two fabrics and you start with the fabrics exactly

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.500
the same size.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.920
You're going to need three 6½" squares of a

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.740
black-and-white print and one 6½" square of blue.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.660
You're going to take the blue and one black and put

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.060
them together, right-sides facing. Then you are going to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.060
cut this, once on this angle and once on that angle.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.220
While you have the rotary cutter in your hand

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.060
you will take both of these and cut them right in half.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.160
We'll put these aside.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.120
We're going to work on the square pieces.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.180
You need to sew the right-hand side of the triangle.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.180
You can still see that this was the outside square.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.420
This is the left side; this is the right side.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.160
This is the side that's going to need sewing,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.980
so that would be the right,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.320
that would be the right, that would be the right.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.560
You can stack them all in front of you.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.280
With the square side facing you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.640
you need to sew each right edge.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.860
When you open it up

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.220
you will have this arrow shape. Sew each of those

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.860
four edges.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.760
Now press it so that the seam is going

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.380
towards the darker fabric.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.100
You can just finger-press this. By just finger-pressing it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.540
you're going to prevent it from stretching.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.000
Now the next seam we're going to sew is this one.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.160
That's where the four larger triangles are going to

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.480
come into play. These will get sewn together.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.380
Now when you sew them together you will notice that

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.400
the back triangle is slightly larger. That's good because

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.300
this is going to give you a chance to square it up

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.480
so it's perfect when you're done.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.680
To square it up the 6½" Eleanor Burns Square Up Ruler is

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.280
really really handy to use.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.440
There's a 5½" mark.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.100
You're going to take that 5½" mark and you're going

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.580
to place it on the seam.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.020
That center line should be lined up to the stitching

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.800
on the fabric, going up to the point

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.460
and that 5½" line is going to go on the seam sewing

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.100
the two triangles together.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.300
Then take your rotary cutter and trim off the extra.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.320
While I have the rotary cutter in my hand I do like to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.480
cut off the little dog ears.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.540
When you open them up it will equal a 5½" square.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.400
Now press the seam going towards the solid piece.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.240
If you hold the corner you will be able to rotate

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.800
the pieces around.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.780
By rotating them around

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.100
it will help keep the pinwheels in order.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.020
All of the points are going in the same direction.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.700
Now you're going to be able to take and sew these

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.720
two together and these two together.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.640
So the two halves are together. If you flip it over

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.900
you can see that the seams are going in this direction.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.000
Continue to press the seams in that direction.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.120
So this seam will go in this direction,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.300
this seam will go in this direction.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.180
Now you're able to nestle those center seams together.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.360
Because they're opposing,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.140
they're going to stay nice and tight and you're going

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.480
to be able to get that point really nice.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.240
Once that seam is sewn you need to continue

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.200
the pressing going in the same direction.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.380
You will be able to just separate a couple of the threads

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.530
right in the center. When those threads are separated

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.540
you're going to be able to continue that pressing

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.120
and it will stay nice and flat. Even this point here

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.320
where there's a lot of fabric together will lay flat.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.920
So this block is done. It was so quick and easy.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.280
Let's do another variation.

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.920
Let's do the same pattern in different fabrics.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.000
Choose two fabrics: A solid and a print.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.940
Make two blocks with the solid pinwheel in the center

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.140
and the print on the outside.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.760
Make two blocks opposite so you have the print

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.782
on the inside and the solid on the outside.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:46.460
Now let's sew them together. We're going to put a print

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.020
and a solid together.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.360
Then we need to put them together, sewing the center

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.940
seam. The same idea as you did with the pinwheel.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.860
So we've taken one simple block and we've multiplied it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.600
by four. By doing that we get a table topper. It's a very

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.720
cute little table topper. Now you can continue this and

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.639
make more blocks and make a full-size quilt out of it.

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.580
It is especially nice in children's fabric.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.820
Because of the pinwheels, it's very bright and cheerful.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.920
I do hope you've enjoyed today's episode of

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.900
