&gt;&gt;ALAN SCOTT: Hi, this is Alan Scott.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.890
I was part of the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.670
Jurassic Park dinosaur crew

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.270
over at Stan Winston Studio.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.240
I was lucky enough to be part of the mechanical
team, but also

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.610
with my art and mold experience integrated
a lot with the

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.520
core technology and

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.370
understructures for a lot of the dinosaurs.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.580
&gt;&gt;LINDSAY MACGOWAN: Hi,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.780
I'm Lindsay MacGowan.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.530
I was part of the Stan Winston Studio dinosaur
team also.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.440
And I worked within the mold department and
the art department at Stan's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.370
during the Jurassic Park period.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.610
This is some of the first tests of the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.129
tail moving with the skin on it.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.050
&gt;&gt;ALAN SCOTT: When we were

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.410
developing the core technology on this,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.770
everyone had traditionally been using rings
to try and create

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.369
cores that moved sequentially and we realized
that

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.630
it's going to be hard to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.500
organize all those and make them all work,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560
and while I was in working on the Raptor,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.440
I came up with this idea of just cutting in
a continuous spiral

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.009
so that it could expand and contract

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.330
but never lose its shape.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.680
It wouldn't just fall apart with

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.770
40 different rings on it. They would all stay
integrated to itself

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.040
so that's actually me up there trying to
pull the skin on.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.580
So the tail and the neck for both the Raptors
and the T-Rex

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.000
were done as a spiral and then reinforced

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.390
so that they didn't become too weak.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.900
But that way we could keep the shape

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.310
and the look of everything very continuously.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.329
The trick with these skins

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.790
is that it's a cone,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.380
it's a perfect cone.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.659
And every time you moved it it just kept wanting
to slide off

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.130
and get

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.020
looser and looser

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.340
on it so we had to pull them up and then sew
them and stitch them and glue them

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.460
to the hips and to the shoulders so that they
didn't want to work themselves off.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.180
&gt;&gt;LINDSAY MACGOWAN: Part of the issues with it as well
was that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.200
with all of the cylinders and the hydraulics
in there

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.650
that trying to make sure that

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.850
as we were moving things that we weren't,

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.290
that the core wasn't

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.440
stripping any of the hydraulic tubes or

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.980
potentiometers that would then

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.599
cause it to freak out.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.930
&gt;&gt;ALAN SCOTT: Yeah, because Tony [McCray] made everything
out of vacuum bag carbon fiber.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.370
And we didn't have the advantage of complete
3-D modeling back then so

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.480
a lot of this was done as guesswork as to
what would fit.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.730
So what looked good from the front and from
the side

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.540
suddenly didn't fit from the top

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.819
so that we had to

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.290
make adjustments every step of the way.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.200
Here's the crew pulling on the skin over
the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.670
the neck.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.050
&gt;&gt;LINDSAY MACGOWAN: You can see, you saw it back there
on the tail and it happened on the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.160
neck area too

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.599
is that foam actually shrinks quite a lot
when you

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.129
have that much foam,

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.550
but generally it shrinks anyway, but...

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.860
on this it shrank quite considerably

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.220
and we'd have to put in like two or three
foot sections of skin

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.970
back into the...

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.629
basically re-sculpting areas with these patches.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.319
&gt;&gt;ALAN SCOTT: Tremendously heavy.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.819
These skins were, you know, two inches thick
in a lot of places

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.519
because we wanted to make sure that they didn't
give away the mechanisms inside

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.080
and that's kind of the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.540
wonder of the fabrication and the coring of
it.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.239
Is that inside you've got hard mechanical
moves.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.159
On the outside it needed to look like smooth,
organic, realistic movement

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.030
so a thicker skin always helps with that,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.060
but as we learned later on, a thicker skin
takes on more water.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.970
It shrinks more,

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.590
and it's just heavier

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.670
so with the hydraulics it wasn't as much
of an issue, but

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.530
they finely tuned these

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.819
dinosaurs to what the dry weight was

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.709
and then like the T-Rex which wasn't supposed
to get wet,

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.880
it took on a lot of water.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.950
And, as you can see

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.340
what everyone's doing here is they're
taking the T-Rex through its paces so we would

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.150
have to see how far it would stretch

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.860
so we'd move the head all the way up to
its foremost position and you can see that

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.610
that skin needed to stretch three or four
feet in some places,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.750
and then when it bends down it had to not
bunch up and crinkle in unrealistic ways.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.040
So, finding the perfect amount of tension
and stress on the skin

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.080
that wouldn't tear itself apart,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.840
but would still look organic

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.470
was tricky

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.900
on something of this scale.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.630
&gt;&gt;LINDSAY MACGOWAN: We ended up having to find

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.720
different types of nettings

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.410
for use with the T-Rex

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.530
than we had done on other movies

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.740
just because the amount of stretch that they
needed to go through and the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.180
durability of the fabric.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.630
So it was actually quite a loose weave

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.720
of netting as I recall,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.910
but it was just

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.190
tricky trying to find the correct

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.210
amount of fabric to put in there as well as
the foam.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.810
&gt;&gt;ALAN SCOTT: Yeah.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.090
Everything was so big. You couldn't risk
running it three and four times.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.009
It was

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.389
gallons, and gallons, and gallons of foam
so you only had one or two shots at it.

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.960
But, it's a testament to the artistry too
as to, you know,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.789
take this amazing sculpture

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.360
and then cut 3 one-foot sections out of the
middle of it

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.820
and then have to re-fabricate it

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.100
out of foam latex and patch it back in and
make the lines work

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.930
and the wrinkles work,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.340
make everything flow again even though you've

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.869
cut a big piece out and it's shrunk make
it all look good again.
