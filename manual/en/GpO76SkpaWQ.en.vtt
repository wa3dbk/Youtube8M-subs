00:00:02.784 --> 00:00:04.469
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:06.260
T.L. TAYLOR: E-sports
is a way of signaling

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.343
all of those things we
find in traditional sports,

00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:10.410
and the shared community
of passionate gamers

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.460
that comes around that.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.980
DAMIEN DAILIDENAS:
The thing that I

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.370
love about "Street Fighter,"
of course, is the competition.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.245
I go to a tournament.

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:16.322
If I win, it's amazing.

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:18.030
Like, it's the best
feeling in the world.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.446
AJ MAZUR: As long as there are
people playing video games,

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:22.900
there are people ready
to watch video games.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.930
T.L. TAYLOR: Competitive
gaming has been present

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.160
since the earliest
days of arcade play.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.500
People forming around favorite
titles, sharing top scores,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.950
competing against each other.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.960
When personal computers
came on the scene

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.170
and those became popular, people
started going to LAN parties--

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.600
local area network parties-- to
play and compete face to face.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.100
When we get the
Internet, of course,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.420
that changes everything.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.970
Because people can now
start competing with people

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.370
they've never met before.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.980
What happens then
is that there's

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.490
business people who are
interested in seeing

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.680
if they can also make some
money off of that scene.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.020
So coming in and starting
more formal tournaments,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.810
formal organizations,
that run year to year.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.940
Despite having now been
around for several decades,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.410
it's still in very early days.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.710
It's still trying to figure
out its economic models.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740
It's still sorting out
the broadcast model.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.420
It's still trying to figure
out what spectatorship means,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.271
and how to bring
more people into it.

00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.770
So I think for me that's one
of the really important stories

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.420
of e-sports.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.420
It's what does it mean to
turn something that we mostly

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.720
think of an object of
leisure into something

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.050
you're professionally
passionate about

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.852
and are dedicating lots of
time, hard work and energy to.

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:35.840
AJ MAZUR: When it comes
to e-sports right now,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.820
there are four major genres.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.140
First off, you have your
shooters-- "Counter-Strike,"

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.330
"Halo," "Call of Duty."

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.960
You have those.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.210
Next up is the fighting games.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.710
They've been around
for the longest.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.730
"Street Fighter," "Tekken,"
"BlazBlue," "Guilty Gear"--

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.550
things like that.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.925
Then you have
real-time strategy,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:52.405
which is really the basis of
e-sports where it is today.

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:54.280
It started off with the
original "StarCraft,"

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.380
now went over to "StarCraft
II," "Warcraft II,"

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.050
"Command &amp; Conquer"-- a
lot of games in the genre.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.450
And then it finally is
MOBAs-- the multiplayer

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.740
online battle arenas.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.115
This is your
"League of Legends,"

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.100
"Dota," "Dota 2," "Heroes
of Newerth," "Smite."

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.840
Shooters and MOBAs are more
the team-oriented games.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.050
You have a group of guys--
three, four, five people,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.050
depending on the game.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.420
And they really work on
team coordination, teamwork,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.360
for some sort of goal.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.860
For shooters, it's
usually capturing

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.790
bases of getting tons of kills.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.625
For the MOBAs, it's go and
destroy the enemy's base.

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:23.750
The real-time strategy
games and the fighting games

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.340
are more of the one
v one situations.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.590
RTS games, you have
command of little armies.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.852
You try to destroy your
enemy's base, just one v one.

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:32.060
Same thing with the fighters.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.800
You have a health bar.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.305
You goal?

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:34.750
Just get that thing to zero.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.840
I think a lot of the
misconceptions about e-sports

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.500
carried over from misconceptions
about video games--

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.180
how it's a waste of time.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.490
When in reality, you
can make quite a bit

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.820
of money off of this.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.255
And in some parts
of the world, it

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:48.340
can really open huge
career paths for you.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.120
T.L. TAYLOR: Right
now there are hundreds

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.150
of e-sports tournaments
every year worldwide.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.430
And they're organized
in a range of ways.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.120
There are some very polished,
professional leagues.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.490
There are also game developers
who run events themselves,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.870
all the way down to
volunteer organizations

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.190
who are doing small,
local tournaments

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.420
in their communities.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.650
So there's a pretty
broad spectrum.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.630
At tournaments, spectators
energize in the same way

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.750
they do at traditional
sporting events.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.690
When I talk to e-sports
fans, they often

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.700
compare their e-sports
fandom to their fandom

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.892
of a traditional sport, whether
it's soccer, or basketball.

00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:31.350
So it means we've
got to figure out

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.280
how to bring all these other
people into what is essentially

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.235
a one-to-one space.

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:36.610
And so over the
years, there have

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.720
been lots of different
ways of doing this.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.550
Broadcast modules in games--
putting a big screen up

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.430
in a room so that
people can all sort of

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.570
watch one player's perspective.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.030
One of the most
interesting things

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.696
that's happened in
the last couple years

00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:51.920
is the growth of live streaming,
where people are broadcasting

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.640
tournaments, matches,
or even practice time,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.115
over the Internet onto
channels that lots of people

00:03:57.115 --> 00:03:57.990
can spectate at once.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.370
So it's a big challenge-- how to
let tens of thousands of people

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.604
get into that space of digital
play, the digital playing

00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:08.475
field.

00:04:08.475 --> 00:04:11.100
DAMIEN DAILIDENAS: I was raised
on a small island in the Bronx.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.170
There was this local pizza place
that got "Street Fighter I."

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.790
So I got into that
with my friends.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.066
It was very addicting.

00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:19.190
And then "Street Fighter
II" eventually came along.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.964
And that was huge.

00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:21.410
That, like, took
the world by storm.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.576
So that was, of course, the
game that got me hooked.

00:04:23.576 --> 00:04:25.920
And I was the best in my
little group of friends.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.325
So one thing led to another.

00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:29.682
I found a local tournament
that was in Philadelphia.

00:04:29.682 --> 00:04:31.140
This was a really
small tournament.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.490
There was only
about eight people.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.830
I was just really fascinated
that there were tournaments

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.340
for this game that I loved.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.590
So we played.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.060
And you know, I got destroyed.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.172
But it was a real
eye opener to see

00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:42.630
how differently
the game was played

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.660
from when I thought I was good.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.330
The metagame, and the
strategy involved,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.160
was, like, way different.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.826
So I was getting beat
my characters that

00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:51.670
were unheard of getting beat
by back when I was younger.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.350
When I first started, I was
going to almost every major

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.860
of the year.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.840
I'd fly at least six
or seven times a year.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.755
I was really hungry to test my
skills and climb the mountain.

00:04:59.755 --> 00:05:02.380
When you're at home, playing on
the couch or with your friends,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.690
you're totally
comfortable with anybody.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.730
That's when a lot of people
can really play their best.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.396
But when you go to a
tournament, there's

00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:09.620
this new element that you
really have to get used to.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.860
And you only do that by
going to more tournaments.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.990
And that's the element of
hundreds of thousands of people

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.570
that you don't know
watching you play

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.020
and judging your every move.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.300
The community now is
extremely friendly.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.850
Like 99% of the
people that go to

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.160
tournaments are
there for the party.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.660
So yeah.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.130
It's a very close-knit
community in that regard.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.680
I've kind of reached the top
of the mountain in America.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.880
So I'm going to make a big
trip to Japan this year.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.463
That's where all the
best players are.

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:33.184
My goal now is to
go there and be

00:05:33.184 --> 00:05:34.475
able to beat them consistently.

00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:39.010
T.L. TAYLOR: The
e-sports community

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.460
needs to really confront
in a serious way,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.440
and grapple with, real problems
if it wants to continue growing

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.080
and bringing new people in.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.530
It is male-dominated right now.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.530
And sexism is something that
the scene and the community

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.380
struggle with.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.950
There are structural
problems that keep women out.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.490
I think that
community has tended

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.420
to support itself and turn
inward, kind of take pride

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.827
in their own outsider status.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.910
And I think one of the
things that's happening now

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.190
is computer gaming
has really just become

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.180
a mainstream leisure activity.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.440
And so the e-sports
community is having

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.300
to transition into what it means
from going from geek subculture

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.270
to something actually hundreds
of thousands of people

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.570
may be participating in.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.760
And I think the people who
are very interested in growing

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.170
e-sports tend to be really
dedicated and passionate

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.550
about improving
e-sports competitions.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.430
I think if the community
can sort out and get

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.710
through this growing pain of
being a more inclusive space,

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.811
it has an interesting
future ahead.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:38.920
DAMIEN DAILIDENAS:
I have a small group

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.760
of dedicated friends.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.843
We meet about once a week.

00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:41.400
And we play.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.980
You have to be real
analytical in picking apart

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.460
why you're losing.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.500
T.L. TAYLOR: Right now
the model is around

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.144
advertising as a
predominant form of support.

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:51.560
It's one of the
most fragile parts

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.643
of the scene in many ways.

00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:54.810
Because it's still
trying to find the best

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.150
way to make it sustainable.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.440
AJ MAZUR: Every
progressive year has been
