00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.460
How to Make an Origami Crane.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.030
According to Japanese legend, folding 1,000
paper cranes in one year will guarantee your

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.099
wish will come true.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.351
A young girl named Sadako did just that in
1955 and wished for world peace—the origami

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.910
crane has been an international symbol of
peace ever since.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.500
You will need A square of origami paper folded
into a Bird Base and a flat surface.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Step 1.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.780
Position the Bird Base so that there are separate
right and left flaps on the bottom.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.590
These flaps will be the tail and neck of the
bird.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.590
Step 2.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.310
Narrow the top layer of the right flap by
folding its outer edge to meet the center

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.030
vertical edge.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.350
Step 3.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.370
Narrow the top layer of the left flap by folding
its outer edge to meet the center vertical

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.640
edge.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640
Step 4.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.820
Turn the model over and repeat, narrowing
the remaining layer of the right and left

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.850
flaps on the other side.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.980
Step 5.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.920
Fold the entire top right layer over to the
left side, along the center vertical.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920
Step 6.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.420
Turn the model over and repeat, folding the
top right layer over to the right side, along

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.680
the center vertical.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.899
Step 7.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.789
Fold the top layer of the long pointed bottom
flap all the way up to the top.

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.600
This forms the tail.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.600
Step 8.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.820
Turn the model over and repeat, folding the
remaining long pointed bottom flap all the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.180
way up to the top.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.289
This forms the neck.

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.289
Step 9.

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:46.030
Fold the tip of the neck in on itself to form
a head.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.030
Step 10.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.429
Fold the top left layer over to the right
side, along the center vertical.

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:53.479
Step 11.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.159
Turn the model over and repeat, folding the
top left layer over to the right side, along

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.969
the center vertical.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:02.979
Step 12.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.149
Pick up the model and hold it in the middle
along the bottom.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.990
With your other hand, reach in between the
layers and pull the tail down and out to a

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.740
pleasing angle.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.740
Step 13.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:28.220
Repeat on the other end to form the neck,
and pull out the head.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.600
Step 14.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.930
Gently spread apart the wing flaps, allowing
the crane's back to spread open.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.570
Did you know Did you know?

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.530
An origami crane folded in 2001 in a Japanese
stadium had a wingspan of 256.5 feet—nearly

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.830
the length of a football field.
