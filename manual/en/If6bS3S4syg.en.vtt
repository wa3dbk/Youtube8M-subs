00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.769
Today on this 2005 Chevrolet 3500 we are going
to install part number RP50064-58.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.969
This is Reeses fifth wheel rails and install
kit.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.639
The first thing we need to do is get the truck
ready to install the kit.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.980
The first thing we did was remove the spare
tire so we can get underneath the vehicle

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.110
and install the hardware.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.801
We will also lower the exhaust because above
the exhaust there is a heat shield and we

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.490
need to move the exhaust out of the way so
that we can cut the heat shield out of the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.490
way.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.140
We will look at the passenger side frame rail
of the vehicle and this is the heat shield

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.309
that goes all the way across.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.609
We are actually going to remove two sections
of this.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:42.300
We are going to remove this section here from
this hat channel as far back as we can because

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.780
right here is where we have to have wrench
access to tighten down parts.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.140
The second section we are going to remove
is on this side of the hat channel, there

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.230
are two right in a row, so we are going to
cut across here and we are going to go all

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:09.240
the way to the next hat channel up here and
go across as well.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.720
00:57
Next when you get into the bed of the truck

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.910
we will measure out where to put the base
rails.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.930
What we are going to do is measure the edge
of the bed itself as described in the instructions

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.790
and make a mark, do that on both sides, we
will line up the rails with a mark and you

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.240
want to measure left and right to get it centered
in the bed.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.790
With the rail in the right spot we will mark
out the holes we drilled.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.210
On the rail going towards the cab of the truck
we are going to be using these two holes on

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.570
the outside edge of the rail on both sides.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.000
We will find our center.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.800
We will drill out a pilot hole with a 1/ 8
inch bit.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.480
Repeat the same process for the remaining
three holes.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.830
We are looking underneath the truck now and
we can see the two holes that we just drilled

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.370
out and we will hold the bracket up there
and see how everything is going to fit into

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.370
place.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:29.290
We will just line them up roughly so it looks
like 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:44.519
the bracket 
is going to be using this existing hole here

00:02:44.519 --> 00:03:35.779
and it looks like we can U-bolt 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:04:00.040
it or 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:05:22.169
we can bolt 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:06:21.900
it into 
place 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:07:04.020
here as well by 
drilling 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:23.439
the hole out.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:33.129
