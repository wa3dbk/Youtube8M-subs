00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.239
Our mission is to make communal sustainable living mainstream

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.620
As we believe many of the worlds ills can be solved

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.319
Through communal sustainable living

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.220
So were building a network

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.340
Of 100% off the grid communities

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.260
Starting here in Montreal, Quebec, Canada

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.050
We're documenting the entire process

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.050
To show others how to build their own communities

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.250
And to show the world that communal, sustainable living

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.380
Is awesome, feasible and necessary

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.600
We're not a protest, we're a solution

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.359
We are building a 100% off the grid community

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.000
On 60 acres of land

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.269
Just 20 minutes from Downtown Montreal

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.300
Now what will we have in this community?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.510
Well it'll start with a giant two-story community center earthship

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.810
Gardens, greenhouses, livestock, homes and so much more

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.809
An earthship is a 100% off the grid structure
invented by Michael Reynolds

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.789
Earthships use modern engineering to work
with the natural processes of the planet

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.850
Resulting in free and automated generation
of food, water and energy

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.939
All your basic needs are met at zero cost to you

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.110
They utilize the principle of thermal mass
to stay around 68° Fahrenheit

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.000
About 20° Celsius in even the most extreme
climates without any electric heating or cooling

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.899
They're also much cheaper than conventional
homes and are made of mostly recycled materials

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.570
Living at Valhalla will be like how we're meant to live

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.049
Simply, beautifully and together

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.380
Food, water and electricity are plentiful

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.990
You're around like-minded people

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.929
There's always something exciting going on

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.210
There's always something new to learn or some new way to grow

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.959
This isn't just some hippie ideal

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.410
It's a feasible lifestyle

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.290
And we're making it a reality

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.000
The most exciting part about Valhalla

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.459
Is the freedom it provides

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:46.760
With all your basic needs met

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.159
You wake up each morning owning the day

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.320
You can follow your bliss without compromise

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.860
And the people best fit to change the world

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.699
Are those 100% absorbed in doing what they love to do

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.000
With communities like Valhalla

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.679
Anyone can do that

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.490
Valhalla started in April 2012 with a handful of people

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.020
Who were tired of waiting for others to be
the change they wanted to see in the world

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.469
So we bought 60 acres of land with no clear vision

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.569
But we knew it needed to be done

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.020
We planted some trees, gathered some people

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.970
Moved into a house together, started a website

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.820
And Valhalla was born

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.789
The number one question is

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.049
How are we funding this?

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.400
We're going after funding from all angles

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.830
We're attracting sponsors

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.010
Trading the skills of Valhalla members for goods and services

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.849
Seeking documentary funding

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.209
Using crowdfunding campaigns

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.220
And selling merchandise

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.000
Made within the Valhalla community such as
soap, candles and yoga mats

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.840
We're also running local events that
 promote the ideals of Valhalla

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.830
In 10 years we will have created the world we wish to see today

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.789
The Valhalla Movement will be a network of sustainable communities

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.069
Learning from each other and helping budding communities flourish

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.250
The goal is to be mainstream

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.239
These communities will be a launchpad for social change

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.630
And inspiration for the world to believe in sustainable living
