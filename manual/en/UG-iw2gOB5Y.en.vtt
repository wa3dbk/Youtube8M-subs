00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.750
Soldering jump rings closed is a basic skill
in jewelry manufacturing and repair.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.960
Here we discuss gold and sterling silver jump
rings.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.170
If you need to solder brass or other base
metal rings, low temperature solders and soldering

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.730
techniques would be used.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.029
There are two methods available to deposit
the solder into the joint: applying paste

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.289
solder or placing a snippet of solder in the
joint using a solder pick.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.920
The smaller the jump ring, the more difficult
depositing the solder on the joint becomes,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.800
as we do not want the solder to flow anywhere
outside of the joint.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.240
Note that very little solder is needed to
close a jump ring!

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.920
This guide covers the typical task of adding
a jump ring and a clasp to a chain tab.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.710
The tools needed are:
Two flat nose or needle nose pliers

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.929
Jump Rings
Firecoat

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.629
Flux
Solder or Solder paste

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.879
A Solder pad
A Soldering torch

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.600
A Soldering Pick
Interlocking tweezers

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.750
A pickling solution
Eye Protection

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.330
And Optionally, polishing tools

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.570
The first step will be to assemble the pieces
together.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.360
Using your pliers, gently twist the jump ring
open sideways just enough to allow it to slip

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.040
onto the tab and the clasp.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.220
After installing the parts needed, twist the
jump ring back together so the seam is totally

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.640
closed.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.320
Due to gold and silver having 'memory', or
the desire to maintain a position, you will

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.850
probably need to over close the joint, slightly
past where the joint is aligned, and allow

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.110
the metal to spring back a bit for a perfect
join.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.490
There should be a slight tension holding the
seam closed, soldering is not made to bridge

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.800
gaps.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.070
Next, firecoat the piece wherever it will
be heated, to learn more about this process,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.470
check out this article: Soldering 101.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.920
Fire coating will prevent heat damage to affected
parts of the chain and clasp.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.040
In this case, we will firecoat the jump ring
and about one inch of the chain with the tab

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.810
and clasp.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.500
After the firecoat is covering the parts that
will be exposed to heat, apply the flux.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.290
Only to the area where you want the solder
to flow.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.450
No flux is needed if you are using soldering
paste, because it is already mixed into the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.209
compound.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.000
The next step will be to apply your solder
to the joint.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.980
We will cover the two most common options,
and whichever type of solder you choose, remember,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.760
the joint must be as isolated as possible
from the rest of the piece.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.049
This is to make sure the torch doesn�t melt
or discolor unwanted parts of the chain.

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.640
Either rest the chain on your solder-pad with
the joint on top, or use an interlocking tweezers

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.879
to hold it in position to apply your torch
flame.

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.870
If you choose to use the solder pick technique,
the first step will be to heat the piece of

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:21.790
solder on your solder pad until it balls up.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.629
Pick it up on the end of your solder pick,
and then place it directly on the seam of

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.150
your jump ring as you are heating it.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.769
Heat the jump ring until the solder flows
evenly throughout the seam.

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.079
The heat from your flame will draw the solder
to where you want it.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:44.889
Solder flows towards the hottest point.

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.329
If you use Paste Solder - apply the paste
solder directly to the joint and gently heat

00:03:49.329 --> 00:04:00.090
until the solder flows into the seam.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.099
The next step will be to pickle the work and
then rinse it in water.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.230
Lastly, you may choose to polish the newly
soldered portion of the jump ring.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.099
Usually very little polishing is needed; a
hard rubber wheel is usually sufficient to

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.730
brighten up the small amount of solder used.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.910
You can now enjoy wearing your jewelry with
pride, knowing that you made it yourself.
