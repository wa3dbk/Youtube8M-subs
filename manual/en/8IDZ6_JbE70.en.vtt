Hello, my name is Jose Zuniga. I'm representing
expertvillage.com. Well, we have gone over

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.230
indoor or outdoor herb garden, what do we
do now as well. We have to maintain it. Well

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.240
let's start with a indoor herb garden that
you have. As always, check the water drainage

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.390
every other day. Be sure that your plants
are getting at least 4 hours of sunlight.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.899
If you don't have a window, pull that pot
every other day, at least so it can get some

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:36.410
sunshine. Also, don't place your plants near
the stove. Don't kill them with that heat;

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.370
it is going to kill them. And just enjoy your
indoor herb garden. We always want to smell

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.609
that wonderful herbs in the kitchen. We step
in there, we want to smell it. Remember, don't

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.460
forget about the plant food, don't forget
to water it, check for drainage as well. Come

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.899
on let's move outside, cause that is a different
story. Remember outside they are going to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.250
get sunlight just about every single day.
Check for if they are turning yellow, or if

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.890
the leaves are kind of dying. If that is happening,
most likely either you are watering it to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.980
much, the drainage is bad, or the plant is
just basically getting too much sun. That

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.460
is why it is important that you know your
plants. One of the signs of to much sun is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.680
they are going to start turning yellow. The
leaves are going to start dying, so it is

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.680
time for you to find them a new home; that
is what you need to do. Perhaps they need

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.570
to be underneath the tree. Okay, so look for
those signs. And of course don't forget the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.130
plant food. Plant food is very important to
grow freely and beautiful, and remember it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.810
is only done between 7-14 days don't; overdo
it. You know talking about survival, unfortunately

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.530
these plants are not going to be year round;
it is all going to depend what state you live

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.940
in. If that happens, don't worry; replace
that rosemary with another rosemary. Wow,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.480
today you decided now you are going to start
eating fish. Well you know what? Get some

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.490
herbs that you could utilize with your wonderful
fish. And every year be creative; add a different

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.540
herb that you don't have. Let that mint just
take all over your garden. Well, this is how

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.390
we maintain a herb garden.
