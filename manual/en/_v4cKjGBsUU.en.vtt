On this week’s creator’s tip, I show you
guys how to use online video content to drive

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.680
traffic back to your website or your Facebook
pages or wherever you want the traffic to

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.440
go.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.380
Hey guys, my name is Tim Schmoyer and welcome.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.480
Every week, I give you guys some tips, advice
and help and suggestions for making your video

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.050
content stand out on the web.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.500
This week, let’s talk about using video
to drive traffic to your website.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.980
A lot of us are small businesses or big businesses
and we want to use online video to kind of

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.780
establish a presence and create some buzz
and send people to our website.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.920
Let me give you four tips and ideas on how
you can do that effectively with your videos.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.420
The first one is really simple actually, just
put a link in the description below your video

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.309
on YouTube that links back to wherever you
want the traffic to go.

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.350
Put the link first in the very beginning of
the description and make sure you use the

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.250
HTTP colon plus forward slash so that it actually
turns into a hyperlink that people can click.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.219
You’ll see an example of that directly below
this video on YouTube that links to our Facebook

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.219
page.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.219
Pretty simple, right?

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.850
The second one is equally as simple and it’s
just to put a little watermark somewhere on

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.680
your video that is your URL or you can use
an annotation just as easily with your URL

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.310
or your Twitter name or whatever you want
to directly link to.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.639
Just make sure it’s discreet and out of
the way and it isn’t actually distracting

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.270
from the content you’re providing.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.249
While that watermark and the annotation aren’t
actually clickable to send people to your

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.619
website, they do provide that reinforcement
that when people think about you, they automatically

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.939
just know what your website is and can go
right to it without having to dig it up or

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.939
look for it.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.880
Another way to use your online video content
to send traffic to your website is actually

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.219
not that common on YouTube.

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.439
If you’re watching this video on YouTube,
maybe you noticed in the very first 15 seconds

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.049
of this video, instead of the AdWords from
Google showing up down here at the bottom,

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.069
instead, it showed a little picture of Facebook
and some little text that said hey, click

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.649
this to go to our Facebook page.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.060
Those are called Call to Actions on YouTube
and they’re super simple to set up.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.159
It’ll cost you a one-time fee of five dollars
for your account to enable that for all your

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.350
videos on YouTube.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.809
And then you can make them clickable to any
website or URL you want with any logo, with

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:05.809
any text.

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:09.110
How to set those up is kind of outside the
scope of this video so I’ll include a link

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.370
in the description below that’ll take you
to a tutorial exactly step by step with screen

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.980
shots, how to get that set up for your YouTube
account so you can use the first 15 seconds

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.320
of every video to have a call to action there
to send traffic straight to your website.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.060
And in case you missed ours, just refresh
this video on YouTube and let it start playing

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.989
again and you’ll see exactly what I’m
talking about.

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.760
Or if you see the two mostly transparent arrows
right around here somewhere, click on those

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.813
and it’ll bring it back up for you too.

00:02:32.813 --> 00:02:38.340
A little side note for you, these do not work
on mobile devices, iPhones, Android, iPads,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.569
iPod Touches, it only works on a desktop.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.780
Number four, create bonus video content that
you post on your website and then use your

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.382
YouTube videos to mention that, to bring it
up and tell people that you know, I’ve linked

00:02:48.382 --> 00:02:50.620
it up in the description below if people want
to check it out.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.580
Link stuff like Q&amp;A videos, a look behind
the scenes, maybe like the making of videos

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.299
or tutorials.

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.830
A couple people who do this really well on
YouTube are WheezyWaiter and Smosh.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.189
I’ll link up a couple of their videos in
the description below if you want to see some

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.650
examples of how they do it.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.269
Also as another example, after this video
is over, you can head over to our Facebook

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.290
page at Facebook.com/ReelSEO to watch the
creator’s tip bonus video of the overarching

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.390
principle you really need to have in place
if any of these four ideas I’ve suggested

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.189
to you, if any of them are going to work,
these principles have to be in place.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.709
That’s in the bonus video on our Facebook
page so the link to it is below.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.109
For next week’s creator’s tip, I’m going
to show you guys that once you get the traffic

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.920
to your website, how to use video on your
website, keep them there and keep them stuck

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.590
and engaged on your website.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.959
