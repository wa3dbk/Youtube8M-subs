00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.933
- IN A FEW SHORT YEARS,
OUR NEXT GUEST

00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.500
HAS GONE FROM BEING HOMELESS
TO PERFORMING AT CARNEGIE HALL.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.666
TAKE A LOOK.

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.333
[dramatic piano music]

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.733
- MY NAME IS JAMES MATTHEWS.
I'M 24 YEARS OLD.

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.166
I STUDY PIANO AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF WEST FLORIDA.

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.500
AND LAST WEEK I PERFORMED
AT CARNEGIE HALL.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.333
IT DEFINITELY HAS NOT BEEN
AN EASY ROAD

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.233
GETTING TO CARNEGIE HALL.

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:21.966
I DIDN'T HAVE AN EASY CHILDHOOD.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.900
WE ALWAYS STRUGGLED FINANCIALLY,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
BUT MY FAMILY ALWAYS DID
THE BEST FOR ME THAT THEY COULD.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.300
AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO HAVE A PIANO TO PLAY,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.566
SO THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN
MY OUTLET.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:36.033
THINGS VERY QUICKLY TURNED
FOR THE WORSE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.033
I JUST FOUND MYSELF
LIVING ON THE STREETS

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.300
FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.066
I SLEPT UNDERNEATH BRIDGES,

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.033
BACKS OF PEOPLE'S TRUCKS.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.166
THAT WAS KIND OF SCARY
A COUPLE TIMES,

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.633
'CAUSE THEY--
PEOPLE CAME OUT AND--

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.633
THEY TURNED THEIR CAR OR THEIR
TRUCK ON, AND I WAS STILL IN IT.

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:53.566
EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T HAVE
A PLACE TO LIVE,

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.000
I MANAGED TO STAY FOCUSED

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.666
AND KEEP PIANO
MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.233
I RECEIVED A MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP
TO GO TO FLORIDA SOUTHERN.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:00.733
EVENTUALLY, I GOT SMART

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.533
AND I STARTED SLEEPING
IN THE REHEARSAL ROOM

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.033
THAT WAS OPEN 24/7
TO MUSIC MAJORS.

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:07.566
MY PIANO TEACHER
DR. ROBERT MACDONALD FOUND ME.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.566
HE MADE A BUNCH OF PHONE CALLS

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.400
AND FOUND A COLLEGE FOR ME
TO GO TO IN NORTH FLORIDA.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.900
IT HAD FREE HOUSING
AND, YOU KNOW,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.900
THEY--BECAME MY NEW HOME.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.033
I PLAYED AT CARNEGIE HALL.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.800
I'M GETTING TO PLAY FOR ELLEN.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.100
IT'S JUST AMAZING.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.833
I STILL WANT TO SLAP MYSELF
TO MAKE SURE THIS IS REAL.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.833
IT'S KIND OF A SURREAL
PIANO FAIRY TALE DREAM

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:35.666
COME TRUE, YOU KNOW?

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.666
- FROM PENSACOLA, FLORIDA,
PLEASE WELCOME JAMES MATTHEWS.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:39.833
ONE THING I HAVE TO ASK--

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.633
WHEN DID YOU FIRST START
PLAYING PIANO,

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.633
SO THAT YOU GOT ON THIS ROAD
AT ALL?

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:46.233
- OH, I STARTED PLAYING PIANO
WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD,

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:47.566
AND MY DAD WAS MY FIRST TEACHER.

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.966
- OKAY, SO THEN
WHEN YOU WERE HOMELESS,

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.700
YOU WERE TRYING TO STILL
KEEP IT UP AT SCHOOL

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.000
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.833
SO WHEN YOU WERE HOMELESS
AND GOING TO SCHOOL,

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.500
DID YOUR FRIENDS KNOW
YOU WERE HOMELESS?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.900
- NO ONE KNEW I WAS HOMELESS,
NONE OF MY FRIENDS OR TEACHERS.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.000
FOR THE MOST PART,
I LIVED A NORMAL LIFE.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.933
DURING BUSINESS HOURS,
I WAS IN SCHOOL,

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.766
I WAS PRACTICING ALL THE TIME,
SO NO ONE REALLY KNEW.

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:07.766
THE ONLY HARD PART ABOUT IT
WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.100
SOMEWHERE TO SLEEP.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.666
- SO--AND SO WHEN YOU'RE
SLEEPING UNDER BRIDGES

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.766
AND IN PEOPLE'S TRUCKS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.400
YOU STILL HAD, LIKE, THAT,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.100
"I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP"
ATTITUDE, RIGHT?

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.533
YOU JUST KEPT GOING TO SCHOOL

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.100
AND DIDN'T FEEL SORRY
FOR YOURSELF.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.433
DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE KEY
TO YOUR--WHERE YOU ARE?

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:25.700
- DEFINITELY.
THAT'S JUST WHAT KEPT ME GOING.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.200
YOU KNOW, THE WORLD
FOR A LONG TIME--

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.366
THE WORLD WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE
GONNA STAY THERE FOREVER."

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:31.900
BUT PIANO IS MY GOOD THING, AND
I JUST KEPT FOCUSING ON THAT,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.000
AND IT BROUGHT ME THROUGH
ALL THAT DARKNESS.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.966
- ALL RIGHT, SO I CAN'T WAIT
FOR YOU TO PLAY FOR US.

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:37.433
- ABSOLUTELY, I LOVE--
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:38.700
- I WOULD LOVE TO.
- THANK YOU.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.700
[cheers and applause]

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.200
[dramatic piano music]

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:41.266
[dramatic piano music]

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400
[cheers and applause]

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.133
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- OH, WOW.

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:31.300
- THANK YOU.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.566
- REALLY AMAZING.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:35.533
ALL RIGHT.

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:38.700
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO
CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION, RIGHT?

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.166
YOU WANT TO GRADUATE.
- YES.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:41.733
- AND I KNOW THAT, FINANCIALLY,

00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:43.566
IT'S TOUGH TO KEEP DOING
ALL OF THAT,

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:44.900
SO OUR FRIENDS AT SHUTTERFLY

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.833
LOVE TO HELP INSPIRING PEOPLE
LIKE YOU.

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:49.100
THEY WANT TO HELP CONTINUE
YOUR EDUCATION

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.666
AND THEY WANT TO GIVE YOU
$25,000.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.066
- WHOA!

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:55.466
