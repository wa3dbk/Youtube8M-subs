"This is going to give you good shine, this
is going to give you good protection". Hi,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.410
my name is Sylvia Russell and today we're
going to share with our how to repair damaged

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.909
hair. Now on this process is one that you
definitely be taking seriously. Damaged area

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:25.119
is no fun for anyone. So if you're doing a
lot to your hair and you're realizing that

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.640
you're seeing damage, take a minute, stop,
and let's go over what you've been doing.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.750
No.1 thing people do, is they do too much
to their hair. They brush it all day, they

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.640
comb it all day. They shampoo everyday. They
hot curl, they roller set. All of these everyday

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.559
activity can cause breakage. Now what you
will see is sometimes, your ends will be dry

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.890
and brittle and that comes from everyday shampooing,
everyday brushing and combing. The only way

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.950
to truly, truly repair damaged ends is by
trimming them off. If you don't trim them

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.550
off, they will continue to slide down the
hair shaft, thus, giving you broken damage

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.160
hair. Another thing that happens is once the
hair becomes dry, it begins to get brittle.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.200
So we have to remember that we need good shampoos
and conditioners. We need to keep our ends

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.240
clean, clip on a regular basis and these are
things that you can do at home. But I would

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.920
suggest visiting your salon, maybe once a
month or once every six weeks for a good trim.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.240
If you're doing a lot of swimming, make sure
that you're deep cleansing that hair with

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.590
a really good deep cleansing shampoo, replenishing
the hair with moisture is very important because

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.310
once your hair becomes dry, if you don't attack
it right away, you will run into problems.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.160
So my client has healthy hair, it's moisturized
and she's good to go. My name is Sylvia Russell

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.000
and this is how to repair damaged hair.
