something done here

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.900
it was it for me I lost my hearing a
very strange way from a car accident

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.710
and I didn't wanna b ball anymore so I
started doing research in research and

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.450
research in

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.680
the technology today I think if I can
have a full head of hair

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.110
and song and take me one day to do it it
was a no brainer fines

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.890
you got a full head of hair okay I do
have some before pictures so let's take

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.399
a look at those are very quickly

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.290
oh yeah he's okay was just going to man
completely different ways the right when

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.369
you look back

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.170
at that picture right there what do you
think a guy that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.940
felt good on the inside and look bad on
the outside that make you feel

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.530
older yeah I mean I exercise and stay
fit all the time but

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.840
when you don't look as good as you feel

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.150
the something that is this missing there
was one piece to the puzzle that was

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.820
missing

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.100
when I will go to a dinner something I
would never sit under

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.120
a bright my parents sent back a little
bit always wore a baseball cap

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.370
the confidence was not there my
confidence is back tenfold now

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.630
at school it looks great and I'm sorry
I'm sure you hear this a lot

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.560
not just men women also facing this
what's new about this new graph

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.110
procedure

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.700
well me bottom line is that there's no
cutting and no scar

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.769
I didn't realize how you used to do
these you show me this couple that you

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.930
took part said a people's the scalp more
less an entrance by here we would do

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.780
we'll be taking a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.820
very sharp instruments such as a scalpel
over here and what we would do is we

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.140
would actually if you want to come in
tight over here take a look at the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.810
scalpel

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.070
but we would actually do is we woulda
would take a chunk outta your

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.070
at your head we would actually cut a
chunk at your head then we would have

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.239
had a bottom-up

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.239
and then put them back in but the
problem is you're left with a pretty

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.120
large scar

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.590
and a lot of our patients don't want to
have a scar and also for women

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.609
could corrode baldness and women's
becomes has become not becoming it is

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.030
really a major problem

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.120
but these patients are kinda hiding
because they don't want this car to not

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.980
talk to these pictures are coming out
because we can do without scars don't

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.100
use now it's completely different

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.260
different we were kissing technology to
look at the same to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.900
okay this is just what the temp are our
device would look alike because I could

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.950
bring the big device in today but this
is like a tiny it's one millimeter

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.459
around that such as smaller than a
typical ballpoint pen

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.169
and what we do this is connected to a
carb a computerized device

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.769
and what we'll do is we'll just punch
little tiny hair follicles out okay

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.299
and bike so you take from like the back
up here and yet you're using that to to

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.299
punch up in this area and we're taking
it from the door area which is always in

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.579
the back where we don't get

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.030
typical pattern baldness where the areas
are prefect back here

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.590
punching out individual follicles
randomly only fitting in about 14

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.109
percent
