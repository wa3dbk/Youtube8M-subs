00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.040
I'm James Ladyman,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.400
Professor of Philosophy
at the University of Bristol.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.520
My name's Samir Okasha,
I'm Professor of Philosophy of Science

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.760
in the Philosophy Department,
University of Bristol.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.240
The topic we're going to discuss
concerns the status of ethics,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.240
in particular, objective
versus subjective views of ethics.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.520
According to the subjective view,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.120
there are no facts of the matter
about ethical questions.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.120
For example, if someone
says "euthanasia is right"

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.800
and someone else says
"euthanasia is wrong",

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.600
ultimately, that's a matter of
subjective taste, not scientific fact.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.400
So if that's the case,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.440
why do people think
they're having disagreements

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.480
that can be resolved by argument?

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.440
After all, if I say
"chocolate ice cream's nice"

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.600
and you say "No, it isn't",

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680
there's nothing more to be discussed

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.800
because we acknowledge that
each of us is expressing our taste

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.040
and there's no further
fact of the matter.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.680
One of the strongest arguments
for the subjective view,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.520
which in part responds
to that objection,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.760
is the fact that different communities
around the world at different times

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.640
have held widely divergent
ethical views.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.360
Some people have thought, for example,
it's OK to perform honour killing

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.480
of young girls who
get pregnant out of wedlock.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.120
Other communities find that
to be an abhorrent thing to do.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.440
And you can think of
many examples like that.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160
A natural response to that

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240
that the subjective view
gives is to say

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.480
"That's because there's no fact
of the matter in the first place".

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.920
It's a bit like a preference for
chocolate ice cream over strawberry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.520
There are also widespread divergences

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.840
in beliefs among different cultures

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.760
about matters that we're not
tempted to regard as not factual.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.080
For example, different
cultures have disagreed

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.560
about whether or not
the Earth is round

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.920
as opposed to flat

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.960
or about the origins of the universe
of the nature of matter.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.600
The difference with the ethical case
is that, in those scientific cases,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.920
there's a reasonably
agreed-upon method

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.480
for establishing
which answer is correct,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.240
even if it's hard sometimes.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.000
In the ethical case, there don't seem
to be any comparable methods

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.680
to decide whether, for example,
euthanasia is or is not morally wrong.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.080
I take your point that
we can't do experiments

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.840
to find out the answer
to ethical questions, however,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.440
we do have procedures and methods.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.240
One of those methods is the method of
rational persuasion which people use

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.080
in attempting to bring others round
to their moral point of view.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.800
So if we think of
the Abolitionist Movement

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.840
or the campaign for
the emancipation of women,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.600
in both cases,
a large part of their methods

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.400
were that rational persuasion
of other people through argument,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.720
so how do you explain
what's going on in that process

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.800
from a subjectivist point of view?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.640
It's certainly true that,
from a subjective point of view,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.080
it's difficult to account for the idea

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.840
that we've made
moral progress, for example.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.760
We all tend to believe that
we have made moral progress,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.360
we've moved from times
when slavery was dominant

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.320
to its abolition, say, over
a period of a few hundred years -

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.360
and that seems to be progress.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.760
But a subjectivist will say
that it doesn't follow

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.080
that we've learnt the truth of
some factual thing about the world

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.120
like slavery is wrong, where
we used to think slavery was OK.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.840
But a subjectivist will try to account
for our sense of moral progress

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.600
without appealing to the idea

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.280
that it involved
apprehending the truth

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.600
about objective moral facts.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.720
Yeah, that's interesting.
I'm not yet persuaded

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.040
that we have a reason to deny

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.400
that there are ethical truths.
