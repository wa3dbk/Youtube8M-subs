Hi! For expertvillage.com this is Mitch Kaplan.
In this clip we will be talking about how

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:16.400
to hold the clarinet. First we put our left
hand on top, and our right hand on the bottom;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.650
that is the most important thing, because
we want to have our fingers utilize the leverage

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.660
over here, those are very important after
a while. To make it comfortable they invented

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.210
the thumb rest. The thumb rest, you can buy
these also at your local music store, they

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.120
are little rubber pieces that fit over the
metal thumb rest, and it makes it much more

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.530
easier to hold. Now, to play the instrument,
we will talk about the instrument we will

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.079
talk about the embouchure. The embouchure
is the mouth position, and that is how you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.249
would perform the sound; it is very important.
Now what you do is, you put your lower lip

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:11.490
over your teeth, like that; you’re going
to put your finger on top of the mouthpiece,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.560
as a beginner, to know, how much mouthpiece
you will put in your mouth. Then you are going

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.689
to make an “O” with your lips, and it
is going to wrap solidly around the mouthpiece,

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.640
so you are going to put your mouthpiece in
your mouth, your lip over your teeth, kind

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.439
a like a pillow, then you rest your top teeth
on top of the mouthpiece, and then tightly

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:49.560
wrap your lips around the mouthpiece and then
blow… Using your lower stomach, you will

00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:00.429
produce the sound, this way the air is going
through your body and through the horn. Keeping

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:09.850
your fingers tight, you want to make sure
that you want to keep your fingers hovering

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:19.150
above the keys, but not depressing them at
the same time. Keeping them close as possible

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:32.670
makes it faster and easier to for you to play,
here is an example…
