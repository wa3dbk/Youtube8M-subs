00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.540
We started doing the Mille Miglia in 2007 with a Lancia Aurelia B24.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.660
We were in the top twenty, and then in 2009 we came 13th with this car,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.020
but we had problems with the engine, and we've had them again this year.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.180
It's a former official OSCA team car.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.020
It did the Mille Miglia in 1954 and 1956 in this configuration,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:51.100
with the number 4-28, which was the start time, and it came sixth in its category and second overall.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.740
We use Michelin XAS tyres:

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.180
they're very good.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.220
We use modern treads, obviously, with a classic design, and we get on very well with them.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.540
As a race, the Mille Miglia has an excitement all of its own. 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.100
The people and the villages and the crowds are unique.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.180
We also race against the clock, but we prefer long, regular tracks.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.380
We inspect the car nearly all year round,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.700
and we replace any worn parts with modern ones.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.060
So they're "historic" cars with modern parts.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
The car's going very well for now, fingers crossed.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.940
We use new Michelin tyres with old designs,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.460
but these too are modern tyres.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.220
And the brakes are resurfaced by hand because they're fixed onto drum brake shoes,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.900
and they're made by Ferodo so the materials are the main thing.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.220
We race with this car,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.660
which is a very unusual one with a long history of wins.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.140
We're thinking of doing the best races regularly: the Coppa d'Oro delle Dolomiti,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.820
the Mitiche Sport a Bassano, the Coppa Franco Mazzotti: these are the top Italian rallies.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.540
Like I said, the Mille Miglia has an excitement all of its own,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.300
because of the people, the crowds and the emotion.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.940
You see people looking so happy as you pass, and you make a lot of noise.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.740
That's just the way it is, there's no particular reason. 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.220
You go through nearly all the most important cities.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.420
It's a unique route that goes from Brescia to Ferrara, and from Ferrara to Rome.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.860
It's always full of people, and the towns and villages are fantastic.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.300
You have to do and see the Mille Miglia to believe it!
