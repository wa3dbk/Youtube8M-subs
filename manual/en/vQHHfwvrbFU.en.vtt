00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.767
Hi, my name is Charles Ying.

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:06.767
I'm one of the cofounders
of PixVerse.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:09.534
PixVerse is a next-generation
virtual world company.

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:12.234
We were recently acquired
by hi5 Networks,

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:13.934
the fastest-growing
social network.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.501
Today, I'm gonna be talking
about PixChat,

00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.334
our real-time chat room that we
built using Google App Engine.

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:20.968
So let's get started.

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:26.501
So this is PixChat here,
running on my hi5 homepage.

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:29.501
This is running
in the open social platform.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:35.133
So to give you a brief overview
of PixChat...

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.300
PixChat seems a little confusing
at first,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.601
but basically what you have here
on the left

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.400
are people viewing the PixChat
from anywhere on the Web.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.567
So either on a profile page
or on any Web page

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.767
you've embedded
this chat room on.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:52.334
On the right-hand side
you can see people

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:54.334
who are active--
actively chatting.

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:57.334
And mixed in as well
are notes, stickers,

00:00:57.334 --> 00:01:00.167
and photos people have left
onscreen

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.067
for other people
to see.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:04.767
So what I'll show here
is--

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:06.167
this is a chat going on.

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:09.033
As people enter and leave,
they'll sometimes chat.

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:10.234
I can even type in a message,

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:12.968
like, "hello?"

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:14.934
It'll show up here.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.200
I can even move
my avatar around,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.667
so it comes up here.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.133
So people can see me better.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.767
I can even check out
people's profiles

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:27.400
if I want, or I can chat
with them privately

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.734
as well.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:32.767
I can also embed
this chat room on any Web page

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:37.067
I want just by copying
the embed code here.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:39.567
I can now also add things
like--

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:44.367
I can change the backgrounds,
I can change this to a...

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:45.634
brown background.

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:47.100
And here you can see
the background has changed

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.167
instantly in real time.

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:51.634
I can add stickers.

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:53.801
So I can put some sushi,

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.300
maybe a spinning wheel,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.901
a teddy bear,

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.133
and a cookie,
and they all appear on here.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:03.701
So here's one
of the teddy bears.

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:07.167
You can move around
and put him here.

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:08.968
I can write notes
to people.

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:10.133
I can also add photos.

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.868
I'm gonna add a photo.

00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:14.033
Let's see.
That one.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.033
And this one.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.601
And they appear instantly here.

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:20.267
So here's one of the photos.

00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:21.300
And I can just zoom in.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.400
And it'll zoom in on it.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.667
You can see
the whole photo here.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.567
If there are other photos
people have put online,

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:27.934
you can see them
as well.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:30.801
It's basically photo-sharing.

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:33.234
I can also search
for videos.

00:02:33.234 --> 00:02:36.100
So here's a search
for App Engine.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.167
So I'm gonna pull
out the campfire video

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:39.934
and stick it on the page.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:42.868
And that showed up here.

00:02:42.868 --> 00:02:43.901
And I can play it.

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:44.968
And it plays it
straight from YouTube.

00:02:44.968 --> 00:02:47.100
(man on video)
Hi, everyone.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.501
(Charles)
Right here from YouTube.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:52.834
And I'll just close that.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:56.934
And that's pretty much
a tour of PixChat.

00:02:56.934 --> 00:03:00.200
Just to show what happens
when you put it across the Web.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.334
You can take the embed code
and put it anywhere,

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:05.167
but PixChat also appears
on your profile.

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:08.200
So here's a profile page
with a smaller version

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.400
of the chat window
running here.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.701
So you basically have
a chat room

00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:13.534
that can be embedded anywhere
instantly.

00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:15.667
And I can even copy
and paste that

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:17.067
and put that
on any Web page,

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:21.000
just like we've done
on our main homepage

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.434
here as well.

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:24.968
The way we built PixChat
on App Engine was,

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:28.033
we ported WebPI, which was
only a few lines of code

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.567
and didn't take very long
to run

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:32.701
on top of App Engine's
Python framework.

00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:34.634
Um, it was really easy.

00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:37.200
And we were able
to start serving

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.734
our open social gadgets,
our Flash animations,

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:44.601
and our Flash clients
all from App Engine.

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:48.701
And the real-time aspect
of the system

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.267
is using
our real-time servers,

00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:54.067
but everything else runs
on App Engine.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.934
 In terms of the--
the--

00:03:56.934 --> 00:04:00.334
the user's
last-visited location

00:04:00.334 --> 00:04:03.934
and the presence information,
we store those

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:08.200
using the Datastore API
and the memcache API.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.434
And we use keys
to speed up the queries.

00:04:13.434 --> 00:04:17.300
And we use memcache to--
it's really very easy.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.033
Just a few lines
of code added in

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:21.968
to make things work great.

00:04:21.968 --> 00:04:24.234
And the whole porting effort
for our prototype took

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:26.334
only three hours
to put together.

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:27.734
And we had the whole system
up and running.
