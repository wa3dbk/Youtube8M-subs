Hi, I'm Jason, Mac genius. And today, we're
going to look at hooking up a shared drive

00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:11.969
to our system, to our network. So we have
right here our wireless router. So, our MacBook

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.700
is again connected. This goes right to our
wireless router. This is the power switch

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.010
(unplugs). And then we have a network drive
here and this is how you hook up the network

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.921
drive. It's got an ethernet port on it. Most
drives just have FireWire USB, but this has

00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:34.010
got an ethernet port on it, which makes it
a network drive. So, we've got that directly

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.710
hooked directly into the router as well, right
here (shows plug). And most network drives

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.760
have a utility that you have to use, software
wise, that directs, that mounts and unmounts

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.610
the drives and things like that. And so this
particular drive uses NDAS Utility. So, I'm

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:06.450
going to select NDAS Utility and I'm going
to choose mount with read/write. And we should

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.440
see that. There it is! Mounted on the desktop.
And at this point, we've got access to read

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.770
and write this drive. Just to make sure that
this is a shared drive, though, I'm going

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.150
to open -- again, just to make sure this is
a shared drive, I'm going to get info on the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:35.990
drive and go down into sharing and permissions.
And we want to change the permissions from

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.180
everyone to read only to read and write. So,
I'm going to type in my admin password and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.250
change this to "Read &amp; Write". And now that's
technically a shared drive so other systems

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.100
can network this. And then getting rid of
this, also again, you want to use the same

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.940
software utility. This is called the NDAS
Utility up here. And we are going to unmount

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:08.110
the drive. I'm going to take our FireWire
drive here, just an external FireWire powered

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.840
bus paneled drive and I'm going to hook that
right into the FireWire port on the computer.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.140
And again, everyone is set to read only. We're
going to click on the lock there, put in our

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.510
admin password and then change the everyone
to "Read &amp; Write". And now that is basically

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.310
a network drive, so anyone who has access
to this computer is also going to have access

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.440
to that drive. And that is basically how you
set up a shared drive on your Mac. I'm Jason.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.080
Thanks for watching.
