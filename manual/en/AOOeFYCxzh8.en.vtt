00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.900
I remember in
'Lomas de Zamora' University,

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:07.301
when I was taking classes
of homosexuality,

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:10.302
we were clearly spoken
about differences.

00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:14.103
"We human beings are alike
in that we are all different",

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:14.904
they used to say.

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:18.605
A pretty idiotic word game
that only increases confusion

00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:21.706
about the problem of human beings
in accepting what is different.

00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:25.607
Here is the testimony of
a singer that, from pop,

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:28.108
suffers this problem in his career:

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.509
the non-acceptance
of what is different.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.410
MICKY VAINILLA
BEING DIFFERENT

00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:36.111
Look into my eyes.

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:38.812
They are trying to
tell you something… Look.

00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:41.813
Do you think
I'm not open enough?

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:44.714
I don't accuse anyone. I just try
to make fun music. That is it.

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:48.515
However, everyone is insisting
on the subject of discrimination.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.716
I repeat: I only want to see
the kids dance and have fun.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.817
Any of my songs is just pop.

00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:55.918
Pop to have fun.

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:03.619
The night glows at the disco.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.720
And dancing I give you a bite.

00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:07.621
But something is bothering me:

00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:09.822
at my side a dark-skinned guy!

00:01:09.823 --> 00:01:11.723
I never make differences,

00:01:11.724 --> 00:01:13.624
but the dark-skinned guy bothers me.

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:15.625
A dark-skinned guy isn't strange

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:17.726
if at the disco
he cleans the toilette.

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:23.727
Ohhh… If the dark-skinned guy
is an employee then it's cool.

00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:29.828
Ohhh… If the dark-skinned guy
is an employee then it's OK.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.729
But don't let him dance with me:

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.730
it's a matter of skin.

00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:36.031
It's a matter of skin!

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.932
That many problems
about one of my songs?

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:44.933
I think that we talk somehow
of a certain lightness, I don't know.

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:48.434
Micky, don't you think you
are sending a dangerous, sick idea?

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:52.535
No, no. Well, I understand,
but my lyrics simply talk

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:54.436
about what happens to us,
the kids,

00:01:54.437 --> 00:01:56.737
when we go out singing
or for a walk.

00:01:57.138 --> 00:01:58.438
About  the dangerous message,

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.339
because many kids
go to see your shows.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.940
But I love it!
I love to see the kids,

00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:06.341
I love to see the families.
I love kids singing my songs.

00:02:06.342 --> 00:02:08.942
I don't know… Of course,
of course it's a pleasure.

00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:10.943
I ask you about the
kids for the very

00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:12.244
polemic advertisement
you made.

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:13.645
You know which one
I'm talking about right?

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:14.846
No, let's see,
let's see…

00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:19.647
This is for you moms

00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:22.448
that want what's best
for your children:

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.649
for them to grow
healthy, strong,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.550
blonde, white-skinned.

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.651
That's why you give
them dessert...

00:02:28.852 --> 00:02:30.052
'Teresito'.

00:02:30.053 --> 00:02:32.253
Of course!
Because dessert 'Teresito'

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:36.254
comes with lacto-genome DC,
that stimulates strength,

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:38.155
intelligence and
prepares your son

00:02:38.156 --> 00:02:40.156
for the competition of life:

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:43.157
to be able to stand out
and grow up far away

00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:44.758
from the poverty line.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.559
And for that we must be
healthy and strong,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.760
with all the conviction
to crush the enemy.

00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:53.761
Respecting natural selection,

00:02:53.762 --> 00:02:56.662
where only the fittest
survives above other

00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:59.163
beings of weak and
corrupted races.

00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:02.964
Remember: dessert
'Teresito'.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:06.465
Vanilla flavored
racial superiority.

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:10.766
Look, either you like it,
or you don't like it.

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.867
I do shows every weekend
in 'Capital Federal'

00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:13.668
and I'm doing great.

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.069
It's a matter of
identification.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.170
People from 'Capital Federal'
are super identified

00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:18.371
by me and my songs.

00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:22.672
Who designs your look?

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:26.473
My hairdresser is
Cucky Varhaihaihaintnz.

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:28.574
She does a little volume
and a little

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:30.475
wacky and funny humor,

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.076
part of the image,
part of the game.

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:33.677
Because that look
and that little mustache

00:03:33.678 --> 00:03:35.978
makes you very similar to a
sinister historical character.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:36.879
Did you know that?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.080
No, who?

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:39.081
Hitler.

00:03:39.982 --> 00:03:41.982
Adolf Hitler…
Hitler.

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:42.683
No.

00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:43.684
The German guy.

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:44.985
No, no,
I don't know him. No.

00:03:44.986 --> 00:03:46.486
Is he a pop singer?

00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:50.887
Look, I just want open heads,
pleasure and emotion.

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:53.088
And for people to listen
to my latest hit, of course.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.489
Stop all bitterness.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.290
Throw sadness to the dust bin.

00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:12.891
I go out to the
streets for a walk.

00:04:13.492 --> 00:04:18.292
But I see a 'Latino'

00:04:18.293 --> 00:04:21.893
that's coming in sandals.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:26.894
He's poor and
has a torn jacket.

00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:28.995
I'll better better
cross the street now

00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:31.296
and call a policeman,

00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:33.997
to lock him up
in advance.

00:04:33.998 --> 00:04:36.298
I'll better better
cross the street now

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:38.599
and call a policeman,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.200
to lock him up
in advance.

00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:43.301
Accused of being a Peruvian.

00:04:45.002 --> 00:04:47.102
I want people to have fun,

00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:49.503
to live freely and
to enjoy music.

00:04:49.504 --> 00:04:51.704
And that's it, that's my truth.
Nothing else.
