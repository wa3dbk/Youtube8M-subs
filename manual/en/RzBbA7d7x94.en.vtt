00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.760
In this video we will discuss operating and
safely using the Forklift.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.290
At Titus we require all forklift operators
to complete our training course on Forklift

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.970
Safety for everyone's safety.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.800
Every employee must obtain certification to
be authorized to operate a forklift. This

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.910
training video will be followed by a written
test. Training sessions will be performed

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.910
whenever new attachments are used, employees
need a refresher course, or for all new employees.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.089
To prevent any damage or injury, here are
the performance requirements for Forklift

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:40.920
use:

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.940
Read and be familiar with the related manufacturer's
operator manual.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.989
Any operator must inform supervision about
any change in medical conditions or about

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.190
prescriptions or over-the-counter drugs, which
may impair your ability to safely operate

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.370
the machine.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.940
Remember: It is prohibited to a forklift while
under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.710
Depending on working conditions, wear protective
equipment if needed and also use seat belts

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.250
if equipped.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.290
When operating a Forklift, always pay attention
to:

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.420
STOP SIGNS: be prepared to immediately stop
the vehicle.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.080
BLIND CORNERS: sound horn when approaching
intersections and utilize a co-worker if the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.690
activity area is in blind spots.
PEDESTRIANS: always yield the right-of-way

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.460
to pedestrians.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.530
Every Operator is required to keep all body
parts inside the operator compartment when

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.080
in movement to prevent injury.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.690
To safely unload or load vehicles, be sure
the trailer wheels are chocked or restrained

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.310
to prevent movement, and always maintain a
safe distance from the ramps, docks, platforms

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.030
or any other working surfaces.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.940
Always set loads against the back of the fork
and low the picker to floor levels prior to

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.920
forward or reverse travel.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.920
When driving a loaded forklift up an incline,
it is important that the operator always drive

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.409
with the load in front of them, up the incline.
Improper driving will cause the forklift to

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:31.019
tip serious injury can occur as well as damage
to materials.

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.829
Other forklift regulations include:
Never tamper with equipment or components

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.900
on the forklift.
Use forklifts only in approved location, maintaining

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.469
appropriate speed.
Avoid using outside the machines designed

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.680
for internal buildings.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.139
Remember to respect the limitations and specifications
when operating a forklift, such as:

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:03.139
Electrical limitations, Truck and load weight,(Titus
never exceeds 2000 Lbs.)

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.269
Never transport personnel under any circumstances.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.829
At the start of each shift of operation, a
vehicle safety inspection is required. Any

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.510
defective equipment should be reported to
supervisor.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.180

includes:

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:37.000

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.909
Always Remember to turn on the propane tank
before you operate and to close the propane

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.069
tank after every use.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.199
Each employee is responsible for the safe
operation and the operational inspection of

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:00.430
the forklift.
It is also the operator's responsibility to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.819
ensure the trailer bed is in good condition
and the trailer wheels are chocked before

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.499
loading and unloading from a trailer.

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:12.559

and understand how to operate the heavy machinery

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:18.920
for your safety. Any questionable conditions
should be reported right away before operating.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.390
