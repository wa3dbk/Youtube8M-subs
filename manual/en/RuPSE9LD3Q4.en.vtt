Hi, this is Phil and Callie, and this is how
to teach a child how to swim. The first thing

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.920
you want to remember when working with a child,
is to remember what it was like to be a child.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.309
Only at that point can you really understand
the fears that children go through in new

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.720
environments, new activities, and with new
people. So when you're adjusting to the water,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.660
the best way to hold a child is underneath
the armpits, just like this. This will help

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.780
acquaint the child with water, and make them
feel more secure. Once you have them underneath

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.001
the armpits, you can just kind of hold them
around, keeping their body on top of the water.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:40.710
Do you feel comfortable? Yeah? You afraid
to talk? That's okay. And then they'll just

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.100
glide around on the top of the water, just
like that. The next thing that I like to do

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.890
working with children, is to go ahead and
teach them first on how to hold their breath.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.340
And by doing this, we just ask them to go....and
make big giant cheeks. Can you make your big

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.220
giant cheeks? Go....and then when you count
to three, go underwater. So, big giant cheeks,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:09.110
holding your breath, and one, two, three.
How was it? (I don't know.) It was pretty

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.130
good. And then they know how to hold their
breath. From that point, you want to try working

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.710
with bubbles, which can be a lot of fun for
children, but then it also can be a little

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.590
bit tough and difficult. So when you first
teach 'em how to blow bubbles, it'll be something

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.909
to this effect. We'll go ahead and put our
mouths just at the top of the water, Miss

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.910
Cal. And that way, they don't have to put
their nose in the water, or their eyes, which

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.369
some children might have certain fears of.
Once we do that, we can do a "ring around

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.840
the rosy" song, and go "splashes, splashes,
we all blow bubbles". And then we'll just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.420
go with that portion, is that okay? Can we
blow bubbles? (Yep) Okay, so we'll go, "splashes,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:56.900
splashes, we all blow bubbles." Incorporating
fun activities in your teaching programs or

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.009
in your lesson plan working with children,
makes the experience that much more fun and

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.400
engaging for children. Especially when they
get a little bit cold and a little bit restless.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.549
You can also go ahead and go on with back
floats, by putting their heads on your shoulder,

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.760
teaching them straight leg, pointed toe kicks,
and then glides. To learn more, please contact

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.169
your local swim instructor for more information
and tips on how to work with your child in

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:21.500
the water.
