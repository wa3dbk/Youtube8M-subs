00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:24.238
First, there is BRAHMA, the SELF-AWARE IMMENSITY, from whose thought-substance are created all known and unknown things.

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:32.799
In this vast, infinite expanse of awareness, one single day lasts four billion, three hundred and twenty million years...

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:39.276
...or one Great Day, in which the four ages of 
 the Earth repeat like the cycle of seasons.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.428
In this ebb and flow of Cosmic Karma lies the web of all existence.

00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:56.908
In the primordial perfect Spring Morning of the GOLDEN AGE, perfect men and women live for 
thousands of years in an earthly paradise without sorrow, evil, sickness or fear.

00:00:56.908 --> 00:01:03.228
Yet, for all their majesty and understanding, nothing could protect the Immaculate Ones from Time.

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:09.280
And so, in the SECOND AGE of SILVER, evil comes to the Earth, in the form of greed.

00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:23.219
Glorious paragons like rama come to contend with 
the encroaching powers of Darkness and ignorance.

00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:26.058
WAR is born.

00:01:26.058 --> 00:01:31.793
And with war came the SUPERWARRIORS, a new race of ultimate men and women...

00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:36.299
...sent to stem civilization's decline at the end of the Second Age.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:42.780
Perfectly constructed, they almost resemble the Immaculate Ones of the preceding Age.

00:01:43.255 --> 00:01:50.460
But the Great Autumn Afternoon of the Third Age began and these Superwarriors become prey to a new misery.

00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:51.680
Disease

00:01:53.077 --> 00:01:54.080
Imperfection

00:01:54.037 --> 00:01:56.400
Decay

00:01:56.434 --> 00:02:04.760
Prophecy says this Third Age of ours will end soon, in its turn, on an epic battlefield, upon the crack of the Ages...

00:02:04.765 --> 00:02:12.760
When we of the Great Autumn Afternoon depart, the terrible FOURTH AGE of Winter Night begins. The Black Age of Iron.

00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:16.510
Wealth is law here.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.380
Dollars and Cents, the new Gods.

00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:23.230
Here survival is the new disciple.

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:26.670
Loneliness is the new faith.

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:28.950
Everything is for sale...

00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.460
Insanity is instinct.

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:40.480
To be born into this Black Age is to suffer 
 constant terror.  A time of interminable war.

00:02:41.303 --> 00:02:45.460
And at its end, evil will engulf the Earth.

00:02:47.544 --> 00:02:49.220
Life will be extinguished.

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:59.030
At last, as the world shudders and dies, RUDRA will come in the form of Seven Suns to obliterate creation.

00:02:58.832 --> 00:03:03.670
Plunging everything toward the heat death of absolute zero.
