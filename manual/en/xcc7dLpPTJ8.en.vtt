00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.960
Well drift is that awesome feeling when you are able to control the car when it is going sideways

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.100
and to stay on the road and drive where you want.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.960
Drift - it's a show. Speed - more than 100km/h and you pull a handbrake.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.860
Fans love to came to drift competitions because they like the smoke, they like to hear tyres howling

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.500
Even when I'm driving my day to day car and I'm thinking about drifting

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.280
how I will drift through those corners on the track. Those thoughts alone gives me an a adrenaline rush.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.920
Then, when I get to the race track, get to my car

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.920
I have already planned what I'm going to do. How I'm going to drive.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.920
Drift is pretty risky. 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.940
You have 15-20 seconds on the track and if you're not careful enough

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.800
and you knock over a cone, that on mistake ruins all your effort.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.960
Ruins your result. In fact it can even ruin your position in overall year standings.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.580
If I have to describe a perfect drift day, it's when you register for the race.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.120
You start the training runs. Later on, you are racing and everything is going perfect and you just dominate in every run.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.700
But there are times when you don't win. When it happens you shouldn't blame yourself for too long

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.300
because if you gave your max, at least you had fun, when you were pushing it hard.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640
You won!

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.460
From experience I can say that stability is a key to good result.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.400
You have to get your act together and you have to enjoy drifting. Then results will come.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.760
Another thing.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.100
If you really want to climb to the top, you have to risk

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.220
But don't mess risk with stupidity, it doesn't always pay off.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.520
Even if you did everything precisely, but then at the finish line you knocked down a cone

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.760
that's, it you can go home.
