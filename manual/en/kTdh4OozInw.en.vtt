00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.509
arising number of military uh...
soldiers are overweight and as a result

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.679
of that they're being discharged from
the military now i'm looking at their

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.980
vin numbers reported on the number of
obese soldiers within the army

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.520
specifically and the numbers are
actually pretty depressing also the

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.689
number of active duty military personnel
deemed overweight or obese has more than

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.119
tripled

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.270
um... but in twenty ten or fees

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.119
the in twenty ten eighty six thousand
one eighty six troops or five point

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.200
eight percent of the force received at
least one clinical diagnosis of

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.500
overweight or obese

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.250
but stop right there because i

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.460
have been an issue with this because

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.380
our soldiers have to passed two
different tests the first test

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.709
make sense it's an endurance test where
they have to do running push-ups sit-ups

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:52.950
than usual stuff on and the second test
is where they dual body mass index

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.020
and that's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.640
let's keep their real b_m_i_ is usually

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.059
mostly time inaccurate

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.059
it because you might be muscular right
muscle weighs more than fat

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.939
you might be short and you might not
pass the b_m_i_ tet test based on that a

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:07.860
lot

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.610
yet look or all these will be seat s i
fear of sir

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
uh... and if everybody is that the servi
service partly because

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.790
we arm or a piece of paper but it's also
partly because

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.290
for the way they were measuring it we're
like okay if you don't look like much

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.360
combo

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690
recalling some movies straight

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.270
intermediation only made one pass the
uh... i don't care because of that asked

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.849
if he turns out that he could

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.740
passenger recess push-ups sit-ups a
setter

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.100
dot blots and it's sort of similar to
women who want to be on the front lines

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.560
uh... instead of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.770
picking who can be on the front lines
based on uh... gender why don't you just

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.150
see if women can pass the certain
testing in duran's test

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.690
and if they can then if they want to be
in combat sharpening combat it's a very

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.810
similar

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.810
um... you know type of situation

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.360
so um... but it would be naive to deny
that

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.690
members of our military are getting all
the sides of my own aggressiveness like

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.909
the rest of us so

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.649
uh... in by the way just a few other
statistics that i found a little

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.369
interesting during the first ten months
of this year

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.349
the army kicked out one thousand six
hundred twenty five soldiers for being

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.140
out of shape

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.880
about fifteen times the number discharge
for that reason two thousand seven the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.170
peak of wartime deployment cycles so
it's probably 'cause we're getting

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.800
slightly better but mainly because we
knew a lot of soldiers voted two

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.929
thousand seven so they liked her very
slight he's fine

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.329
program finances are a registered nurse
who really love

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.979
well on the phone with you

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.809
may act that was the most violent here
in the war in iraq so that's why they

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.169
needed to deploy as many as possible

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.559
so uh... that's not really works

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.769
but look at them and river problems the
role reversal of the like

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.849
uh... content writing for kids the
develop

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.029
you are trying to dictate every part of
our lives

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:59.219
and then we've got noted this movie to
that

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.620
that's the thing that you would normally
with a job well
