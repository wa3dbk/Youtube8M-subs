00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.620
Sony Xperia T3 review: Wits and looks.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.770
Sony's Xperia T lineup has been growing out
of 007's tux and the third generation is putting

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.770
on a t-shirt.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:16.180
OK, an oversized t-shirt, although the T3
has lost some weight, and screen real-estate,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.750
compared to the T2.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.540
Gone is the Ultra moniker and the massive
6" display - the Xperia T3 is closer to smartphones

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.070
than phablets.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.160
It is indeed that simple, the Sony Xperia
T3 is a more compact version of the Xperia

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.859
T2 Ultra phablet, one that you can slip in
your pocket.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.600
The screen is still a high-quality IPS unit
of 720p resolution and Sony once again goes

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.680
for the Snapdragon 400.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.160
The Xperia T3 is running KitKat out of the
box which is good, but other specs are taken

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.660
a notch down.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.049
The camera, to begin with, is now an 8MP unit,
down from 13MP in the T2 Ultra.

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.909
On the upside, the proper shutter key is there.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.710
With a 2,500mAh battery, the Xperia T3 will
probably struggle to match the impressive

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.969
times of the T2 Ultra, but we'd be happy if
it gets close enough.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.000
Here is the complete list.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.860
Key features.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.800
� Impressively thin at 7mm
� 5.3" 720p IPS capacitive touchscreen Triluminos

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.500
display (277ppi), X-Reality engine, ambient
light sensor

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.720
� LTE connectivity
� Android 4.4.2 KitKat

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.040
� Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset with quad-core
1.2GHz Cortex-A7 processor, Adreno 305 GPU

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.270
and 1GB of RAM
� 8MP camera, single LED flash, 1080p video

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.720
recording, dedicated hardware shutter key
� 1.1MP front-facing camera with 720p video

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.750
recording
� 8GB of built-in storage, expandable via

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.800
the microSD card slot
� Active noise cancellation with a secondary

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.740
microphone
� 2,500 mAh battery; STAMINA Power Saving

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.990
Mode
Main disadvantages.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.409
� Non user-replaceable battery
� No water or dust proofing

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.890
The Sony Xperia T3 seems reasonably equipped
for the midrange and does well to offer LTE

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.100
connectivity on top of good looks and solid
build.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.750
It's also one of the thinnest Sony smartphones
around with only the Z Ultra having a thinner

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.750
profile.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.340
The sealed battery should hardly be a surprise,
we guess it's part of the price you are paying

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.120
for the Omni Balance design.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.840
That said, we have perhaps seen too much of
it already, though it isn't something to hold

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.409
against a device of the Xperia T3's price
bracket and level of equipment.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.989
Design and handling.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.079
It's not like we haven't seen the OmniBalance
design used on a plethora of Xperia smartphones

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.209
over the past few years.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.319
It's probably time the next flagship moved
on but the midrange Xperia T3 is on the safe

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.379
side.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.019
It looks reasonably good and has pleasant
handling.

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.200
The Sony Xperia T3's entire front is occupied
by the 5.3" IPS display.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.719
The non-removable rear cover is made of plastic,
with matte finish in graphite black.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.019
The material doesn't look or feel low quality,
but fingerprints tend to stick on.

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.810
They would probably be harder to notice on
the white and purple versions.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.700
Still, the issue is not as obvious as it would
have been on a glossy surface.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.249
Just like most of the previous Xperia phones,
the Xperia T3 sides are lined with a glossy

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:08.900
strip for a nice contrasting accent.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.529
The only thing actually made of metal is the
signature power/lock key.

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:17.469
Handling the Sony Xperia T3 is a pleasure
and the screen size isn't a particular burden.

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:23.700
With a 7mm waistline, the Xperia T3 feels
great in hand, not bulky at all, and well

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.059
put together, no wobbles or squeaks.

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.819
In fact, it's among the thinnest Sony phones
ever.
