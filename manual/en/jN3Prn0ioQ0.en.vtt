00:00:00.522 --> 00:00:03.882
Where? oh! where did the year go? It's
holiday season again.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.440
Holiday season is traditionally a time where we exchange gifts with each other.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.840
But what you may not know is that holiday season is also a notoriously stressful time

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.751
for marriages and romantic
relationships.

00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:20.691
January, out of aaall the months of the year, is the one month that has the highest

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:25.281
filings of divorce. More people filed
for divorce in January than any other month of the year.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.479
In this video I'm gonna teach you the greatest gift that you can give to your romantic partner

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.669
this holiday season, that doesn't cost a
penny

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:39.228
and will transform the way they
experience your relationship.

00:00:39.228 --> 00:00:43.688
Will have them love you more and make for a really, really happy holiday season.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.040
Hi. I'm Bruce Muzik. I'm a relationship coach

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:50.756
and I specialize in helping couples fix
their troubled relationship.

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:54.606
In more than 10 years of coaching
people, I've noticed

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:59.386
something that I think is profound. "The
people who live the happiest and healthiest lives

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:02.704
tend to have great relationships with
their parents".

00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:05.963
In fact, people who have happy marriages,

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:09.054
also tend to have great relationships
with their parents.

00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:12.803
Is almost as if you have a great
relationship with your parents,

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:16.532
you get given this magical gift of high self-esteem.

00:01:16.532 --> 00:01:20.232
That high self-esteem gives you more
confidence. Then you don't take

00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:23.952
things personally, you don't take life so
seriously, you have a greater sense of humor,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.832
you're better at getting along with
people.

00:01:25.832 --> 00:01:28.672
What does this have to do with the
holiday season?

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.411
Well, I promise you in this video I would share with you the unforgettable gift you

00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:35.791
could give to your relationship partner this holiday season. Here it is:

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.320
In my opinion, the best gift you can give to your partner is to give them the gift

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.629
of a great relationship with their
parents.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.858
I know, it sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? But stick with me. If you help your partner

00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:53.358
create an extraordinary relationship
with their parents (whether they're alive

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.860
or dead you can do this).

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:58.817
What you do, is you transform the way
your partner

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:03.595
experiences and sees themselves. Because we're so tied in unconsciously

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:08.805
to our parents (our self-image and
self-esteem came from our parents mostly).

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:12.715
So when you transform your relationship
with your parents - unconsciously -

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:17.274
you transform the way your partner sees
themselves. And in doing so

00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:21.544
you transform the way your partner sees the world; the way your partner sees you

00:02:21.544 --> 00:02:24.304
and the way your partner relates to your relationship.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.540
Your romantic relationship between the two of you.

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:29.603
Ultimately the highest leverage thing
you can do

00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:33.552
to transform your romantic relationship,
is to take responsibility for making

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:38.952
sure that your partner has an
extraordinary relationship with their parents.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.440
Now, how do you do this? You're probably thinking

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.000
"Bruce I'm not a psychotherapist I don't know how to transform my partner's
relationship with their parents"

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.639
Well, it doesn't have to be complicated.
And the first thing I want to underline is

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.520
I am not asking you to interfere.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.780
All I'm asking you to do is support your
partner from the sidelines,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.099
having an extraordinary relationship with their parents.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.938
A way to get started doing this is
to help your partner

00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:06.158
discover the positive intention behind
their parents actions.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.337
Very often, when
we're spending time with our family

00:03:10.337 --> 00:03:14.297
in the holiday season. We can get
triggered by our parents (perhaps you have a controlling mother)

00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:18.055
You're making the dinner table for a
family dinner and even though you're

00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:22.175
thirty-fourty years old, your mother is still
telling you exactly where to put the knives and the forks

00:03:22.274 --> 00:03:25.744
you get triggered and you get annoyed. Well, all that means

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:29.704
is that you have some unhealed childhood baggage around your parents.

00:03:29.704 --> 00:03:34.303
And as a relationship partner you can
support your partner healing that baggage.

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:38.373
Whenever something comes up for your partner, where they're annoyed

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:43.293
with a parent, what you can do is help your partner find the positive intention

00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:46.861
behind their parents' behavior. I'll give you an example:

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.880
When I was growing up into a young man, one of the things my dad would do is

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.891
he would slip some money in my back pocket

00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:56.311
as I was leaving the house, and you'd  think I'd be grateful but I wasn't.

00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:59.840
I was really annoyed and angry because I interpreted it as

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.380
my dad actually... insulting
me and saying to me

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.080
"Bruce I don't think you're a man, you still need to be dependent on me".

00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:11.348
At that point I had a troubled
relationship with my father,

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.780
and somebody once said to me "Consider that is just your Dad's way

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.497
of saying I love you. That he has a
positive intention behind the money.

00:04:19.497 --> 00:04:21.587
So what is the positive intention?"

00:04:21.587 --> 00:04:26.127
I thought about it an I realized... wow! ... "My dad actually is just trying to say that he loves me.

00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:30.240
He's just trying to help me because he loves me so much". And when I saw  that, the penny dropped.

00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:35.615
I stopped blaming my father for
trying to keep me small and for thinking

00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:38.444
that I wasn't man enough to be
independent.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:42.014
I went to him and actually appreciated him. I thanked him for giving me the money.

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.533
Our relationship changed in that moment.

00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:48.633
Now, you can do this with your partner's
controlling mother.

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:53.033
Imagine this in the previous example that I gave you with a controlling mother setting the table.

00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:57.042
It could be that the mother's positive
intention is just to make everything

00:04:57.042 --> 00:04:58.512
neat and tidy because

00:04:58.512 --> 00:05:01.742
she wants to feel relaxed and she wants
everybody to feel at home when

00:05:01.742 --> 00:05:03.141
everything is neat and tidy.

00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:06.611
When you help your partner see their
parents positive intention,

00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:10.140
you take the first step in helping heal
their relationship.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.059
Even more importantly the same
distinctions apply to you

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:17.199
and to me. If you don't have an
extraordinary relationship

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.408
with your parents you're at a
disadvantage in life,

00:05:20.408 --> 00:05:23.508
and you're in a disadvantage in your
relationship.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.960
The most common question I get to ask about this is

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.860
"Bruce what happens if my parents are dead?"

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.898
It doesn't matter whether or not
your parents are alive or dead. You can still

00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:34.138
use this technique on their memory.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.020
Go and write down where you are most upset, and the things you're most upset about ,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.836
and that you're still carrying around.

00:05:39.836 --> 00:05:43.616
Any resentment you might still be
carrying around about your parent's who've passed away.

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:47.535
Write it down and start to look for what
were your parents positive

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:51.875
loving intentions behind their actions
and don't stop until you find them.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:54.903
If you're struggling to find that positive intention just call your

00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:58.104
relationship partner. Call your husband or your wife; your boyfriend or your girlfriend,

00:05:58.104 --> 00:06:01.644
to come and help you find the positive intention and let them contribute to you and help you.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.813
So there you have it, the most unforgettable gift

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:08.752
you can give your romantic partner this
holiday season.
