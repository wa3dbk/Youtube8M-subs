Hi my name is Jill Weiss and I'm going to
tell you a little bit about how to break in

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:16.699
your softball or baseball mitt. First thing
you want to do is usually when you buy a brand

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:24.060
new glove is the stiffness of the glove. You're
going to want to soften the leather, any way

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.730
you can. Kind of what I do is, take some shaving
creme kind of spread it around inside and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.600
outside of the glove. And then you're going
to take two softballs, and you're going to

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.280
place them inside, inside the glove to keep
it open, then you're going to take like a

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.079
rubber band or a piece of string and you're
actually going to wrap the string around to,

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:03.089
to tie it up. Once it's together you can grab
any type of plastic bag set it in there you

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:11.200
know tie tie the bag and let it sit over night,
you know that way the shaving creme and everything

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.350
will soften the leather and the balls inside
will actually form the shape with the deeper

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:28.649
pockets inside the glove. The next day when
you take it out, grab a rag or a towel something

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.480
like that so you can clean out the, the inside
and outside of the glove to just clean out

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.900
the shaving creme, then take it out and just
using it in practice you want to try and make

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.229
sure you get the glove nice and soft and fitting
to your liking before you actually use it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.869
in a game so, that's kind of the most important
thing in softening a softball glove. Again

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.250
my name is Jill Weiss and that's just a little
bit about how to clean a softball glove.
