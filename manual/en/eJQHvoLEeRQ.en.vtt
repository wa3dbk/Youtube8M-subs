00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.470
political office has a corrupt even well
intended people

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.540
cells of your seo and personnel there

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.870
uh... and then they say that political
parties are taking advantage of voters

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.240
by seeing the polarizing issues that
really are of minimal consequence

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.989
and up

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.819
i totally agree with that as well and
rightly a left-wing they like it you

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.000

why we're both protesting

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.890

well what do you think corrupted that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.950
third question that i love crafts

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.320
and the people are two people said hey
you know what you know that in the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.490
recounting of the story here in so long

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.350
they say it's not a bad point we can see
how corporate employees would be you

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.170
know something that winds up

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.310
affecting the politicians when they get
money from their that's not to say that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.760
there are a key part of people are now
on the rampage against corporations or

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.880
anything like that are on the bit of
money that they spend but it's a cup it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.200
wasn't interesting a fruitful
conversation they want to meet again and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.660
then came the kate rick said

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.259
uh... quote the team bubble tea party
cannot deprive movement

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.810
would be the biggest threat ever

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.349
uh... by totally agree

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.420
and and i think that that would be

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.390
just absolutely fantastic

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.800
now one more productive thing that came
out of meeting that's really interesting

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.960
uh... it turns out that the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.230
occupy guys the using this park

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.780
uh... for two weeks uh... and didn't
have to pay for any of it but the tea

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.940
party guys had done uh... a protest that
same part and they were made to pay

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.230
eight thousand five eleven forty four
dollars and eighty two cents

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.619
for permits and celebrate

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.839
e is now the occupier movement is hoping
the tea party movement recruit back

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.379
costing the government possessing you
should have to pay for your

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.800
pretty together a protest that so well
known

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.300
fact of the united states constitution
even when the k_k_k_ marches through

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.379
town

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.279
they can't be made to pay for because
that is their first amendment right so

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.639
they should never charged a tea party
guys in the first place and i love the

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.479
doctor fire movement is helping them get
that money back

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:50.049
get together man week we can do this we
can fight the power if we joined forces

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.619
and we had the same exact complaints
about aside house

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:58.369
politicians have been pulling corrupted
and it is largely the influence of giant

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:02.159
money whether it's corporations unions
in satara that have corrupted this

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.009
process we need to get our democracy
back to me to start following the

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.319
constitution
