00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:18.607
I always wonder, why do always have to wear armor inside a ship?

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:26.886
Because with the armor, if the ship depressurizes, you three minutes before you eyes pop out of their sockets.

00:00:26.886 --> 00:00:28.646
My eyes...

00:00:29.207 --> 00:00:33.654
And why make a combat suit completely airtight if you only have 3 minutes worth of air?

00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:38.062
Don't question the Kaminons.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.429
And why are you wearing "camo" on the bridge?

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:45.429
Shut up, before I rip out your kidney, hand it to the chef, and bring meat back on the menu.

00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:49.594
He's worn that armor since the Battle of Felucia, at night he sleeps in his closet.

00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:51.805
The Acklays just keep coming!

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:56.936
  I saw one of them tear my commander into four pieces, and he was still alive!

00:00:57.137 --> 00:01:01.052
Those of us who slept died, most of us who came back were insane.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.831
Well, that explains a lot of things-

00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:06.779
wait, detecting incoming ship, CIS cruiser from the corporate alliance.

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:08.063
Sound for the Captain!

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:16.824
Charging turbolasers, arming proton torpedoes, shields charging.

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:18.427
Status report!

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.233
Enemy ship, M-Class Strike Cruiser incoming.

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:22.761
They're firing!

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:34.265
AHH-!

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:36.319
Damnit, get those shields back up!

00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:37.710
I can’t get power sir!

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:39.553
Damage report!

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.246
We lost main power and the secondary bridge…

00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:46.210
Wait, why do we have two bridges?

00:01:47.723 --> 00:01:49.347
Now’s not the time!

00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:53.325
Sir, turbolasers are fully charged, should I divert power to shields?

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:55.424
No, fire!

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.907
CIS vessel has taken hard damage on port side.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.452
Hard to port, standby port turbolasers.
