00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.450
I keep getting told I need to go vegan or
raw to be healthy, wealthy, wise and ethical.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.390
Can you tell me why you should never go vegan?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.660
You say you’re living an all natural life
and then have to buy B12 supplements made

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.590
in a bioreactor.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.460
There are people who go years as a vegan before
they need supplements.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.890
Only because the liver can store a ten year
supply of the nutrient before you run out

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.050
and become anemic.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.040
And because you get the nutrient from meat
and animal products like milk, vegetarians

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.030
getting it from cheese don’t run short.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.890
Yet I’ve heard going vegan is good for your
health.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.780
You lose weight because there are fewer calories
and more fiber in your diet.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.420
Then you get really skinny.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.310
That’s attractive.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.850
Skinny to the point of looking anorexic isn’t
attractive.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.890
Doesn’t a vegan diet improve your hair?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.129
Not if you don’t get enough protein, and
because a lot of vegans won’t eat enough

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.210
beans or any faux meat, they don’t.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.659
And insufficient protein leaves you with weak
muscles.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.140
And limp hair.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.140
And going vegan makes you radical.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.799
Vegan is a radically eco-friendly diet.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.469
Have you ever seen vegans debate over whether
honey is exploitative of bees?

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.609
Or going nuts over Starbucks drinks colored
with ground up bugs?

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.770
I don’t want to eat bugs, vegan or not.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.280
Fruit and vegetable processing standards by
the FDA allow a ratio of bug parts, so everyone

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.600
does.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.810
And saying you won’t eat animals to be in
harmony with nature neglects the fact that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.159
wild bison are ripped apart by wolves.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.780
Just because nature can be cruel doesn’t
mean we should be.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.149
Lots of vegans are as angry and ranting as
the Westboro church, but they nitpick people

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.710
as they sit down to eat.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.259
It’s like an atheist picking on you while
you get ready to go to a church wedding, instead

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.510
of just putting up a Festivus pole and going
home to get drunk.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.189
And then there’s the fifty questions game
with the waiter.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.630
Fine, I’ll stay vegetarian.
