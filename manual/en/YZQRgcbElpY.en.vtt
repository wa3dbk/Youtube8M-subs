00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.640
- [Matt] Let's face it, rules are there to
be broken and our beloved sport of cycling

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.330
is no exception at all. And we're not
talking about UCR regulations here,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.070
more the unwritten rules that, on
occasion, actually need to be broken so we

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.110
can all spread our own
individual cycling wings.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.450
Top 10 cycling rules to break!

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.220
Sock-shoe combination. A few years back,
you'd have been hauled before the court by

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.870
your bib shorts if you'd have had the
audacity to venture out in anything but

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.700
traditional black shoes, white socks
combo.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.530
- [Si] Yeah. Now, though, almost any shoe-
sock combination seems to be acceptable.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.660
There's even gray socks in the pro
peloton.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.870
I'm loving those, that length. Perfect.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.620
- Yeah, I hold them up like
permanently tensing my calf muscles.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.100
- Wearing leg warmers without arm warmers
on. This may seem a little odd to you,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.380
and in fact, it does to us too, hence it
being in this list. Do the right thing and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.260
ignore this frankly peculiar rule.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.100
- [Dan] You all right?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.540
- No, my legs are fine, it's just that my
arms are getting a bit warm.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.840
It's just what I've always done, mate.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.570
- I know you've always done it because I
noticed in that Bertie video where he

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.600
dropped you, you had this combo going on.
Didn't help you then, did it?

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.980
- Wearing pro team kit.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.070
Another unwritten rule that we're happy to
see screwed up and tossed into the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.710
recycling bin is this, that you can't
wear pro kit unless you're a pro.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.955
Well, stuff that. If you're a fan of the
sport and want to support your favorite

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.750
rider or team, then why not?

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.140
- Yeah. Although we do have one
caveat. We draw the line at wearing the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.916
kit of national or indeed world
champions. Just respect the stripes.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:38.693
Oh. Well actually, it's just up to you.

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:46.043
- Tools and tubes should be stored in
pockets.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:51.000
- Whoa, hold on a minute. There are
options. Saddlebags these days can be

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.500
really discreet, tucking themselves very
neatly and aerodynamically beneath your

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.000
seat so as not to disturb your bike's
wonderful aesthetic. You pop your tools

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.520
and your tubes in there to keep your
pockets bulk-free and comfortable.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.650
So, we will take that rule
and we will put it in the trash.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.830
- No unplanned cafe stops.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.680
Hey, new cafe!

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.218
- Hey, check it out. That looks
all right, doesn't it?

00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:13.753
- Can we stop here?

00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:14.140
- Let's do it.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.640
- So when faced with the quandary of "do
we or don't we," apply this test.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.650
"Will I ever get the chance again?"
If no, give in and enjoy.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.650
- Whose round is it?

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.280
- Uh, I think it might be yours again, Si,
to be honest with you.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.340
- Four rounds on the truck?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.170
- But we set the limit at
five stops per ride.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.760
Shorts should always be black. To be so
ingrained as to arbitrarily ignore the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.010
option of even trying other colors we
find rather unhealthy. So we say,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.620
give colors a chance, but approach with
caution. FDJ, AG2R, and Cervelo test team

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.790
kit designers, please take note.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.010
Stick to your training plan. Look, we're
not telling you to throw your plan

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.037
completely out the window and dispense
with it altogether, of course.

00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:05.810
If you really are tired, dial down the
intensity and take a day off, or up for

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.950
the cafe over intervals.
Don't be a slave to the plan.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.540
You have to eat energy products.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.670
I'll tell you what, Si, it must be nearly
lunch time. I'm absolutely starving,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.920
I've not got any food.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.653
Gels, bars, and energy products are all
well and good, and certainly have their

00:03:21.653 --> 00:03:23.440
place...
- I've got baguettes for us.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.750
- I...thanks very much, that's fantastic!

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.000
Simply pack your pockets with stuff you
like: your favorite sandwich,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.970
some homemade fruit cake, even pizza! Your
pockets are your oyster.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.870
Ride naked. No, not that naked.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.210
Have we been here before?
I think we're lost.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.570
Once in a while, why not turn off your
generic cycle computer? It's liberating.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.530
A voyage of discovery dictated only by how
far you're willing to push your personal

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.165
envelope of natural instinctive
inquisitiveness.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.410
No Tour de France viewing when working.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.740
The Tour de France only comes around once
a year, albeit 21 days a year,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.530
once a year. Anyway, because of its
relative rarity, we think that bosses in

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.040
general should be far more generous when
it comes to our Tour de France viewing

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.850
pleasure.
Eh, Dan?

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.410
- Sorry? Sorry, man. I was watching the
Tour. Cracking stage.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.550
Have we...let's crack on with the end of
the video anyway.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.620
- I've done it. That was it. That was the
last one. You missed it because you were

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.160
watching the Tour.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.330
- Oh. Sorry, mate. We've got loads more
great top 10s for you on the channel,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.250
some of them from a few years ago but real
gems. So if you click just up there,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.460
we've got our top 10 things not to eat on
a bike and just down there we've got top

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.890
10 things not to wear on a bike.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.730
- Well, if you want to subscribe to GCN,
you might as well click on the Tour de

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.190
France because that's what Dan is pretty
much focused on anyway.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.725
Cheers, Dan.
