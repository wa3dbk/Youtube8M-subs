Hi we’re Nick and Valerie Wisniewski on
behalf of Expert Village.com. We would like

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.700
to show you how to identify fisher tracks
in the wild and for information, you can check

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.960
our website www.walnuthilltracking.com. The
fisher is a large member of the weasel family

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.190
and like other members of the weasel family;
it has 5 toes that register in the track on

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.310
both the hind foot and the front foot. The
fisher tends to have bulbous toes and the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.370
claws sometime do register and sometimes the
don’t. It has very well developed sharp

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.480
claws for grasping and holding prey. The heel
pad has a c-shape to it which helps differentiate

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.269
between other families of animals and weasels.
One of the most common patterns of the fisher

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.030
is what we called a 3-4 bound. Some people
to refer to it as a lope. It is somewhat related

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.250
to a gallop or a lope. It is highly variable
and the way the fisher does it like other

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.390
weasels, the fisher can be very erratic. It
is a highly energetic animal as it moves around

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.070
the landscape. Now what we have here are two
groups of actually not 3 prints but 4 prints.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.850
Now what happens is the fisher is moving along.
A front and a front will hit the ground and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.310
then a hind, and then a hind. In this case,
the hind has landed on top of another front

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.850
leaving a pattern of three. The fisher has
very variable distances in between and when

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.750
we measure the stride of a fisher in this
kind of gait, we measure what is called an

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.940
intergroup length or the space in between
the groups. So you will measure from the trailing

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.700
edge of one group to the leading edge of another
group. In this particular case, it is just

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.300
under 20 inches. Fisher can have a stride
in this kind of pattern up to 30 inches and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.750
the only other animal that you could possibly
confuse it with might be the river otter but

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:27.370
the river otter does not have as long strides
as the fisher and the trail width of the river

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.540
otter is much wider. The fisher has a more
narrow trail; usually from somewhere around

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.370
3 to 5 inches. In this case, it shows us a
little less than 4 inches. So that fairly

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.390
narrow 3-4 bound and the fairly long stride
tells us that this is fisher.
