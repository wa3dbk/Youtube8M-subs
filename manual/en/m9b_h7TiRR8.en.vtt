00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.024
Voiceover: Let's say you plant a
PPD and a person comes back in,

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:11.189
and now they want to find out
whether it's positive or negative.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:12.529
The way I kind of think about it is

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.529
I break people down into their risk group.

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.696
I think of 3 risk groups.

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:22.188
I think high risk, medium
risk, and low risk.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.529
If they're not high or medium,

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.862
then they basically by
default become low risk.

00:00:26.862 --> 00:00:28.696
That's how it works out.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:31.950
Going to the high risk, there's
2 ways to think about it.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.911
Either I'm really worried that
they are going to have TB,

00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:37.712
and that could be someone
who I suspect has it,

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:41.524
maybe they have a very
abnormal chest x-ray,

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:44.076
or maybe they lots of fevers, cough,

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:47.363
night sweats, things like
that and I really suspect TB.

00:00:47.363 --> 00:00:49.337
They would fall in the high risk, right?

00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:51.150
Because I worry that they have it.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.788
In fact, even their family
members, close contacts,

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:59.404
let's say a grandchild
of a person who has TB,

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:02.282
or and uncle or an auntie
of somebody who has TB,

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:04.221
someone in the household, they are also

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:06.531
at high risk of getting TB.

00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:09.937
These are folks I'm worried
may have tuberculosis,

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.036
but also in this high risk group I'm going

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:14.379
to put a third group, or a third category

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.308
which is immunocompromised people.

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:18.571
This is people that do not have a normal

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:21.126
immune system so these folks it's

00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:24.063
not that I'm worried that
they have TB necessarily,

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:26.827
but it's that if they did have TB, gosh,

00:01:26.827 --> 00:01:29.104
that would be really
awful because tuberculosis

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:31.045
requires that you have
a good immune system,

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:32.831
and if they don't have
a good immune system

00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:34.881
then tuberculosis is going to be devasting

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.625
for these folks especially folks with HIV.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.179
In this first group then,
the high risk group,

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.167
either I'm really worried
that they have it,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.580
or I'm worried that if they did get it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.515
they would get really sick with it.

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:48.419
For these folks, a positive test would be

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:52.429
induration, remember in PPD
you're measuring induration

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.622
anything above 5 millimeters,

00:01:54.622 --> 00:01:58.346
anything above this range
would be considered positive.

00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:00.733
For example, if someone with HIV comes

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:04.280
and they have a PPD of,
let's say, 6 millimeters

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.134
then they would definitely be positive,

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:09.208
but if it was 3, then
they would be negative.

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:11.580
This red stuff that
I'm kind of filling in,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.009
this is the positive range,
positive anywhere in here.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.434
Anything below that, I'm
going to write it in white

00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:22.676
down here. This would be
negative, anything below 5.

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:25.706
If it's exactly 5, then
that's still positive.

00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:27.742
Who's in the medium range? These folks.

00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:30.880
One group would be people
coming from an endemic country.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.255
Let's say they recently came across

00:02:33.255 --> 00:02:36.146
from China or parts of Africa.

00:02:36.146 --> 00:02:37.550
If they're coming from a country where

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.284
tuberculosis is very common or endemic,

00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:44.373
then they are also in
that medium risk group.

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:48.634
Also folks that live or
work in large groups.

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:52.099
Think about nursing homes, or let's say,

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.865
a jail or an army barracks.

00:02:54.865 --> 00:02:56.797
Anyone that lives or works in these kinds

00:02:56.797 --> 00:03:00.284
of places in a large group setting,

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:05.722
I'll say large group setting, is
at risk for getting TB because,

00:03:05.722 --> 00:03:08.575
of course, it spreads from
person to person very quickly.

00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:11.807
If you're around a lot of people,
you're upping your chances.

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:13.585
Similarly, people that are in health care

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:16.254
so anyone working in a
hospital setting because,

00:03:16.254 --> 00:03:18.465
of course, people with TB
often come to health care

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:20.962
settings to be take care of.

00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:22.312
If you're in a health care setting working

00:03:22.312 --> 00:03:26.151
as a nurse or a doctor, then
you also are in the medium risk.

00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:29.138
I, myself, because I'm a physician, am

00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:30.701
in the medium risk for this reason.

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.290
I'll put a few more up here; IV drug use.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.209
This also puts you in the medium risk.

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.580
Then I'm going to actually switch gears,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.700
and just as before where
I said I'm also worried,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.194
specifically worried about certain groups,

00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:47.363
here I'm very worried about
children less than 4 years of age.

00:03:47.363 --> 00:03:48.617
If you're less than 4 years of age

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:50.789
meaning if you're 3, or 2, or 1,

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.366
those children they may
not have any other reason

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:56.492
for getting TB like the
people I just mentioned

00:03:56.492 --> 00:03:58.729
like health care setting
or endemic country

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.074
where it's around, but if they did get it,

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.377
it would be particularly
problematic because

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:05.847
young kids don't have
great immune systems.

00:04:05.847 --> 00:04:09.584
Also, people that are actually
fighting other diseases.

00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:11.957
We call those comorbidities.

00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:14.801
Let's say you have
already gotten a disease

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.040
like diabetes, or let's say your
kidneys aren't working properly,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.281
if you already have other diseases

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.923
then you're also at risk
because if you did get TB,

00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:27.790
it would be even tougher to fight it off.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.978
For all of these folks, 10 millimeters

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.161
or above is considered positive.

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:33.524
I didn't make an exhaustive list.

00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:34.830
There actually are a few other ones,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.210
but I tried to highlight some

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.813
of the most important ones on this list.

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:41.882
For example, just to
make sure we understand

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:44.654
how to utilize this, let's
say you have a person

00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:48.862
who is 3 years old and
that person comes in

00:04:48.862 --> 00:04:52.568
with a PPD of 12 millimeters.

00:04:52.568 --> 00:04:55.428
That would be positive here, but
if it was only 8 millimeters,

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:59.266
it would be negative so that's
how you would use this graph.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:01.025
So down here then we have anyone else,

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.364
anyone that doesn't fit
into the other categories

00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:06.596
fits into this final one so
this is the low risk category.

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:10.410
For these folks, 15 millimeters
or greater are needed

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.566
to be considered positive.

00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:14.919
If you have someone that is very healthy,

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.818
and doesn't fit into
any of the other things

00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:20.909
that we just talked about and
their PPD is 20 millimeters,

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.779
then they would be considered positive,

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.185
but if it was only,
let's say, 13 millimeters

00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:27.954
somewhere in this other range down here,

00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:30.459
then they would be considered negative.

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.417
You basically measure the induration,

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:34.193
and then you kind of think
about what risk group

00:05:34.193 --> 00:05:36.854
a person falls into; high, medium, or low,

00:05:36.854 --> 00:05:39.775
and then you kind of organize
it using these graphs,

00:05:39.775 --> 00:05:42.358
very easy, right? So above 5, or above 10,

00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:44.729
or above 15 tells you which is considered

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.125
positive versus negative.

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:48.279
A couple of questions people
always ask is they think,

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.032
"What if someone falls into
2 of these categories?"

00:05:51.032 --> 00:05:53.757
What if they're, let's
say, below 4 years old,

00:05:53.757 --> 00:05:55.464
let's say we're talking about a 3 year old

00:05:55.464 --> 00:05:58.152
so they have this one, but
you're also really worried

00:05:58.152 --> 00:06:00.901
that they have TB so they're in this one.

00:06:00.901 --> 00:06:03.535
If you ever have someone
that falls into 2 categories,

00:06:03.535 --> 00:06:06.553
you have to go with the
more conservative approach,

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:09.501
and say if they meet
the high risk category,

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:12.390
I'm going to use that
one to decide if they're

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.457
positive or negative.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.912
In this case, a 3 year
old who I suspect has TB

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:20.645
automatically I would have
to go with this top one

00:06:20.645 --> 00:06:23.482
because I suspect TB simple as that.

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:26.854
The other question that often
comes up is what about BCG vaccine?

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:29.072
This is a vaccine that
some countries offer

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:32.902
to their citizens to
help prevent disseminated

00:06:32.902 --> 00:06:37.173
or spreadout TB especially a
problem among young babies.

00:06:37.173 --> 00:06:39.738
What if someone has had BCG vaccine?

00:06:39.738 --> 00:06:41.995
It's very clear. The
Centers for Disease Control

00:06:41.995 --> 00:06:43.572
has been very clear on this point.

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:47.739
They say, "You do not
need to interpret the PPD

00:06:47.739 --> 00:06:51.939
"with this in mind. Ignore
the BCG vaccine completely."

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:54.258
In other words, when
you're trying to figure out

00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:57.066
whether someone's PPD
is positive or negative,

00:06:57.066 --> 00:06:59.323
just rely on the high,
medium, and low risk

00:06:59.323 --> 00:07:00.829
criteria that we've talked about.

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.167
Do not worry about the BCG vaccine.

00:07:03.167 --> 23:59:59.999
That should not affect your decision.
