00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.900
Hi I'm Julie with Beadaholique.com and I want to show you have to apply resin into

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.630
some unusual objects. So if you've familiar with working with resin and watching our

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.510
videos you've probably seen bus fill
things like bezel pendants and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.910
bezel earrings and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.929
the common thread is usually just a bezel and you'll see that

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.090
a bezel here has these nice sides around it and a flat interior surface

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.500
this is a bezel button and so you might be wondering

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.160
how do I fill a bezel button because as you know if you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.630
work with resin you need to have a flat

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.160
parallel to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.860
the table and needs to be on an even keel

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.640
and a button is going to tilt, your resin is going to spill out

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.770
and same thing with these little discs
here. I've had people say how

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.500
do you

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.350
apply resin to an object that doesn't have
a bezel ring, how do you do it if it's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.980
just flat and there's just a straight edge

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.580
I'm going to show you how to apply resin
to both of these objects which I've

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.259
gotten some requests for

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.010
so let's begin

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.260
the first thing you're going to need is a box. I have a Beadaholique.com shipping box

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.280
but any box will work

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.250
go ahead

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.380
tape it up

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770
and then don't put it this way

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.960
because

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.860
it's uneven. You wanted to go ahead and
be on its side

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.700
that's a nice fairly solid

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
it tilt's a little bit but it's a fairly solid surface

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.250
then if you're going to do a button

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.979
you're going to take an object such as this pen

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190
punch the surface of the box

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.050
you've created a little cavity

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.780
that you can put

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840
your button into and suddenly

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.990
you have a nice

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.820
flat surface to pour the resin into

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.030
now for these objects that have no bezel here's a great tip from the Beadaholique.com

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.840
customer service department, actually this is Jason's tip

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.930
and what he says to do is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.280
push the push pin

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.570
into the cardboard box

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.809
apply a little bit of Crafter's Pick glued to the top of it

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:12.580
then

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.590
rest your object on top and the reason you want to elevate it is because we're

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.189
going to be relying on surface tension

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.759
to keep the resin in place and keep it from spilling over the edge

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:23.850
you can

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.400
do this with it flat on the surface like
that but I find it just works a little

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.449
bit better

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.879
when it's raised up so I prefer to do it
that way

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.789
now all of my images have been prepped. I want to briefly tell you what I

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.139
did to prep the images. You can watch

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.849
one of the other videos on beadaholique.com which fully goes over prepping images

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.889
for use with resin, how to use resin
and how to use other types of resin

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.150
but for the purpose of this video I'm going to tell
you. So what I did

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.549
with a object like this was I just applied

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.449
Crafter's Pick

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.249
on top of the surface

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.889
flipped it over

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.989
set it down on some collage paper and let
it dry

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.469
I then trimmed the collage paper

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.859
so that's right up against the edge of my stamping blank

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.489
put a little a dab of glue on top of this push pin

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.219
and set

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.900
it down like so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.139
and then once that was done I went ahead
and I coated my

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.199
paper and I did that with my buttons and with this little flat stamping

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.439
blanks as well and I used three coats of
Nunn Design sealant and made sure I

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.180
coated

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.680
the edges as well. It's really important that you use three coats

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.439
let me show you how to do this techniques. I mixed up a batch

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.919
of Ice Resin

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.449
equal parts

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.849
and you'll see that I'm not going to use
all of this resin in this particular

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.659
video so we do have another project

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.479
in the background to use the leftover resin for

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:55.069
gonna pick up some resin on my popsicle
stick which was my stir stick

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.329
and I'm just going to carefully

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.809
drip it in little by little

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.079
into the center

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:10.079
of the button. You'll see it spreads out to
the edges

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.219
you won't be able to see this time. I'm actually going to ahead and hunker down and

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:23.150
look at it

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.680
from this way so I'm eye level with them

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.909
to see if i need to add more

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.150
so that looks pretty even to me. I do want
to create an

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.690
ever so slight dome so add a little bit more

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.690
go to the next one and do the same

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:50.729
if you see that it is sliding too much to one side

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.899
rotate it a little bit

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:54.800
without touching the resin

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.949
to make sure that it is completely level

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.490
it can take a little finessing but you'll get it

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.620
add

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.129
a little bit more

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:15.349
one tip if you have bezel shapes like these. These are Nunn Design buttons

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.620
and you see they're not really the size of traditional of a hole punch or anything

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.969
if you put these down

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:22.979
these down on a copier

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.229
like this

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.599
bezel side down, make a copy

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.149
you can then go ahead and cut out the
imprint that it makes and that you can

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:35.569
use as a template for cutting out your
shapes

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.300
now when you have an object that does not have an bezel edge

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.500
again pick up

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.800
your resin on your popsicle stick

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.249
you are going to go

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.430
very slowly dripping resin into the center of the object

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.740
spill out to the edges

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.430
to not rush this process because again
you're relying on surface tension here

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.110
to hold to resin in place. If you apply too much resin too quickly

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.219
it's going to spill over

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:12.620
once these are fully cured you can just pop

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:19.620
the thumb tact off the back because they just it's just Crafter's Pick glue that was holding it in place

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.439
If you're ever unsure if you need to add anymore to this one just pause for a moment

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.649
see how it spills out take that view of that eye

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.649
level

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:55.409
I'm actually quite happy with that so I'm going to stop and then you

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:59.340
go ahead and use all this left over resin on another project because you

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.380
cannot save mixed resin

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.560
so if you want a more detail explanation of how to mix resin, how to

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.710
use resin

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.200
how to prepare your images definitely check out Beadaholique.com and all of

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.280
our videos in our mixed media section on
that topic

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.989
but I hope this video helped answer some
your questions on how you might fill

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:19.399
something like a button that doesn't
have a flat back or something that

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.830
doesn't actually have a bezel edge that's
just

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.519
a flat straight drop edge

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:26.419
so I hope you enjoy this video and that it answered some of your questions. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
