00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.720
[Music]

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.900
As winter approaches, most gardens stop
producing fresh produce for harvest,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.280
but it's still too early to sow new crops.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.740
That's why it's the perfect time to try your hand at growing greens indoors.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.600
By using the methods outlined in this
video, you'll be able to grow enough for

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.080
tasty additions to soups, sandwiches and salads throughout the winter.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.280
Most of us will have tried our hand at sprouting seeds,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.080
even if it was in school growing cress in 
eggshells.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.640
It's very easy to do, and you can try this with many other sprouting seeds.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.660
Choose seeds which are organic,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.000
or labeled as suitable for consumption
or sprouting. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.200
This ensures that the seeds aren't coated with chemicals which assist in germination when planted outside,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740
but which you don't want to directly consume.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.140
Almost any vegetable or herb seed can be sprouted and eaten when young, 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.980
but some are more tasty than others.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.360
As well as the familiar cress and mustards, try alfalfa,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.700
sunflower, fenugreek and radish,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.320
along with legumes such as the mung bean,
which is a common Chinese bean sprout,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.600
adzuki beans and peas. 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.400
There are two different methods
you can try.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.040
The jar method is the cheapest and easiest to get you started.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.420
Thoroughly clean a glass jar, like an old
jam jar - you don't even need one with a lid.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.680
Add a tablespoon or two of seeds to the jar.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.500
If you like, these can be mixed, such as
cress and mustard for a fiery combination.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.620
The seeds will expand up to 30 times their
size, so don't add too many.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.460
Fill the jar with water and cover with a piece of muslin or cheesecloth

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.700
held securely in place with a rubber band or string.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.060
Leave for about 24 hours.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.620
The moisture triggers the germination process just as it does when you plant seeds in the ground.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.480
Drain off the water to prevent the seeds
from rotting.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.280
This is easily done by holding the cloth
in place and simply pouring the water away.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.680
Give the jar shake to dislodge any seeds
which have become stuck to the cloth.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.720
Put the jar in a warm place to start
germination.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.660
If you're growing Chinese bean sprouts
from mung beans

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.000
then it's better to sprout them in a dark place, as allowing green leaves to form makes them bitter.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.920
Other seeds can be sprouted in a light
place.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.300
Rinse the seeds twice a day, once in the morning and again in the evening .

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.020
Keep the cloth in place and fill the jar with water, sloshing it around 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.800
to make sure all the seeds are washed.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.120
Then just pour it out as you did before,
and tap to dislodge the seeds.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.400
This washing keeps the seeds moist and
stops them from going mouldy.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.860
Usually after just a few days they will
start to sprout, 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.300
and will continue growing for the next few weeks.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.900
Keep on washing them twice a day, and
harvest them when there at a size that you like.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.080
Experiment with different varieties and
sizes to see which taste you prefer.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.820
They'll stay fresh in the fridge for a
couple of days too - 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.280
useful if you want to stop them growing
further,  but can't use them all at once.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.340
This method requires an inexpensive
sprouting kit

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.780
which allows several types of seeds
to sprout at the same time.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.740
The principles are the same as for the
jar method.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.400
After soaking your seed for 24 hours,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.320
just add each seed type to a different layer of the kit.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.820
Washing the seeds each day is easy - just
rinse under running water

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.169
and let the excess drain out at the bottom.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.529
Store it as you would for the jar method and let nature do the rest.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.359
Micro greens
are the young seedlings of familiar

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.640
mustards, cabbages, radishes, beets,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.000
and herbs such as basil, fennel and
coriander (or cilantro).

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.160
They're harvested shortly after they
sprout, when their first true pair of leaves are formed.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.560
The first 'true' pair leaves are different to the first pair of leaves, also known as the seed leaves.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.360
It's the
true leaves which will be packed with

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.560
all the taste of the actual plant you are growing,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.200
and in its 'micro' form it will pack a
powerful tasty punch.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.540
Take a seed tray or an old clean food
container

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.480
to fill it with an inch or two of
sterile potting soil. 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.960
Avoid used compost or soil from your garden

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.551
as this can easily bring small, soil-borne
flies into your home.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.660
Water the soil well, or stand it in a
tray of water for a while before draining it

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.460
so the soil is thoroughly moistened.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.620
Sprinkle your preferred seeds (or a mix) on the surface is the soil -

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.000
aim for the same spacing as for seeds on a
burger bun.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.040
This is much denser than if you were
growing plants to full size from seed,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.140
but as you are only growing them for a short
time it won't affect the plants.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.560
For small seeds, that's it!

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.920
Just put them on a warm, sunny windowsill.
Keep the soil moist but not wet.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.699
If you're using larger seeds such as
beets, sprinkle a shallow layer of soil over the top

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.039
and place on the same warm, sunny windowsill.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.979
Germination rates will vary depending on
the seed you're using and the temperature.

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.439
If you don't have a sufficiently warm
windowsill

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.200
(preferably in the mid-60s Fahrenheit, or above 18 degrees Celsius)

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.819
then start the seeds off somewhere warmer
and transfer them to a sunny windowsill

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.559
as soon as they germinate.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.560
My favorite winter greens are pea shoots.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.380
The taste is unmistakably of delicate fresh peas,

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.919
which are so much better than the
expensive ones that you buy in the supermarkets

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.199
which are often washed in chemicals and last
only days before they wilt.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.240
You can use almost any type of peas,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.520
even the dried ones sold in supermarkets, which are often very cheap.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.280
As with the method for microgreens, fill a
container with an inch or two of sterile potting soil

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.509
water it, or stand it in a tray of water to
thoroughly moisten it

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.669
before allowing it to drain.

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.549
Sprinkle the
peas thickly across the surface -

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.970
aim to leave about to pea's width with between each pea.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.479
Cover with soil until the peas just
disappear, and water them in.

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.739
Place in a sunny, warm place and keep the
soil moist.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.600
In a couple of weeks your pea shoots will be
3-4 inches tall.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.930
Harvest them by snipping them with
scissors just above the bottom set of leaves.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.180
Some of the pea shoots will regrow, giving
you a second harvest.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.160
Growing winter greens indoors is quick and easy, and they're packed full of vitamins and minerals.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.411
It's a great way to get a tasty harvest
when there's little else available from your garden.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:17.560
