00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.900
Naturex is the world's largest supplier
of rosemary extracts and the Naturex

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.480
rosemary harvesting program is the
global sustainability model for rosemary

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.980
it all starts here, in Morocco's Atlas
Mountains, where millions of tons of wild

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.190
rosemary grow naturally. No pesticides
and no toxic agricultural chemicals have

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.870
ever been applied to this soil, so
there's no damage to the soil, to the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.750
water or to farm workers. All of the
rosemary is harvested by hand and the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.820
rosemary regenerates after the harvest,
so there's no chance of endangering the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.940
wild supply. No mechanization, no diesel
fumes, no truck tracks in the mountains.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.539
The Berber people who do the harvesting
here depend on this for their livelihood.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.770
They're experts in this, they've been
doing this for generations, they know how

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.720
to harvest the rosemary sustainably to
ensure that it grows back strong and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.929
healthy.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.920
The low-tech, high efficiency method of
drying of this rosemary is accomplished

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.920
by the sun. After the rosemary is hand
harvested it's put into piles and it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.680
sits in the sun for three days. And that
drying is just sufficient enough to get

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.660
it ready for extraction. Again this is a
traditional method and it may be

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.220
low-tech but it produces some of the
highest rosemary in the entire world.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.380
The Naturex extraction plant in
Casablanca, Morocco is a high capacity

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.470
facility processing thousands of tons of
botanicals every year. Some workers here

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.890
are unloading a large truck of rosemary
from the Atlas Mountains. On a regular

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.590
basis large truck loads of botanicals
come in from all over Morocco. This is a

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.450
strategically placed facility,
specifically put here to process

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.470
Moroccan plants which are essential to
the business of Naturex.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.170
This botanical extraction facility in
Casablanca is important to Naturex

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.360
because of its strategic location to all
of the Moroccan botanicals of the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.100
company processes, but it's also
important to Naturex for another reason:

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.170
this is the very first botanical
extraction facility that the company set

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.720
up and operated today Naturex runs
botanical extraction all over the world,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.870
but it all started right here in the
spray drying equipment behind me fluid

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.560
botanical extracts are transformed into
powders for use in the food, beverage,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.540
cosmetic and nutraceutical industries.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.220
Every plant contains hundreds of
naturally occurring compounds. Here, in

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.349
this analytical laboratory the
scientists at Naturex investigate those

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.930
compounds and their concentrations. This is all part of producing the finest

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.700
botanical extracts in the world.
