00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.640
Hey Vlad!

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.167
Wait, wait! How are you doing?
Need help?

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:30.527
- What can you carry with your tiny soft arms?
- Come on! please!

00:00:30.527 --> 00:00:31.760
Stop! There is a lot of work...

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.080
...so leave me alone and go back to your broom, kid!

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.238
I'm fed up with the broom!

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.452
- I can't do anything here!
- Noisy cart coming!

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:40.440
Oh no, no! not again!

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.140
Stop that Stan!

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.867
It's not fair to make fun about Gom!

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.547
It's already hard for him, poor guy!

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.227
Thank you, Zephyra.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.167
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.025
Welcome to...

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.784
...the ACME circus!

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.240
Without further ado...

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.960
...an incredible and mind-blowing performance...

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.412
...starring the amazing...

00:01:16.412 --> 00:01:17.400
...Davy!

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.060
Hey! What's up?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.300
They are amazing!

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.116
I told you it was mind-blowing!

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.900
Ladies and gentlemen!
after a short break, the show will go on!

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.144
We're screwed!

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.058
- We'll have to pay back, we are broke!
- No worries, there is certainly a solution!

00:01:56.058 --> 00:01:59.207
You're dreaming, honey!
Without an assistant, it's impossible!

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.360
- Anyway, we're dead!
- I'm here, I can do it!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.264
Yes, of course...
Go back and play, we're busy.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.820
Anyway, it can't get worse...

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.300
...he could succeed.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.220
Am I dreaming?

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.422
You're totally nuts!
I knew it was a circus...

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.825
...but this is getting really crazy!

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.018
At the slightest noise of drum he'll turn soft. You're totally insane, you... 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.740
What?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.500
You don't feel concerned?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.020
Easy! I can't hear anything with my helmet!

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.507
With that he won't turn soft !

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.857
We'll make him signs and it will work!

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.540
Come on Gom.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.340
You can do it.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.370
Come on Gom.
You can do it.
