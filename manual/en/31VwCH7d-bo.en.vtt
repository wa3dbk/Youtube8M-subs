00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.120
The relationship between technology
and organizations...You want to do MIS because

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.030
you are creative, you are innovative, you
are a problem solver. The thing about MIS

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.779
that I love is that the curriculum is half
business and half IT. Almost everything today

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.720
in business is being driven by IT systems,
MIS students are in demand, there are more

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.920
jobs out there than there are graduates. The
main reason I ended up doing MIS was because

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.140
I am a tech person, but I also saw project
management as something that I wanted to do.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.210
MIS did not allow me to pigeon-hole myself
in one area, I was able to combine both of

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.270
those and that's MIS in a nutshell. Organizations
depend on technology...MANAGEMENT INFORMATION

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.260
SYSTEMS, OR MIS, IS A MAJOR THAT COMBINES
BOTH COMPUTER CLASSES AND BUSINESS COURSES

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.129
SO THAT GRADUATES IN THE FOGELMAN COLLEGE
OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS ARE PREPARED FOR

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.879
NUMEROUS INTERESTING AND REWARDING CAREERS.
Including being a programmer, being a systems

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.460
analyst, network administrators, working as
a database administrator, support and help

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.140
desk personnel, working in strategic problems
of how to apply information systems to business

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.390
problems, and these jobs not only are they
prevalent, but they also pay quite well. There

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.200
is a lot of variety. We do not see the same
thing every day. There is different problems

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.770
that come up every different day. So it is
always a different challenge. LOCATED IN A

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.390
THRIVING METROPOLITAN AREA, THE UNIVERSITY
OF MEMPHIS' FOGELMAN COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.900
ECONOMICS IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR STUDENTS
LOOKING TO GET INTO THE MIS FIELD. The U of

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.490
M is the best place to do MIS because we are
in the middle of some of the most active IT

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.570
companies on the planet. We have Federal Express,
we have International Paper, we have AutoZone,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.810
we have Hilton Hotels, we have all the hospitals
in town. They all have made their mark by

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.610
the way they use information technology. The
MIS department has really impressed me both

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.610
on being cutting edge in terms of research
and development and being very aware and interested

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.209
in the needs of technology in the world and
how that fits into the business landscape.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.260
Our MIS curriculum is structured so that the
students get a full range of computer oriented

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.090
courses, plus they get the full range of business
courses because we are in a business school.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.950
So they also get courses in accounting, marketing,
management, economics, finance and so on,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.950
and that combination is very powerful. I designed
microprocessors and...TEACHING THAT MIS CURRICULUM

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:45.280
AT THE U OF M IS A FACULTY THAT COMPARES TO
ANY BUSINESS SCHOOL. They provide a great

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.260
knowledge base, they seem very interactive
with the students, they provide the hands-on

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.849
environment, especially in MIS courses, your
tech courses here within the department, and

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.730
they just make you feel like you are the only
student in their class. If we do this right

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.939
with technology...A lot of them have actually
worked in the real world, so they know the

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.159
different situations that would come up. So
they can take the concepts that we learn in

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:13.170
the book and apply them to real life situations.
When they teach their MIS subjects, they are

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.909
talking not just about academics, but they
are talking about their business experience,

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.299
and that makes a huge difference to the students.
We get involved with\'85THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.349
MIS ALSO WORKS WITH LOCAL LEADERS IN THE INDUSTRY,
MANY OF WHOM FORM AN ADVISORY BOARD FOR THE

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.099
DEPARTMENT, WHICH ENDS UP BEING A TREMENDOUS
ADVANTAGE FOR THE STUDENTS. It keeps me connected

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:39.099
to other IT professionals and the research,
and kind of the vibrancy coming out of the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.719
university of memphis MIS department. In effect,
the business community becomes a living, learning

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:51.900
laboratory for the students. We have lots
of opportunities to get students in contact

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.019
with the businesses that ultimately they will
be working for and having careers with. That

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.909
is what information systems do for an organization\'85STUDENTS
IN THE FOGELMAN COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.060
ALSO TAKE PART IN THE INNOVATIVE "FOGELMAN
PROMISE" INITIATIVE, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.980
TEACH STUDENTS THE PERSONAL SKILLS NEEDED
TO SUCCEED, AND THRIVE, IN THE BUSINESS WORLD.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.560
The dean has developed a number of programs,
the 4 C's initiatives, where we think about

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.829
creativity, critical thinking and things like
that, etiquette and toast masters and things

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.829
that help communications. The holistic approach
to education involves both academics, in terms

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:35.380
of computer subjects and business subjects,
plus other attributes that people need in

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.470
today's business world. It's important to
be able to have good communication skills,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.630
both oral skills and written skills, and we
develop that in our students. GREGORY SAYS

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.960
THAT HIS MIS DEGREE WILL HELP HIM ADVANCE
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER AT INTERNATIONAL PAPER.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.480
If you are in college looking for a good degree
that's very broad in the different directions

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.370
that you can take, I would suggest MIS as
a degree because you can go more technical

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.620
or you can go more of a business side of things.
I can talk with the tech people, but I can

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.720
also have the soft skills that are taught
here at the University of Memphis through

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.310
MIS for project management, so you again,
have the best of both worlds. It really is

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.340
a great field to get into and people were
impressed with that degree. How many of you

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.100
have worked for an organization\'85FOR MORE
