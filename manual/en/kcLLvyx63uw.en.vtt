Com2US have made a mark on the App Store thanks
to their relatively solid releases and in

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.180
particular their deft hand at producing decent
action KRPG titles. Caligo Chaser was an interesting

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.970
take on the side-scrolling beat'em-up and
Queen's Crown returned to the top-down roots

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.090
while introducing a new weapon-swapping mechanic,
however their latest release, Third Blade,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.070
adds a third kind of heat by mixing side-scrolling
with the weapon-swap system for a far more

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.880
immediate action experience.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.020
The result is a game that feels far less in-depth
than its predecessors, however this is a boon

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.110
for those who enjoy the action and not the
RPG. Basic kidnapped girlfriend plot aside,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.250
you'll travel around the world beating up
the same handful of monsters over and over

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.250
using one of three weapons. Your twin blades
may not pack a huge punch, but they're the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.940
best way to increase your combo score which
(in turn) increases the damage you do significantly.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.300
Players can then switch to a sword and board
setup, dishing out damage while healing and

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.460
ignoring incoming attacks in turn; and lastly
a two-handed weapon provides the most brutal

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.900
amount of impact, clearing the screen once
you're maxed out on your combo.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.260
While this does sound like there's potential
for a lot of variety, things quickly hit their

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.170
stride early on as you spend levels - 1) Maxing
your combo; 2) Healing as needed; and 3) Switching

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.410
to two-handed to end things quickly. Cash
is earned based on your performance and can

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.720
be spent on upgrading weapons, armor, potions
and purchasing other bonuses such as runes

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.550
which are used to purchase and upgrade skills
for each weapon. Without purchasing cash from

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.440
the in-game store you can expect a bit of
grinding to push through later levels as enemy

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.340
health and damage ramps up to provide an artificial
barrier.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.700
With that said, no one said you couldn't kill
monsters in style and the visuals are very

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.440
appealing even despite the repetitive use
of a handful of creatures. Due to the skill

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.830
system you'll be treated to special effects
more often than not and 'boss' creatures can

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.600
provide a serious challenge later on as you
learn to deal with their unique spells.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.000
Third Blade attempts to appeal to those who
enjoy mindless combat without the burden of

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.080
a complex story or pointless questing. It's
not perfect and it can get monotonous if you're

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.229
not a fan of the genre, but it's still amusing
at least for a little while.
