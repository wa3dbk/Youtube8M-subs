00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
[gun firing]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is the Army Today.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
With liberty and justice to brawl.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's a place where violence is okay, the girls get dirty in the roller rink and love it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm Sergeant Ashleigh Torres.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's just the right kind of atmosphere that promotes empowerment and promotes leadership skills--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
--so I think it would be perfect--a perfect relationship.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[shouting]  Get her!  Get her!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Working out, being able to go really fast on the track--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
--and actually hitting people and not having to apologize for that.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Everybody here is very aggressive--some more so than others.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Just the athleticism and the fact that you can wear anything you want and nobody judges you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There's all sorts of sizes here and there's no judgments.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Everybody has their own certain level of skill, and everybody helps everybody else--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
--so it's like this big huge sisterhood that I've never, ever experienced anywhere else.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I will play this sport for the rest of my life, until my body says, "Now."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The nice part about derby is it is one of the fastest growing sports in America.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's just a love of a sport, and it gives me that adrenaline high, that endorphin high--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
--and any sport that challenges me has got to be awesome.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And this is, like I said, one of the most challenging sports I've ever played.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And it's funny because people are like, "Oh, man!  Is it like the 1970s?  Am I going to see that?"

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And it's like, "No, not quite, but you're going to see a sport--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
--and you're going to see people getting knocked down and shoved and pushed and hip checked and that's what it is."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Derby can almost be a little self-serving.  I love what it does for me.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But these are all my friends.  This is my second family, which is just like the Army.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[♪techno music playing♪]

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
That's the Army Today.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
