Hey guys, I'm going to be showing you how you can download MC Patcher for Minecraft.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:16.860
To start of with go to the MC Patcher page on minecraft forums. And it should be linked in the description somewhere.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.720
So scroll down and press download for Windows, if you're on Windows.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.940
So press "Download" and then press "Skip Ad" in 5 seconds.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:42.440
And then, save the file. And go to your download area.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.740
So now, open up MC Patcher.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.620
Then, whatever unmodded versions of minecraft you have already. They will appear here.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:07.260
So if you run "Minecraft 1.7.10", just normal "Minecraft 1.7.10". Then it should appear on the game version.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.320
So, if you wanted to change it to 1.7.10, then it would be here.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.060
So, I have 1.8.4 which is unmodded so I'm going to choose that.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.980
Now over here there should be all the mods which you have selected to add to minecraft.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:43.280
And if you go to "mods" here. And you can press "add" and select a mod for it.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.400
So I'm going to press "Patch".

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.880
Now that it has finished patching, if I run minecraft.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:08.900
You should see here it says "MCPatcher" and if I press edit profile on MCPatcher, you can see that the version is "release 1.8.4-mcpatcher".

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.540
Press "Play".

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:32.840
So now that minecraft is open in MC Patcher, I can go into a world. I have a resource pack enabled which is Dokucraft and MC Patcher allows Dokucraft custom skies.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.160
And Random Mobs and stuff because it was on the mods option thing here.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.420
And if I look at the sky, you can see that this is a custom sky.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.580
Those aren't the normal minecraft clouds, normal minecraft sky texture or the normal minecraft sun.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.420
So that is proof of MC Patcher being installed.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.000
