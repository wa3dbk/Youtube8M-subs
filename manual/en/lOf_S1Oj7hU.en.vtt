00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:11.386
When we advance in video 
productions, the need to use

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.764
accessories with our camera 
increases.

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:16.016
That's why today we'll take a 
look at two tools from

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.250
ALZO Video... the Multi-Mount 
and the SHOCK Multi-Mount!

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:26.944
The Multi-Mount it's a hot shoe 
adapter that multiplies

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:30.822
the camera's mounting options.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:34.159
It has a solid hexagonal cage 
design...

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:41.250
made completely from aluminum 
and weighting only 155g.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:46.797
It has four universal shoe 
mounts...

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:53.000
so it can accept any type of 
video or photo accessories.

00:00:55.931 --> 00:01:04.250
It includes five 1/4"-20 holes 
that offer even more options.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:13.782
Its interior measures 9.5cm by 
6.3cm.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:17.619
It attaches to the camera via a 
metal shoe

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.540
that also has a threaded 1/4"-20
hole...

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.087
allowing to screw it to a light 
stand or tripod if necessary.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.633
We can mount it pointing at any 
direction

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:36.750
depending on the balance 
desired.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:53.155
The SHOCK Multi-Mount shares 
most of its design...

00:01:53.155 --> 00:02:02.039
but adds a smaller cage with 
four extras shoe mounts.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.251
These two pieces allow to use it
as a shock mount for

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:13.250
any microphone thanks to its 
large interior dimensions.

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:21.516
And it is the only shock mount 
specifically design

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:28.000
to be used with the popular Zoom
H4n audio recorder.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:44.164
This version can be adjusted 
easily to obtain

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:49.000
the best balance possible above 
our camera.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:55.175
Both models can be used to mount
and combine

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:59.388
accessories on top of any 
camera...

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:04.184
or even on top of a light stand.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:08.355
We can also use audio recorders 
like the Zoom H4n

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:13.250
on a boompole thanks to the 
SHOCK Multi-Mount.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:17.614
We find these products from ALZO
Video to be a good solution

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.617
for adding various accessories 
to your camera.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.370
Their prices are very 
accessible, they are of good 
quality

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.250
and they perform perfectly.
