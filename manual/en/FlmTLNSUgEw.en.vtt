What's up? Matt Guf here, House Snowboard
Shop, this is the Capita Horroscope, bo ya

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.250
kasha, "Flat Kick" board. "Flat kick", you
guys will know what that term means by the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.220
end of the season from watching some of these
videos and for riding. You will get to know

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.109
flat kick for riding. These Capita boards
flat in between the bindings, rocks up a little

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.079
bit before the nose and the tale then there
is an extra little lift or what Capita calls

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.840
"Flat Kick". Again, so it's flat, up a little
bit and then up a little bit more. Great for

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.090
that jibber at heart and let me tell you what,
this horoscope "Flat Kick" board is for that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.370
urban warfare Jib terrorist out there. If
you like hitting the streets hitting the rails,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.190
hitting the ledges, doing bomb drops, this
is going to be the indestructible board that

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.240
you can thrash all season long. True twin
of cores, seven stains of cores, and it has

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:09.250
a wood derived technology of core, which means
that inside of here is pressure bonded wood

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.610
composite core. So, it is not normal tip to
tale wood core, its pressure bonded wood composite.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.750
It makes for a nice flex. On the glass it
is called pre cured 420 glass. Which means

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.420
that on both the top and the bottom of the
sandwich core there is 370 grams of fiber

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.700
glass that runs tip to tale, and there is
50 grams of glass that runs from edge to edge.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.100
The base is an extruded base. You won't have
to maintain this thing very often because

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.030
you're probably going to be running parking
lots and sand lots. What other lots are there,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.920
car park lots? Anyway, flex is a 3 this thing
is soft you could butter a sandwich with it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.390
if you wanted to, yep super soft! And, Transworld
has rated this thing Good Wood in 2010. Horrorscope,

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.820
