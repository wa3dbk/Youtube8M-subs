00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
hello I`m Li Yuxiao
I`m a model in Japan now

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I`ll introduce the cosmetics in my pouch today

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you must check it out

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
these are the contents in my pouch

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I`m going to start now

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
first of all, this is my fundation which is very pretty

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
this is the fundation of ZA, Shiseido 
I often use this color

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because my skin color is a bit dark
the one I use is number 103

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
it is good to use

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
next is also from Shiseido
the name is IPSA

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
IPSA fundation is for partial use which is creamy type

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
there are 3 different kinds
and I love to use it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
if you have black eye, just put on some here with white color

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so black eye will turn to be white

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:36.000
if you have pimple, use this dark one to put it on
then you will turn to be pretty

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I love to use it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
about my eyebrow I use this one, Heavy Rotation

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:08.000
with this eyebrow powder I don`t use pencil but this brush
which can draw the eyebrow naturally

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
see my eyebrow
doesn`t it look natural?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
next is eyeshadow
it is from Kate, Kanebo 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:38.000
when taking photos I use pink or blue or several kind of colors
but usually I use this one

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I feel this one is very naturl
because I like natural color, I use this one

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I especially like the bright one
when I put on my face it makes me look very shiny

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
next I want to introduce this eyeliner

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it looks like only one in it
but actually it has 3 inside

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the first one is liquid type
you can draw like this

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
second is a pencil which is not liquid type

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000
third is like eyeshadow which can make it look natural

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I like to use it a lot

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
next is Majolica Majorca from Shiseido

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:04.000
this one is mascara
I like this brush because it can make the eyelashes longer and seperately
so I do like it a lot

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the color of mine is BK999
I usually use black color only not brown one

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
next one is Chanel the one I love the most
it is a lip cream

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I feel this cream can give lips moisture
when I use it I feel myself is so cute which makes me a good feeling 
so I always use it

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:56.000
when eating oustside I often put it in my bag or pocket so I often use it

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:12.000
next is the blusher which is also from Majolica Majorca, Shiseido
the brand is the same as this one I just introduced

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the color number is PK301

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
this color is pink with a little bit orange 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I feel this color is very cute that can make you look feminine, cute and pretty

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I usually use brush to put it on because it can spread more naturally

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
next one is lipstick which is also from ZA, Shiseido

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
it is the same brand as my fundation that I just introduced

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the color number is OR2

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
see I used too much so only a little left
I need to buy a new one 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
this color also makes me look feminine

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
put it on like this which is a good color
I like it a lot

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
sometimes you feel the color is not enough 
you can put on this one which can make the lips shiny

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
just like this

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
compare to the lipstick this one is more pinky

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:15.000
see this two color
this one is like orange-yellow color, but this one is pink

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
use them together that I think they match each other which is very good

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I love to use this two

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:50.000
next is this hair spray
I use it when I do curly hair
since my hair is straight, if I don`t use it I hardly can make curly hair

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that`s it
the contents inside my pouch are like this
