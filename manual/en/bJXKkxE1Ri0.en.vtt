00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
(Chewing) Mmm. Oh yeah, that's very good. It's a very good sandwich

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.860
SHUT UP

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.960
Ian: What are you doing?

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.700
Anthony: Eating a taquito. It's the best food in the world.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.360
Ian: Taquito? More like CRAPitos.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.900
Anthony: What's your favorite food?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.680
(A tray full of donuts suddenly appears in Ian's hands)

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.540
Ian: Duh idiot, there right here in my hand. Pink frosted sprinkled donut.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.580
Anthony: Yeah, well&nbsp;I bet my taquito can do more everyday tasks in this catalogue than your stupid pink frosted pieces of crap!

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.160
 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.760
You're on!

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.280
Anthony: How about this plunger?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.980
(Anthony plunges the taquitto in the toilet but it falls down and fails)

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.460
Anthony: Dang it.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.600
Ian: Don't let me down, donut.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.380
(Ian does the same thing, but doesn't work )

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.880
Ian: Mine didn't work either.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.640
But..

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.180
..it still tastes pretty good.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.000
Ian: What about, uh, socks?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.280
Anthony: Stupid Ian. Time for a taquito sock.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.660
(Anthony tries to put the taquito in his feet but the taquito doesn't fit]

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.860
lan: Anthony doesn't know it, but donuts are made to be socks. He is going dowwwn.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.420
(Ian puts his donuts in his toes)

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.800
Now it's time to stroll down the city.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.280
(Ian walks with his donuts, while walking, a donut falls off his toes)

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.060
Anthony: Telescope. Let's do a telescope.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.260
OK!

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.260
Alright, time to teach Anthony a lesson.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.020
(the doughnut covers Ian's eyes)

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.820
I don't see anything.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.880
The hell is going on

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.500
Can't see anything.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.620
All I can see is...

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.480
(sees Ian humping a fire hydrant)

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.240
Ian.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880
Ian, what are you doing?

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.560
How about an airbag?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.940
(Anthony creepily laughs)

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.800
Ok.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.220
Don't let me down donut, please.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.840
(banged his head to the donut)

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.060
It works!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200
I know you're so much better than a donut.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.900
You'll save my life.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.080
(banged his head to the taquito, but got injured)

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.740
AGGGGGGH!

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.660
Anthony: Cigarette!

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.240
I'm gonna smoke you on this compitition.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.360
(they both laugh)

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.100
Like a stick, yeah----It doesn't make sense.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.720
(they stopped laughing)

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.360
I think it's funny.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.880
It's not funny.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.340
Alright let's-let's smoke this bad boy.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.520
(smokes using a taquito)

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.360
I'm totally going to show Anthony up on this food smoking.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.100
He's goin' downtown

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.420
Oh yeah.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.260
That was a close one.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.800
(drops the donut and fails)

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.720
Let's see your crappy piece of crap be a ballpoint pen.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.220
What do you think ink's made out of?

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.040
BEEF!!!

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.660
Alright lets put this beef to use.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.280
(uses the taquitto as a pen)

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.860
I wrote the Bill of Rights!

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.800
Let's see Anthony beat this.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.080
(uses his donut as a pen)

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.840
Yeah.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.360
Okay,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.040
haha,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.720
yes.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.300
No, no no no.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.420
(stomps on the doughnut to release the fire)

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.740
Lipstick.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.860
It worked!

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.240
(uses his doughnut as lipstick, but vomits)

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.840
Oh my god I look so beautiful!

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.860
Prepare to be defeated when my taquito is....a girlfriend or boyfriend!

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.460
Because you've never had one.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.400
Yes I have.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.080
No!

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.580
Yeah!

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:34.740
Anthony and Ian Talking over each other (someone subtitle this for me.)

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.780
I just want to tell you donut.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.780
I love you.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.840
My donut had a hole, and...

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.660
No.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.780
taquitos, you know, not exactly a hole.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.080
I thought you loved your taquittos.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.880
I love my taquittos it's just...

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.780
Anthony decided to forfeit this round, cause he's a pansy.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.740
I'm not a pansy, you're the one! You're the one who's a pansy.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.720
How about.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.920
pool floaties?

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.300
Pool floaties?!

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.160
Yeah, pool floaties.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.280
What'd you think beef's made of; cows and they float all the time.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.320
I-I've never seen a cow float before.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.320
They always go swimming in the lakes.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.460
Maybe in your butt they do.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.960
I'm gonna prove to Ian that beef really does float.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.720
(uses his taquitos as a pool floaty, but fails)

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.880
I can't...

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.740
Anthony, eat my shorts.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.840
These things float so good.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.100
Look how good I'm floating.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.120
Ah man. Anthony's totally gonna lose.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.380
Hear that Anthony?

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.380
You're gonna lose

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.660
Ian: Hey Anthony, are you drowning?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.760
Because if you do, you know it's an automatic forfeit.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.000
Anthony?

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.780
(Anthony drowned)

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.700
Ian Ian

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.440
You've just won Food Battle 2006, what are you going to do now?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.160
I'm gonna to Disneyland!

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.420
Oh boy Disneyland! Can I come?

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.280
Ian: NO!
