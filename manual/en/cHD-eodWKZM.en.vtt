00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey everybody, welcome back to The Bee Vlog

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.675
I'm in beautiful SE Portland today visiting my friends over at Bee Thinking

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.480
I wanted to take you on a tour of their shop and show you what they've got

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.460
So at Bee Thinking they feature 3 different types of hives with a unique spin

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.880
They use redwood cedar instead of the usual pine

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.800
So you'll see on their Langstroth boxes that they are all cedar made

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:28.495
They also feature these interesting Warre hives

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.795
This is something you don't normally see on my channel

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:34.300
but it's something I'll show you today and show you that's built

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.740
Also the top bar hives

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.840
In their store they also feature a good selection of honey...

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:43.815
candles...

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.160
wax...

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.640
and soaps and other things made from the hive

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.520
They have a huge selection of locally crafted meads

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.351
And every Saturday they do mead tasting here

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340
So this is their top bar hive

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.900
This is the lid. We're actually standing on the back side of the hive right now

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.000
So the bees would be moving in and out of the entrance up in the front here

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.860
But it's really easy to use top bars, that's one of the nice benefits

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.995
There's not a lot of heavy lifting, you'll see on my videos when I'm lifting these Langstroth boxes

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:33.480
I'm doing a lot of heavy lifting of these boxes

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.640
and when a box, a medium sized box in a Langstroth, gets full of honey it can weigh about 60 pounds

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.140
But on a top bar there's really no heavy lifting

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.795
Just take the lid up and then you have a lot of bars here that the comb is built on by the bees

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:48.675
This is what the comb would look like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:50.131
when it's inside the hive

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:54.811
There's a comb guide on the underside that helps them to draw out straight comb

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.300
They just build comb that looks like that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.580
The reason the comb is shaped in this "V" shape is because the box itself has that "V" shape to the cavity

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.240
So these bars basically make up what would be the inside ceiling for the bees

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.180
Each one fits tight together, side-by-side

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.280
And the cavity inside is where the bees live and build the comb

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:21.155
So you might put one follower board at one end

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.257
and then put 8-10 bars for the bees to build comb

00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:34.839
Put another follower board to limit their cavity space, so they're in a smaller area

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.380
As they grow just move the follower board out and put in new bars

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.180
And they continue to build out on these

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.134
When you're inspecting in a top bar hive you actually start at one end

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:53.040
I see a lot of new beekeepers starting out and they grab a bar from the middle and pul it out

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.320
And 90% of the time they'll break that comb off

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.860
So the trick is to move the follower board out of the way

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.240
Then you can take a peek in there and see if that comb is attached to the walls and you can cut it free

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.620
and you can move that bar over and you work from one end to the other lifting the comb out

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.100
For example, this comb might be sitting in like this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.400
So when you pull it out it will be covered with bees and you can take a look at it

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.940
It's a very simple hive design

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.620
and it's favored by those who want to keep things easy, keep things light, and maintenance-free

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.440
Another cool thing about these top bars is they have little windows in the back as an option

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.580
and you can come in here and see the bees and the comb without having to open anything up

00:03:46.035 --> 00:03:50.295
So you don't disturb the bees at all but you can see how things are going

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:52.351
and if they need more space

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.140
This is a Warre hive, it's almost like a Langstroth but it's got a different size

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.660
It's smaller in dimension, and we'll take a look inside

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.580
We've got the outer roof here

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.500
and under the roof is a quilt box

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.060
I copied this concept on my Langstroth hives over the winter where I put a box on top that has a 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.360
canvas bottom with wood chips or filler inside to absorb moisture

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.940
This also has another canvas cover inside that is nice for when you're doing an inspection you can just peal

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.900
this back, you don't have to open the whole thing up, and keep the bees dark on one side

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.500
Unlike a Langstroth box however, this doesn't use frames for the comb, it's more similar to a top bar

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.200
wherein you have just a bar with a wedge comb guide that the bees build the comb on

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.180
And these have to be spaced appropriately so that you have the correct distance between the combs

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.420
and maintain good bee-space

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.700
They can be pinned in place if you want so they don't move, you can put little nails in there

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.978
you'll see that the bars have a little groove on it that you can fit in the nail

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.980
One other thing that you have to be careful of when doing an inspection on these types of hives

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.040
is when you remove the comb they can attach it to the side-walls

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.380
so you have to make sure it's cut free before you pull it out

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.800
This style also a viewing window that you can open up and see what's going on inside just like the top bar

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.080
Unlike a Langstroth box, when you want to add a box to a hive of this style you don't put it on top

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.900
you actually add it to the bottom

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.240
It's called Nadir, or "Nadiring"

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.740
So what you would do is you would remove all the boxes from the bottom

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.800
put your new box on the bottom

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.380
making sure you've got the top bars in place and the correct spacing

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.360
Then put all the bottom...what used to be the bottom boxes, now on top

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.400
in the same order that they were in before, then you can replace the canvas...

00:06:08.714 --> 00:06:09.594
the quilt...

00:06:11.534 --> 00:06:12.574
and the roof

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.140
And that's called a Warre hive

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.380
So later this spring when the bees are flying and the weather is nice I want to take you inside a working

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.040
Warre hive and a top bar hive and show you how the bees actually build comb and how they use the space

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.680
So that's Bee Thinking here in SE Portland
