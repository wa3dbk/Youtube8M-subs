00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.660
My name is Lauren and on behalf of Expert
Village I'm here to talk to you about styles

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.900
on the go. A lot of women, especially with
long hair, tend to have their hair fall flat

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.830
in their face as the day goes on. Most women
simply tuck it behind their ear. I'm going

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.160
to give you a little bit of an alternative
for tucking it behind your ear. What you can

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.240
do is if you brush all of your hair back,
if you want to get some of that hair away

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:33.120
from your face, you have two options, you
can either brush it back, spray it, in order

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.920
for it to stay back so as it falls better
you have that extra hold. I personally am

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.680
not a huge hair spray fan. I do not like a
lot of product in my hair, I feel like it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.541
weighs my hair down. Something that I do if
if you take your regular tail comb, and you

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:53.380
can do little patterns, you can go criss cross
back and forth, they don't have to be perfect,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.149
but what it does is prevents there from being
a distinct part or you literally do is lay

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.720
the comb, tail comb part right by the beginning
of your hair line and just wiggle it back

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.649
and forth, then when you wift, you wift up
and separate. That's going to give you a bit

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:19.710
of a criss cross pattern. I do it on both
sides, wift that section of hair, we'll do

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:37.930
a little bit of spray, just for smoothing,
pull the hair back, twist it, until it goes

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:48.860
down to the scalp, you really want to twist
this whole back section, then you simply push

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:57.469
it forward, grab one of your bobby pins, open
it, and you're going to want to insert it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.159
going in through that twist and down to the
scalp so that way it will hold it with using

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:16.939
minimal pins, straighten it out, grab another
section, same criss crossing pattern, again,

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:35.430
wift, twist, push it up, place your bobby
pin inside that twist, sometimes when the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.340
hair is a little heavy, you'll want to place
two, like this one is lifting, so I'll go

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.659
back in with one more bobby pin, I'll grab
it from the bobby pin, twist it back down

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:53.250
in order to smooth that backside and then
reinsert another pin. You can also do this

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.879
if you do want parts and separations just
by doing a straight part. It's going to be

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.890
more noticeable when you do the straight part;
you're going to see the separation of the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:28.019
twists a little bit more. Back, push up, insert
your bobby pin, going into the twist. Now,

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:36.409
you can see the difference once I turn her
head between the two twists. This is the straight

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.670
part, it's very noticeable, the sectioning
in between it, the top is not so noticeable.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.340
You can't really tell. So, depending on whether
or not you want a little bit of a defined

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.170
twist or whether or not you would like it
to look as if your hair is just falling back

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.060
like that naturally, would depend on the different
part that you want to do. And that is how

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.239
you can keep your hair stylish yet away from
your face and prevent you from tucking it

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.029
behind your hair continuously.
