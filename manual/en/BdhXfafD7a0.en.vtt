Almond milk is a satisfying drink that's delicious
on its own, or when added to coffee or smoothies.

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.320
With only 4 ingredients, this recipe is surpisingly
simple to make at home and is even healthier

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.080
than the one you buy at the store.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.750
Start by placing almonds in a bowl and pouring
in just enough water to cover.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.909
Soak the almonds overnight, or for at least
10 to 12 hours, then drain.

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:44.980
Combine the almonds with water, dates and
vanilla bean seeds or vanilla extract.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:01:02.300
Blend on high speed until it's smooth.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:57.430
Strain the almond milk through a nut bag or
cheesecloth to remove lumps.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.630
Serve right away, or keep refrigerated in
a closed container with as little air as possible

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.360
for up to 3 days.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.050
Be sure to shake well before serving.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.560
We think it tastes best when chilled.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.450
Thanks for watching!
