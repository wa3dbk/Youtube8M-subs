00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.000
We're here in Long Beach, CA at It's A Grind
Coffee House.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.240
Today we're meeting up with Lazara, the business
owner here, and helping her setup a DCS-930L

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.539
Wireless N Network Camera.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.990
That way she can monitor her business while
she's away.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.310
So let's go inside.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.189
So Lazara, tell us a little bit about It's
A Grind.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:31.400
Well It's A Grind is here on Pine Ave in downtown
Long Beach.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.570
Actually, It's A Grind was founded here in
Long Beach. So we're very happy to be able

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.090
to find our store here in Long Beach.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.160
We serve a variety of customers, local residents,
people that work close by to us, some tourists

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.420
so its a nice mixture of folks.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.870
So you get some dedicated customers as well
as newbies.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.780
Yup and I love it. Because its not only residents,
its not only one type or the other, its a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.220
nice variety and I love that about this store.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.920
I'm sure they love your coffee here too.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.510
Yes they do, they love It's A Grind Coffee.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.400
And you also have baked goods, I love your
bagels.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.920
Thank you, yes they are popular.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.750
Yeah, they are delicious.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.550
Well we're here to setup a DCS-930L by D-Link.
It's a wireless N Network Camera and its a

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.650
perfect compliment to the surveillance system
you already have.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.650
Oh wow!

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.630
Its an extra set of eyes for you if you're
away from the store or even if you want to

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.630
take a vacation.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.500
Vacation? Tell me what that is.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.560
So I guess you don't get away from your store
very often.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.870
No, no but maybe this will help.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.440
Yes, this can help. I noticed too that you
have an iPhone.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.360
I do, thank you.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.540
I don't know about your current surveillance
system but with the DCS-930L you can view

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.060
the feed from your camera on your iPhone.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.580
That's an excellent feature.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.330
Can you do that with your current surveillance
system?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.680
No, not at all. I would have to be at home.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.850
You would have to be at home. So even if you're
out doing errands or taking a vacation. And

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.609
as long as you have your iPhone and the DCS-930L
setup you can view your store anywhere in

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:11.609
the world.

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.780
That is great.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.939
Also, your current surveillance system I noticed
is fixed into the walls.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.090
This one all you need is just to plug it in
and you can move it freely anywhere in your

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.930
store. So if its in your backroom or in the
front, you can specifically aim it at somewhere.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.930
So its easy to move around.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.090
It is indeed.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.639
You can also setup email alerts and notifications
and motion sensors so that way if anything

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.180
crosses the path of the live feed, you'll
be notified immediately.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.049
Wow that's great.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.819
So let's go ahead and setup the camera.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.290
Let's set it up.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.260
Right out of the box, the DCS-930L is simple
to set up.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.400
I easily plugged in the camera and connected
it to the existing network.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.159
After a few minutes at her computer, I configured
the camera and had it up and running. Also,

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.450
I downloaded the mydlink app so that Lazara
could view the feed on her mobile device.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.209
With any business, space in the store is pretty
important. Thankfully with the camera's small

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:25.189
form factor, the DCS-930L can be positioned
anywhere near an outlet.

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.909
Well thanks Lazara for having us come in today.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.719
You're welcome, thank you for coming in.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.109
I hope you enjoy the DCS-930L.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.669
I do, I'm sure I will. And I'll let you know
how my vacation goes.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.040
Terrific. Have a good day.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.829
Thank you, bye.
