Hi! Nili Nathan and Chef Aj on behalf of Expert
Village your watching the healthy dessert

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.700
episode and Aj is going to show us how to
make a pumpkin mousse. Pumpkin mousse would

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.180
be versatile it could also be turned into
a pie or a cheesecake. I'm going to take a

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.110
bag of the healthiest ginger snaps that I
can find with organic unbleached wheat flour.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.540
I'm going to put a few aside to garnish and
I'm just going to just throw them all on the

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.550
food processor. You could do this by hand
with a rolling pin and zip log bag put having

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:39.730
a food processor. Alright so she is just blended
this in a food processor. Well actually grind

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.680
into crumbs. Well grind into crumbs and take
the blade out and then I'm just well just

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.010
put them back in this bag. I got my little
fine crumbs. This is how you could also do

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.720
this with graham crackers or oatmeal raisins
are your favorite cookie, any cookie that

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.470
you want, but we want crumbs so never throw
those cookies out. Mm what's next? Well you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.360
know there is a few crumbs in here but it
is okay because it is going to be a great

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:10.000
flavor we are going to take a 12.3 ounce box
of organic firm tofu. Put it in the food processor

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.670
along with a 8 ounce container of non diary
cream cheese. Tofu. This is available everywhere

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.850
and it is actually delicious it taste just
like the real thing. So this is a quick and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.100
easy receipt it is good with any holiday dessert
you have every had. In this bowl I have 2-15

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.260
ounce cans of organic pumpkin you could also
use 1-29 ounce can one ounce is not going

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.229
to make a difference sometimes the two cans
would end up being cheaper then the one can.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.229
Just pour it everything in. This is a stand
alone. Yeah oh you could I like to put it

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.340
in the glass first. I like to eat right out
of the can. Tablespoon of a pure vanilla extract

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.310
alcohol free is my favorite and 2 tablespoons
of pumpkin pie spice. All pumpkin pie spice

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.659
is a combination of different spices like
cloves and ginger and nutmeg and cinnamon.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.290
You could use those individual spices but
they already package it this way for you so

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.420
why not. And did you know that cinnamon is
good for your blood sugar level. So this is

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.482
perfect. It helps balance it. Well that is
good because you know it is funny that you

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:18.349
said that because the sweetener that we are
using today is suppose to also be easy on

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.630
your blood sugar, a guava nectar which they
make tequila out of and it even says on the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.230
bottle suitable for diabetics. Now I don't
think that you want to drink this whether

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.069
you are diabetic or not but it is a wonderful
natural sweetener and. It is actually a cactus

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.680
that is grown in Mexico.
