00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.873
My first time standing before the 
camera was kind of strange and scary.

00:00:07.947 --> 00:00:12.268
But I had to learn quickly how 
to press the ‘on’ button.

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:17.245
“I’m standing in front of 
the camera and it feels good.”

00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:20.346
I really had to learn not 
to be afraid of the camera.

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:30.353
I used my first pay check to book 
a trip to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:34.587
I love active holidays. I used to go 
backpacking with my friends.

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:39.123
I think it is the best way to experience the 
culture of a country and how people really live.  

00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:42.588
Backpacking brings you closer to the people.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.049
But everything has changed now I am a mother, 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.594
Now it’s about time with the family, 
renting a house.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.985
We chose to go Ibiza on our family holiday 
because my husband is a DJ. 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.521
He visits the island regularly for his work.

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.889
This way we get to see each other often 
and he gets to spend time with our baby too.

00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:06.033
Ibiza is a great island. A good place 
to relax and enjoy the occasional party. 

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:08.586
I think that when my son is older, 

00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:11.111
We will travel more and go backpacking again.

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.712
When I’m in the Netherlands 
I always go back to Friesland.

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:21.444
I grew up in this beautiful, peaceful area

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:28.326
My best friends are from Friesland, 
I have known them since I was 10 or 12. 

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:31.872
They know where I’m from, my roots. 
They understand me.

00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:37.808
When I was younger, I didn’t want 
to be a fireman or a model. 

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:44.511
I wanted to be a happy woman, 
living on a hill in nature. 

00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:47.804
That is the image I always had 
of what I wanted to be. 

00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:51.124
I never expected to be a model.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.774
I finished secondary school 
to get my diploma. 

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:01.293
And to prove myself. 

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:06.535
But then I wanted to try different things, 
different schools. 

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:08.416
I thought about becoming a teacher. 

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.457
Because I really enjoy working with kids.

00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:14.856
But I started modelling instead. 

00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:19.280
So the choice was made for me, 
and I am really happy with the result.

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:24.246
My fist time working for 
Victoria's Secret was in the Hamptons.

00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:25.802
I worked with model Alessandra.

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:31.754
Alessandra had been working for 
Victoria's Secret for eight years. 

00:02:31.754 --> 00:02:34.398
She really knew what to do. 

00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:39.555
She moved and posed while 
I watched her in amazement.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:43.897
When it was my turn I was pretty nervous. 

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.308
Standing there in your lingerie 
with ten other gorgeous women, 

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:49.119
Who haven’t had children.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:57.477
I just turned on some music and 
flipped the switch. It worked.

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:02.096
I started at Repeat as a model 
in one of their campaigns.

00:03:02.296 --> 00:03:05.099
Now I am involved in the design process. 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.353
It’s a new step. 

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.310
One that involves more than wearing 
clothes and posing in front of the camera.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.182
It is great to share my 
opinion about what I like... 

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:16.627
and what is comfortable to wear.

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.882
As I was one of the faces of 
L'Oréal, I got to enjoy Cannes. 

00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:27.842
Suddenly I was in the same category 
as Eva Longoria and Beyoncé.

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:29.729
It was a great honour.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.434
"This route cuts straight through the ice."

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:38.880
I think it was amazing that 
I got to play in a film.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.934
Nova Zembla is a film about Gerrit de Veer. 

00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:45.024
A writer who travels on a ship.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:49.741
He hopes his journey will prove his 
love to his muse and love Catherina. 

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:51.479
I play the part of Catherina.

00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:53.910
My life’s goal has changed. 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.661
On the one hand nothing is 
more important than your child.

00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:03.257
On the other hand the child is 
the reason that you work. 

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:07.143
He has become your responsibility.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:17.291
When we held him in our hands 
we decided he was a Phyllon.

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:19.473
He is Phyllon.

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:21.864
My husband came up with that name. 

00:04:21.864 --> 00:04:25.865
We googled it and I think 
it means ‘leaf’ in Greek.

00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:29.774
Our quality time is for the three of us. 

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:34.706
Quiet time at home or we go to 
the park, just the three of us. 

00:04:34.706 --> 00:04:37.300
We do very relaxing things. 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.529
This is also great for my husband 
and I as both our lives are hectic. 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.405
He brings peace to our family.

00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:47.616
I don’t know where my son will grow up. 

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:50.878
It is something we are still talking about.

00:04:50.878 --> 00:04:52.788
We talk about it a lot, 

00:04:52.788 --> 00:04:57.282
Will it be the Netherlands, 
New York, Los Angeles or wherever…

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:03.722
We’ll be spending the coming 
months in New York. 

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:08.798
And if we don’t like it, 
we’ll return to Holland.
