00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.410
Okay, in this segment, we're going to cover
installing the tensioner. This is really a

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.629
crucial part of the chain system. It is real
crucial because it's what keeps all of the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.129
slack out of the chain and the chain fitting
as tight as possible to the tire. The tighter

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.550
that chain fits to the tire, the better it's
going to ride on the tire. The better handling

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.520
you're going to have. Traction, ride quality
and it also keeps everything real snug, so

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.750
you don't have any loose portions of the chain
flopping around and potentially damaging your

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.250
vehicle. That does happen quite often and
regular. If you should experience a failure

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.620
where you start hearing a smacking sound,
a broken link or a broken tensioner or whatever

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.940
the situation may be, the second you hear
it, get pulled over as quickly as possible

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.800
and address that issue. Because, it's just
going to rapidly deteriorate the chains and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.989
your vehicle by letting that go. If the chains
come off, they can wrap around the drive axle,

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:07.570
cause all kinds of other problems. This is
where things can get a little bit tricky here.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.881
What I'm going to down is, you can see it's
kind of out of center, out of round more or

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:22.270
less. I'm just going to make some adjustments,
kind of slide everything into position and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.260
move the chain around so it gets good and
centered. Reaching around the back side checking

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.260
the inner bead of the chain. When it comes
around, you'll have a nice circle loop on

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.660
the back side. Make sure it's nice and tight.
You'll want to get up and get an inspection

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.350
from the front on the inside. Make sure there's
nothing in its way. It's not going to hit

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.080
on anything. Then you just slowly work the
chain around so it all fits nice and uniform.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.950
Basically the entire tie down points where
the links come in, are all pretty much centered

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.740
in the same location around the tire. You're
not going to have as much movement down the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:10.420
bottom. As you get going, it will kind of
center itself too and make some minor adjustments.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.330
That's basically what we're looking for; they're
still not exactly perfect. Then you just want

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.590
to go around to the other side and duplicate
the same thing. Now we've the chain on, the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.480
tensioner on correctly and everything is set
up and ready to go. Please watch our next

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.510
segment and I'll cover the safety requirements
and some winter driving tips on safe operation

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.620
with chains on your vehicle.
