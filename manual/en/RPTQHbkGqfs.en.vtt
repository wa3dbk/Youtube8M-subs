00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.800
The Wind and the Sun

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.050
A Santali folktale

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.717
One afternoon,

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:17.800
the Wind and the Sun

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.550
were having an argument

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.883
about who was stronger.

00:00:26.217 --> 00:00:27.550
"I've uprooted huge trees

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.967
"I've uprooted huge trees

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:32.050
and drowned millions of ships.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.467
and drowned millions of ships.

00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:40.717
You can't do

00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:43.550
either of those things,"

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.217
said the Wind proudly.

00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:48.800
The Sun smiled and shrugged.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.383
The Sun smiled and shrugged.

00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:53.383
"That doesn't mean

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:54.967
you're more powerful," he said.

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:58.717
you're more powerful," he said.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.133
"I can cover you with clouds

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.967
"I can cover you with clouds

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.300
so that no one can see you!

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.217
so that no one can see you!

00:01:10.217 --> 00:01:13.133
You can't do that to me,"

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.967
said the Wind.

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:17.800
But the Sun just smiled warmly.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.217
But the Sun just smiled warmly.

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:25.550
"I still think

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.883
I'm stronger than you,"

00:01:28.883 --> 00:01:33.217
he said calmly.

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:40.300
The Wind began to grumble.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300
He didn't like the idea

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.300
of the Sun being stronger than him.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.300
"Why don't we have a test?"

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
"Why don't we have a test?"

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.300
the Wind finally suggested.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.633
the Wind finally suggested.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:59.133
He whipped around,

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.467
looking for something

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:04.633
to show off his strength.

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:10.217
"Shall we see who can knock down

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:10.883
"Shall we see who can knock down

00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:12.883
the most number of houses?"

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.883
he asked.

00:02:15.883 --> 00:02:19.967
"Let's keep it simple.

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:22.800
See that man over there?"

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.467
asked the Sun.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:26.550
The Wind looked down

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.050
and saw a man

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.967
walking down a road.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:35.800
He was whistling happily to himself

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.300
and had a shawl

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.717
thrown across his shoulders.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.883
"Shall we see who can force him

00:02:44.883 --> 00:02:46.050
"Shall we see who can force him

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.883
off the road first?" the Wind asked.

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:50.883
off the road first?" the Wind asked.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:57.550
"No, that will only hurt him,”

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.300
the Sun replied.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.800
“Let's just see

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.883
who can take his shawl off.”

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:06.967
who can take his shawl off.”

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.883
The Wind shrugged

00:03:09.883 --> 00:03:14.050
and whipped around the sky.

00:03:14.883 --> 00:03:18.050
He huffed and puffed

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.883
and made the leaves

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.467
in the trees shiver.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.800
The man frowned at the sky

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.467
The man frowned at the sky

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:25.800
and wrapped his shawl

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.383
tightly around himself.

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.300
Thunderclouds appeared in the sky.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.133
Animals began running for shelter

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:43.133
and the Wind began to roar.

00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:48.217
The man wrapped his shawl

00:03:48.217 --> 00:03:51.883
even tighter.

00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:56.883
Soon the thunderclouds drifted away.

00:03:56.883 --> 00:03:59.633
The Wind had blown himself out.

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:04.217
"I give up. I can't do it,"

00:04:04.217 --> 00:04:05.133
panted the Wind.

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:09.383
panted the Wind.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.883
He curled up on top of a cloud

00:04:14.883 --> 00:04:19.133
to catch his breath.

00:04:20.883 --> 00:04:22.050
"Now it's my turn,"

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.133
said the Sun.

00:04:26.717 --> 00:04:30.550
He yawned lazily

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.633
and stretched his rays.

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:35.217
He seemed to grow brighter

00:04:35.217 --> 00:04:40.383
and bigger in the sky.

00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:43.217
Soon it was as hot

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:46.633
as a summer day.

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:50.300
The man looked up at the sky

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.633
and wiped the sweat off his forehead.

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:57.050
"What strange weather

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.800
we're having today!"

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.633
he said to himself.

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:07.217
Then he took his shawl off

00:05:07.217 --> 00:05:12.217
and tucked it under his arm.

00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:15.633
"Looks like you win,"

00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:16.550
the Wind agreed cheerfully.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.383
the Wind agreed cheerfully.

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:23.300
He clapped his hands

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.883
He clapped his hands

00:05:24.883 --> 00:05:26.717
and made the leaves on the trees rustle.

00:05:26.717 --> 00:05:29.800
and made the leaves on the trees rustle.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.633
"You don't have to knock a man down

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:32.883
"You don't have to knock a man down

00:05:32.883 --> 00:05:35.800
to take his shawl off,"

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.967
said the Sun with a teasing smile.

00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:40.967
said the Sun with a teasing smile.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.717
They laughed together

00:05:44.717 --> 00:05:46.300
and watched the man

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.300
walking down the road,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.467
again whistling happily to himself.

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:52.883
again whistling happily to himself.
