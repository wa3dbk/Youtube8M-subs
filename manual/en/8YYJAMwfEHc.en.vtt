Hi.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:20.859
This is Stephanie Manley with Copykat.com.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:21.859
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.240
Today, we are going to make some honey roasted
carrots.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.070
I am going to use
coconut oil to go ahead and roast these with.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.990
If you don't have coconut
oil, olive oil will work just as well.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.640
So, I've taken some really large
carrots.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.760
I love to buy these because they're very inexpensive.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.620
I'm simply
going to chop these into large, long planks,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.720
so you can see the colors when
they brown.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.880
. Just go ahead and put them in your bowl.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:13.420
. Now, I'm going to
make the marinade that goes over the carrots.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.140
I have a couple of
tablespoons of oil in here.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.869
Again, I used coconut oil.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.450
You can use olive.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.340
Add a couple tablespoons of cider vinegar
to add this nice little bit of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.340
tartness.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.310
Then to offset that, I'm going to add a little
bit of honey.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.229
. A
couple tablespoons of honey.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.549
I'm going to stir this together.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:51.070
. Then, I'm going to pour this over the
carrots.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.960
I want to stir the carrots to make sure they're
well-coated.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.229
I'm
going to put them into my baking dish.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:17.120
. I'm going to season generously
with salt and pepper.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:30.150
. Then, I'm going to add a little bit of fresh
herb

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.150
right here.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.680
This is just some flat leaf parsley.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.960
Let's look at this dish, a
nice bit of color and some extra flavor.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.930
So, now we're going to put this
into a 375 degree oven and bake them until

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.740
they're nice and golden brown.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.980
I hope you enjoyed my last video.
