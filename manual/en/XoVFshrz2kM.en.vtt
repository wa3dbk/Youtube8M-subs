Having access to technology can enhance almost
every aspect of our lives. Being included

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.230
is very much about being connected. Whether
it's for online shopping, Internet banking,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.020
or simply staying in touch with friends or
family, technology plays a pivotal role in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.010
everyone's lives.
It's very, very simple to get started with

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.010
technology. You can learn bit by bit and day
by day. So in this short series of videos

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.210
we've broken down all of the popular topics
and questions around technology and we've

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.680
made it really simple and user friendly and
we hope that you find it to be a very valuable

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.680
resource.
Hi, I'm Robin Spinks, I'm 39 years old, I'm

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.820
partially sighted and I am a gadget enthusiast
and I have to say that the smart phone is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.240
my device of choice.
Ellie Southwood: Hi, I'm Ellie Southwood.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.380
I've been blind all my life and so have got
into the latest technology, every time it's

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.869
come around and this time it's been smartphones.
Madleen Mann: Hi I'm Madleen Mann. I am 30

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.469
years old, I have been blind all my life,
and I could not live without my iPhone any

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.600
more.
Robin: Now, over the past few years there

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.890
has been an explosion in the use of smartphones.
Now, if you're not too sure what a smartphone

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.350
is, quite simply, it's a very clever mobile
phone that can perform all sorts of really

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.469
valuable functions, all made possible by being
connected to the Internet. Let's get down

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.810
to the nitty gritty, there's a lot out there,
Ellie, where do we start?

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.070
Ellie: I think we start with what on earth
do you want to do with it? So there's things

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.359
in the market, if you want to simply make
and receive calls. There are things in the

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.270
market, if you want to go on the Internet.
Robin: Madleen, you're a smartphone user,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.950
aren't you? Tell us a bit about what you currently
use.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.850
Madleen: I currently use an iPhone 5.
Robin: How does that work, if you're a person

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.090
who doesn't have useful vision?
Madleen: The iPhone comes with a screen reader

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.180
called Voiceover and it's very easy to switch
that on when you first get your iPhone.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.600
Robin: How do you interact with a touch screen
that's essentially a flat surface, if you

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.030
actually don't have anything there to feel?
Madleen: You get to know, for example, where

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.030
your cancel button is, or where your keyboard
is on the screen.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.800
Ellie: I'm a huge smartphone fan but I guess
not everybody is going to want to use a touch

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.570
screen phone or smartphone.
Robin: The most important thing is to really

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.280
explore. Try out the options that are available,
and find out what works best for you, and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.720
if you need any help with that, you can get
in touch and discuss your options.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.490
Now, if you don't want a traditional computer,
another option that you could consider is

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.500
a tablet. Tablets essentially occupy the space...
between a smartphone and a traditional computer.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.540
They're becoming really popular with people
who are blind or partially sighted. A tablet

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.520
will allow you to do most of the things that
a traditional computer would do, but with

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.330
much more portability, and it will allow you
to use built-in accessibility features.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.540
Ellie: It sounds like these might be brilliant
for people, who've got some sight, so they

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.650
might want to enlarge things on the screen,
where a smartphone screen just isn't big enough.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.280
Where do you see them being useful for people
with no useful vision, Madleen?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.560
Madleen: Some people would say that having
a tablet would enable them to use the keyboard

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.520
a bit better and people like that, they don't
want a tiny thing.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.210
Ellie: The other thing I've always wondered
about is cameras. There's lots of hype about

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.690
how good a pixel cameras have. What use is
a camera to someone who can't see?

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.040
Madleen: The camera can be very useful. Want
to know what you've got in your cupboard?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.600
The camera enables you to scan your product,
and know, is it a tin of tomatoes or is it

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.360
a tin of baked beans.
Robin: And it's important to remember that

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.530
the latest tablets. all have some level of
accessibility features built in. Prices range

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.600
from about Â£159 upwards, but the most important
things

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.430
Find out what you want to do with the device,
Keep it simple, Explore what is available

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.759
before making a choice.
