00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.600
How to Make Your Favorite Recipes Gluten-Free.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.000
Learning that you are gluten-intolerant doesn't
mean that you have to give up your favorite

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
recipes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.910
Here are some ways to modify traditional recipes
into ones you can enjoy.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.289
You will need Traditional recipes Pencil Pasta
dish substitutions Baked good substitutions

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.210
Main course substitutions Soup substititions
and sauce and gravy substitutions.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.210
Step 1.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.449
Review your traditional recipes with a pencil
in hand, marking problematic ingredients.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.160
As you look at the recipes, consider whether
you can substitute for -- or omit -- the things

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.539
you can't eat.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:50.679
At first, try modifying recipes that contain
very little flour or gluten-containing ingredients.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.809
You may be able to omit the flour without
ruining the recipe.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.229
Step 2.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.850
Consider pasta dish substitutions.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.769
Gluten-free pasta made from brown rice is
an option -- so are traditional Asian rice

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.519
noodles.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.580
Step 3.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.110
Know that you can still enjoy baked goods.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.620
Instead of wheat flour, use gluten-free flour
substitutes like millet, soy, white or brown

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.869
rice, tapioca, or garbanzo bean flour in your
recipe.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.799
Step 4.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.110
Consider main courses.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.700
You can flour or bread meats with cornmeal,
potato flakes, crushed potato chips, gluten-free

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.140
cereal, or gluten-free bread crumbs.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.350
Step 5.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.210
When making soups, instead of the gluten flour
usually used to thicken soups, use cornstarch

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.210
instead.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.240
Making sauces or gravies?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.890
Tapioca and tapioca starch can be used as
gluten-free thickeners.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.840
So can arrowroot, cornstarch, and potato starch.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.159
Smooth gravies can be prepared with sweet
rice flour.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.950
Now enjoy your favorite foods gluten-free.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.739
