00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.340
well the day is finally here this is
when we get a chance to see

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.010
two new pickup trucks I'm Mark Williams for
pickup trucks dot com

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.480
and we're here just outside pontiac
michigan where general motors

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.600
showing us the 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.369
and the 2014 GMC Sierra 1500

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.999
let's take a closer look of

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.699
a lot of the most significant changes
have to do with a rope

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.020
fuel economy is a huge issue so a lot of
the design changes especially to the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.680
front and

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.370
were a direct result of trying to
squeeze out every mpg they possibly can

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.789
that means wider grill narrower slats

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.129
taller look because a lot of the GM guys
are saying that their truck guys

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.329
want a truck that looks like a truck
that means

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.019
looking more like the current generation
heavy-duty

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.699
it's worth noting that especially in the
grill the separation between a Chevy

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.960
and the GMC look is probably the most
dramatic

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.540
other specific details specifically
tailored toward being slippery year

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.460
through the win

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.790
new bulging fenders a more

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.150
inlaid looks to the doors no longer does
the door shut

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.850
up high where can grab a lot of the
women create turbulence

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.940
but now it's over the lip and well
sealed also the way the air

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.140
rushes past the cab and over the bed is
now sealed as well too

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.530
in a win diffuser here in the front
tires

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.270
also is going to help improve fuel
economy probably the biggest news that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.010
we're hearing from both these trucks

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.040
three brand new engines all lumina

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.620
continuously variable valve timing
direct injection

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.210
and cylinder deactivation
across-the-board 4.3 liter v6

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.710
5.3 liter v8 and a 6.2 liter v8 now
they're not telling us the horsepower

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.890
and torque numbers yet

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.130
but they're making some big promises so
that means the v6

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.380
somewhere around 300 horsepower the 53
somewhere well above 350 horsepower

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.759
and the 6.2 come on this is the Corvette
engines

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.870
somewhere bumping up around 400
horsepower

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.390
that means big towing numbers and big
hauling capacity

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.250
probably some pretty high G VW's as well
we'll have to wait and see for that

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.870
clearly GM engineers to spend a lot of
time on this pickup bed

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.879
rolled steel instead of stamp steel for
weight savings

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.469
and strength 6 tie downs five
thousand-pound capacities

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.329
in the bed integrated bumper step to
make access

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.299
into the bed much easier and a fully
structured tailgate

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.329
to make it much easier to drop it by
yourself without doing any damage

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.810
as well as lifting it with very little
effort

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.459
it cannot be overstated

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.969
how vastly improve these new interiors
on his new trucks

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.689
first thing we like right off the bat
trailer brake controller

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.480
nice n Easy in our vision right up on
top four-wheel drive controller

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.790
easy to grab nice big knob right next to
it the door itself

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.659
brand new materials soft touch pad Inc
plenty of storage

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.969
huge improvement not only is there a
completely new gauge cluster

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:27.819
here but there's a 4.2 inch information
screen for the driver that has a host of

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.590
information

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.989
that you can monitor in real time or
overtime

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.989
but the money the heart and soul for
this new interior redesign

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.049
is right here in the center stack
big-screen

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.319
radio controls easy to see knobs

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.329
a/c controls and toggle switches that
control all sorts of

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.569
data and information around the truck
and power

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.249
you have electronics four separate
difference

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.620
power sources and a completely
reconfigurable

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.959
both storage area in the middle we also
want to make note that

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.389
Extended Cab models don't have the
suicide or

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.769
configuration anymore regular
conventional

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.370
rear door also a longer wheelbase

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.090
brand new wheelbase crew cab six and a
half foot bed model

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.380
this all out GM to better compete both
with their GMC

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.900
and their Chevy models against the new
RAM 1500 and the Ford F 150

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.080
and we don't want to forget the frame is
essentially the same

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.570
the suspension essentially the same but
still big changes

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.710
high-strength potential stealing the
cross members

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.430
ultra high-strength steel in the
mainframes

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.170
the suspension still near leaves front
coilovers

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.040
but the tuning and the fine-tuning is
completely different

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.470
that's what GM is telling us whether or
not this is going to be enough for

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.970
people to say this is a

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.280
a revolutionary pickup truck from
General Motors

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.970
even if you're a hardcore show the guy
you're a hardcore GMC guy

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.640
will will that other people have that
debate for us

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.570
there's a lot new in a lot for us to
explore we've only scratched the surface

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.690
here

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.690
