00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:21.390
A minimalist garden design suits a young professional
looking for a clean, smart, low maintenance

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.529
garden.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:35.690
It should feature sculptures, architectural
planting, and great vistas.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:44.980
All this adds up to an area you can both entertain
and relax in

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.420
A 
well designed minimalist garden can effectively

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.370
provide you with an extra room.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:12.770
The need for plants is minimal, so use artificial
materials to create a bold, crisp landscape.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.380
Plants are indeed key to a minimalist design,
but it should be the hard landscape features

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:47.720
which tie it together, with materials used
in sculpture and furniture being echoed in

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.860
the paving.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:14.680
Use lighting to great effect, perhaps set
into the patio, to alter the garden's mood

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:28.319
as you enter the twilight hours.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:53.480
Water can be used, but it 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:10.730
should 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:30.970
be calm and sedate which helps 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.769
to create great reflective qualities

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:55.170
It is important to 
work with a good professional gardener and

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:09.500
landscaper in order to realise your are ideas.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:23.280
Do 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:34.180
not 
be afraid to provide any professional with

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:44.120
your own input and inspiration.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:53.500
Steel, glass, and concrete are all materials
heavily featured in many minimalist gardens.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:03.471
This â€˜Industrial' basis does not mean it
has to be stark and unwelcoming, though a

00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:11.400
good knowledge of how to utilise these materials
is essential

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:28.020
The front garden should always mimic the back,
perhaps carrying on any features such as sculpture

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:41.170
or water.
