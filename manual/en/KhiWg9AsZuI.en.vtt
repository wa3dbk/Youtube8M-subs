00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.660
This is John Mendez with Expert Village and
now that we have got our strands strung on

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.250
one side of our clasp we can go ahead and
start beading. And you can see where I strung

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.770
them. I did the very ends and then the two
in the middle so I skipped two loops and the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.240
way it's strung, it works out in the end.
They just don't make a clasp that fits a four

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.570
strand perfectly for this so I choose a six
strand and work around it. So once you have

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.620
that done we can go ahead and put on our first
bar. I like to keep all the heads of the head

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.450
pins on one side and the soldered ends on
the other to just give it a nice clean look.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:54.760
So we can either start from either end will
be your top or bottom, so I like to just string

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.570
the first one and then choose your second
one for the second. And you will notice that

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:16.490
we are doing this so that the bars are on
one side and you will want to keep that going

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.100
in that pattern every time you put a bar on
because you don't want it to be unsymmetrical

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:39.209
if that is a word. So let's string that one
on and then we will get the fourth one through.

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:47.539
And this bracelet will take a while to make.
The first one I ever made probably took me

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.020
two days because I had to figure out the pattern
and put it down and look at it. So if you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.880
get frustrated you can always put it down
and come back to it. So what we will want

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.429
to do is we will want to pull that, and you
can see how it will just line up at the end.

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.830
It's going to look a little strange now, but
once you get all of your pieces on and the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.950
other end attached it will line up really
nicely and you can see when you put it one

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.310
you don't even notice.
