00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:51.982
I have been in pigeon racing
since I was twelve years old.

00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:56.558
I have had pigeons for
more than 30 years already.

00:00:57.771 --> 00:00:59.438
I am Marcel Sangers.

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:02.947
We are now standing on
the old Ijssel bridge in Zutphen

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.715
and there is a very nice
story about this bridge.

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:11.922
When I was a young boy my first
two pigeons came from this bridge.

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:14.985
When you look at the
orange part of the bridge

00:01:15.372 --> 00:01:16.464
you will see holes in them.

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:19.409
In those holes pigeons made nests.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.523
Some older friends of mine
always checked those nests

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:26.620
to see if there were
youngsters or eggs.

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:30.857
When there were youngsters in there,
they waited until they were 23 days old.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.011
They climbed onto the bridge
and grabbed those young birds.

00:01:34.717 --> 00:01:38.036
Those young birds were
my first two pigeons I ever got.

00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:39.875
It were two pied pigeons.

00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:49.944
When I was eleven years old

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:53.376
I lived upstairs with my
mother, my brother and my sister.

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:56.771
There I kept my first
two pigeons on a balcony.

00:01:57.237 --> 00:01:59.910
I had three next boxes
on top of each other.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.198
In the upper next box
I had a pair of pigeons.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.868
It was there that I got fascinated
by the pigeons, on that balcony.

00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:10.704
To be here has always been something
special for me...

00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:15.688
Two years or a year and a half later

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:19.004
I started to participate in
races for the first time.

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:25.074
Many years of hard labour,
day and night,

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:27.229
gave Marcel the means to invest

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:32.410
in pigeons from the best pigeon
fancier at the moment: Bertie Camphuis.

00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:38.494
The old 'Super Breeder' from
1995 became founding cock

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:40.725
and within a few years these pigeons,

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:44.340
together with Marcel's total
dedication for the sport,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.180
brought him to the top.

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:51.254
After winning all there was to win
in short and middle distance racing

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:55.452
Marcel wanted to excel on the
NPO one-day classics

00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:59.162
from 500 up to 700 km.

00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:03.349
He bought in original
Gerard Koopman pigeons,

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.165
and especially direct youngsters
from 'Kleine Dirk' and 'Golden Lady'

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:11.331
had a huge influence on the
modern Sangers pigeon.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.687
Results were breathtaking.

00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:15.560
Highlights like

00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:24.406
1st NPO OrlÃ©ans 18,127 birds
with six pigeons in the top 10 NPO

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:33.876
and 1st NPO Bourges 10,767 birds
with six pigeons in the top 10

00:03:33.876 --> 00:03:35.793
were just the beginning.

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.834
In the years afterwards super
performance including NPO wins

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:46.787
only confirmed Marcel Sangers' status
as number one long distance performer

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:48.238
of fhe Netherlands.

00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:56.608

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.030
