00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.330
Waving is a really cool
illusion style of popping.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.250
It's ability to make
you look like you

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.150
don't have any limbs or bones.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.410
They're not connected together.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.795
Waving is something
really neat and fun.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.485
We're going to break down
how to do our arms first.

00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:24.600
So to start our arm wave, I'll
put both my arms straight out

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.705
like this.

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:27.560
And my arms are
locked right now.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.250
And I'm going to bring
them in just a little bit.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.040
When we start our
arm wave, there's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.080
quite a few different
parts just in your hand

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.795
alone, which you want to hit.

00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:37.475
And waving is all
about the details.

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:43.170
So starting with our fingertips,
we'll go fingers, or digits.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.075
Then they'll point
down to knuckles.

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:47.960
And you can even
emphasize this as a fist,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.030
as kind of how you want to look.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.230
And then I'm going
to go to my wrist.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.176
Now, this is one part where you
really have to pay attention.

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:59.050
I'm going to slide
this arm down.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.070
My wrist is creating a
higher level than my elbow.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.710
So I would fingers,
knuckles, wrist.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.000
Then my elbow went low,
my wrist went high.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.099
When I'm going to
switch to my elbow,

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:14.140
or my wave's going to be
at the elbow right here,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.050
I'm going to be turning my elbow
up, and then my wrist down,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.855
flattening my hand like that.

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:23.490
This is called a blade.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.170
As opposed to open,
we're having blade hands

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.925
just for this drill.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:30.550
And so now my elbow
is sticking out.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.360
And my wrist is low.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.856
So we try again from the top.

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:39.540
We've got digits,
knuckles, wrist, elbow low.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.180
And all I'm doing-- all I'm
doing is turning my elbow.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.290
And so right here I'll turn.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810
My elbow will stick out.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.940
And then my arm and my wrist
are below the level before it.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.990
So after we get this elbow--
I'll stick my other arm back

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.030
out-- I'm going to
pop my shoulder.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.070
And then I'm going to go to my
right shoulder and pop that.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.900
Notice my left arm
is straight again.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.780
Now I'm going to go to
the elbow this time.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.794
So I've got to make
sure it's popped out.

00:02:10.794 --> 00:02:14.540
And then I'll switch to my
wrist, now to the higher level.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.110
And then I'll go to my knuckles,
my digits, and fingertips.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.280
One more slow breakdown.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.290
We got the digits, the
knuckles, and the wrist.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.032
We've got the elbow, this
shoulder, this shoulder,

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:35.670
the elbow, the wrist at eye
level, knuckles, fingertips.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.860
So using that same
base clap, we're

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.073
going to break down
our arms like this.

00:02:45.073 --> 00:02:46.848
And you can do it
with me, and then you

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:48.790
can practice on
your own afterwards.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.900
So we'll go boom, clap.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.735
Boom, clap.

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:52.975
Boom, clap.

00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:54.340
Boom, clap.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.510
Boom, clap.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.840
Boom, clap.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.000
Boom, clap.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.250
Boom, clap.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.190
Boom, clap.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.140
Boom, clap.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.370
Boom, clap.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.180
Boom, clap.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.610
Boom boom, clap.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.790
Boom, clap.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.870
Boom, clap.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.730
Boom, clap.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.036
Boom boom, clap.

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:11.210
Boom, clap.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.790
Boom, clap.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.390
Boom boom, clap.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.380
Boom, clap.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.385
So once you start to
break down the steps,

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:17.860
then you gotta go for it.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.560
You're going to try to do a
whole wave throughout your body

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.580
without stopping.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.254
All you gotta do is keep in
mind the order of the body parts

00:03:25.254 --> 00:03:26.170
as you're moving them.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.830
Obviously, if I'm
at my wrist here,

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.430
I don't want to start
this elbow-- this elbow?

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.840
That's my shoulder--
this shoulder out,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.240
because I'll be missing
my elbow in this shoulder.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.610
It's all about going
sequential order.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.803
So try it really slowly.

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:41.494
Left side.

00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:42.910
Come on, I'll do
it with you guys.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.569
Ready, set, go.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.980
All about breaking down
each body part in order.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.672
You can go as slow
as you can to get it.

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:53.600
Why don't you take
a couple minutes.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.600
First practice with the
song using the base clap

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.724
to break down the sections.

00:03:56.724 --> 00:03:57.905
And then give it a shot.

00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:58.650
Go for it.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.561
Pause this video.

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:00.560
I'll see you guys after.

00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:08.080
