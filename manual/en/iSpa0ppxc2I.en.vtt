00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.040
Mimosa autumn begins

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.820
Golden, fragile and nice

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.300
It's you, it's you, you're the one

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.240
Who was coming out for me on the street

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.700
Your letters smelled in the hall

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.720
When I returned breathless from school

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.060
And on the streets in the light autum

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.260
Bright angels were chirping behind me

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.500
Mimosa is reminiscent of withering

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.560
Strawflower, yellow  October

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.000
It's you, it's you, you are my only one

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.880
You came to me to the sweetshop

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.740
From the fainting, from the praying

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.240
Sleepy

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.060
In the park, I cried

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.600
With sweet words

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.060
And the rain of sweet autmun

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.140
It's you, it's you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.240
You are the only one

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.460
In dreams playing with old springs

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.740
Like the gold, like this fragrant bouquet
