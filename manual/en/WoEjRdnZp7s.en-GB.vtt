This is Fieldsports Channel News.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.400
Grouse shooting is to feature in the Christmas
special of Downton Abbey. Alnwick Castle is

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.360
renamed Brancaster Castle for the programe
and the filming of the shoot took place there

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.070
in July and August 2014. Fans of the series
will want to know that Rose’s father-in-law,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.380
Lord Sinderby, has rented out Brancaster and
invited the Crawley family to a shooting party.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.800
A game meat initiative in Denmark has captured
the public imagination. Called Jægernes julehjælp

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.699
and set up by Danish hunter Kasper Svenningsen
and his girlfriend Camilla Nielsen, it supplies

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.050
game meat to the needy. There are now 3,400
members of the group.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.370
The trade in tigers and other wild cat parts
is on the increase. A new study reports there

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.839
is a surge mainly in Mong La, a Burmese town
bordering China. It says the number of shops

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.749
selling such products has trebled in the past
eight years. Tiger parts were found in 80

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:08.000
per cent of the surveys, representing at least
200 tigers. The most common parts were from

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.710
clouded leopards, which number fewer than
500 in the world.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.610
Daily Mail royal editor and sometime friend
of Princess Diana, Richard Kay, has had a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.690
pop at the Princes for their love of shooting
sports. In an article headlined 'Slaughter

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.510
by Royal Appointment', he writes about the
apparent mismatch between Prince William's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.830
campaign to save endangered species and his
and his brother's love of big game hunting.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.460
Kay illustrates the article with pictures
of the princes’ ancestors shooting big game,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.850
including King George V shooting tigers on
a trip to India in 1911.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.600
The American Kennel Club has added a new hunting
breed. The Sicilian rabbit-hunting (wait for

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.690
it!) Cirneco dell'Etna joins the Spanish water
dog, an Italian sheepdog called a Bermanasco

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.250
and a South African watchdog called a Boerboel,
which will become recognized breeds on 1st

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.250
January 2015.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.960
And finally, do you want to use up those old
shotgun cartridges? Women's Outdoor News has

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.890
brought out a recipe for how to make a lighted
shotshell wreath. Its correspondent Barbara

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.630
Baird used a strand of 100 clear lights, 100
empty coloured shotshells and a green wreath.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.810
Included in the recipe is one bottle Chardonnay.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.240
