00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.129
This is Best Mobile Contracts, unboxing the
Samsung Galaxy S3.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.140
This is the latest flagship device in Samsung's
Galaxy range of Android phones.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.480
It comes in nice, clean white packaging and
as you can see there are various technical

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.990
specifications on the back, but we won't spend
too much time looking at these because we're

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.970
quite keen to get it open.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:34.450
So, let's break the seal at the bottom here
and see what we have inside the box.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.300
And here we have the phone itself.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.899
Ours is the marble white edition, though it's
also available in pebble blue.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.720
Let's take it out and get some first impressions.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.800
It's very lightweight, and the size of the
screen is obviously a bonus for this phone.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.180
It's also very slim at around 8 and a half
millimetres.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.739
The entire phone is built from plastic, though
it has a nice, glossy finish to it and overall

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.230
has a very nice feeling in the hand.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.659
Let's put that aside for the moment and see
what else we have in the box.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.500
So, here we have various pieces of paperwork
that we're unlikely to read.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.050
Get those out of the way...

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.770
And we have the earbuds for the earphones,
presumably there are earphones in here as

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.420
well somewhere.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.820
And then we have a standard micro USB charging
cable here.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:40.500
Here we have a power adapter in two parts.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.430
Then there is the actual earphones themselves
to go with the earbuds.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.659
And finally the battery.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.100
So there you have it, that's the contents
of the box.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.659
We will be firing up the phone and putting
it through its paces very soon, so stay tuned

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.140
for a full hands-on review.
