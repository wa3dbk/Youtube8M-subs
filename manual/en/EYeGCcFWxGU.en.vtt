00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.000
new polls out on whether president obama
is worse than president bush in terms of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.759
what will turn out for our civil
liberties laureate men decided but first

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.999
upholds on drawing overall

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.950
now people are still it

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.430
in favor of crawling by signifi margin

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.699
when the question is asked this way

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.839
you agree with the use of unmanned rose
to kill people in foreign countries whom

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.269
the u_s_ government says are terrorists
and present and and threat

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.519
sixty five percent still say we support
it

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.099
nineteen percent say we oppose

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.320
are now has a terrible number but

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.070
the on site is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920
there last week it was eighty three
percent

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.940
and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.420
who when you pass question differently
in the number gets even lower we asked

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.330
should it be lulu

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.340
school for the u_s_ government

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.780
to kill non-u_s_ citizens who need that

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.080
description

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.480
that's one thing when we do area they
were doing it should be illegal

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.249
fifty three percent say yes

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.779
and twenty one percent say no now those
numbers again i'm not that encouraging

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:58.599
obviously

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:00.950
a pretty bad overall

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.470
at least you know the numbers are
proving what is that

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.970
that number seem to be in the ballpark
about eighty three percent just last

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.330
week now here's another number that's
slightly encouraged

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.550
issue illegal for the u_s_ government
until american citizens who it believes

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.729
are terrorism

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:16.679
present imminent threat

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.280
so this is specifically about u_s_
citizens

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.200
now all the sudden that number which
last week was sixty five percent

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.180
is that a forty four percent

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.030
and now thirty one percent disagree

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.520
so they are basically saying

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.800
uh... okay

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.820
okay citizens info as you say they're
terrorists but nominated a waiver on

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.320
republics begin a waiver and democrats
agree in a way of so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.870
you know we were hopeful that we kid

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.650
asking people that what was actually
happening withdrawals that is beginning

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.400
i don't think any of those folks know
not any but a lot of them a great

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.510
majority of them don't even know about
the signature strikes in the double taps

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.960
right where we kill the first responders
and we kill the people who we don't know

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.570
their right so

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.470
five now

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.390
we have a question is izzo mama any
better than george w_ bush

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.950
on balancing civil liberties and
national security

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.610
some surprising answers there

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.979
forty four percent say better in in that
balance

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.589
thirty-seven percent say worse

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.969
and fifteen percent say about the same
sonya

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.729
to lessen categories worse for the same

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.209
it's actually fifty two percent of the
majority

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.329
that's a all bahama is either worst or
the same as bush in civil liberties

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.399
and by the way

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.290
that's true

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.629
now you can make a claim that they're
forty four percent says a fruit he ended

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.559
torture

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.050
now there's some loopholes there in the
extraordinaire rendition program

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.379
but let's grant them that right

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.319
but he certainly worse than bush in the
drone as strikes against u_s_ citizens

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.379
and other drugs trace and i just
mentioned

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.579
it is a toss-up and at some portion up
here numbers that don't seem always but

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.979
that i am encouraged

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.909
pass though obama administration has not
improved under bushes record

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.449
twenty one percent of democrats agree
and twenty three percent a liberal state

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.379
so we're talking about twenty to
twenty-five percent obviously

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.769
of people on our side progressives
liberals democrats are really

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.499
characterize and say

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:13.769
hey you know what

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.199
even though all but i was doing it

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.059
i'm not in favor of it

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.489
and i think i'll bomb a has been worse
than bush

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.319
look it might seem like a small
percentage do you will believe me that

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.760
that number was a much smaller

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.389
unquestioning on mama

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.239
they year-ago certainly two years ago

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.219
so now would be at least woken up

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.970
anywhere for

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.899
between you know if if true quarter

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.809
of people on our side going

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.139
hey this doesn't make sense

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.660
and i'm telling you that number will
only grow

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.089
because president bomb a

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.429
is violating our civil liberties

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.279
massive scale
