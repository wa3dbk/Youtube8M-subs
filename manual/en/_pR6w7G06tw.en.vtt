00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.900
Over the last few years, this demo has
become a bit of a favourite and it's certainly one that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.100
I can't help but love as well.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.800
All it really involves is some ethanol, which is just ordinary alcohol,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.470
As you can see, it burns with its nice

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.700
bluish yellow flame but quite gently. And the reason it burns gently is that it actually has to turn

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.840
into a gas before it will burn - it's not the
liquid that's burning

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.559
so it can only burn as fast as the
liquid evaporates.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.700
In the case in the bottle, I slosh the ethanol all around

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.900
coating the inside surfaces, allowing it to evaporate

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.579
and creating this highly combustible
mixture of

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.300
ethanol vapour and air which is ready to burn.
If we ignite it and slow down the footage,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.800
you can see that at first, it burns with a really lovely clean blue flame

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.000
which is a sign of what is called complete combustion.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.880
This is where these is abundant oxygen to react with the fuel so you just get the classic combustion products

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.200
of carbon dioxide and water.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.720
As the reaction progresses, the oxygen starts to get consumed and so,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.159
as well as the carbon dioxide and
water, you start to produce lots of tiny

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.320
carbon particles which glow yellow with
the heat of the flame.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.700
There's an interesting thing that you can see
the end of the reaction

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.530
which is this yellow billowing flame and  that's probably because of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
fresh oxygen being drawn into the bottle
through the normal processes and mixing around

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.950
with what's left of the fuel inside

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.960
So anyway so far so fun

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.030
but besides the fact that this looks really
cool, what I think is interesting about this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.100
is that it's basically just a rocket.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.140
A rocket is a device for burning fuel

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.439
and creating a force by projecting the
combustion products

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.100
out the back and that's exactly what's
going on here.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.950
So if this is generating some sort to force,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.030
maybe we can get to propel something,
such as me.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.700
That was underwhelming.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.800
So clearly the rocket isn't strong enough to have much of an effect on a mass such as mine.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.440
So let's back up a bit and
see if we can determine how much thrust

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.800
it is generating and we can do that crudely
on a balance like this.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.630
So that looked like it produced around 600
grams of thrust.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.480
That's about six Newtons, which is not bad but you can kinda see why

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.739
the bottle was a bit out of its depth in trying
to push on me. But the bottle on its own

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.880
is around 100 times lighter than I am so let's see how that gets on.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.909
You can really see the acceleration
as the fuel burns.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.420
The burning gas creates a build up of pressure inside the bottle

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.099
that simultaneously forces the exhaust out the back and propels the bottle forward.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.550
What we're seeing here is a really
beautiful demonstration of one of the most

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.700
fundamental laws in physics - the conservation of momentum.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.400
Where one object, in this case the exhaust gas, moves in the opposite direction to the other object, the bottle,

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.739
balancing out the overall momentum and
keeping Isaac Newton,

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.900
and therefore the universe, happy.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.519
We can also try some more fuels. 
This is methanol, which is similar to ethanol 
but has a smaller molecule.

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.500
It seems the pack a bit more of a punch.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.370
And this is propanol, which is a larger
molecule with more carbon in it.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.000
You can see that it burns with a lot more the
yellow flame, which you will remember was a sign of unburnt carbon particles.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.130
Now this all looks very rudimentary but
in fact some early rockets

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.440
were propelled with ethanol. 
The infamous V2 rockets

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.300
used by the German army in the second
world war, combined their ethanol with pure oxygen.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.740
Fully fueled, they weighed over twelve tons,
around four which was fuel.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.990
Clearly with the few grams a fuel
we're using here

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.500
we're not going to be sending anything into space
anytime soon.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.600
or are we?

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.480
Now that's rocket science.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.710
thanks
