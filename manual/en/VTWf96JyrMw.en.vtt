00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:09.313
You don't have to eat a ton of food

00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:10.741
to become well nourished. In fact,

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:13.244
it's about nutrient density that matters.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.419
So what is nutrient density? Well, it's actually

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.124
a ratio where you compare the amount of calories in

00:00:19.124 --> 00:00:22.121
a given food to its nutritional value.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:24.127
So its vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals

00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:25.877
and anti-oxidents. So of course, the goal is to try and

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:29.138
get as much as each nutrient while taking in as few

00:00:29.138 --> 00:00:31.809
calories as possible. So an example would be Kale.

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.725
Kale scores 1000, which is right at the top of the chart

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:36.486
because it's very high in nutrients relative

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:37.986
to the amount of calories it has.

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:39.954
Whereas soda, for example, gets a 1. It's right at the

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:41.686
bottom because it's very high in calories, yet

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:45.900
it has very few nutrients. So if we can base our diet

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.966
on those nutrient dense whole foods, we're obviously

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.539
going to get more nutrition in. It's not about volume.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.588
You don't have to eat more food, you just have to

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:54.417
get better quality food, and alkaline forming, too.

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:56.456
Foods that are nutrient dense are inherently more

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:59.624
alkaline forming, because minerals are extremely

00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:01.666
alkaline forming, and minerals, of course, are

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.962
nutrients. So they go hand in hand. Also, brightly and

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:08.339
intensely colored fruits and vegetables are high in

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:10.911
antioxidants, which are also nutrients. So when you

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:15.487
pick those bright oranges, reds, greens, purples,

00:01:15.487 --> 00:01:17.869
blues, you're going to be assured of getting more

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.957
nutrition in a smaller volume of food, and that's

00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:24.161
a good thing. High Net Gain Nutrition is one of the

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:26.813
most important elements of the Thrive Diet.

00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:29.255
It's basically about getting more for less. Spend

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.167
less digestive energy to get more nutrition.

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.147
So a calorie is a measure of food energy, so for

00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:36.762
a long time I used to think the more calories I ate,

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:38.807
the more energy I would have. That's not the case

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:41.176
because you have to spend a lot of energy to digest

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:44.397
and assimilate highly processed foods. Energy is

00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:46.138
just like anything else - you spend it, and you no

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:47.807
longer have it. So I started to look at food as

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:50.057
a form of investment. You spend a small amount of

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:55.152
energy, but you get a big nutritional return back.

00:01:55.152 --> 00:01:57.274
That's High Net Gain Nutrition.

00:01:57.274 --> 00:01:59.942
So, Vega One, for example - extremely high net gain.

00:01:59.942 --> 00:02:03.073
Only 135 calories - very nutrient dense, and easy to

00:02:03.073 --> 00:02:07.505
digest. Antioxidants and phytonutrients are

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:11.097
an important component of the nutrient density score, and here's why:

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.752
when you breathe in polluted air, cigarette smoke,

00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:18.171
or you get herbicides and pesticides in your system

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.932
from eating non-organic food, that builds up and

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:23.508
increases your risk of getting disease. So when you

00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:25.762
get enough antioxidants through these nutrient

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:27.856
dense foods, that offsets it, so it combats it,

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:30.682
and it significantly reduces your risk of disease.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:35.186
Antioxidants and phytonutrients include Vitamin C,

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:37.810
Vitamin E, and Selenium. The best sources for

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.852
those are brightly colored vegetables. To expand on
