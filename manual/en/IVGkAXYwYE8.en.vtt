Itís dark and wet around us and also it drips,
But never mind we cheer up and follow our way!

00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:51.985
We may feel down a little and puzzled now and then,
We hum this quiet tune beneath our breath:   

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:59.755
It doesnít matter where we are ëcause weíre together,
ëCause weíre together! 
ëCause weíre together!    
 

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:05.725
It doesnít matter where we are ëcause weíre together,
ëCause weíre together!   

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:14.935
It doesnít matter where we are ëcause weíre together,
ëCause weíre together! 
ëCause weíre together!    

00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:20.085
It doesnít matter where we are ëcause weíre together,
ëCause weíre together!   

00:06:22.885 --> 00:06:24.365
