Hello, I'm ROBwithaB
and this is 101 Ways to Make Fire.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.349
Today, I'm going to show you
how to make fire with a stick...

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.530
and a stone... and a...
and a...

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.680
...nother stick,
using the so-called Hand Drill method.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.070
I'll also be using a small dose
of a secret ingredient,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.550
a wonder product called AMP.
African Man Power.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.919
And this is one of the oldest methods
of making fire,

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.569
practiced for thousands of years
by indigenous people

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.800
in Eastern and Southern Africa.
And some of them are starting to get quite

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.730
good at it,
With all that practice.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.120
Especially Jabulani.
Now the basic concept here is pretty simple:

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.539
You rotate one stick in a hole in another,
applying downward pressure,

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.210
and that combination of speed and pressure
creates friction.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.390
Friction creates heat,
causing the organic material to decompose

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.339
by pyrolysis, forming charcoal dust.
The dust collects in a little notch, the temperature

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.320
increases with more friction until the ignition
temperature of that little pile of charred

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.829
dust is reached and we basically get spontaneous
combustion.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.190
Once we have an ember, we add oxygen to speed
up the reaction

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.570
(and by this stage you've stopped drilling)
and you use THAT heat then to ignite your

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.080
flaming tinder. And pretty soon we have fire.
Oonga Boonga

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.570
Everyone dances.
We get nice and warm

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.360
We eat some zebra steaks
We share slightly exaggerated hunting stories

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.930
Perhaps read our physics textbooks by the
firelight

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.250
Boy meets girl
Everybody's happy...

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.040
and society perpetuates itself for another
generation.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.860
BUT
But..

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.990
It's not quite as easy as I made it sound.
For a start, it requires a surprising amount

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.510
of upper-body strength.
AMP!

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.520
This is a job for grown men and in most tribal
societies, fire-making is the exclusive domain

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.970
of adult males.
This probably helps to explain the patriarchal

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.690
and hierarchal structure of most traditional
cultures.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.700
Without fire, you didn't survive and without
men you didn't have fire.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.700
Yeah, ladies. You KNOW you want this.
In Africa, the man is the Boss.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.790
[Roberta's Voice from upstairs]
Listen, I hope you're getting ready, the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.319
people are coming soon.
So...

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:05.330
Today we're in Africa.
