00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.050
HTC Gratia.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.050
Expected November 2010.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.260
The HTC Gratia is designed to be a relatively
affordable Android handset, and its functionally

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.490
almost identical to the HTC Legend announced
earlier this year.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.359
The Legend wasn't exactly a great sales success.
When compared to the HTC Desire, the Legend

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.440
seemed overpriced considering its modest specification.
Out of the two, the Legend was certainly the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.820
better looking phone.. but the Desire is the
handset that HTC can't make enough of.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.900
HTC watchers may recognise the Gratia, as
this is basically the European version of

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.920
the HTC Aria which was sold only in Asia.
The main difference between the Gratia and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.690
the Aria is that the newer handset runs Android
2.2 rather than 2.1.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:07.850
Featuring a 3.2" 320 x 480 pixel touchscreen,
3.5G support and WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, a microSD

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.740
slot, and a 5 megapixel camera, the HTC Gratia
is a mid-market Android phone, the Gratia

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.119
also has a 600MHz processor and 384MB of RAM.
This means that the Gratia is better than

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.719
the HTC Wildfire but not as good as the Desire.
We would expect the price to fall somewhere

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.329
between the Wildfire and Desire too.. our
guess is that the Gratia should retail for

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.590
about â‚¬350 SIM-free.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.869
As is typical with HTC Android phones, the
Gratia runs HTC Sense on top of the standard

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.810
Android user interface, and it also comes
with HTC's Friendstream application to help

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.389
you keep track of your friends and manage
updates on social networking sites.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:57.459
We understand that the HTC Gratia should be
available from November onwards in black,

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.359
white and green colour schemes.
