A MAJOR ADDRESS THIS WEEK BY SECRETARY SALLY
JEWELL ON CONSERVATION...

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.500
IN A SPEECH AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, THE
SECRETARY LAID OUT HER VISION, NOTING THAT

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.990
WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION AS A PEOPLE TO
ACT NOW TO CONSERVE AND PROTECT OUR NATIONAL

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.300
TREASURES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.560
IN THE WAKE OF THE 16-DAY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN,
JEWELL HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR COMMONSENSE,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.500
BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL ACTION TO SUPPORT
OUR PARKS, REFUGES, RIVERS, AND CONSERVATION

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500
LANDS.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.190
We're continuing to move ahead in fulfilling
our mission at the Interior Department.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:49.120
As stewards of our public lands, waters and
wildlife; in partnership with tribal nations,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.739
states, and stakeholders, we will meet the
needs of the present generation without sacrificing

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.200
the rich legacy we pass on to our children
and grandchildren.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.609
This is our commitment to all Americans and
my personal commitment to you.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.740
JEWELL ALSO LAID OUT AMBITIOUS GOALS TO ENGAGE
THE NEXT GENERATION THROUGH EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.810
AND VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES ON PUBLIC LANDS.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.630
THESE TARGETS INCLUDE PROVIDING OUTDOOR EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES TO AT LEAST TEN MILLION OF THE

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.349
NATION'S K THROUGH 12 STUDENTS ANNUALLY...

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.440
ENGAGING ONE MILLION VOLUNTEERS IN SUPPORT
OF PUBLIC LANDS...EFFECTIVELY TRIPLING THE

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.960
NUMBERS WE HAVE NOW...

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.950
AND PROVIDING 100-THOUSAND WORK AND TRAINING
OPPORTUNITIES TO YOUNG PEOPLE ON OUR PUBLIC

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.180
LANDS.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.690
ON THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE SANDY,
THE SECRETARY THIS WEEK WAS JOINED BY VIRGINIA'S

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.720
SENATOR TIM KAINE AND CONGRESSMAN JIM MORAN,
IN ANNOUNCING THE LAUNCH OF A 100-MILLION

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.700
DOLLAR COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO STRENGTHEN
THOSE COASTAL WETLANDS AND OTHER NATURAL AREAS

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.020
THAT SERVE AS BUFFERS TO PROTECT LOCAL COMMUNITIES
FROM FUTURE STORMS...

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.890
THE SECRETARY MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE
NATIONAL PARK SERVICE'S DYKE MARSH WILDLIFE

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.420
PRESERVE IN ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA...

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.330
DYKE MARSH ONCE NUMBERED SOME 200 ACRES, BUT
HAS DWINDLED IN SIZE TO FEWER THAN 60...

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.090
UNDER A 25 MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT, ONE OF
45 ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK TO RESTORE COASTAL

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.039
LANDS, THE MARSH WILL BE RESTORED TO ITS ORIGINAL
SIZE, RE-ESTABLISHING ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.980
AREAS ALONG THE GEORGE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL
PARKWAY, UNDOING A HALF CENTURY OF NATURAL

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.780
AND MAN-MADE EROSION.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.620
It's limited the rich wildlife habitat, and
the recreational opportunities for hiking,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.650
biking and other outdoor activities that help
drive the economy of this region and help

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.220
provide breathing space for so many people.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.890
We need to work together in creative new ways
to make sure that we protect what we have

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.590
against, whether it's weather emergencies
or climate change, or over development...

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.930
we have a lot of work to do, and today's a
good step forward.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.240
JEWELL SAYS THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WILL
USE YOUTH AND VETERAN VOLUNTEERS AND CONTRACTORS

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.670
ON THE PROJECT.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.500
SECRETARY JEWELL IS APPLAUDING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
DECISION TO NOMINATE RHEA SUH AS ASSISTANT

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.840
SECRETARY FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE AND PARKS.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.540
SUH HAS SERVED AS ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR
POLICY, MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET SINCE MAY, 2009.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.410
IF CONFIRMED BY THE U-S SENATE, SUH WILL PLAY
AND IMPORTANT ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.319
STRATEGIC VISION FOR OUR WILDLIFE AND PARK
CONSERVATION PROGRAMS.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.390
AND AS HALLOWEEN COMES AND GOES THIS WEEK,
THE FOLKS AT THE U-S-G-S WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.310
WOULD LIKE TO REMIND US THAT A SCARY SYMBOL
OF THE SEASON, IS GOING THROUGH SOME SCARY

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.760
TIMES OF ITS OWN.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.740
BATS HAVE LONG HAD A FRIGHTENING REPUTATION
AND HAVE BEEN LINKED TO VAMPIRES, WITCHES

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.000
AND WARLOCKS...

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.710
BUT IN *REAL* LIFE, SCIENTISTS SAY THEY SERVE
A VITAL ROLE IN OUR ECOSYSTEM AND OUR ECONOMY,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.840
BY CONTROLLING THE INSECT POPULATION THAT
CAN DAMAGE OR DEVASTATE OUR CROPS.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.819
SADLY, BATS FACE A NUMBER OF DEADLY CHALLENGES,
INCLUDING FATAL FUNGUS INFECTIONS, AND DANGER

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.750
FROM WIND ENERGY TURBINES.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.900
SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS ARE CONDUCTING RESEARCH
ABOUT WAYS TO REDUCE THESE THREATS TO THE

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.340
TINY MAMMALS THAT FLY BY NIGHT.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.000
THAT'S THIS WEEK, AT INTERIOR.
