00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.688
Developer Diaries

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.048
World of Warships is an epic action-packed naval battle.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.976
This is a game about warships 

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:25.488
in their purest form.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:29.120
It's about the ships of the first half of the 20th century.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.840
It's about combat between these 

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.712
multi-thousand ton monsters.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.111
Developer Diaries

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:38.816
If you compare World of Warships with Tanks 

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:41.584
than the first thing you notice 

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:43.168
is the seemingly slower gameplay,

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:45.312
but this is only a first impression at the start of a battle.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:48.016
When the massacre itself happens

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:51.824
the player suddenly finds out that everything is very fast,

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:53.616
that he has to shoot, 

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.048
look if any torpedoes come at him, 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.432
see where his scout plane is,

00:00:58.432 --> 00:01:01.392
check if any enemy planes are going to attack him at the same moment.

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:07.808
Just imagine, if you will, a dozen battleships, each of which has 16-inch rifles, slugging it out.

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:12.704
Intermixed with that the destroyers launching devastating salvos of lethal torpedoes,

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:15.776
then you add the third dimension: 

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:17.616
You look up 

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:21.760
and you find yourself on the receiving end of dive bombers, torpedo attack aircraft, 

00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:25.536
and then up at the higher levels, here's even combat between the aircraft,

00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:30.544
t between fighters and other fighters, fighters and the attacking aircraft.

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:36.192
Once you have this massive, complex battle of multi-dimensions happening at the same time,

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:39.040
that's where you really start to see world of Warships become 

00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:43.040
not just a case of clicking and shooting,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.952
it really does become a more strategic case of interactions and tactical thought.

00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:49.311
Developer Diaries

00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:52.304
We will have four classes of ships in the game --

00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:56.096
carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.832
Each class has its own peculiarities, of course. 

00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:00.224
Carriers are pretty obvious. 

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:03.968
You can tell from the name itself that their main weapon are the deck-based aircraft.

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:06.960
For example, with aircraft carriers, you can attack the enemy using bombstikes, 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.520
torpedstrikes and you also have 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.792
scout planes to find an enemy,

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:15.024
and also fighter planes that will attack

00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:17.152
the enemy planes.

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:20.160
The main class of vessel, of course, is going to be the battleship.

00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:21.344
Everybody knows what it looks like, 

00:02:21.344 --> 00:02:23.824
I mean, we're on one now, 

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:26.480
the characteristic, iconic vessel of WWII.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.528
Of course, not the most significant,

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:31.200
but it's the one everybody thinks of.

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:36.064
The battleship is a Maus with several SPGs on it cruising through the map.

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:39.584
Cruisers are probably the most tactically important ship class,

00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:47.168
since they have a good balance between their armor and movement speed.

00:02:47.168 --> 00:02:49.360
Cruisers can be compared to medium tanks:

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.136
they can harass battleships; 

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.880
they sink destroyers and carriers

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.608
while travelling around the battlefield. 

00:02:57.056 --> 00:03:00.128
The destroyer is a small mobile ship. 

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:02.928
The main strategic power of the destroyer

00:03:02.928 --> 00:03:07.648
is its mobility and fast movement.

00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:12.016
Well, imagine a scout in World of Tanks, fast, mobile,

00:03:12.016 --> 00:03:14.864
but that has a quadruple KV-2 cannon.

00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:17.328
This will give you an idea of the destroyer -- 

00:03:17.328 --> 00:03:19.968
fast, mobile, armed with torpedo launchers.

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:23.296
There are no submarines in the game. 

00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:25.824
Believe me, we looked at it. It just doesn't fit with the gameplay.

00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:29.712
You've got these small things that are practically invisible, 

00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:32.704
unless you happen to be in ASDIC range, which back then wasn't all that long.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.456
They have devastating firepower, 

00:03:35.664 --> 00:03:39.312
but when detected, let's say they're on the surface, they're gone immediately, because they just have no survivability.

00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:41.472
There really wasn't any way of implementing it,

00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:44.832
so, just for the sake of gameplay...

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:47.744
Yes, we understand how important

00:03:47.744 --> 00:03:51.472
the U-Boats and the American submarine fleet were in WWII. 

00:03:51.472 --> 00:03:56.160
We are not ignoring the historical reality behind it, it doesn't work in the game. There will be no submarines.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.592
Developer Diaries

00:03:56.592 --> 00:04:01.168
A project like WoWS can't be done simply on the basis of drawings. 

00:04:01.504 --> 00:04:03.200
Well, I guess you could, but the quality wouldn't be the same.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.112
As a result we actually sent a couple of expeditions.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.072
We visited ships-museums in the USA.

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:13.610
Visiting real ships provides a lot of data 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.112
and material for the game, that we couldn't get anywhere else.

00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:20.512
When we see

00:04:21.376 --> 00:04:23.776
what the ships look like in real life

00:04:23.776 --> 00:04:27.680
it helps us make the graphics authentic,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.552
and closer to the real deal. 

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:31.600
I think this is very important to the gamers.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.792
When you see a ship with your own eyes, you realize 

00:04:36.224 --> 00:04:38.528
it's not a picture or a model, 

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:42.080
but a monstrous steel machine which moved and fired its weapons.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.240
You come to understand the reality of it,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.400
and you get a feeling on what it should be like in the game.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.400
