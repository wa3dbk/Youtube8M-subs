Hi I'm Vernon Blackmoore and I've worked
for Gressingham Duck for the last ten years,

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.930
and today I'm going to show you how to cook
the perfect duck breast. Right here we have

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.930
the duck breasts here which I've trimmed off
already of any excess fat and the first thing

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.890
I'm going to do is get the pan going on a
low to medium heat and then quickly score

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.890
the skin. OK, you dont want to come through
with the knife too far. You've got to make

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.350
sure you've got a nice sharp knife. You don't
want to go through to the flesh if you can

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.350
help it. Then I'm going to season both sides
with a bit of salt and pepper. Now you've

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.330
got your pan on, you dont need any oil at
all because there's going to be a lot of fat

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.070
rendering down. So you place it into the pan
and you want to get a nice golden crispy skin

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.470
which will take about 3 minutes. Right, when
the skin is nice and golden crispy appearance,

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.979
quickly sear it. Look at those, absolutely
delicious. About 30 seconds on the flesh side,

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.460
then I'm going to flip it back over and its
going to go into a pre heated oven 200 degress

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.100
centigrade. If you haven't got a metal pan
just transfer it to a baking tray thats already

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.100
been in there. Right now the duck breasts
have been cooking for 4 to 6 minutes in the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.710
oven. I prefer to eat my duck breasts pink,
however if you prefer to cook them longer

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.649
then thats up to you. On the website at Gressingham
Foods it has specific cooking times for medium,

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.270
well done, etc. Now you need to keep these
duck breasts resting, for about 4 minutes

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.630
before serving. This allows the moisture to
draw back into the centre of the duckto make

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.310
it more tender. Now they've been resting for
about 4 or 5 minutes they are ready to serve.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.430
They are going to be lovely and tender so
I'm going to pop them on the chopping board

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.780
there and I'm going to cut them into 4 or
5 slices. You dont want them too thin otherwise

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.780
its going to lose its heat very quickly. I'm
just going to cut them up there. Now that

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.450
I've cut them up they're ready to serve so
I'm going to put them on the plate there.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.280
Delicious. Perfect duck breast.
