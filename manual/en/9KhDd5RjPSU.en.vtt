00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.636
Now there are a
whole host of factors

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:05.372
that can contribute to
herb-drug interactions.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.507
And, of course, the more
botanicals or the more

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.309
phytochemicals
you're exposed to,

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.745
the greater the likelihood that
there may be an interaction.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.347
And, of course, a lot of
products on the market

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:16.083
now contain more than just
one botanical extract;

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:19.319
oftentimes it's a multitude
of multiple extracts

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.154
in one particular product.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.157
And, of course, you have to
realize that these are botanical

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:28.028
extracts when you're taking the
botanical material extracting it

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.264
with either hot aqueous or
hot organic solvents and

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:33.233
concentrating a lot of these
phytochemicals into a form

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.868
that's much higher than it would

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.005
if you just say consumed
the plant on its own.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.439
And, of course, a lot
of the phytochemicals

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.675
that are in some of these
interesting and unique

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:46.647
and sometimes quite
varied products

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:50.217
we really don't know much about
their pharmacological activity.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.687
So an example that I like to use
is that there's been over 500

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:57.257
unique phytochemicals identified
in Panax ginseng and just about

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:01.695
every multi botanical supplement
has Panax ginseng in it.

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.331
And so if you think there's 500
or so in Panax and you've got

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:08.101
six or seven others then it's
a multitude of compounds

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.870
that are in those things.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.210
And so this is another slide
showing just a partial listing

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.446
of some of the known
constituents in St. John's wort

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:24.384
extracts and so several
phytochemical families,

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.820
so to speak, are fairly
common in most botanicals

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.056
like the flavonoids
and essential oils.

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.058
But every now and again
you run across some unique

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:34.127
phytochemicals that are found
only in one particular species.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.996
And the good example with
St. John's wort are the

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:41.335
naphthodianthrones over
here on the far left,

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.936
and then the phloroglucinols,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.338
and one in particular,
hyperforin.

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.605
And we're going to
talk about hyperforin

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.240
in a little more detail later.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.743
But you can certainly see that
when you consume a St. John's

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:52.646
wort product you're consuming
just more than one single entity

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:55.349
as you would with a
conventional medication.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:01.755
Now in terms of recognizing,
our initial recognition for the

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:04.257
possibility of an
herb-drug interaction,

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.527
most of the time we're initially
alerted to a potential

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.496
herb-drug interaction
through case reports

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.531
that appear in medical literature.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.034
Now of course case
reports really can't establish

00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:16.737
causation, but they can
certainly help generate

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:19.539
hypotheses about
possible mechanisms.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.943
But if you start to see the same
types of case reports over and

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:25.012
over and over,
reporting the same thing,

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.813
there's probably
some merit to that.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.648
And that was certainly the case
with the ephedra products that

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.317
we'll talk about in just a bit.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.419
And, of course, this holds true
for the adverse event reports

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.623
that get submitted to the
FDA's MedWatch program.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.458
And, of course, if
you're into this area,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:43.063
like myself, the literature is
replete with in vitro studies

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:47.000
assessing whether or not
phytochemicals if you expose

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.671
either purified drug
metabolizing enzymes or

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:55.275
transporters or cell lines
that express certain drug

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.110
metabolizing
enzymes or transporters,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.146
if you expose them to a
high enough concentration of a

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:03.717
purified phytochemical or to an
extract you're going to elicit

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:05.585
some type of response.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.156
And oftentimes to do that you
have to stabilize some of these

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:12.893
phytochemicals with
solvents like DMSO and such.

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:15.962
And so a lot of the
in vitro studies,

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:18.298
almost always imply that
there is going to be

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.600
some type of adverse effect.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.436
But rarely do those
in vitro situations

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:25.472
translate to the
in vivo condition.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:29.009
And so to me, just my
personal opinion, is that the

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.312
most definitive way to assess
whether or not a botanical is

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.549
going to lead to a clinically
relevant herb-drug interaction

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.752
is to do prospective clinical
studies in human volunteers or

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:41.354
in actual patients themselves.

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:44.724
So we're going to look at
some examples of all of these

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:45.325
as we go along.
