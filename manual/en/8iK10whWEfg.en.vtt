00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:10.519
Hi everyone!

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.519
Kristina here.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.230
Welcome to another Friday Focus video.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.529
Today I'm starting a new miniseries and I'm
calling it "1 Card, 1 Stamp Set."

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.930
The idea for this miniseries came from a card
that I posted last Monday where I used one

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.610
stamp set for all of the stamping on the card.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.710
A few of you at my blog mentioned that you
really liked that idea.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.149
I decided to take it as a challenge, and give
myself the challenge to create some cards

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.850
using only one stamp set on each card.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.710
I won't be mixing and matching stamp sets
or anything like that.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.600
The stamp set I'm using today is the Butterflies
stamp set from Simon Says Stamp, and I'm using

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.630
a technique that's called Rock and Roll.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.830
If you are an experienced stamper, or if you've
been stamping for a while, you might be familiar

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.059
with this technique.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.790
It's kind of all over the place and it's a
really fun one.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.721
It's when you take a stamp, ink it up in a
lighter color (or any color, really), and

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:12.219
then before you stamp it down onto your paper,
you rock and roll the outer edges of that

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:14.540
stamp into a darker color.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.880
Sometimes the first color can transfer onto
the ink pad of the second color, like you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.469
can see here on this darker teal color.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.790
But it's not a problem.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.240
You can take some scratch paper and dabb that
off and it picks up all of that first ink

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240
color.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.079
The second ink pad is not harmed at all.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.390
The butterflies I'm using from the stamp set--there
are 3 sizes of butterflies.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.829
I'm using the 2 largest.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.880
I used the medium butterfly at the bottom
of the card, and now I'm using the larger

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.180
butterfly with some pink colors.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.539
I used a pale pink color, then now I'm using
a darker, more intense Raspberry.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.849
The thing that's really neat about using clear
stamps with this particular technique is that

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:02.719
you can see where the ink is coming in on
the outer edges of your stamp and you can

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.610
manipulate it and add a little bit more, or
make sure the ink is in the right spot.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.160
I'm pressing down this stamp--it's a very
large stamp so I'm pressing down the center

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.690
very well.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.500
Then I'll lift up and move onto the third
butterfly on this card.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.410
Im using some purple colors.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.520
I'm going to take the lighter purple and ink
up that same butterfly stamp that I used at

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.840
the bottom of the card.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.750
I of course cleaned it off before I did this.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.970
Inked it in the pale purple color, and now
I'll go into this darker purple color.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.510
Watch particularly how it shows on the stamp,
and you can really see where that ink is being

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.640
added to the stamp.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.470
I really love to use clear stamps for this
particular reason.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.020
Because I can absolutely see what is going
on.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.280
So I'll stamp that down.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.720
You'll notice that purple ink pad got quite
a bit of that purple ink on it, but all of

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.370
that ink came off the ink pad with no problem.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.550
I wanted to add some stamping over the top
of that teal butterfly, but I didn't want

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.460
it to disturb any of that teal ink, so I decided
to create a mask.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.790
I just stamped that butterfly in some black
ink on some Inkadinkado Stamping Mask Paper.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.480
I also ran my heat gun over this stamping
because I wanted to make sure it was completely

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.570
dry.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.010
Then I applied the mask over that butterfly,
and moved on to stamping the ABC border stamp

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.770
that comes in the stamp set.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.380
I'm using Simon Says Stamp Fog ink for this
because it's a very pale ink and it will sort

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.350
of recede into the background.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.290
It won't be as obvious as if I was using a
darker ink color.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.810
So I repeat-stamped that over and over to
create a little bit of a collage look down

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.430
at the bottom corner.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.800
Then I decided to work on my greeting area.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.220
Took my EK Success Powder Tool and prepped
some white cardstock and stamped the frame

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.870
from that stamp set.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.209
Coated it with gold embossing powder.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.850
And before I heat set this, I stamped the
greeting inside.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.520
I did it this way because I wanted to be able
to see where I was stamping, to make sure

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.090
I got that greeting inside the frame.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.239
After I had all the gold embossing powder
applied, I heat set that until it was completely

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.330
melted, and set it aside while I worked on
some additional stamping on top of the butterflies.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.240
I heat set that butterfly, and then I wanted
to test to make sure I wouldn't have any embossing

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.620
powder sticking.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.240
And it passed the test, so now I'm going to
move on by using my Powder Tool over the top

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.759
of that pink butterfly, and then I'm stamping
the large polka dot butterfly from the stamp

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.129
set, right over top of that pink.I'm going
to be layering some gold embossing powder

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:55.879
over the top, and it's going to give a really
fun, gold embossed look.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.639
So I'll use my heat tool to heat set this
until it's completely melted.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.280
You can see in the light that it creates a
really pretty gold, shiny color.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.669
I then took my label that I stamped earlier
and embossed, and trimmed that out very closely.Then

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.960
I applied a little bit of foam adhesive on
the back.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.360
Then using my tweezers and also just my fingers
to get it into the right place, I adhered

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.660
that down over the top of the smaller butterfly
at the bottom.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.479
And tied around some May Arts Natural Twine,
and added a bow off to the side.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.900
I then prepped my cardbase by scoring some
Bazzill Marshmallow cardstock at 5.5" to create

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.500
a top-folding card.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.460
All of the white cardstock on this card is
Bazzill Marshmallow, and I made sure to use

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.680
all the same cardstock so all of the whites
would match.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.259
So I pressed that stamped piece all the way
onto the card front.

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.290
And that is the finished card for today.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.009
Really simple and easy, only using one stamp
set, some ink, and some embossing powder,

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.180
and a little bit of twine.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.490
I hope you guys enjoyed today's video.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.770
