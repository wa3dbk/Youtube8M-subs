00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.029
Hello, this is XboxAhoy - and these are the
Weapons of Modern Warfare.

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:15.690
In this episode, we're taking a look at the
MP7.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.050
The MP7, or 'Maschinenpistole Sieben' is a
weapon that makes its debut appearance in

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.310
Modern Warfare 3.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.730
It's a German weapon, manufactured by Heckler
und Koch - and while designated as an SMG

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.730
in-game, can be better described in real-life
as a 'Personal Defence Weapon', or PDW.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.871
Personal Defence Weapons have largely displaced
the submachine gun and machine pistol in their

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:43.910
roles with rear echelon troops - with their
ability to better penetrate body armour, they

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.750
retain effectiveness where standard pistol
calibres might prove ineffective.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.150
They have has found a place in the hands of
special forces units, as well - replacing

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.059
weapons such as the M4 carbine on missions
that require manoeuvrable close-range power.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.800
The MP7 can trace its design roots to the
H&amp;K G36 - as both weapons share the same gas-operated

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.150
action.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.310
The short-stroke piston replaced H&amp;K's trademark
roller-delayed blowback system, as employed

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.020
in the G3 rifle, and MP5 submachine gun.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.200
H&amp;K's first attempt at a Personal Defence
Weapon was a modification of the MP5 - in

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.560
1991 the MP5K-PDW variant was announced, in
an attempt to fulfil a NATO requirements for

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.330
such a weapon.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.970
Lacking the ability to pierce body armour,
however, the MP5K-PDW saw limited success.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.890
The Belgian FN P90, introduced in the same
year as the MP5K-PDW, performed slightly better.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.770
Similar to the MP7, it uses a higher-velocity,
smaller calibre cartridge for effectiveness

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.630
against armoured targets - and an unusual
top-loading magazine configuration.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.970
Other Personal Defence Weapons include the
Russian PP-2000: chambered for 9mm Parabellum

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.840
rounds but taking advantage of specially-designed
ammunition;

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.700
The Knight's Armament Company PDW - which
is designed to be familiar to those trained

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.080
on the M4 platform;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.940
and the Magpul PDR: a futuristic compact bullpup
that fires NATO 5.56mm ammo and takes standard

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.940
mags.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.290
These weapons, including the MP7, all share
similar characteristics: their compact size,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.870
lightweight manoeuvrability and high-velocity
ammunition make them ideal close-quarter weapons.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.660
The MP7 entered production in 2001, introduced
alongside its proprietary cartridge: the HK

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.569
4.6x30mm.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.980
The bullet contains a steel core to aid with
penetration, and with a muzzle velocity of

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.420
over 700 metres per second - double the speed
of a 9mm round - it's not hard to see why

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.830
this custom cartridge performs so well against
armour.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.600
In addition to the MP7, the 4.6mm round was
planned to be used in the now-cancelled HK

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.270
UCP: A sidearm in the same vein as FN's Five-seveN
pistol, which uses the same cartridge as the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.209
P90.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.770
Magazines for the MP7 are of a standard box
type, contained within the pistol grip.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.930
They're available in both 20 and 40 round
capacities.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.709
Rate of fire is quite high, at 950 rounds
per minute - and paired with the lower recoil

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.460
of the smaller cartridge, automatic fire can
be quite effective.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.470
The MP7 weighs in at a mere 1.5 kilograms
when unloaded, and measures a diminutive 340

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.300
millimetres with the stock folded.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.340
Unfolded, the weapon extends to 540 millimetres
- a little over half a metre - and the barrel

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.910
itself is 180mm long.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.610
Since its introduction, the MP7 has been adopted
by many different agencies: including Austria's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.269
EKO Cobra, the German Army and GSG-9 units,
UK Police forces, and the United State's SEAL

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.409
Team Six: with whom the weapon was purportedly
used during the raid of Osama Bin Laden's

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.409
compound in 2011.

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:14.371
The MP7 in MW3 has earned a reputation as
a terrifyingly effective weapon, with its

00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:17.750
low recoil granting very effective performance.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.780
Just like its real-life counterpart, it's
lightweight with rapid handling characteristics:

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.780
and can dominate close-range engagements.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.190
It might be designed for Personal Defense:

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:36.340
but the MP7 is equally comfortable on offense.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.880
Thanks for watching, this has been XboxAhoy.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.040
Join me for the next instalment of The Weapons
of Modern Warfare, when I'll be covering two

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.389
variants of the same platform: an assault
rifle, and light support weapon.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.020
Until then - farewell.
