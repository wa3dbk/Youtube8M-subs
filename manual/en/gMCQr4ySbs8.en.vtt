00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.080
This microwave listens to popcorn popping
to perfectly cook popcorn every time.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.130
And the Iowa Storm Chasing Network recently
unveiled a 10,000 pound armored van specifically

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.040
designed to get closer than ever to tornados.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.040
Vsauce!

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.499
Kevin here.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.660
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.039
The Sulon Cortex Headset hopes to merge the
real world with virtual reality.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.980
The idea is to overlay a virtual environment
on your physical surroundings.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.040
It works using a head position tracker and
a game controller tracker along with a sensor

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.620
package that maps the world around you.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.789
Basically turning the real world into a video
game.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.969
Developer kits are available for pre-order
right now.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.530
Neuroscape Lab created a real-time 3D visualization
of the human brain.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.359
The colors represent source power and connectivity
and the estimated information transfer can

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.400
be seen as pulses of light moving along the
fiber tracts connecting the regions of the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.400
brain.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.250
And you can even fly through the brain activity
of someone wearing an EEG cap using a gamepad.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.360
Space Generator is a room concept that allows
you to create any type of room you can imagine.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.360
Winner of the 2013 Red Dot concept award - the
pre-programmed module cells can be raised

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.329
or lowered to transform the once flat platform
into any number of 3D arrangements - creating

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:31.530
the space for a fashion show, a theater or
any kind of or a game installation like a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.530
maze.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.700
Facebook's facial recognition technology is
nearly as accurate at recognizing faces as

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.700
you are.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.520
Their research project titled DeepFace can
look at two photos and regardless of the angle

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.729
or lighting tell with 97.25% accuracy whether
they contain the same face - something humans

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.110
can do at 97.53%.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.420
This new technology is not currently used
on the Facebook website but ostensibly could

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.359
eventually be used to link every photo of
you online to your Facebook account.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.099
Audi's traffic light recognition system counts
down the time remaining until a red light

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.150
turns green.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.630
It works by reading the automated signals
from the city's central traffic computer and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.269
sending that data to the driver - it will
also let you know if you can make it through

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.010
a green light or if you should start braking.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.430
But there's no current date for when this
will be available in the U.S.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.260
A new study shows that forgetting is actually
an active process - specifically that a protein

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.820
called Musashi is necessary for memory-loss
- hopefully this research can someday lead

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.349
to treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.580
This 360 degree Milky Way panorama from NASA
features two and a half million snapshots

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.200
taken over a decade and stitched together
for the first time.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.659
Find the link below to explore this monumental
space image.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.629
Tidy Dog hopes to train your dog to put away
its toys.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.319
It uses sensors to detect the weight of a
toy when the dog puts it back in the bin - and

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.000
then dispenses a treat.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.220
Rewarding your pooch for cleaning up.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.230
Finally, Firefight Films created Bigger Than
Life - Ice Caves - which is the first documented

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:20.129
drone flight through ice caves.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:31.540
I'm gonna leave you with a robot that learns
by imitating a human and then performs that

00:03:31.540 --> 00:04:13.730
task better than the human - and as always
thanks for watching.
