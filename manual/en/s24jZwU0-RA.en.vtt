00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.430 position:98%
LESTER HOLT, Anchor: The U.S. Speed Skating team has two best hopes

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.000 position:98%
against a powerful South Korean team that took three of a possible four golds

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.370 position:97%
in Torino--Apolo Ohno and J.R. Celski, an 18-year old world champion

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.430
in his first Olympics.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.000 position:72%
Speed Skating is all about force and movement,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.230 position:98%
what in physics are known as Newton's First Three Laws of Motion.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.570 position:95%
Celski and George Tuthill, a physicist funded by the National

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.530
Science Foundation, explain.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.370
[natural sounds]

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.270 position:97%
HOLT: It is the fastest self-propelled sport in the winter Olympics ... Speed skating.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.630 position:97%
J.R. CELSKI, U.S. Speed Skating Team - Short Track: When we're at full speeds,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.970 position:95%
we're up at speeds of, I don't know, 35 or 45 miles per hour.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.600 position:97%
It's pretty crazy for us to be going that fast--to be able to keep the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.970 position:98%
speed and to be able to pass and maneuver around other people at the same time.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.030 position:98%
HOLT: Which is what makes short track speed skating part sprint

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.500
on ice, part demolition derby.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.270 position:81%
CELSKI: In this sport, if you do bump into somebody,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.800 position:61%
you're more likely to get disqualified.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.930 position:97%
HOLT: To win the race, a short track skater has to follow the rules of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.200 position:97%
the sport--and the laws of physics: Newton's First Three Laws of Motion.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.730
Starting ... with the start.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.030 position:95%
GEORGE TUTHILL, Plymouth State University: When the skater is

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.200 position:73%
poised at the start, coiled up and ready to go,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.630 position:83%
that skater is at rest; there is no tendency to move.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.000 position:97%
Newton's first law tells us that an object at rest will remain at rest

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000 position:56%
unless there's a force acting on it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.570 position:95%
HOLT: J.R. Celski is a U.S. Olympic short track speed skater.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.400 position:98%
CELSKI: What we do is dig our front foot in with the tip of our skate

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.630 position:75%
and plant the back foot in with the whole blade.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.730 position:75%
TUTHILL: The skater sets the blade into the ice,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:12.400 position:97%
leans over, digs in his skate, pushes straight back and accelerates forward.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.630 position:70%
HOLT: Which brings us to Newton's Second Law.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.230 position:97%
TUTHILL: Newton's Second Law of Motion says that when a force acts

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.230 position:91%
on an object, it produces an acceleration of that object--

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.130
it changes the object's motion.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.700
Right there.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.770 position:97%
Second law of motion--a force on an object produces an acceleration.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.100 position:97%
HOLT: The greater his mass--that's the sum of all matter in his body

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.600 position:97%
and equipment--the more force Celski must generate to accelerate

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.230
down the track.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.100 position:83%
HOLT: And Newton's Third Law explains how that works.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.370 position:97%
TUTHILL: The third law of motion is sometimes stated as "for every

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.470 position:97%
action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." So if the skater

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.400 position:73%
pushes on the ice, exerting a force on the ice,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.500 position:97%
then the ice pushes on the skater, exerting a force on the skater.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.430 position:98%
The harder he pushes, the more rapidly he'll accelerate down the track.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.970 position:56%
HOLT: Like a sprinter off the block.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.900 position:73%
CELSKI: You know, it's more like a track start.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.100 position:98%
We basically take, four or five steps just planting our feet solid,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.670 position:63%
solid, solid and it's just like running.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.000 position:73%
Expect we've got these long blades on our feet.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.400 position:98%
HOLT: Propelling the skater faster and faster, straight down the ice.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.070 position:81%
HOLT: And according to Newton's First Law of Motion,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.270 position:98%
Celski--an object in motion--will tend to stay in motion--will keep

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.330 position:97%
moving in a straight line unless some forces move him in another

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.300
direction--say, around a turn.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.470 position:95%
TUTHILL: That force comes from the skater pushing on the ice,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.700 position:97%
to the outside of the turn, so that the ice can push the skater to

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.370
the inside of the turn.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.170
HOLT: Turns are tight.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.600 position:97%
CELSKI: We're doing a complete 180-degree turn around a radius

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.570
that's really sharp.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.030 position:98%
HOLT: To make tight turns, short track skaters push on the ice so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.330 position:98%
hard their blade edges "bite" into it ... etching tiny trenches for the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.870 position:59%
blade edge to ride in around the turn,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.570 position:97%
so it doesn't slip and skid across the slick track surface ...

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.430
which usually works.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.470 position:61%
HOLT: The winner of a short track race?

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.430 position:97%
The skater who makes best use of all three Laws of Motion to cross

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.270
the finish line first.
