We're back with Expert Village. Now, the preparation
and the beginning and of the journey and the

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:14.980
mission of the proper sofrito. This is it.
Right here as you see, we have a red pepper,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:30.810
green pepper, chilies, more chilies, and cilantro.
This is the heart of our food. This is what

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.239
makes our rice different and more unique.
I got to brag a little bit about our rice,

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.620
arroz con gandules, because you know it's
my culture. First of all, you need the olive

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.170
oil. You need a blender and of course, you
need electricity and a fan blowing behind

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:02.129
you works great. Here we go. The first process
is you need to rinse off the vegetables.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.050
Now, the good thing about these things. Feel
them out, make sure they're nice and strong

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.490
and healthy. You don't want weak wimpy ones
with black little dots on them because they're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.940
not going to be nice and spicy. You're going
to take it, you're going to cut it right down

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.690
the middle. You're going to see a wonderful
world of seeds in there. You see that. That's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.770
good now. Don't be startled, but we don't
want to eat those things. We want to rinse

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.380
them off. You can rinse it right underneath
the sink. They actually all pop right out.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.170
Drop it to the other side. Now, at this point
you can just rip them. There goes the green

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.410
peppers. Take them, I'm going to put them
right here with my cilantro. Rinse it off,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:51.740
get all those seeds out of there, put them
right in there. Red pepper; same procedure.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:01.460
Give it a rinse, give it a feel and a little
smell. So good. As you see in the inside,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.909
you also have the little seeds. Just go ahead
and rinse those right out. I really like red

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.870
peppers. Good thing about red peppers and
about me is you can just a little bite out

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.449
of them.
