How to make Polish pickles. 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.110
We warmly welcome in my state 
channel video experience. 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.410
Is already high time for ensiling 
cucumbers.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.620
Ogóry cucumbers Kish has more than 40 years 
very rarely happened to be badly 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.100
zakiśiły. 
As it happened this cause were bad 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.550
cucumbers 
not my way of pickling. 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.520
For pickling 15 kg 
cucumbers 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.200
ground-rather need to use 
small cucumbers. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.390
Also needed are three large bundles 
fennel-well opłukanego sand 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.890
cut the roots. 
Four large head of garlic and about 500 g 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.230
eluted peeled root 
horseradish-you can also use extra leaves 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.090
horseradish-grapes. 
Approximately 20 g of salt per 1 kg of cucumbers. 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:57.640
A little bit of whole grain mustard and 
coriander flavor-only. 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.340
And a good 15 liters of water which is well 
is a boil on the brine. 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:07.090
Washed peeled horseradish is good 
divided into smaller parts, such as. 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.080
shred the slices. 
It will be more efficient and we will better it 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.150
decompose. 
Fennel washed divide, cut into about 5 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.600
cm 
pieces to be able to be divided 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.070
put 
jars. 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.090
When slicing fennel should be very 
uważać- 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.840
fennel stalks are quite hard and we 
use 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.170
greater force to crush them. 
NOTE TO FINGERS. 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:46.880
Peel the garlic and shredded 
add one jar one clove 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.470
garlic. 
We are preparing a little coriander and mustard. 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:08.140
Up to 5 liters of boiling water poured 5 
large spoons of salt. 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.860
Water must be salt-salt salt is not 
equal-need 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.870
the brine try-to be salty but not too 
salty. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.970
Ready cucumbers should be sour and salty 
not salty. 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.210
Boiling salt water will flood 
cucumbers. 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.960
Components for the best in the world 
Polish cucumbers 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.930
pickled we got ready. 
Again washed-rinsed cucumbers 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.750
groundwater, 
sliced ​​dill washed, peeled washed 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.300
horseradish 
shredded-shredded, peeled 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:49.550
crushed garlic, whole grains 
coriander and mustard white or black. 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.230
It would be good to get ready a pot of 
spout is turned 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:05.710
pouring pickle jars, 
sealed jars with lids-tightness 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.520
check poured into jars a little 
water and twisted we turn up 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.270
bottom as the water does not flow like a well-
doing it replace the cap or jar. 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.760
We are preparing jars-to the bottom of each we 
after half allocated to one jar 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.200
spices-garlic 
, coriander, horseradish, dill, mustard. 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:50.170
Arrange cucumbers closely to the most 
entered into a jar. 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:04:26.060
On top, add the rest of the 
allocated allowances 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:36.160
przypraw.Zalewamy hot marinade-to 
full-cucumbers must be 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:56.520
covered-immersed completely in the flood. 
Turn off and leave them until they are 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:15.710
work 
kisić for about one week as heat or 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:32.030
when the temperature is reduced 
we need 2 weeks. 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:40.280
After this date, it is advisable to 
are closed after the zalewą

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.950
period in a cool dark dry place. 
That is why it is good to kisić in a barrel because 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.120
we have the ability to charge cucumbers grille 
not flowed. 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.820
As initially ukiszone we can eat them 
a little salt-and later are by me 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.150
Polish pickled cucumbers best. 
Ensiling-lactic acid preserves not 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.980
Therefore, the salt-
Do not overdo the salt-pickled May 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.650
be fermented salty not salty. 
For these components is 22 jars of 0.9 l 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.740
and one barrel of 5 l of good 
homemade Polish pickled cucumbers. 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.110
The cost of buying the components was 50 zł. 
We can easily calculate how much it costs us 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.320
1 kg 
our good pickled cucumbers. 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:22.270
Homemade pickled cucumbers best Polish 
anywhere else in the world do not state their 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.400
