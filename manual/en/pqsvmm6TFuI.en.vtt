00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.020
Tinea corporis is a superficial fungal infection
of the arms and legs, especially on glabrous

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.650
skin; however, it may occur on any part of
the body.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.391
Signs and symptoms
It may have a variety of appearances; most

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:21.300
easily identifiable are the enlarging raised
red rings with a central area of clearing.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.140
The same appearances of ringworm may also
occur on the scalp, beard area or the groin.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.380
Other classic features of tinea corporis include:
The edge of the rash appears elevated and

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.890
is scaly to touch.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.540
Sometimes the skin surrounding the rash may
be dry and flaky.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.270
Almost invariably, there will be hair loss
in areas of the infection.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.560
Causes
Tinea corporis is caused by a tiny fungus

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.780
known as dermatophyte.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.230
These tiny organisms normally live on the
superficial skin surface, and when the opportunity

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.790
is right, they can induce a rash or infection.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.420
The disease can also be acquired by person-to-person
transfer usually via direct skin contact with

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.800
an infected individual.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.340
Animal-to-human transmission is also common.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.280
Ringworm commonly occurs on pets and the fungus
can be acquired while petting or grooming

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.070
an animal.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.360
Ringworm can also be acquired from other animals
such as horses, pigs, ferrets and cows.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.730
The fungus can also be spread by touching
inanimate objects like personal care products,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:34.060
bed linen, combs, athletic gear, or hair brushes
contaminated by an affected person.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.090
Individuals at high risk of acquiring ringworm
include those who:

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.740
Live in crowded, humid conditions.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.800
Sweat excessively, as sweat can produce a
humid wet environment where the pathogenic

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.540
fungi can thrive.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.479
This is most common in the armpits, groin
creases and skin folds of the abdomen.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.860
Participate in close contact sports like soccer,
rugby, or wrestling.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.330
Wear tight, constrictive clothing with poor
aeration.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.380
Have a weakened immune system.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.410
Diagnosis
Superficial scraps of skin examined underneath

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.040
a microscope may reveal the presence of a
fungus.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.069
If the skin scrapings are negative and a fungus
is still suspected, the scrapings are sent

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.450
for culture.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.840
Because the fungus grows slowly, the culture
results do take several days to become positive.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.980
Other methods of diagnosis include potassium
hydroxide tests.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.240
Prevention
Because fungi prefer warm, moist environments,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.670
preventing ringworm involves keeping skin
dry and avoiding contact with infectious material.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.430
Basic prevention measures include:
Washing hands after handling animals, soil,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.040
and plants.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.900
Avoiding touching characteristic lesions on
other people.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.250
Wearing loose-fitting clothing.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.180
Practicing good hygiene when participation
in sports involves physical contact with other

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.920
people.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.180
Treatment
Most cases are treated by application of topical

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.590
antifungal creams to the skin, but in extensive
or difficult to treat cases systemic treatment

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.910
with oral medication may be required.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.280
The evidence is best for terbinafine and naftifine
but other agents may also work.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.150
Topical antifungals are applied to the lesion
twice a day for at least 3 weeks.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.670
The lesion usually resolves within 2 weeks,
but therapy should be continued for another

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.550
week to ensure the fungus is completely eradicated.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.510
If there are several ringworm lesions, the
lesions are extensive, complications such

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.540
as secondary infection exist, or the patient
is immunocompromised, oral antifungal medications

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.230
can be used.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.960
Oral medications are taken once a day for
7 days and result in higher clinical cure

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.280
rates.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.990
The antifungal medications most commonly used
are itraconazole and terbinafine.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.519
The benefits of the use of topical steroids
in addition to an antifungal is unclear.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.660
There might be a greater cure rate but no
guidelines currently recommend its addition.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.160
The effect of Whitfield's ointment is also
unclear.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.940
Prognosis
Tinea corporis is moderately contagious and

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.269
can affect both humans and pets.

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.370
If a person acquires it, the proper measures
must be taken to prevent it from spreading.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.740
Young children in particular should be educated
about the infection and preventive measures:

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.900
avoid skin to skin contact with infected persons
and animals, wear clothing that allows the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.229
skin to breath, and don't share towels, clothing
or combs with others.

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.289
If pets are kept in the household or premises,
they should get the animal checked for tinea,

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.800
especially if hair loss in patches is noticed
or the pet is scratching excessively.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.300
The majority of people who have acquired tinea
know how uncomfortable the infection can be.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.090
However, the fungus can easily be treated
and prevented in individuals with a healthy

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.009
immune system.

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.800
Society and culture
When the dermatophytic infection presents

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.360
in wrestlers, with skin lesions typically
found on the head, neck, and arms it is sometimes

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.599
called tinea corporis gladiatorum.
