00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
When teaching a bird to follow a target,
it's best to be careful.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
A tame bird will probably touch the target
when you'll bring it in front of it.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:50.000
But if there's any chance that the bird is scared of target,
try get the bird to come to target.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's see how it works here...

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Bird was slightly scared of it so I don't want
to force the issue on her.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And lets repeat this couple of times.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And a bit more distance...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
When bird understands what it needs to do
the clicker is unnecessary.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now you can easily increase the distance.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Bird follows the target.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We want to teach that bird touches the pearl.
This why I don't reinforce grapping of the stick itself.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This won't get reinforced,
only touching the pearl will.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Start by offering treats from your fingers and keep rest 
of your fist closed. Repeat couple of times.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
This way bird learns that it can find treats from your hand.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
After this, hide the treat inside your fist and
offer it when bird gets close.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It shouldn't take long untill bird follows the fist since
it knows it gets treats from it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Again, increase distance slowly.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Bird follows the fist even though it can't see the treat.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
When moving your fist around, be careful not to scare the bird.
