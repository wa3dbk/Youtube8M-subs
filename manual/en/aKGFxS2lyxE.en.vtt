00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.990
Hey what's up everybody?!

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.110
This is Allison from WorldTravelerHD.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.080
A lightweight northface rain jacket; a zip-up
hoddie- standard weight, kind of like one

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.250
of those American Apparel ones; a long sleeve
t-shirt; and a cardigan.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:23.369
So if I didn't buy the compression cube, this
would be the size that I would be putting

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.390
into my pack.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.909
I wanted the compression cube because I want
less volume in my backpack.

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.220
The weight is obviously going to be the same.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.320
So let's zip it up and see what it looks like!

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.010
This is much much smaller volume, very compressed,
as compared with the expanded version- so

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.320
I'm loving this cube size!

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.450
To show you what they look like in a day pack,
I've got my Surge II out here by North Face.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.620
That's great.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.590
Let's try out the half cube.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.730
Ok!

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.210
I have 5 t-shirts I am just hoping go in here.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.710
So I have no idea.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.200
I would say that's a perfect size for 5 tshirts.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.899
If you're male and watching this, female clothes
are a little bit smaller than male clothes

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:30.860
but I'm almost 6 feet tall so by no means
are my clothes little tiny, petite, like,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.680
someone more petite than I. I wouldn't even
think of that as a concern.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.719
But compressed down, Whoo!

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.420
That wasn't even very challenging to zip it
up.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.859
A lot easier than the other one.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.219
Just, I think because I have extra space in
this.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:53.710
If you are planning, let's say a backpacking
trip through Europe or Campervanning New Zealand

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.310
or Around the World Trip coming up: I have
four long sleeve items, including a rain jacket

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.659
and a light weight fleece and 5 tshirts in
here.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.659
I've kind of been thinking how am I going
to bring all of this stuff?

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.819
Now after putting my items in here I can't
imagine not having these.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.840
Cuz this is going to be so easy to pull in
and out of my backpack.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.530
I can pop another half-cube right here with,
let's say, pants and shorts and then I would

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.180
have maybe a - I would purchase a quarter
cube or something to throw in here of socks

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.510
and underwear.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.120
And, you could really have all of your clothes
here in this day pack if you weren't carrying

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.340
around other items.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.140
So for one last comparison, why don't I see
what this volume of clothes looks like unzipped

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.329
and expanded; unzipped and expanded.

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.989
I don't think I could put another packing
cube in here like I thought I could with the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:55.989
compressed version.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.739
The cube took up a little more space.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.629
That means that I can't put the half cube
like I thought I was going to.

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.420
So that's fine, the weight's the same, maybe
you wouldn't want to carry anything more anyways

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.420
just because of the weight.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.310
A few tshirts, you know, isn't too heavy.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.879
But, if you did want more space, go with the
compression cube because even though I have

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.719
everything nicely in here, just that small
amount of space is going to take one more

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.239
half cube out of my bag.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.879
They are a little bit pricier than the non-compression
set, but if you're spending the money to get

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.670
packing cubes anyways, just from seeing the
difference between the non-compressed versus

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.819
the compressed version, I would definitely
spend the extra money to get this.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.140
Thanks for watching, see ya next time.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.079
I could even use this as a pillow once its
filled up!
