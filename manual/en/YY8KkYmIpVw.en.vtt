In this video i’ll talk about my unexpected
wonderful experience in Cesme, Turkey – the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.139
windiest sea coasts I’ve been to so far.
No wonder it’s famous for kite surfing and

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.820
other water sports! Cesme, which is “fountain”
in English is situated on the west coast of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.279
Turkey at the Aegean Sea and it’s actually
linked by Izmir through a highway for about

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.279
70-80 kilometers.
First stop, a few of Cesme’s Beaches.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.500
Fun Beach Club. You’ll see a lot of affordable
beach clubs in Cesme, this is one of them,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.050
where I enjoyed spending a whole day here.
The water is crystal clear and shallow, they

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.140
have plenty of sunbeds for everyone, and these
sheltered areas where you can enjoy a little

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.330
more privacy. The sand is velvet soft and
the whole feeling is relaxing and spacious.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:03.330
You pay an entrance fee of about 13 euro and
you have a sunbed and a drink included. Also,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.609
there are other areas, where you can sit on
these huge pillows on the grass, all day long.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:16.390
Loved these. There are areas with music, so
you can choose which suits you the best: more

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.439
music, or more silence. If you arrive in the
morning, you’ll have the whole beach to

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.859
yourself! It gets more crowded in the afternoon.
They have good food so ... there’s no need

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.429
to bring your own snack. It’s called Fun
Beach because obviously they have some water

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.990
sports going on, if you choose to entertain
yourself.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.100
Very close to Fun Beach, there’s a new beach,
whose name was uncertain to me and still is.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.159
It was just being arranged when we visited
it in 2014. It seems that it doesn't appear

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.369
in Google Earth either, so I’ll just call
it New Beach. Here I was charmed the loungy

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.369
music and the fact that it was quiet. Same
clear water and smooth sand, but I enjoyed

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:07.219
the fact that this beach wasn't so popular.
You also pay a small fee to spend a day here

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:14.219
but I thought it was worth it.
Check this name out: Kocakari Beach – not

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.110
sure of the pronunciation.This public beach
has no entrance fee and no sunbeds. It was

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.879
the beach near our accomodation, with charming
colors of the water and few people. We couldn’t

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.659
stay here because of the wind in that day,
but it seemed a cool little bay to spend your

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.420
day.
Cesme is also known for the very private beach

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.239
clubs like these ones Marrakech and Papparazzi.
I tried to take some pictures but guess what??

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.730
I was told to put down the camera. These are
rather expensive and private … My guess

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.730
is that it’s more for stars and rich people.
But Cesme also has some public beaches like

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.079
this one, called Ilica Beach. I didn’t want
to spend a day here, I don’t know, it just

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:14.079
wasn’t my thing, I think you can discover
nicer beaches in Cesme.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.290
The thing that made my jars fall was the Cesme
Marina, a new generation marina – recently

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.469
built with such a taste that you almost can’t
believe you’re in Turkey. You’ll see luxury

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:47.209
boats, luxury restaurants, a lot of flowers,
interesting building design, everything is

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.140
perfect. Don’t imagine that the whole area
is expensive, it seemed even cheaper than

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.140
Marmaris or Bodrum to me. I especially have
to mention these guys, where we enjoyed really

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.660
good sweet deserts. Amazing atmosphere in
the evening here in Cesme Marina, so it is

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.210
a must see in Cesme!
There is also another Marina in Dalyan, a

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.550
district at north of Cesme which is nice and
not so crowded. A lot of fish restaurants

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.500
of course like everywhere in coastal Turkey.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.500
But here, on one of the small streets near

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.580
Dalyan Marian, we found one restaurant where
we ate great fish for a ridiculously low price.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:52.199
It’s called Simge Balikcilik (Balik is fish
in Turkish). Great service, excellent fish,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:02.180
super cheap price. Loved it.
Here are some unexpected things I saw in Cesme:

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.139
Insanely beautiful kids – I just couldn’t
keep staring at this sweet blond child.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.199
Squeezed lemon along with vinegar and olive
oil at the restaurant.

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:24.600
A tree like this in the middle of nowhere.
Accomodation with such a magnificent view.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.400
Flowers ... all over the place.
This guy has a fishtank instead of a fence

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:45.430
for this villa. You can actually buy fish
from here, go home and cook it.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:52.650
A lot of cats!

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:58.600
A happy birtday cookie as a welcome present

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:05.699
at our accomodation.
A mermaid?!?

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:13.539
And an unicorn??

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.500
And… Another funky tree.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:28.530
A stone made painting. Actually it's not a
painting but it looks like one.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.680
A very very old abandoned boat.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.680
Cats and ducks living together hassle free.

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:48.159
Some fishy paintings near the water.
A huuuuuge amount of wind all over Cesme.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.270
These car wheel blockers if you go in the
opposite way on a one way street.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:02.930
Turkey flags all over the place.
These people actually park their private boats

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.710
inside their yards … imagine that…
These pretty stairs.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.860
I realize it’s pretty hard to tell you how
much I loved Cesme, you just got to go there

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.990
and experience it for yourself…
