00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.216
So, we are at Bell Ridge Wildlife and Environmental Area

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.408
and we are capturing primarily Florida mice.

00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:17.429
We have been looking at this property for almost two years now,

00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:19.133
pre- and post-burn.

00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:22.948
It's on a two-year burn rotation, and the purpose of capturing the mice

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.678
is looking at population and movement response, pre- and post-burn.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.150
We check to see whether it's a Florida mouse.

00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:35.711
Out here you might also have oldfield mice, we have cotton rats occasionally

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:37.311
and we also have harvest mice.

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:39.431
So, we identify it first,

00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:41.506
we tag everything with unique ear tags

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:43.621
so that we can tell when we capture it again,

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:47.516
we look for gender and whether or not its reproductively active.

00:00:47.563 --> 00:00:49.089
We get the age on the animal.

00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:52.761
(Assistant:) We've got a female. (Melissa:) Actually, it is a female.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.933
We are trapping at gopher tortoise burrows,

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:56.896
which is a little different than some small mammal trapping,

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.320
where you would just trap straight grids or transect lines.

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.494
So, we're trapping at gopher tortoise burrows,

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:04.803
and we make sure there are no fire ants that are there. If we find fire ants,

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:08.649
we move the traps away from that particular gopher tortoise burrow.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.316
And when we take them out of the field during the day, we put them up in a tree,

00:01:12.358 --> 00:01:14.731
so that the fire ants don't get to them.

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.851
We also never bait with anything but seed.

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.550
Sometimes people want to bait small mammal traps

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.103
with things like raisins, fruit, peanut butter.

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:24.676
We never use that in Florida because of the fire ant danger.

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:28.610
The fire ants are pervasive enough that they can kill the mouse.

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:31.421
And if we have a mouse mortality related to fire ants,

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:33.758
we pull the traps and we do not trap that station anymore.

00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:38.748
Here's your trap. And we would put seeds in and bedding,

00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:43.341
because it's cool for the mouse. So we put the seeds and the bedding in.

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.476
And then we have to make sure that the trap closes fairly easily.

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:50.863
So, the mouse is going to run in here, and there's a plate at the back

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:54.899
that when the mouse steps on it, causes the door to close.

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:57.909
Try to keep it flat on the front,

00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:00.793
because the mice don't necessarily like to go up over a seal.

00:02:00.838 --> 00:02:01.843
And this is actually...

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:06.718
we put cover over it, to make sure it stays shaded in case the sun comes out.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.531
We don't want it to get hot on any of the individual boxes,

00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:12.821
so it keeps it a little shaded.

00:02:12.864 --> 00:02:15.308
The burrow is where the Florida mouse lives.

00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.223
They are not able to burrow from the surface particularly well,

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:21.300
so they go inside of another animal's burrow to burrow.

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:25.653
And so, gopher tortoises are the primary species that they are commensal with.

00:02:25.696 --> 00:02:28.533
They will use an armadillo burrow or some other hole.

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:30.056
Florida mice make chimneys.

00:02:30.098 --> 00:02:33.066
So, sometimes instead of going in the opening of the gopher tortoise hole,

00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:35.466
they'll actually move away, and there'll be a little hole,

00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:40.266
not with a fan or anything. It's very nondescript. So, just a little hole,

00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:42.136
and they'll go down that, and it's an escape chimney,

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:45.244
so that if a snake or something comes in, they can go out.

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:50.016
(Biologist:) So, she's reproductive? (Melissa:) Yeah, she is.

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.753
(Assistant:) OK, little girly-girl. You're almost done, cute, little girly-girl.

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:58.456
She is 35 and a half.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.643
If our management is such that they don't have the seeds they need,

00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:05.211
they don't have the ground cover they need,

00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:08.986
even though they don't technically qualify for listing anymore,

00:03:09.028 --> 00:03:11.901
there's the concern that we would need to relist in the future,

00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.481
because of the management or the lack of management of good sandhill habitat.
