00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.870
The Hand-Look Quilt Stitch is a manipulated
stitch.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.660
Now, I'm going to show you how this really
works.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.410
They've added it to machines but people always
wonder, "Well, how does it really work?"

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.630
Stitch number 77 looks like little stitches
that are dashed.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.690
This is going to make it look like you are
sewing by hand but you are doing it on the

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.690
machine.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.010
First off, start off with some batting sandwiched
between two pieces of fabric.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.980
The thread that you want it to look like you're
stitching with is in your bobbin.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:39.500
This is the color that I have wound on my
bobbin and I have clear thread in my needle.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.710
There is a variety of variations that sometimes
work and sometimes don't.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.090
It does find that some, not all threads in
your bobbin work and not all battings work.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.800
It is a manipulated stitch and you will have
to kind of work with it to find what works

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
for you.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Next, we do tighten our top tension.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.730
I'm going to take it all the way up to eight
or nine just to get me into the ballpark.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.360
I'm going to start this stitch because this
stitch has a sequence.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.430
Also too, it doesn't look like it does anything
for the first couple of stitches, but it has

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.750
kind of a little bit of a delay.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.009
What it does is it takes a stitch forward
and a stitch back, but when it comes backwards,

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.250
it's dragging the bobbin thread up.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.619
That's the color that you want it to do and
then it kind of tacks it in place.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.220
Then stitches forward leaving a little blank.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.990
Well this stitch forward, where it's emptied
is where the clear thread is stitching but

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.320
you just can't see it on most fabrics.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.740
Now, as you start to work around, another
thing too is using a walking foot with this

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.310
stitch works beautifully because then your
fabrics don't move around, but just for today,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.619
I am going to have the open toe foot so if
you're stitching or you're following a line,

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.900
you could go ahead and do that.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.060
If you're turning a corner though, you do
have to find where in the sequence would be

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.810
the best place to turn a corner.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.420
I'll stop with my needle down and then turn.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.409
You can start to see how pretty that stitching
is.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.539
Now, on the back it is going to look like
a solid line of stitching and so it is going

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.970
to show you that you're not really doing it
by hand, but boy, for a quick look, and you

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.060
know those projects that just have that primitive
look that you wanted to have that hand-look

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.780
to it, this is great.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.680
You can also adjust the stitch length should
you wish to make that longer or shorter.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.120
Where you want to turn is when the stitch
comes forward after it's dragged the bobbin

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.290
thread up or right before it starts one more
stitch.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.409
You kind of have to get the rhythm of the
stitch and then you'll know where to do your

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.409
turning.

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.180
If it's not pulling up as much, go ahead and
just crank your tension up a little bit more,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.390
which I am going to do here.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.550
Yes.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.110
It pulls it up just a little bit further and
then you can go ahead and stitch.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.560
Usually, once I get going, I will stitch full
speed.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.580
When you have good quality clear thread, and
your needle's correct, you really don't have

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.239
to take any extra precautions for stitching
slow or anything, but that's what it will

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.160
look like on the front and then this will
be what it looks like on the back.
