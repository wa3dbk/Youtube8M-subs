00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.260
an study conducted by the project on a
government oversight found that big

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.510
government actually ways a substantial
amount of money on private contractors

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.200
the fact that someone had to do a study
on this is beyond me and surprised me

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.840
actually

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.910
this is a prize to you ok well it turns
out that last year the heritage

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.960
foundation

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.859
unreal released a report by the same day
by its report that says that federal

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.240
employees

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.160
uh... make too much money and if we just
replace them with private contractors

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.560
and the federal government can save a
significant amount of money

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.350
weld incomes that project on government
oversight and they said no that is not

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
the case in fact the cases the civic
examples in the report

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.390
stamina and tell you guys are right now
so they looked computer engineering

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.129
services and they found that the
government pays a private contractor

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.559
two hundred seventy thousand dollars per
year for that work uh... by a federal

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.239
employees would make one hundred thirty
six thousand five hundred dollars a year

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.150
which is significantly less

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.059
uh... and when you have been

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.879
yet when it comes to human resources
management

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.489
it private contractor would make two
hundred twenty eight thousand five

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.119
hundred per year but a federal employees
would make only one hundred eleven

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.800
or one hundred eleven thousand

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.110
one hundred eleven

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.980
thousand seven hundred per year

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.260
fifth he got off to her that agree that
you knew specifically that the other

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.160
linda

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.680
has seven percent in nineteen eighty we
have an abortion case

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.830
yeah i mean uh...

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.010
usually people in this were more insist
this idea but they've

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.110
pinched america on this idea

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.090
that government is broken and doesn't
work

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.869
at the federal government to break that
no matter what

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.530
enough to get smaller anything get
smaller that's good for you to that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.410
works for you that helps you in it does
it

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.450
it doesn't

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.549
obviously we've arab major reforms that
we can do major areas of cost cutting

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.719
all kinds of things in the brady law
states

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.499
but this automatic ideas private-sector
handle things better is crazy again the

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:57.590
military

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.500
tunstall dad with the brown decision
should start and then there

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.370
we have a great is that no there in the
world some of my private contractors we

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.520
pay for

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.470
analyze data that you guys paper that
they knew about her the government does

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.879
the sources here at the government does
things

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.140
major appliance someone knew each other

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.760
i don't wanna privatizing we don't need
to privatize everything and and and and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.299
these arguments doesn't it's it turns
out it's not true it cost more money

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.309
pain these contractors doesn't save
money right and to keep in mind you see

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.659
time and time again these private
contractors are lobbying

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.109
to the government so they can get more
and more our jobs in terms of our

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.080
defense

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.220
in terms of enforcing the war on drugs

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.070
i mean private contractors makes so much
money and in fact the fact that the fact

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.399
that week incentivize

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:49.860
everything that they do

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.010
he'd makes this drug war continue it
makes the wars in afghanistan iraq ankit

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.450
continue it's neverending your study
near though by should point out where i

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.409
think it what i suspect that carolyn
would be if that doesn't include like

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.150
the government healthcare for these
workers which i think this incredible

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.799
expense

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.509
writes why don't you do say that
heritage foundation says that this is

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.939
comparing apples and oranges because of
federal employees wouldn't work for a

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.059
short period of time they're not just a
contractor they work for an extended

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:19.709
period of time and they also get
benefits and everything like that

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.070
but it turns out these private
contractors

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.719
actually get employed for years on end

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.950
so and they get paid significantly more
self

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.739
by the way the defense department uh...
lobbying aggressively very hard right

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.529
now that we don't have any cuts to the
defense budget cuts are minimal because

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.669
they're claiming the course that that's
part of it

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.049
they creature

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.199
it's freakin unbearable we spends too
much money on defense and the reason i

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.989
was saying too much money on defense is
because we keep employees in private

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:47.969
contractors
