00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:11.766
Tonight's program
is a symphonic journey,

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:14.302
touching down
in seven different countries,

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.637
and with the help of
video and music,

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:19.807
we'll gain an appreciation
for how 19th-century Europe

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:22.777
helped shape the beautiful world
that we live in today.

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:27.014
The theme of the concert is
romanticism and nationalism.

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:29.541
Nearly all the music
we'll hear today

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:31.910
is from about the same
generation,

00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:34.813
from the late 1800s,
from the Romantic Age,

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.615
and this music championed
national causes

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:40.385
and it also supported
this exciting notion

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:44.222
of common people finally taking
the reins in their society.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:46.841
From Norway to Italy, from
England to the Czech Republic.

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:52.480
Now, let's travel north to Norway
and a piece by Edvard Grieg.

00:00:52.547 --> 00:00:55.150
In the 19th century,
Norway was chafing

00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:57.051
under the thumb of Sweden,

00:00:57.118 --> 00:00:59.687
and you know Norwegians
have a distinct need

00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:01.656
to be Norwegian
apart from Swede.

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:04.726
The cultural capital during
this period was Bergen,

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:06.995
way out in the west
in fjord country.

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:09.531
And the great writers
and artists and musicians

00:01:09.597 --> 00:01:12.400
gathered there to be inspired
by the natural beauty.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:14.936
Part of romanticism
and a part of nationalism

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:16.905
is a love of nature,

00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:20.542
and Norwegians seeking freedom
found inspiration

00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:23.311
in the awesome
beauty of their homeland.

00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:27.515
Grieg wrote this piece to
accompany the play "Peer Gynt."

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:29.984
Peer Gynt was kind
of a Norwegian Huck Finn

00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:33.621
whose misadventures were
set mostly in scenic Norway.

00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:36.558
This piece evokes the beauty
of Norwegian fjord country

00:01:36.624 --> 00:01:39.694
and the pride Norwegians
feel for their way of life

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:42.564
and for the beautiful corner
of the world they call home.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.667
Let's listen to "Morning"
from Peer Gynt

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:49.304
by Edvard Grieg
from Norway.
