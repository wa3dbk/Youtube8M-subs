00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:12.950
Elephant Goes to the City

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.117
By Amit Garg

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.700
In the middle of a big city,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.950
there was a small zoo,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.367
and inside

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:28.867
lived a baby elephant.

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:32.700
Her name was Rosa.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.950
The zookeeper

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.867
loved little Rosa very much

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:40.700
and cared for her in every possible way.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
and cared for her in every possible way.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.700
Many visitors came to see Rosa

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.533
and watched in fascination

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.450
as she ate a dozen bananas in one go.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.867
as she ate a dozen bananas in one go.

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:55.867
as she ate a dozen bananas in one go.

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:59.867
Rosa was well looked after,

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:02.783
but she missed the company of other elephants.

00:01:02.783 --> 00:01:06.617
but she missed the company of other elephants.

00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:07.867
One day,

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.200
after feeding Rosa,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.033
the keeper forgot

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:15.700
to lock the door of her cage.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.533
Soon she was out of the zoo!

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.450
First, she came across

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.867
an ice cream vendor

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:30.367
standing by the roadside.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:35.617
He saw Rosa and ran away.

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:37.450
The curious little elephant

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.867
stuck her trunk

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.700
into the icebox.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
Something tasted so cold,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.533
sweet and delicious

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:55.867
that she simply gulped it all down.

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:58.283
Rosa kept moving about,

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:04.533
her eyes searching for someone.

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.783
Finally, inside a shop,

00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:10.533
she saw a herd of elephants on a television screen.

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.450
she saw a herd of elephants on a television screen.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.867
she saw a herd of elephants on a television screen.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.617
“Friends!” she thought,

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:21.283
and marched into the TV shop.

00:02:21.283 --> 00:02:24.117
Everybody inside the shop

00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:29.033
ran out, leaving her alone.

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:31.700
Rosa tried talking

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.283
to the elephants on the TV screen,

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:39.033
but they didn’t reply.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:42.367
Confused and disappointed,

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:46.950
she walked out.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.200
Back on the street,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.117
she saw a coconut-seller,

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:59.867
selling coconuts.

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:04.533
“Wow, I’ve found a ball!

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:07.283
It’s play time now!”

00:03:07.283 --> 00:03:08.783
she cried

00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:10.533
and kicked a coconut

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:12.367
and kicked a coconut

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:15.450
high into the air.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.367
It flew across the road

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.367
and landed right beside a boy

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:26.533
playing in the park.

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:28.700
Rosa ran across the road,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.367
determined to get her coconut-ball.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:33.783
determined to get her coconut-ball.

00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:35.867
Cars screeched,

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:38.783
buses honked,

00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:40.950
and drivers began to yell at each other.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.450
and drivers began to yell at each other.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.783
Rosa had created a traffic jam!

00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:49.283
Rosa had created a traffic jam!

00:03:49.283 --> 00:03:50.783
The traffic police

00:03:50.783 --> 00:03:53.867
moved in to take control.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:57.950
The zoo was informed.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.783
Ignoring the commotion around her,

00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:02.033
Ignoring the commotion around her,

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.950
Rosa simply ran into the park.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.783
She stopped in front of the little boy,

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:13.367
who was smiling at her.

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:14.950
He giggled

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.283
and patted the elephant.

00:04:18.283 --> 00:04:21.367
Rosa trumpeted back

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:22.783
with excitement

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:27.700
at her newfound friend.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.867
By now, the zookeeper

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:34.367
had reached the park.

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:35.700
Seeing Rosa

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.033
in the open space of the park,

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:39.617
he understood

00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:41.617
that she would never be happy in a cage.

00:04:41.617 --> 00:04:46.033
that she would never be happy in a cage.

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:48.533
The zoo transferred Rosa

00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:50.950
to a protected forest, away from the city,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.617
to a protected forest, away from the city,

00:04:52.617 --> 00:04:55.367
where many other elephants

00:04:55.367 --> 00:04:58.867
roamed freely.

00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:03.700
Rosa grew up very happily.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.700
Now, instead of watching

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.367
Rosa behind bars in a cramped cage,

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:11.367
visitors could see her

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:13.033
among lots of trees,

00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:15.283
still gulping down dozens of bananas!

00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:18.283
still gulping down dozens of bananas!
