Hello I'm Tom Earleywine, director of
nutritional services for Land O'Lakes

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.160
Animal Milk Products. Today we're here to
talk about consistency in mixing and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.580
feeding milk replacer. One of the key
things for calves is they love

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.029
consistency, and if we're going to do a good
job of feeding our calves we have to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.900
make sure the diet is very, very
consistent. Parts of that are weighing

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.710
the powder and then we weigh out the
precise amount of water, place upon

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.200
the powder, mix the solution together and
provide a very consistent diet to the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.580
calf. Another final check can be a final
weight of the milk replacer and mixing it consistently.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.180
One of the key issues that we're trying to shoot for  is

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.240
getting the precise amount of water,
precise amount of powder in precise

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.960
total volume. One way you can ensure
that is to use a water meter instead of

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.650
trying to use a volumetric measure to
look at water. Sometimes we found that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.629
tanks contain, or supposed to contain 30
gallons, actually contain 25. If you use a

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.320
water meter you don't worry about what
the volumetric measure is or the changes

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.039
depending on temperature. Another part of
the water scenario is a thermalcouple.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.299
Thermocouples are fairly inexpensive
piece of equipment that blend cold and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.360
warm water to a pre-set temperature. Thermocouple can be a great

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.300
way of making sure the temperature is
always consistent.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.060
We talked a little bit about the tools
used in mixing milk replacer and mixing

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.579
it consistently. Some of the key tools
involved would obviously be a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.069
thermometer checking temperatures, the
whisk or a squirrel cage mixer on a

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.709
power drill or even in this case a large
propeller type batch mixing arrangement.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.719
And then of course the big number one
key is the scale. The scale is to make

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.950
sure we're weighing the precise amount of
powder. Ideally you would weigh

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.909
out water as well and even maybe the
final solution mix. Always check your

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.329
scale. There's a number of options and
scales. You can get digital scales, you

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.920
can get load cells on mixers, things like
that. But always check them because

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.239
they can get off, that does
happen over time so it's always worth it to

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.120
recalibrate and recheck these scales in
a routine basis.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.360
Essentially this is an example of a
scale we've used to weigh the powder. Here's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.000
the bucket - you can see the scale is
actually pre-set for the weight of the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.540
bucket so that when you set the bucket
on the scale it zeroes it out and then

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.530
you would just add the powder
to the bucket, weigh it and and weigh each

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.620
bucket to make sure you have the precise
amount of powder. Obviously this would be

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.819
pre-calculated for the number of calves you would have. If I was looking for 1.3

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.560
pounds of powder - look at that I came out
pretty decent. Stop right there. Obviously

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.260
the big key to doing this consistently is
making sure you just take your time and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.859
do it correctly. And if you put
too much powder in, take some powder back out.

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.069
 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.040
 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.400
As far as mixing milk replacer, once we
have it completely mixed and we make

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.640
sure we have a very consistent mix at
the proper temperature, the key is delivering

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.870
the consistent volume to the calf then
that's kind of the final step in the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.140
process. Consistent volume is really tough to do with a bucket.  One of the keys with bucket feeding is if you're

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.590
gonna feed with a bucket is to weigh the
bucket. We weigh each bucket that's fed

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.150
to the calf. The challenge with buckets is
they tend to be wasteful. Calves can

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.900
spill milk, they can tip the buckets
really easily. So one of the advantages to

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.620
the bottle is that it's easier
to deliver consistent amounts. You don't

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.280
necessarily have to weigh it every time.
Another advantage to the bottle is it's a more natural feeding mechanism.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.560
You don't have to train the calf to a bottle, typically. You have to work hard to train

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.560
them to a bucket. The challenge with the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.290
bottles is too often people don't
inspect and check the nipples to make

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.330
sure that they have the precise, clean
nipple and that it also isn't cut

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.220
too wide and the vents work properly. So
all those are some challenges with

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.550
the bottles. If you maintain
proper nipples and keep proper nipples

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.460
on the bottles the bottle can be the
most effective way to feed the calf.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.200
No matter which piece of equipment you use, whether
it's a bottle or a bucket, the key is

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.560
consistency in what you provide to the
calf.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.220
