00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.760
my name is Nick and when I was 26 I was
diagnosed with cancer

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.100
think about how you feel right maybe a
little fear little pity maybe some

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.530
sadness all that is normal now picture yourself hearing that sentence sitting across

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.300
from me on the first date. "What?", "I was just telling you something about me like I

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.000
love skiing, I had cancer

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.260
play Settlers of Catan" "Wait what did you
just say?" "Settlers of Catan its a board game, kind of dorky,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.910
but it's fun and it's super addicting!" "No no wait go back, go back before that you said what..

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.610
you you have cancer? Do you still have
cancer?"  "No, no no!  I'm, it's fine! Enough

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.490
about me you, let's talk about you. Tell me about yourself Meghan. Should we just order?"

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.540
I don't blame anyone for feeling uncomfortable hearing about cancer it's a subject that makes you think about death which isn't great date

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.090
talk because when you're on a date you
feel so alive

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.129
sharing stories you're being vulnerable
you're trying to be open and honest and

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.850
funny so you can connect maybe even make-out cancer is my heaviest baggage, its my

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.469
crazy ex-girlfriend who tried to kill me
and I would hate it if she ever came

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:14.049
back but she's crazy so she might I feel
like I gotta tell you at some point so

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.899
when's the right time I don't know
maybe on the third day definitely not

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.149
when you first just like sit down with someone that's seriously personal information and you don't

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.240
even know anything about me

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.860
Where are you from?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.880
Now it's just weird

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.260
But you're super cool and you're pretty

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.970
maybe if you told me you had cancer I would like you more than you like me a little

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.850
Does that mean you already like me a little already?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.640
Let me give you some advice. Okay. Maybe just get to know somebody. You know wait until the time is right.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.200
That's good advice

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.360
and change your
profile picture it doesn't look anything like you

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.700
It's just really great angle should we order? If I tell you right away it might scare

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.030
you off cancer is scary and you have
every right to find someone less cancer-y

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.860
but if I like you I want you to
know everything about me

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.069
cancer is a big part of Who I am so
there it is how to navigate when the

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.649
right time is, its complicated.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.780
it was really nice to meet you, you know good luck with

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.829
everything. Thank you, I would do it again if you want to

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:22.009
get together again because I feel like we are  having a good time and. "Did you want to order?"

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.860
See? This game involves wheat!

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.720
Yeah if you have any wheat I will give you some brick?

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.580
I think I like you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.780
I think I like you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:03.280
there's something I want to tell you
and um its weird and medical and it doesn't really matter but I feel comfortable around you

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.760
I have something too, I have something weird and medical and I have just been waiting for the right time

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.200
Should we go at the same time? or?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.700
One

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.200
Two

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.700
Three

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.940
I have cancer, I have HPV

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.060
I'm sorry what did you say?

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.300
I have HPV if it's really
embarrassing doesn't like everybody had

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.640
like 80% of sexually active adults get HPV. You're not weirded out? No! Like the other 20%

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.140
live in their parents basement.  Thank you for being understanding you're very sweet .You're very sweet. What was yours again?

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.800
Ah! Doesn't matter, okay. Okay. Wait.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.530
did you say that you had cancer? Yeah.Yes.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.590
Oh you know! Is there something? No? we need to talk about? *laughing* No we don't need to talk about it.
