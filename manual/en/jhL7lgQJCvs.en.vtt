00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.810
Submitting regular meter readings ensures your bill

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.030
is accurate as possible and helps you
avoid overpaying what you actually used.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.830
You can submit the reading online or by
the British Gas App

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.330
or you could also submit it by phone
or text.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.870
Meters are usually hidden in dark places such as under the stairs like this

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.030
The British Gas App has a handy built-in torch which is perfect for getting your reading.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.770
I'm going to show you how to read your
electric meter

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.930
first up is the single rate meter. You
need to first five digits

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.260
reading from left to right you can ignore
the last one which might be shown in red

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.200
so the meter reading here is 02951

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.710
next up let's show you how to read the two rate meter.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.989
You'll need the first five digit numbers on
by rows

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.220
reading from left to right you can
ignore the last one

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.230
which might be shown in red so here the
meter reading is

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.259
93807 and 59076.

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.200
Now we demonstrate how to read the two
rate single display meter.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.520
You'll need both five-digit numbers

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.670
reading from left to right some meters
automatically switch between the two

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.500
numbers

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.800
while others you need to push the button
to see them both

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.899
so here the readings is 42371

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.729
and 33520. And finally,

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.240
here's how to read the dial meter. You'll  need to read the first five dials from left

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.830
to right

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.659
Make any note of the number the pointer
is indicating if the point is between

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.520
two numbers

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.979
right down the lower figure.  Each dial
may rotate in the opposite direction

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.939
to the one before

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.840
so check which way the numbers are going
so here's the reading is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.610
83923. Once you've read the meter

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.909
