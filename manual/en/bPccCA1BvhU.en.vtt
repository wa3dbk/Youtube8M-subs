00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.719
The Alhambra is a palace and fortress complex
located in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. It was

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.880
originally constructed as a small fortress
in 889 and then largely ignored until its

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.160
ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid
11th century by the Moorish king Mohammed

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.210
ben Al-Ahmar of the Kingdom of Granada who
built its current palace and walls, and later

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.090
converted into a royal palace in 1333 
by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.700
After being allowed to fall into disrepair
for centuries, the Alhambra was rediscovered

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.350
in the 19th century by European scholars and
travelers, with restorations commencing.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.019
It is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions,
exhibiting the country's most significant

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.190
and well known Islamic architecture, together
with 16th-century and later Christian building

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.920
and garden interventions. The Alhambra is
a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the inspiration

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.960
for many songs and stories.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.250
Despite long neglect, willful vandalism and
some ill-judged restoration, the Alhambra

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.439
endures as an atypical example of Muslim art
in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.189
by the direct Byzantine influences found in
the Mezquita of Cordoba.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.460
Moorish poets described it as "a pearl set
in emeralds," in allusion to the colour of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.930
its buildings and the woods around them. The
palace complex was designed with the mountainous

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.240
site in mind and many forms of technology
were considered. The park, which is overgrown

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.240
with wildflowers and grass in the spring,
was planted by the Moors with roses, oranges

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.450
and myrtles; its most characteristic feature,
however, is the dense wood of English elms

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.649
brought by the Duke of Wellington in 1812.
The park has a multitude of nightingales and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.649
is usually filled with the sound of running
water from several fountains and cascades.
