00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.390
Last night the Lord gave me a very strange
dream.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.340
In my dream there was a couple people who
were playing a game.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.310
They were playing this game with food.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.330
They had a plate and on the plate were a couple
potatoes and some rice.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.050
They would take the potato or the rice and
they would chew it and then they would spit

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.590
it back out onto the plate.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.619
And they would continue to do this with trying
not to vomit.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.671
The first person would take the food,
chew it spit it out onto the plate and then

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:37.200
the second person would have to then chew
that same chewed food

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.060
and then spit it back up onto the plate.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.050
They continued to do this until the potatoes
turned to mash potatoes

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.690
and until the rice turned to some sort of
nasty pudding.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.690
For a second I forgot what this was.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.850
And I saw the plate sitting on the table and
I though; “maybe this is good food” I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.970
had,
I don’t know if it was amnesia or what happen

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.509
but I went over to it and I started to eat
a little bit of this food,

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.890
but as soon as I did it tasted funny and I
remembered how it was made

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.100
and I just spit all of it back out onto the
plate.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.380
This was the end of my dream, but I prayed
about this because I thought it was very odd.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.340
And what the Lord put on my heart was; “We
need to have fresh food that comes from Him,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.619
NOT food that is processed.”

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.340
You know a lot of people they’re getting
processed food from other people,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.569
but they’re not hearing from the Lord themselves.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.500
They go to their pastor or they go to their
church.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.869
They’re getting all this processed garbage
and they think it’s good for them.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.670
But they are hearing from the Lord second
hand, or sometimes maybe even 10th hand.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.069
They’re definitely not hearing directly
from the Lord Jesus.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.149
It is not a good thing to be hearing from
the Lord even second hand, and the reason

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.149
why is because,
that person who is feeding you, you have no

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.189
IDEA what they did with that food, they may
have poisoned it.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.730
These people that were playing this game,
this food was disgusting.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.540
You would NOT want to eat that if you saw
the process of how they made this mash potato

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.440
and this pudding;
you would NOT want to eat it.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.709
We need to be going directly to Jesus.

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.500
Jesus promises that He will lead us and that
He will also feed us.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.150
He promises the Holy Spirit to lead us into
ALL truth.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.489
And Jesus says that we need to go to Him because
HE is the Living Bread, HE Is the bread of

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.489
LIFE.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.819
We need to be going directly to Jesus and
hearing from Him.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.709
There is a lot of people who say;
“Well I don’t hear from the Lord,

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.629
that’s why I need to read this book or that
book or get this commentary or hear from this

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.650
pastor.”

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.040
Guys, you NEED to go to Jesus.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.340
If you’re going to this commentary or that
book or this pastor,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.280
you’re not hearing from the Lord.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.340
You need to go before Jesus until HE is giving
you FRESH food.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.090
Go before Him and wait on Him.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.820
If you truly want to hear from Him and not
be eating food that is nasty,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.540
go before Jesus and wait on Him in prayer
until He speaks to YOU!

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.540
And He WILL.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.540
He promises.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.560
Jesus says that His children they hear HIS
voice.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.080
And He also says that He leads His children
by His voice.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.599
If you go before Jesus in prayer He will lead
you, but you have to WAIT on the Lord Jesus.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.020
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
