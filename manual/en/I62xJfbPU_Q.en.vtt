Hi I'm Linda Leon with expertvillage.com.
On previous segments, I talked about the basics

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.250
that you will need to have in your kitchen
in order to do power cooking, and the concept

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.900
of what power cooking is. Now I'm going to
show you what to do when you start to use

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:28.519
the principle of power cooking. You would
need celery, bell pepper, garlic powder, or

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.460
a garlic that has been chopped—fresh garlic
would also do—you will need an onion, and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.440
some type of salt, and I like to use sea salt
or some kind of oil, cause you are going to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.110
use that for your sauteing. But if you look
at this as a basic recipe, then if you want

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.370
to cook a lot of meals at one time and power
cook, say for example you want to make a dirty

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.629
rice which we would be doing shortly. All
you would need to do is add two ingredients

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.090
to that. Now once you got your dirty rice
ingredient, which would be a addition of ground

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.260
sage, an Italian seasoning. And what we are
going to do once the pan gets a little hot,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:14.410
we are going to go head and saute our vegetables.
Now today what we are going to be using, because

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:22.110
of time and because for health proposes too,
we are going to use a vegetarian ground product,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.620
and this is called a meal starter. But you
can use ground turkey or ground beef or ground

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:40.080
chicken in any of these recipes and it would
work just as well. This is going to be about

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.980
a pound and half worth of the ground meat
product. Now the reason that we are making

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.070
this in a large volume is because when you
power cook, what you do is your run all of

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.020
these ingredients together in the basic, and
put that aside in the freezer bag. The freezer

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.080
bag is going to give you some good options,
because you would be able to take this basic

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.140
mix that you already put together and then
vary it up. Now when you are power cooking,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.030
this is as far as you would take the first
step, because this is your basic ground meat

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.830
recipe; and to this you are going to make
up whatever else you like to make. So I'm

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:35.360
going to take out a little bit of this and
put it into a plastic bag, and you can date,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.860
you can write your contents on here and put
your date. I'm going to put this into a plastic

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.020
bag because we are going to set this aside
to make other recipes. So what happens on

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.100
Monday night or Tuesday night, or Wednesday
night, and you want to make a ground recipe

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.490
you already go everything pre-seasoned. Now
we are taking this basic recipe, and we are

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.080
going to turn this into now a dirty rice,
and some people call it seasoned rice, but

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.760
the more south you get, the more it is called
dirty rice. So you are going to put about

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.620
a teaspoon, and that is just a little hands
work that is just about a teaspoon. Put about

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:24.250
a teaspoon of your Italian seasoning and about
a teaspoon of your sage, and that is the only

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.880
two additional ingredients that you added,
and you've gone from a basic ground meat type

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.160
recipe to a dirty rice. Now to that you want
to add about 3 cups of rice, which I already

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.709
precooked. That is a simple, quick, low fat
recipe, lots of flavor because you got a lot

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.760
of seasonings in here, and you created one
meal from just a basic recipe. There you have

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.629
it dirty rice. I'm Linda Leon with expertvillage.com.
