00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:02.498
- It is a manling!

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.050
- It is I, Mowgli, Kaa.

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:10.195
- The little frog?

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:11.734
- That's an encounter between Mowgli,

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.312
and the giant snake, Kaa,

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.892
from Zoltan Korda's 1942 adaptation

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:17.843
of Kipling's "The Jungle Book".

00:00:17.843 --> 00:00:22.027
- But the real-life heavyweight
snake champion of the world?

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:23.025
Let's find out!

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:24.608
(whooshing)

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:28.070
(electronic music)

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.480
- [Robert] Everyone
loves a giant snake tale.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.281
Heck, myth and religion are
practically infested with them.

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.582
Especially those cosmic world serpents

00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:36.080
that are tied to the creation

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.743
or destruction of the universe.

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:39.162
Like the Norse Jormungandr,

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:41.058
or Hinduism's Sesanaga.

00:00:41.058 --> 00:00:43.460
Today, their fictional descendens
continue to enthrall us.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.917
Whether antagonizing Conan the Barbarian,

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:48.974
or simply vomiting up a
half-digested Jon Voight

00:00:48.974 --> 00:00:51.131
in 1997's "Anaconda".

00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:52.341
But let's turn to real life.

00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:54.667
Which snake species is the largest?

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:56.425
- [Julie] The modern serpent queen's crown

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:58.732
rests most easily on the heads of either

00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:02.055
the Asian reticulated
python, Python reticulatus,

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:04.452
so called for its geometric color pattern.

00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:08.084
Or, the South American green
anaconda, Eunectes murinus.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:10.358
If you're an avid reality TV viewer,

00:01:10.358 --> 00:01:11.967
you might remember the
green anaconda Chumana,

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:15.717
which failed to gobble up
Eaten Alive host Paul Rosolie.

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:17.081
- [Robert] Many sources tend to credit

00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:19.253
the reticulated python with
the greatest record length,

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:22.162
while crediting the heavier
semiaquatic green anaconda

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.560
with the greatest overall weight and size.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.844
Others just go ahead and award

00:01:25.844 --> 00:01:27.381
the green anaconda top honors.

00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.697
You might expect there to be a bit

00:01:28.697 --> 00:01:30.363
more scientific certainty on this matter,

00:01:30.363 --> 00:01:31.724
but you'd be quite wrong.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.178
- [Julie] Giant snake accounts are rather

00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:34.716
like giant fish stories.

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:36.717
The maximum size is directly proportional

00:01:36.717 --> 00:01:39.221
to the amount of skepticism
you choose to employ.

00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:40.935
Do you trust that Victorian explorer,

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:43.004
or scrap of local hearsay?

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.772
Do you ignore how
stretched that skin appears

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.441
in that 50 year old photograph?

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.007
Ultimately, record
measurements in the wild

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.906
are few, far between, and
easily bungled or exaggerated.

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:54.842
- [Robert] For instance, an alleged

00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:57.078
33 foot reticulated python

00:01:57.078 --> 00:01:59.795
from a 1946 natural history magazine story

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.707
continues to pop up in
articles on giant snakes.

00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:05.122
Though herpetologist John
C. Murphy dismisses this,

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:09.257
and any wild reticulated python
length greater than 25 feet.

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:12.364
- [Julie] But please, go
ahead and believe HN Ridley's

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:15.050
1899 mention of a, quote,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.415
"specimen measuring 40
feet having been reported

00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:22.669
"as obtained by a scientific
expedition in Manila",

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.986
if you crave size over documentation.

00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:26.514
- [Robert] And then
there's the green anaconda.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:28.828
According to German
herpetologist Lutz Dirksen,

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:31.486
the larger females typically
reach lengths of nine feet

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:33.235
and weigh upward of 200 pounds.

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:35.764
Dirksen cites a record 29-foot account,

00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:38.330
while Murphy entertains
the possible reliability

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.356
of up to 32-foot measurements.

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:42.713
- [Julie] But again, leave your
skepticism on the nightstand

00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:45.777
and you can revel in
Fritz W. Up de Graff's

00:02:45.777 --> 00:02:48.912
dubious 1923 account of a 50 to 60 foot,

00:02:48.912 --> 00:02:51.724
or 15 to 18 meter green anaconda.

00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:53.395
- [Robert] Either way you shake
the reputable data, however,

00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:55.983
the green anaconda wins
the heavyweight title.

00:02:55.983 --> 00:02:58.266
With its mass suspended
in its watery habitat,

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:02.393
this apex predator can hit
the scales at 441 pounds

00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:03.974
a good 100 pounds heavier

00:03:03.974 --> 00:03:06.120
than most of the largest reported pythons.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.022
- [Julie] The maximum
size for either species

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:10.305
is determined by both ambient
environmental temperature

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:12.159
and metabolic rate,

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.980
in addition to a steady diet
of things to swallow whole.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.735
And so to find a larger snake,

00:03:16.735 --> 00:03:18.095
we have to turn up the heat

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:21.356
and venture into even steamier
jungles on an ancient Earth.

00:03:21.356 --> 00:03:22.934
- [Robert] 60 million years ago you'd find

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.642
just such a tropical hell
in the Cerrejon rainforest,

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:27.294
located in modern-day Colombia.

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:29.129
We're talking average yearly temperatures

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.316
of 86 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:34.589
Far hotter than modern tropical
rainforest temperatures.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.884
- [Julie] Here, Titanoboa made its home,

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:39.345
feasting on equally
giant turtles and crocs

00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:41.559
in the oldest known American rainforest.

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.463
By comparing the creature's
fossilized vertebrae

00:03:43.463 --> 00:03:45.496
to existing snake specimens,

00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:48.464
paleontologists estimate
its tip to tail length

00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:51.438
at a whopping 42 feet, or 13 meters,

00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:54.097
and its crushing weight
at more than a ton.

00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:55.381
- [Robert] Certainly, there's room enough

00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:57.791
for larger serpents in the
shadows of prehuman history,

00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:01.154
but for now Titanoboa reigns
supreme as Queen of Serpents,

00:04:01.154 --> 00:04:02.702
and the largest snake ever

00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:04.148
to slink its way through the jungle.

00:04:04.148 --> 00:04:05.476
Hey, if you enjoyed this video,

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:07.705
be sure to check out these
three videos as well.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:08.816
- [Julie] And don't forget to visit us

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:10.268
at stufftoblowyourmind.com.

00:04:10.268 --> 00:04:12.799
- [Robert] That is some
horrifying BBC footage

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.414
of a giant leech consuming
an earthworm in Borneo.

00:04:16.414 --> 00:04:18.111
- [Julie] We know, you're terrified

00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:19.217
and need a little comfort.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.442
Well, have some science, please.

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:22.490
You know, I'm not all that shocked

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.476
by Miley Cyrus's 2013 VMA performance,

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:26.599
but the real star of that show?

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.168
It is her tongue.

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:29.379
- [Robert] Yeah, why is it constantly

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:30.409
sticking out of her face?

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.980
We're gonna look at the
world of human biology,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.431
and reptile biology for a possible answer.

00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:36.253
- Ah, Medusa.

00:04:36.253 --> 00:04:39.257
I have long held a torch
for that monstrous vixen.

00:04:39.257 --> 00:04:43.424
And her curious anatomy is
never far from my imagination.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.621
(soft tone)
