Now we are onto our nut granola. I'm just
going to tell you about what I bought. Again,

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.920
this is totally up to you, whatever you want
to throw into yours, whatever you like. I

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.914
have some cashews I got from the grocery store.
Of course you probably know what a cashew

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:23.650
tastes like and look like. Mmm. These are
raw, organic and unsalted. You don't have

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.560
to go that far. They can be conventional,
meaning non-organic or a little bit of salt

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.980
on them. But the more basic you get, the healthier
it's going to be. That means the less they

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.800
did to the nut, the less processed, the fewer
things they added to it, that's always healthier.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.500
So, I have some great raw cashews. I have
some almonds here, nice, raw, unsalted. Almonds

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.880
are such a healthy nut. These are great just
to keep on hand just to munch on. These are

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.460
salted, however. I couldn't find the unsalted;
they were out of them actually. Not a big

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.149
deal. A little bit of salt won't hurt you.
I also have some pistachios. I love pistachio

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:18.130
anything. These are actually still in the
shell, and they're escaping as well. One overboard,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.770
but that's alright. I'm going to be peeling
them and getting them out of the shell in

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:29.590
a minute, but pistachio is a great, great,
very flavorful nut. Lastly, I have some sesame

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.659
seeds. Not a lot, gosh, this is probably only
about a tablespoon of sesame seeds, just to

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.270
sprinkle on top. Great little addition, you
can add just a little bit of something, great

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.460
extra flavor that you need. I also have some
honey; I'll show you how we are going to use

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.739
that. Some raisins, I love that texture with
the nuts and that sweetness of the raisins.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.619
And the lemon, I'll show you how we are going
to use just a little bit of lemon juice in

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.249
this. Again, I got these from the bulk section
because I like to be able to have control

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:02.049
over how much of what I get. But it's up to
you; just bring home your favorite ingredients.
