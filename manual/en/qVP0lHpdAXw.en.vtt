00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:06.900
Functioning as both
a painting and a print,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.867
a monotype is unique
and non-reproducible.

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:12.700
They are unpredictable
and usually very spontaneous,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.967
so the process is great for
experimenting and exploring.

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:18.167
The hoopla
over Monotype

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.533
can be experienced
in your classroom

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.867
using a safe, simplified,
water-based process

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:24.733
that I'd love to
share with you today.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:28.033
I'm going to walk you
through this particular image,

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.533
but you can have your students
create their own unique designs.

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.100
I have a square piece
of muslin,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.800
and a foam dinner plate.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.967
The foam plate will be
used as our printing plate,

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:42.000
and will also keep everything
contained and tidy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.533
I also have some
Blick Studio Acrylic colours.

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.567
These are the perfect
consistency for

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.100
this particular process.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.667
Not too thick, not too thin.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.167
I'm going to begin by making
some registration marks.

00:00:55.167 --> 00:01:00.867
This way I can align
my print each time.

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:05.267
A hatch mark on each side
and two on the bottom,

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.467
and we'll set that aside.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.733
Beginning with
the lightest colours first,

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:13.300
we'll paint the background
of the monotype.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.300
Paint directly onto
the foam plate.

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:21.333
Especially when you're
painting broad areas,

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:26.900
you can add a little bit of
water to make the paint flow

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.733
a bit more freely.

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.667
It's important to remember
that what you paint

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.600
on the plate will
print in reverse.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:39.900
Paint some distant hills.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.567
Now I'm going to
take a modelling tool,

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:53.300
and I'm going to pull back
the paint in some areas.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.133
This will print as white
on my first print,

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.567
and will reveal colours
beneath in subsequent prints.

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:09.200
Align the registration marks,
and with firm,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.533
even pressure to
the back side,

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.433
make your first print.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:17.067
You can see some of the paint
bleeds through the muslin,

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:19.267
so it's best to use
a paper towel

00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:21.133
to protect your fingers.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:34.267
And there's the background.

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:37.000
Now, for the middle layer,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.933
we're going to use
the same plate.

00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:40.700
Don't clean it off.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.933
The paint that remains
on the back can be used as

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:49.800
a guideline for
the next layer of printing.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.067
To start we're going to put in
some quick leaves here

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:55.667
in the tree,

00:02:55.667 --> 00:03:00.100
and then paint
the grassy area

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.100
underneath the tree.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.500
I'm using some mid tones here.

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.900
Once again,
take a modelling tool,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.567
going to create some quick
blades of grass beneath here,

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:19.900
and then I'm going to
bring back a few highlight areas

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.967
up here in the leaves.

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:36.667
Back to the muslin.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.933
And make our second print.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.033
There's the middle ground.

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:14.533
Okay, now I've saved
the darkest colours for last

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:17.467
in the foreground.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.800
Dark colours
overprint everything,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.667
and nothing ever
prints them very well,

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:29.800
so it's really best to
save them for the last.

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:36.100
We'll do a very quick
tree trunk,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.400
and a few branches at the top.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400
You notice that
I'm working very quickly,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.600
because acrylic paint
does dry very quickly.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.367
That helps
keep it spontaneous.

00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:51.167
Now I'm going to
use a wooden tool,

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:56.900
and I'm going to create some
bark-like texture

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.300
in the tree trunk.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.000
And up through the branches.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:11.233
And now the final print.

00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:43.633
There we have it.

00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:45.933
In just three easy steps
we have a complete

00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:47.500
monotype landscape,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.067
however you can use
as many layers as you like.

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:52.867
An embroidery hoop
may be glued to the front,

00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:54.833
or to the back of the print,

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:56.667
after the paint
is completely dry.

00:05:56.667 --> 00:06:00.367
You can also put two prints
together on a hoop,

00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:03.100
and hang it together
as a two sided piece.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.267
