00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.850
You want to know the hardest thing about making a
cheese sauce? Grating the cheese

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.480
 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.400
So get yourself a good grater and start
grating your cheese.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.570
I use different cheeses all the time in my cheese sauces

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.939
and there's no set rule but
here's why I'm using the three that I'm using

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.390
today.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380
You just saw me grating up some cheddar.
That's because cheddar has a universally

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.920
liked

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.230
flavor. Then I'm also using some gruyere cheese. Gruyere is

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.989
a Swiss cheese. It's got a nutty
flavor to it but it's a really good

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.829
melting cheese and then I am using true
parmigiano-reggiano cheese.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.710
I'm using it because it has saltiness to
it, a toasty, nuttiness to it. It seasons the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.050
sauce really nicely. I'm going to
mix them up

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.829
and then I'm gonna start making a bechamel sauce or just a white

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.930
sauce. I'm gonna put the stove here on about medium heat.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.730
The first step in making a bechamel or a white sauce

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.300
is making a roux. R, O, U, X. Roux.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.320
It's simply a mixture of butter and flour cooked together.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.729
We do that because if you cook the
flouer a little bit in the butter, it

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:07.050
doesn't

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.270
have sort of a dusty harsh taste at the end.  So
once the butter is melted

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.390
go ahead and add your flour and this is
the cooking part of it. We're gonna stir

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.490
this around.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.920
The butter and flour together should look like
wet sand in the pan.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.009
We're going to cook it for about two minutes just to get
that starchy flavor out of the flour.

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.950
While your butter and flour are cooking, it's
important to bring your milk

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.180
to a warm temperature. When you add warm
milk

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.540
to your warm roux, you're less likely to get lumps.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.440
I'm using whole milk here. That's going to make the 
richest most delicious cheese sauce.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.130
And while I pour, I'm gonna whisk it all in. So as soon as it's come to a boil

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.990
you know that as thick as that flour is
gonna make that sauce,

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.490
Before I add my cheese, I'm going to turn

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.040
off the heat. If you've ever had a cheese
sauce

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.850
that is stringy and gluey, that's because you
overcooked your cheese.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.930
This is enough heat to melt that cheese without
a problem. I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.500
and add my cheese to the sauce now and
just

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.879
stir this in nicely.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.840
I'm going to add a little bit of salt. I'm
going to add a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.349
little pepper. If you don't mind the
specks, go ahead with black pepper

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.540
otherwise use some white pepper. Something
that I really really love the most in

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.609
a cheese sauce that makes it so delicious

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.849
is grating a little bit of whole nutmeg in there.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.480
That make a delicious seasoning and then I get to
taste it again.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.620
Mmmmm.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.239
Now it is ready. Whether you wanna put on
broccoli and get the kids to eat their

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.840
greens

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.090
or stir into a lot of pasta and make a
delicious mac and cheese,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.250
you've made a great cheese sauce from
scratch.
