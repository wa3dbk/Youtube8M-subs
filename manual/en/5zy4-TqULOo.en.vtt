00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:08.270
Hello. My name is Denise Robinson and on behalf
of Expert Village I'm here to show you how

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:20.449
to create a decorative pillow. Okay, I just
marked the pillow with the fabric on the side

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:33.899
that I want to cover it with. I placed a pin,
straight pins on the edge to indicate where

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:49.379
I need to cut. So, now I'm going to begin
to cut the fabric. The part with the most

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:59.960
fabric left over was the hangover so I'm going
to begin there. And I'm just going to take

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:14.290
my scissors and I left a little space where
I marked it to help me guide to give a straight

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:38.280
line. I'm just going to go all the way down.
Like that. Now my excess is still pinned to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:51.600
the actual side that I want and that's fine.
Now I'm going to cut the short edge and I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.720
don't think I left myself enough room to get
my scissors in there but just to start with

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:10.789
a little snippet, then I can take my pin out
and follow the guide to the next pin. So I

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:19.920
can have a pretty nice straight line. And
if you're working with new fabric, it's pretty

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:38.049
stiff so you can probably get a straight cut.
I'm down to the next pin. I'm going to remove

00:02:38.049 --> 00:03:05.889
it and continue my cut. Next pin. Continue
my cut. And this is the final pin.

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:19.639
And finishing off the cut. Remove the excess
from the short end. And this side is the side

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.809
of the face of my pillow.
