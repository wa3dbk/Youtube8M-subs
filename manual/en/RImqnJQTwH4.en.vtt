00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.629
Racism is still the most intractable issue
in this country and we are never going to

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:10.600
make the progress, the strides on this issue
that we ought or should if we can't come to

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:18.860
realize that we have to have an earnest honest
transparent conversation about what ails us.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.340
And America just isn't ready to have that
conversation, as Americans as I should say,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.460
we're not ready to have that conversation
about why race is still the issue that it

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.460
is.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.520
It is the most divisive issue in this country.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.550
And on any particular social or political
issue one sees the race divide, politically,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.750
socially, economically, culturally even, we're
still divided by race.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.030
And so if we're not ready to have a real earnest
conversation about it, I mean look at the

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:55.660
trouble that President Barack Obama has gotten
into on occasion by making pretty simple comments

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.969
as far as I'm concerned.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.140
And by simple I don't mean to disrespect him,
I mean he's made comments that are pretty

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.540
basic, pretty normal, to me at least as a
black man, but he catches all sort of hell

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.820
for even injecting himself into these concerns
even though he may be asked about it.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.830
And so if we aren't prepared to even have
an honest conversation about this issue then

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.880
we're not going to - we're never going to
make any progress on this.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.670
I go back to my relationship with Maya Angelou
for the best answer I think to this question.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.020
It is about respecting and reveling in the
humanity of every other fellow citizen.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.120
Racism by any other name or by any other definition
is the contestation of someone's humanity.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.330
And that always gets us in trouble as a society.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.950
Whenever we want to shrink rights as opposed
to expanding rights, whenever we want to contest

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.060
the humanity of any other fellow citizen,
it could be ageism, it could be homophobia,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.909
it could be sexism or patriarchy, it could
be racism.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.879
There's any number of ways in which people
every day have their humanity contested.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.349
At the end of the day if we cannot respect
and revel in that humanity of every fellow

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.760
citizen then we'll never get past these social
ills, the xenophobia, the racism, the homophobia

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.200
that holds us back as a great society.
