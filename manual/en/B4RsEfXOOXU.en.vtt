00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.290
He was going on guys so um there was a
thumb

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.429
bad news today arm and that has to do
with you tubers

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.670
channels being shut down arm

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.279
so I don't wanna right now turning by

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.539
basically a Gold Glove

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.570
and wealth doom clan

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.109
and another guy I've never her to them

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.170
but I they were all all the channels
were shut down arm

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.960
implant I never actually even watch them
never hurt like her to them

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.840
that that never really know they do
gonna nothing about them all I know is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.360
there

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.070
they do something okay arm but %uh

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.020
pressure has to do with quality by Tom
go clubs

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.550
II was described him i watch the video
sometime he is trickling out

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.520
and it sucks that a chance to shut down
I leave a link to all the channels

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.000
arm and their two daughters in the
description arm their twitches

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.559
and I got the personal lives but they're
panels aren't

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.610
it to says the cells been terminated for
repeated violations or something

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.000
and even know what they violated like
for go clubbing night

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.299
couldn't think of anything really
violated arm

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.479
you know I now I've no wow anyone's read
the Community Guidelines okay

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.759
by Tom you know there might be something
in there about like

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.200
ripping gameplay from a twitch stream or
something but I highly doubt it

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.590
so yeah

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.820
but if that is something then how that's
retarded armpit ponds people do that

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.920
although I would say Gold Gloves channel
is literally base of nothing but doing

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.250
that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.740
arm but I'll yeah how so that's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.770
that awful om had died go club had a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.119
what was the elec 580,000 million six
hundred and

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.360
nothing is a five hundred and something
500 and 1000 subscribers

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.899
and shall get shut down and a shutdown

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.170
again yes or no are back the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.750
MW two days go published on YouTube
channel got shut down his

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.860
channels go club many make ok love TV
with 20

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.099
had until it got terminated today you
know and I feel like

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.940
his U-two career has been kinda rough
for him you know losing so many channels

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.670
for and and the you listen to me picture
not enough arm

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.489
you know losing small channels and a on
I'd say it for like for me

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.980
losing a small town a bit worse than
losing a pic channel because losing a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.700
pic channel

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.110
six months you're probably be back to
normal whereas viewers

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.440
small channel you're basically done like
restart buddy you know

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.590
so on is it necessarily the worst

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.450
I fillings actually probably be better
than the first time he lost the channel

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.890
I should I see the first time was really
good because he had a bunch

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.580
meteors help them get all the subs back
in fact he had even

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.069
more you know and that's one thing that
I want actually do is a

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.260
whenever he announces with new channel
is or if you get this

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.370
calm the situation situated obviously I

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.890
which is talking about using be able to
do if but that doesn t happen

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.769
I will you know I might take this video
down or you know

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.390
do something like that but arm I i think
thats awful that his channel

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.430
got deleted you know arm in a as as TV
in our frags a Preston what's a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.750
if my youtube channel ever gets shut
down are just sell kak doctor living

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.930
and become a Niner okay arm bles it's
that that's really bad

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.159
p arm so I hope he gets back

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.769
and doesn't three-star anything but me
this is YouTube so

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.670
sadly that's going to happen arm but

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.700
maybe he'll have looked like he had last
time we have the bottom gigante or

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.000
YouTube urself now next thing you know a
year from now you got over millions of

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.659
now arm so with honestly but then this
year i think is gonna be an eight

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.430
hundred thousand sups by the end of this
year

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.189
yeah around 800,000 subs

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.489
so mean with the help of other youtubers
looking at last time like last time

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.920
I don't even know how many subs he had
but I know after all the help within

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.790
like a month he

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.319
doubled what he had to start so you know
maybe it'll from it's like that'll

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.739
happen

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.950
you know in a dozen you know I guess
that's good by Tom

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.109
yup top anyway ok got the

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.239

video announcing what his shell is

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:20.820
healthy

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.900
