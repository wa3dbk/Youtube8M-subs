00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:16.750
Waltz routine, we will demonstrate
once around the room with music first.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:01:19.190
Those were steps that were taught
to you in our bronze 1 class

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.940
and of course our bronze 1 DVD.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.190
So here is a complete description
of the counts and the individual

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.760
steps linked together for you.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.600
We start on the long side of the room
in dance form,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.620
dancing a whisk and chasse,
one-two-three,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.100
one-two, and three.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.280
A natural turn on the turn,
which means we only turn a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.700
quarter not the usual three-eight,
one-two-three.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.420
An outside change,
one-two-three,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.850
now a natural turn turning the
normal three-eights turn to the right,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:20.099
one-two-three, hesitation change,
one-two-three, a reverse turn,

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.409
one-two-three, one-two-three.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.909
At this point I’m going to turn
this corner and start to go down

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:35.040
the short side of the room
by using the whisk, one-two-three,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.900
I turn the whisk to the left, a chasse,
one-two and three, a natural turn

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:54.359
on the turn quarter, one-two-three,
an outside change, one-two-three,

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.579
and now a natural spin turn
to go around this corner,

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.019
one-two-three,
four-five-six,

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.739
one-two-three.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.599
I will now start from the beginning
again and dance this second

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:22.489
long side of the room same routine;
whisk, chasse, two and three,

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.459
on the turn natural turn,
outside change,

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:39.090
natural turn, hesitation,
reverse turn,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.709
and now whisk to turn this corner,
one-two-three.

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.609
Now moving along the second
short side of the room

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:57.669
with the chasse two and three,
natural turn, outside change,

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.480
and finally turning this corner
with a natural spin turn,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.709
one-two-three,
one-two-three,

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.650
one-two-three,
which brings us right back

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.909
to the beginning of the routine
having danced all four side

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.750
of the room –
one complete cycle around the room.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.880
We’re going to show that to you again
from the other side,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.220
starting from the other side,
just to give you another look at it

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.250
and I’m going to count from
beginning to end.
