00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.620
&gt;&gt;Narrator Kelii Alapai, University of Hawaii
at Manoa student: A medicine that effectively

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.730
treats the sting of the box jellyfish has
been developed by Angel Yanagihara, a researcher

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.330
at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.750
A sting that is a painful nuisance in Hawaiʻi
and deadly in places like Australia, Thailand

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.369
and Indonesia.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.760
Her work was published in the December 2012
edition of PLOS ONE, the world’s most prestigious,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.080
open access, online scientific journal.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.320
&gt;&gt;Angel Yanagihara,UH Assistant Research Professor:
What is extremely satisfying to me is to bring

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.949
this 14-year hunt and work to a peer review
end.

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.369
&gt;&gt;Narrator: That hunt started when Yanagihara,
a biochemist, was severely stung by box jellyfish

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:52.230
in 1997 while swimming near Waikiki.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.540
That’s when she discovered that little was
known about what causes the sting’s burning

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.540
pain.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.120
&gt;&gt;Yanagihara: They certainly brought the battle
to an interested person.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.100
When I got stung, I got motivated.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.500
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This is video of the venom being
fired out of the jellyfish tentacles.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.330
In 1998, Yanagihara identified a toxin in
the venom that has since been found in all

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.120
box jellyfish around the world.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.180
She soon discovered the toxin was the kinetic
leader or locomotive that drives the venom

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.230
and eventually found compounds that can block
that toxin’s effect on human blood cells.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.520
Then came the tests on more than 300 laboratory
mice.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.620
&gt;&gt; Yanagihara: Just injecting the venom into
the mice, cause death of a hundred percent

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.950
of the animals within 20 minutes whereas when
we follow that up with the treatment, most

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.850
of the animals, over 75 percent of them, survived
the entire 12-hour observation period.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.409
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The technology to treat the stings
is now being developed and may be on the market

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.409
soon.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.260
&gt;&gt;Yanagihara: Not only is it a technology
that is applicable for life threatening stings,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.060
but also for our local burning stings.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.120
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This is just the beginning.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.140
Her research on box jellyfish could lead to
breakthroughs on things like treating wounds

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.810
and septic shock.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.310
It is just another example of the impact UH
can have on the state and the world.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.819
&gt;&gt; Yanagihara: This is a real strong point
of Hawaii and the University of Hawaii here

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.991
at Mānoa and we have state of the state-of-the-art
facilities so we can put together a community

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:28.040
to address really unusual kinds of topics.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.029
&gt;&gt; Narrator: Yanagihara and her team are still
out on Waikiki beach every month in the middle

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.579
night collecting box jellyfish.

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.069
She even became a certified scientific diver
to study the creatures in their habitat.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.409
&gt;&gt; Yanagihara: It is pretty scary.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.951
You know there are tiger sharks out there
at 3 a.m. where you are diving, anyway, it

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.010
has been a magnificent kind of journey.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.409
&gt;&gt; Narrator: She credits her success to her
departments … the Pacific Biosciences Research

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.909
Center and the UH medical school and colleagues
from around the world, but says it is the

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.569
funding from the Hawaii Community Foundation,
which has been on board since the beginning,

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.170
that really made a difference.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.090
&gt;&gt; Yanagihara: All thanks go to HCF for their
vision and their support of this work.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.940
&gt;&gt; Narrator: And thanks to the jellyfish that
stung Yanagihara over a decade ago that started

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.930
her magnificent journey.
