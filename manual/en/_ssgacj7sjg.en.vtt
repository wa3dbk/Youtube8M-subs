Eating noises
Tonight for dinner we're going to show you

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.110
one of our favorite Korean meals.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.250
It's actually Korean Chinese food.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.260
In every country Chinese food is a little
bit different and Korea is no exception.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.260
This here is a typical Korean-Chinese restaurant.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.260
It's just a small little place.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.260
Hahaha!

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.550
We have someone who is very hungry.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:33.980
So the last time we had Chinese food it was
in Busan on our first trip together.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.710
And Sam ate so much that one night that he
couldn't even walk afterwards and we ended

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.399
up not even seeing the markets, not seeing
the city.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:43.930
It was straight to bed for him.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.350
What you talking about!

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.559
Actually, sadly it's true.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:49.749
Gamsahamnida!

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.670
Yum Yum check this out.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.409
It's for one person.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.720
That's like a feast in a bowl.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
What is it?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720
That's Jjajamyeong.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720
Which is?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.289
It's noodles with a black bean paste and some
onions.

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.100
And this is an actual set we ordered.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.159
We got this whole massive feast.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.290
Like these are huge bowls.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.880
And we got sweet and sour pork.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.450
Now this is a value meal.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.899
For the two of us $13.

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.469
Yeah!

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.150
I'm already digging in.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.619
You are.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.049
Slurping noises.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:50.899
Stirring noises
Eating noises

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.960
Well, that's a long noodle!

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.960
It sure is.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.049
Oh, it's so good.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.140
One of our favorite foods to have.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.113
So here we have this sweet and sour pork.

00:02:06.113 --> 00:02:12.670
It's breaded and deep fried and it's in a
nice sweet sauce.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.610
And we also have a few veggies like onions,
carrots and maybe coleslaw.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.750
Mmm....nice little surprise there.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.750
that's really good.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.500
It's quite sweet isn't it?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.780
MMMMM&gt;...yeah
In a Chinese Korean restaurant often the best

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.150
value meals are the sets.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:39.140
We ordered what was Set A which included the
two bowls of Jjajamyeong here and the Tongsuyuk

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.900
the sweet and sour pork.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.930
This meal will leave us stuffed.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.450
We can't even finish it all.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.989
Oh yeah, that's going to fill us up for sure.

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.010
Eating noises
Stirring noises

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.030
What are you doing?

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.819
Just mixing in the black bean paste.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.209
Then I'm going to stuff my face.

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.319
Eating noises.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.489
Hahahaha...You got enough?

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.590
As usual in a Korean - Chinese restaurant
you don't really get that many side dishes.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.340
We just have these lovely little radishes.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.340
That's the banchan.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.530
That's the Korean side dish.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.470
We've got so much to eat leftover.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.250
Well, I couldn't quite finish mine.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.680
It was just too much food.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.799
Sam did a little bit better.

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:46.799
There is nothing left of mine.

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.810
A true pig.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:59.849
But anyways, for someone visiting Korea and
looking for a cheap budget meal that is delicious

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:00.849
we recommend Korean-Chinese food.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.851
It's awesome!
