00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.559
Three distinct versions, one exceptional aerobat.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.599
Good news for fans of the Edge 540.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.750
This airshow favorite and aerobatic champion
has been replicated in not one, not two, but

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.880
three great ARF models.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.189
All you have to do is pick that one the best
suits your style.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.890
This 27% Edge 540 is part of the performance
series and flies equally well on glow fuel

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.890
or gasoline.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.850
Its size is impressive but it certainly isn't
intimidating to assemble.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.480
You'll notice the attention to detail, the
beautifully molded fiberglass cowl and wheelpants

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.310
painted to match the trim scheme.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.970
Even the composite landing gear is shaped
to enhance the planes overall appearance.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.620
The sheeted foam core turtledeck offer super
strength with little weight.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.120
Large control services with full throws deliver
quick-reaction to 3D inputs.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.610
And the rudder servos can be mounted in a
pull-pull setup or with a shorter, more direct

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.710
linkage.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.000
It's a worthy addition to the performace series
of expertly engineered RC models.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.630
If a smaller size Edge 540 with electric power
is more to your liking there's also this E-Performance

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.110
Series model.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.030
Final assembly is even faster for this ARF.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.260
And the 2-piece wing is something you usually
find on larger planes.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.760
This E-Performance Series Edge also has a
fiberglass cowl which attaches with magnets

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.740
to help preserve its clean lines And a mount
is already in place for installing an outrunner

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.800
brushless motor.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.159
But maybe you're interested in flying a model
in the 50 inch class.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960
In that case the Edge 540T is just the ticket.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.900
It's the first in the exciting new E-Performance
XLT Series.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.820
With features and construction that take electric
aerobats to the next level.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.890
Only the finest materials have been used including
hand selected woods for the airframe.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.189
Like the other Edge 540s the cowl is fiberglass,
the wheel pants and landing gear legs are

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.979
also made of fiberglass and the low profile
axles eliminate bolts to give the wheel pants

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.420
a super clean look.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.750
High-quality carbon fiber is used for the
wing joiner.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.890
It not only aligns the wing automatically
it also allows for easy transport The control

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.860
services are double beveled for precision
tracking with low throws.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.310
And by maxing out the throws you'll have all
the agility you need to execute extreme 3D

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.510
maneuvers.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.950
So if you've been thinking about flying the
classic Edge 540 now you have three ways to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.980
do it.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.190
And because they're all from Great Planes
you can't go wrong with any of them.
