I hope you all are having a great week.

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.130
Thank you for checking out my latest video
on glitter cheetah print nails.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.670
These nails are based on my favorite notebook
that I made over the summer.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.250
I will be using nail polish strips and the
LED gel kit that The super sweet folks at

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.460
Incoco sent for NAILgasmTV

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.369
You want to start with clean nails that are
free of oil and debris.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.940
Applying nail wraps and nail polish strips
can be tricky.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.250
The easiest method I found is to place your
finger on a flat surface and place the strip

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.739
onto your nail.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.660
Then using your fingers, gently press the
polish strip onto the nail, smoothing out

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:57.769
any air bubbles that may have formed.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.690
File away any excess polish strip

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.129
Repeat for the rest of your nails

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.200
Do you have another method for applying polish
strips?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.590
I'd love to know.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.860
Tell me about it in the comments below.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:31.939
For your cheetah print, I find it's easiest
to use black acrylic paint as it dries faster.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.430
I'm using a size zero paint brush that I got
from my local craft store.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.480
Use whatever brush you like.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.670
Next I'm going to place a small dab of paint
onto my aluminum foil palette

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.899
There are a million ways to paint leopard
print so do what works best for you.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:02:32.040
I find that it helps if you have a pattern
to look at for reference while you paint.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.400
Once your leopard print spots are dry to the
touch apply your gel top coat and cure.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.530
It is very important that your paint is dry
otherwise it will smear when you apply top

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.940
coat and ruin your hard work.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.840
That's it, you now have glittery gold leopard
nails.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.800
Congratulations on your design.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:01.930
This is a quick manicure that should last
several days with the gel top coat.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.180
Thank you so much for watching.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:19.510
Have 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.079
a wonderful week
