Hey guys,
AJ from GoProFanatics.com. In this video,

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to show you how to make a time lapse
video using Adobe Premiere Pro and pictures

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.080
taken with your GoPro camera. So open up Adobe
Premiere Pro and choose new project.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.140
Name the project whatever you want and then
click OK.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:30.730
And in the new sequence window, go to general
and editing mode select desktop. And for timebase

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.350
or the frame rate, I'm just going to leave
it at 29.97. For the frame size, you will

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.840
have to manually enter these dimensions. So
I took a time lapse on my GoPro Hero 3 black

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.959
edition in the 12 megapixel resolution, so
that's 4000 by 3000. And the pixel aspect

00:00:52.959 --> 00:01:02.139
ratio instead of anamorphic, select square
pixels and everything else should be OK so

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:03.890
go ahead and click OK.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.810
After Adobe Premiere Pro loads, you should
see something like this. So head on over to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.540
the project window on the left side over here,
right click and select import. And I've already

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.109
gone ahead and placed all of the pictures
that I took during the time lapse in a folder

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.900
and as you can see, they are all sequentially
named starting at 99 and going all the way

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.439
up to 1385.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:40.700
So go ahead and click on the very first frame
so the smallest file name and click on numbered

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.999
stills and then click open.

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:53.899
And basically Adobe Premiere Pro is going
to load all of these pictures as a video file.

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.319
So over here you'll see the video file. So
go ahead and click on it and drag into the

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:07.679
sequence down here and release it. And as
you can see there's going to be a yellow bar

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:15.510
over here so that means the video is not rendered
so go up to sequence and render entire work

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.540
area. Basically this is going to allow you
to play back the video as smoothly as possible.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.180
It's not going to be choppy or anything like
that.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.129
OK so the video is done rendering and you
can tell that it is finished by the fact that

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.790
we have a green line here instead of the yellow
one that we saw before.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.959
So you can go ahead and preview your time
lapse video by either pressing on the space

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.159
bar or clicking on the play arrow over here.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.100
And if you're satisfied with the time lapse,
you can export it.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.580
So just go file, export, media. And if you're
uploading it to YouTube, make sure your format

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:03.150
is H.264 and there is actually a YouTube preset
so just click on the widescreen HD one and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.110
that's pretty much it. You click export and
then you upload it to YouTube.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.791
The only thing I wanted to comment on was
the frame rate that I selected earlier. It

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:18.129
was 29.97 frames per second. So basically
if you know the number of pictures that you

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.780
took and the frame rate that you've selected,
you can determine how long the video is going

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.120
to be.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.350
So in my case, I took 1288 pictures and if
that's played back at 29.97 frames per second,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.299
you end up with a video that's just under
43 seconds so it's really easy to calculate.

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.159
You just take the number of pictures divided
by the frame rate and then you have the final

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.409
length of the time lapse video.

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.349
My recommendation is to keep the time lapse
videos you know short, in between 30 and 45

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:00.260
seconds is ideal in my opinion. Anything longer
than that and viewers become less interested

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.180
and they'll want to move on to the next video.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.200
So that's it for this tutorial on how to create
a time lapse video using Adobe Premiere Pro

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.500
and your GoPro camera and if you have any
questions or comments about this tutorial,
