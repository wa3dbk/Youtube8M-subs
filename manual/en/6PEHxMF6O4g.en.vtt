00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
While I'm inclined to enjoy the odd round
of Cabal, Blood Bros. or Wild Guns, the genre

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.230
of running and gunning on a single screen
never really appealed - this was mostly a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.360
fault of the controls as there was no real
intuitive way to pair moving your character

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.279
and aiming and shooting in a seamless way.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.160
Zombie Panic in Wonderland by Akaoni Studios
took a fresh stab at things on the Wii, but

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.940
now the 'new and improved' Plus version is
available for iOS gamers to check out.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.250
And the immediate verdict is that the controls
do the game far more justice than a trackball

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.530
and buttons - I'll admit that this may be
a matter of personal preference, but tilting

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.140
to move around the screen while touching where
you want to shoot comes off as far more intuitive.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.060
The addition of easy to remember gestures
such as swiping your character to perform

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.450
a diving roll only make it that much easier
to avoid enemy fire.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.590
Much like its Arcade forebears, Zombie Panic
is all about going all Rambo on a horde of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.110
enemies, taking on waves upon waves of zombies
while shooting up the surrounding environment

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.190
for bonus points, ammunition for special weapons
and to squash undead foes with the resulting

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.210
rubble.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.439
The premise is simple, but quickly ramps up
to extraordinarily difficult proportions as

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.220
you face newer, faster and more deadly foes
including ninja goblins and demons that can

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.880
block your bullets - it's mayhem, destruction
and fun all in a tidy package.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.500
All of this would be incredible if not for
the rather shameless way in which access to

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.480
the game's content is locked behind a pay
wall.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.920
By now, iOS gamers should be used to such
antics, but instead of providing options to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.580
earn progress through skilled play, money
needs to invariably be exchanged if you want

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.369
to make any headway.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.650
Unlimited continues require money; new characters
require money; and the full story campaign

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.259
requires money.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.909
Most insultingly of all, a score affecting
bonus can also be purchased (Combo Bonus x2),

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.770
making it all but pointless to compete in
the leaderboards unless you're willing to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.720
open your wallet again.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.439
It's a minefield that gets even worse when
you consider there's content yet to come and

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.750
it's unclear if the All-In-One package will
extend beyond the current version.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.910
As a game, Zombie Panic in Wonderland Plus
is a non-stop action-packed slaughter-fest

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.739
that captures the best aspects of a rarely
exploited genre and packages it with slick

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.379
graphics, intuitive controls, and a difficulty
curve that keeps you coming back for more.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.230
It's recommended you grab the free version
and test out the available content first before

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:33.090
jumping in to any paid content; your wallet
may just thank you.
