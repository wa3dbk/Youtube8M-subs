HoM 64: Indigo Children - Crystal Children - Rainbow Children - What Next? - Star Children 01 September 2007

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.270
Hi, this is Jack.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:30.150
I‟m giving some practical support with the Indigo and Crystal children; practical support or assistance with Indigo and Crystal children.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:40.720
What we‟ve done in the dimensions, is that we have sound-bombed all the manifestations of crystals within these children.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:50.410
Secondly, we‟re busy looking at how we are able to…

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.680
because what is happening within the minds of these children is the following:

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.510
The children have defined themselves

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.520
according to the emotional-centre that has been exemplified within the entire mind consciousness system within them.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.900
So, the „problem‟ is, with some of the children, is that they have gone and defined themselves according to that as „who they are‟.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.450
Why do I say that that‟s a „problem‟? It‟s a „problem‟ from the perspective of:

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.410
if they are so infused and defined as that emotional-centre within their mind that‟s been exemplified,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.290
we‟re not able to remove it – because if we remove it,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.410
the being will „die‟, because they are so part of that entire mind consciousness system centre

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.570
that is infused within the human physical body.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.580
What you must remember is the following:

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.930
That these mind consciousness systems are interdimensional,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.330
and they manifest interdimensionally within the human physical body,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.540
and if the being starts defining themselves so extensively as this mind consciousness system that‟s infused within the human physical body

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.940
and you suddenly remove the system,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.940
the body will die – because

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.180
the being charged the mind consciousness system that is within and as the human physical body.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.490
So, in other words,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.600
if the systems aren‟t there, the human physical body can‟t function.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.130
So, what is the practical support for the Indigo and Crystal children?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.390
At the moment what I‟m able to say is that,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.380
we are currently working on methods, within the dimensions,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.300
that we‟re able to „diffuse‟ these mind consciousness centres –

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.650
these mind consciousness emotionalcentres – within the human physical body of the child, through time.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.100
Meaning – we‟re slowly but surely doing the following:

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.630
We‟re standing within the child, as the child, as who the child really is.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.350
What we‟re doing is:

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.230
we‟re lifting them as who they are, within them,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.570
and we‟re allowing them to stand up within them – slowly but surely –

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.790
and in that standing up in the expression of who they are as life,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.900
these mind consciousness systems centres within them start moving out –

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.660
slowly, very slowly.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.490
We‟re not doing it too fast;

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.270
we‟re doing it just on the correct pace,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.840
so that the child‟s true expression as life starts coming forth.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.370
Now, depending on how extensive it is,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.630
we‟re able to assist with that method.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.100
Other methods are forgiveness.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.240
Okay – the application of forgiveness...

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:30.500
Now, presenting forgiveness to your child, if the child still does not

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.130
cooperate from that perspective,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.680
what you do, is: you do forgiveness as your child.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.890
It‟s like you‟re placing your child within you. It‟s almost taking your child and putting them inside your heart,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.560
and then you do forgiveness as them, for them.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:55.470
Or, you‟re able to write down forgiveness applications on a piece of paper and have your child read it.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.650
Forgiveness applications, for instance:

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.180
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to define myself according to these emotional reactions.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.630
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to be scared all the time.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.000
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to be frustrated all the time.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.510
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to throw tantrums all the time.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.850
I forgive myself that I have allowed myself to feel guilty for being like this for my parents.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.520
And they do experience that.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.910
Most of the children, parents, are quite aware of what‟s happening to them –

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.170
and that‟s what makes it even more difficult,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.140
because they are very much aware of what they‟re doing, but they can‟t stop themselves –

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.620
and that is not cool.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.640
I mean, I‟ve spoken to children in the dimensions who‟ve had this experience –

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.840
and they told me that it‟s like they‟re trapped inside this body and

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.630
they cannot get out and no one can hear them, because it‟s like this system inside them is doing all these things

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.760
– and they just want to come through and say: “I am still here! I am still here! This is not who I am!”

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.060
They say it‟s like being trapped inside something that‟s doing everything –

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.060
and no one can hear you.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.840
I don‟t know if you‟ve had the same experience, like with human beings who are in comas,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.310
who almost feel like they‟re trapped in a body and no one can hear them.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.930
It‟s the same thing, though – in terms of the experience of the human physical body, is the complete reverse,

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.590
which is the tantrum throwing, being difficult, not being cooperative, etcetera.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.340
Parents – that is not your child. That is not who your child is – and you know that.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.310
That is a mind consciousness emotional-centre system reaction,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.220
which I‟ve explained in my previous interview on indigo and crystal children.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.460
Your child is here,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.170
and we‟re busy assisting with that. We‟re bringing your child‟s expression, as who they are as life forth - slowly but surely,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.820
not too quickly.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.850
What I suggest is: apply forgiveness as your child – anything that comes forth.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.160
Even your reactions to your child, forgive that;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.020
clear your relationship with your child. Meaning –

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:13.810
make sure that you do not react to your child‟s expression, because that reaction would also support the child in their expression continuously.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.310
Stand up – say: “No, till here no further! This is not who you are!”

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.320
‟ You know, speak to your child, as an equal –

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:30.070
although their reactions and everything might not seem equal, your child that is here beyond those system reactions,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.900
hears you.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.820
Motivate your child as who your child is. Your child is not those tantrums, reactions, noncooperation –

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.740
that is a mind consciousness system reaction.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.050
Start applying equality and oneness with you child,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.850
saying to your child: “Stop! This is not who you are.”

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.090
You know, apply forgiveness as your child. Apply forgiveness on yourself. Be careful to not react to your child,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:07:00.180
because you‟re reacting to a system. Your child as who your child really is exists within that,beyond that.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.560
Okay, thank you very much.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:11.380
If you require any more support, for me to be more specific, you are able to go on to the Desteni Universe website,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.120
 and then I‟ll be able to give you some more specific examples.Thank you very much.
