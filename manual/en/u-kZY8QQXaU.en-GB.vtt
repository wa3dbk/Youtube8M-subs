00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.640
Hundreds of fields speckle the northern Italian
landscape south of the Po River in this ALOS

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.219
image acquired on July 4th of 2010.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.390
Agriculture is one of the main economic uses
of the Po Basin because of the fertile soils,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.379
and this image clearly shows a landscape dominated
by fields.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.670
Throughout Italy's history, agricultural landowners
would often divide their properties among

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.809
their male heirs. Generation after generation,
land would be further fragmented, resulting

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.090
in the millions of small plots found across
the country today.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.000

Optical satellite imagery like this can be

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.439
used to monitor agriculture and changing landscapes.
Satellites can provide the information necessary

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.549
to make informed decisions on agricultural
management, including yield prediction, irrigation,

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.869
planting, pricing and regional need for food
assistance if a harvest is likely to fail.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.770
At the very bottom of the image, foothills
of the Apennine mountains appear dark green.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.609
The city of Bologna is visible in the lower-right
corner, and Modena can be seen on the left.

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.969
Two roads cutting across the flat Po Valley
provide a nearly straight route between the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.509
cities.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.119
The city of Cento -- which means 'hundred'
in Italian -- is located in the upper-right

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.119
section of the image on the Reno river.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.890
This image was specially selected for today,
as this is the one-hundredth regular edition

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.090
of Earth from Space. As always, we broadcast
online every Friday at 10:00 CEST and you

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.090
can find us on our website or, through the
ESA app on your mobile device.
