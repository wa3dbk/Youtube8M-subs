00:01:28.400 --> 00:03:02.800

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:52.400
Bonus Fact #3: Perpetuum is a single-sharded world, meaning there's one global server that every player logs into. This small game manages that scale by reducing its world to islands that can be run on individual computers.

Bonus Fact #4: Mining and other activities permanently change the face of the world in Perpetuum. Players can build settlements and terraform the land to make their own realms.
