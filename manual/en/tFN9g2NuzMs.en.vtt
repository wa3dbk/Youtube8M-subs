00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:06.534
(BANG)

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:08.802
- Dude! 
- Does no one ever knock?!

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.912
You are NOT going to believe this!

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:12.232
(Markiplier giggles)

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:15.476
This is going to blow your mind!

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:17.899
- Wow dude!
-I know!

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.312
Whoa!

00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:21.886
Dollar store glasses. My mind is blown.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:23.426
(tiny boom)

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:30.817
You don't get it! Try them on.

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:33.612
(click)

00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:35.382
Whoa...

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.355
So this is what you came to gloat about:

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:40.092
virtual reality glasses.

00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:44.092
-Not virtual reality...(whispers) REALITY...
-What?

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:47.597
What the heck?! That's some devil magic!

00:00:48.806 --> 00:00:52.526
I know, right?! OH! This is so cool.

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:54.126
Dude, where'd you get those?

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:55.286
At the dollar store.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:59.501
Now, we see what these bad boys can do!
(click)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.730
(laughs)

00:01:03.047 --> 00:01:03.855
Ooo!
(tap)

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:06.173
(click)
Oh...

00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:09.382
They must have been in creative mode.

00:01:09.382 --> 00:01:12.032
(awkward laugh)
I'll...change that right...

00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:13.182
What -- hey!

00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:18.074
Check this out. Huh? Yeah?

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.220
- Nice!
- Right?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.000
(ding!)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.420
Don't wink at me.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.980
- Don't ever wink at me.
- Yeah, it felt weird.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.360
It -- it felt weird. 
(click)

00:01:27.447 --> 00:01:30.077
(whimpers)
Oh, the blocks!

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:32.807
- OH, THE BLOCKS!
- Wait, what--what'd you see?!

00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:37.901
Hang on, dude. Wait, whoa, whoa

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:39.571
wait a minute, dude, I have an idea.

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:41.881
Give me those. (click)
I have the BEST idea.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:44.468
Whoa, whoa! I don't have any armor!

00:01:44.468 --> 00:01:45.198
(triumphant yell)

00:01:45.198 --> 00:01:46.178
(smack)
Oof...

00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:47.838
(gleeful laugh)
(click)

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:52.776
(tense music)

00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:14.288
(pants)

00:02:14.288 --> 00:02:16.818
(click)
I need you to make this...

00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:19.768
disappear.

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:23.173
(poof)

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:27.812
