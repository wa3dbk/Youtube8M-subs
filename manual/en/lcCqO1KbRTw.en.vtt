Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.340
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.790
And as promised, I'm going to
show you just a quick Pinterest

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.270
tutorial this morning.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.250
Now, I'm not a Pinterest guru.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.400
So Pinterest has a help
website, and you can obviously

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.210
ask other people that
are using Pinterest

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.950
if you have more questions
than I'm about to answer.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.640
I'm just going to give
you the quick version.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.960
So when you go to Pinterest.com,
you can see it's spelled

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.772
P-i-n-t-e-r-e-s-t dot com.

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:34.030
So it's the word "pin" and
"interest" mushed together.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.640
When you go to this
website, you're

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.730
going to see a page
similar to this.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.860
Now, if you're already
a Pinterest follower,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.030
you already know to just log in.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.095
And then on the search feature
up here, you can type in Mindy,

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:50.730
M-i-n-d-y, Mrs. Hairdo--
which is my user name--

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.130
and you should be able to find
me using that search feature

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.530
and then follow my
boards if you want to.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.827
Now, if you're not
a Pinterest user,

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:01.660
you're going to need
to click on this button

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.950
right here, which is
request an invite.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.400
Or if you know somebody that's
currently a Pinterest user,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.600
then you can have them
send you an invite.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.610
If you want to-- if
you have nothing else--

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.630
then you can email me at
cutegirlshairstyles@gmai.com

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.460
and leave me your
email address, and I'd

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.070
be happy to invite
you off my account.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.820
So once you request
an invite, this

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.560
is what you will see is
in your Gmail account

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.290
or your email
account, you will get

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.760
an email that says "To
sign up for Pinterest,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.340
follow the link below."

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.940
And if you click on
it, it will pull up

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.030
a little page that
says congratulations,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.370
you've been invited
to join Pinterest.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.860
So it's going to ask you to use
your Facebook account to merge

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.640
you with your friends that
are already on Facebook.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.990
So read through the
legal mumbo jumbo.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.340
And if you're comfortable
with it, click yes.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.500
Which, of course, I did.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.060
And what it does is it just
shows you which of your friends

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.570
are already using
Pinterest and their boards,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.780
and allows you the opportunity
to follow all of them

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.780
as well as when you join, then
they can be able to follow you.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.777
And you can see what
each other are pinning.

00:02:12.777 --> 00:02:15.360
So it's fun because you can see
what your friends are pinning,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.550
and their interests and their
likes and things like that.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.070
So once you've signed in and
you've set up your account--

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.150
and just so you
know, there is like,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.520
a four step process to
setting up your account.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.310
So it'll ask you to
create your boards

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.890
and create your user name.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.920
It maybe takes
five minutes total.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.929
It's really easy.

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.470
I'm just telling
you so that you know

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.340
when you sign up what
you're going to face.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.290
These are my boards.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.160
So now if you imagine
giant cork boards,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.400
each one is an individual
board, is what they call them.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.460
And I can go to any page
anywhere on the internet.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.220
For instance, let's say that
as I'm browsing one day,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.260
I stumble across this picture,
just on some random website.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.430
And I love this picture and
I want to do this hairstyle.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.240
So one of the steps that
you do in creating Pinterest

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.510
is adding the Pin It
button to your toolbar.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.060
So here's my Pin It
button on my toolbar.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.090
So simply I just click
Pin It and it pulls up

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970
all the pictures on that page.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.850
And I want this one.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.550
And I click Pin This.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.650
And it will ask me which
board I want to drop it into.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.770
So I want to drop it
into my Try board, which

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.100
means it's the
hairdos I want to try.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.680
So I'm going to click Try.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.280
And then you can
describe your pin.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.780
So maybe I'd write,
braided crown or whatever.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.360
And one really
cool feature that I

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.580
love about Pinterest
is that let's say

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.370
you found a hairdo you thought
I really would love to see

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.160
or you really want me to try.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.650
You can type in an @-- this
is called an at mention.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.500
So you would type in my name.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.800
See, it's pulling
me up right here.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.780
Mindy Mrs. Hairdo.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.990
And you would click Pin It.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.900
And what that does is
it sends me the picture

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.870
and it tells me somebody
has sent this picture to you

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.320
and wants you to view it.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.510
So this is a really
great way for you

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.470
to send me things you're finding
that you would like me to try,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.790
or great hairdos that you just
think I totally need to see.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.162
So then also, you can use this.

00:04:24.162 --> 00:04:25.620
Lots of people are
always asking me

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.000
questions like what are my
interests, what are my hobbies.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.600
And this is a great way
to find out more about me.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.520
You can see that I
love holiday ideas

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.820
and I love to throw parties.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.510
And so I'm always
trying to glean ideas.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.280
I'm a room mom at
my kids' school,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.000
so I have a give section
for little class favor ideas

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.380
or teacher party ideas.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.100
And I love antiques, so I
have a section for antiques.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.400
Anyway, it's really fun.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.310
As I pin things,
you'll see them.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.760
Or as you pin things,
your followers

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.130
will see them as well.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.040
So I am sure that I've
made this sound way more

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.380
complicated than it really is.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.880
It's really fun and I promise
that within a couple days,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.760
you'll probably be a
complete junkie like I am

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.860
and you will love Pinterest.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.340
So I hope you have fun.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.150
And don't forget, my user
name is Mindy Mrs. Hairdo,
