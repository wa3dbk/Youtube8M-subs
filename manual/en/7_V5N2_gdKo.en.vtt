"Orange Aromatherapy for Anxiety"

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:11.599
Aromatherapy is the use of 
concentrated essential oils

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.125
extracted from plants 
to treat disease.

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:18.317
And it's commonly used to 
treat anxiety symptoms.

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:22.139
Anxiety disorders are 
the most prevalent class

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:24.903
of psychiatric disorders 
in the general population.

00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:27.787
However, their treatment 
is still challenging

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:31.468
as the drugs used for the 
relief of anxiety symptoms

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:33.547
can have important 
side-effects.

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:37.870
Thankfully, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trials

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.709
performed to evaluate the effects of 
essential oils on anxiety symptoms

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:45.815
are gradually starting to appear 
in the medical literature.

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:47.346
However, in most 
of these studies,

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:51.716
exposure to the essential oil 
odor was accompanied by massage.

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.388
This makes it difficult to 
draw firm conclusions about 

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.145
the effect of the 
aroma itself.

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:59.126
Here's a typical 
example.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:03.022
A patient's in the intensive care unit 
the day after open-heart surgery,

00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:07.543
getting foot massages 
with orange-scented oil.

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:09.853
Why not back 
massages?

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:13.211
Because they just had 
their chest cracked open

00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:16.225
so this huge 
sternotomy wound...

00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:20.787
Maybe a plant-based diet rather 
than a post-op plant-based massage

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:23.874
might have been 
a better choice.

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:27.163
But the massages felt great, 
restful, peaceful, calming.

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:31.716
You know it's a British study because 
one described the effect as "smashing".

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:34.789
But how do we know the essential 
oil had anything to do with it?

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.926
Maybe it was just the massage 
that was so "bloody" good.

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.950
In which case, great! 
Let's give people massages.

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:42.900
I'm all for more
ICU foot rubs.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.780
There's considerable evidence 
from randomized trials

00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:48.710
that massage alone 
reduces anxiety.

00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:53.710
So if massage is effective then aromatherapy 
plus massage is also effective.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.630
So aromatherapy may work, 
even if it doesn't.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.300
In fact, one study where 
cancer patients got massaged

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:02.580
during chemo and radiation,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.440
even found that the massage without 
the fragrance may be better.

00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:10.340
They thought it might be like 
a negative Pavlovian response.

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:12.220
You know, people smell the 
citrus and their body is like,

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.160
"Oh no, another 
cancer treatment".

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:19.560
More recently, the ambient 
odor of orange was tested

00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:23.670
in a dentist's office to see if it 
reduces anxiety and improves mood.

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.350
Ambient odor of orange was 
diffused into the waiting room.

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.150
It appeared to have a relaxant effect, 
less anxiety, better mood, and calmness

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:35.310
compared to the control group where 
there was no odor in the air.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.080
No odor, that is, except the 
nasty dentist office smell.

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:43.240
Maybe the orange scent was just 
masking the unpleasant odor.

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.720
Maybe it had nothing to do with 
any orange-specific molecules.

00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:49.720
More research 
was necessary.

00:02:49.723 --> 00:02:53.960
"The Effect of Sweet Orange Aroma 
on Experimental Anxiety in Humans"

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.440
They exposed some grad students 
to an anxiety-producing situation,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.720
and tested the scent of orange vs. a 
non-orange aroma vs. no scent at all.

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:08.750
And the orange did appear to have 
an anxiety-reducing effect.

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:12.500
Interestingly, the observed 
anxiety-reducing effects 

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:15.360
was not followed by physical 
or mental sedation.

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:18.030
On the contrary, the highest 
dose the orange oil 

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.750
made the volunteers 
feel more energetic.

00:03:20.753 --> 00:03:24.830
So potentially less anxiety
 without the downer effect

00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:26.590
of valium-type drugs.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.790
Does that mean we can get the 
benefits without the side-effects?

00:03:29.797 --> 00:03:33.510
Well, I've talked about 
the concerns about

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.830
using scented consumer products, 
even ones based on natural fragrances.

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:41.940
There have been reports of 
adverse effects of aromatherapy.

00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:44.500
in fact, some pretty 
serious reactions.

00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:49.080
Alternative medicine isn't 
necessarily risk-free.

00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:52.350
Like there's dozens of 
reported cases of people 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.430
having their hearts 
ruptured by acupunture.

00:03:56.432 --> 00:03:58.800
Ouch!

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:02.520
But the adverse effects of aromatherapy 
were mostly from skin irritation

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.750
with essential oils being 
applied topically on the skin

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:08.630
or even worse, 
swallowed.

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:13.510
Certain citrus oils can make 
our skin sensitive to sunlight.

00:04:13.513 --> 00:04:16.900
though less of a problem 
in France, evidently,

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:23.550
where they're known to stick them 
where the sun doesn't shine.
