Hi guys and welcome back to Hair With Hollie.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.589
So, today I am going to show you how to do
this really cool ratchet look.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.620
Very red carpet, Kristen Stewart, Cara Delevingne
have been loving it lately and it is so easy

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.330
to do.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.330
[music]

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.460
So, for this look we are going to do quite
a severe side parting.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.960
So, whatever pick your favorite side.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.570
I am going to run the comb through.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.570
Going to use just about there.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.149
So in around the arch of your brow as a guide.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.410
Make sure you get quite a keen line and just
brush the hair over.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.580
So, you want quite a keen line for this and
make sure you go all the way down to the nape

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.960
of the neck, just about like that.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.160
There we go.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.560
So, I am going to pin this out of the way.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.910
Before making the plait, it is good idea to
kind of wet the hair before you begin.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.579
Just a little bit of water, I find it a little
bit easier to use than gel because it makes

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.579
the hair sticky.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.130
So, just make sure you get right in at the
root.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.130
Okay.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.200
So, for this look here, we are going for a
look kind of inspired by Kristen Stewart.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.330
So, it is not a straight cornrow.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.200
It is kind of like a little plait quite defined
by partings all the way down the side of the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200
head.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.240
So, just start off quite sleek.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.700
You want it quite tight.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:39.409
Just going to split the hair in three as per
again, nice clean lines.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.190
And I am going to fan to plait it keeping
it as tight to the head as possible.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:54.640
You want to plait only about three lengths
down the plait and then we are going to tie

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
it with a little bobbin.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.890
These little elastics are great and try and
get them as close to your hair, straight as

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.890
possible.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:16.049
And now, we are just going to join it up with
this hair like so.

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:25.189
And now, we are going to start on the next
plait.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.019
So, just tie it with another elastic.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:37.939
Make your next section and then tie them both
together.

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.659
So, just keep going until you have used up
all the hair and you are right back at the

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.069
nape of the neck.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.449
So, what you are going to do with your cornrow
is to pop a little bit of mousse or texturizer

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:53.959
or a bit of hairspray in the rest of your
hair just so it is not so perfect.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.859
Just run the mousse down to the lengths of
your hair and kind of scrunch it through your

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.760
hands just to give it a kind of tousled look.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.959
So, once your happy with your look just give
the whole thing a little bit of hairspray

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.200
mainly on this side just to give it quite
a sleek look.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.309
And just have all the hair kind of coming
over one shoulder.

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:18.069
So, I hope you guys liked the look.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.549
