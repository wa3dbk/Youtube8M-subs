The LED Driver Board is a part of your LCD
TV's Panel Assembly.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.530
LED Driver Boards are connected to the panel
via small wires or lock into a series of small

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.770
slot connections built into the panel.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.940
LG &amp; LG Philips LED Driver Boards are part
number specific, and do not require matching

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.130
TV model number, serial number, or panel number
in order to confirm compatibility.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.111
If the label found on the back of the panel
contains an LG logo, then the LED Driver Board

00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:51.910
will also be manufactured by LG, and is identified
by using the following part number pattern:

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.520
6917L, dash, 4 numbers, and 1 letter for a
suffix.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.010
The entire part number is found printed on
the board.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:11.560

and size.
