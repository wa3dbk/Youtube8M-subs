Hi there. Doug Thomas from Channel 9 News.
Now you may not know it, but we are in

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.670
the midst a hummingbird migration
season. So we're here at the home of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.500
Brenda Allen. Brenda tells us she's had
great success attracting these

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.180
fascinating feathered friends to her
backyard using the Perky-Pet Top Fill

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.519
Hummingbird Feeder that she claims makes
feeding hummingbirds quick, clean, and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.990
easy. Well, just how fast and easy is it?
We'll see. Are you ready? Clock set to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:43.469
zero, and three, two, one, go! Wow that was
fast. It's really easy, and there's no

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.260
mess. Just push, pour, pull, and hang it in
the yard. You know, I think our viewers

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.739
need to see that again. Can we show that
again in slow motion? Okay I see you're

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:09.260
pushing down. Is that breakfast? Ah ok. Now you're
pouring the nectar into the feeder.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.689
Weird, where did those cards come from?
All right, here you go. You're just

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.040
pulling up the feeder to release the
nectar.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.980
There's... How...?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.810
That, wow. That was amazing. There you have
it, a hummingbird feeder that's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.380
hummingbird fast. Brenda, how do you do it?
