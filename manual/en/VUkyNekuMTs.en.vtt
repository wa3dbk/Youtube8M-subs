Music &amp; Lyrics : Mezame-P

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:33.427
『Liar』

00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:39.175
I told myself I would let you go

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:41.374
I told myself that I would let you leave

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.278
Let this heart of mine and yours move on

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:46.175
Tonight's the same off and on

00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:48.337
Test a lover's fight with you and me

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:51.293
Soon for us, it'll turn to anxiety

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:53.231
Keep talking, I'll hear your word

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:54.988
●●●●●●●

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.874
Everything is what I've heard

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.756
My, oh well

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.492
Everything's so swell

00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:04.671
Just let me vanish into thin air from this spell

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:08.622
I already know what I have done and what you have too

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:12.493
Just let me sleep here while I bid you adieu

00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:17.725
Now let me just cry a bit

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:19.937
I won't mind if you want to leave

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:22.734
me here in this room dimly lit

00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:24.714
You really don't know what it's like

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.894
Have these stupid thoughts of only me, only me

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:29.760
Makes it such a heavy day

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:31.753
Washing out my fraying hair

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:33.520
●●●●●●●

00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.456
Combing with my fingers bare

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:38.286
My, alright

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:40.135
What a delight

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:43.059
Everything I knew about you is vanishing

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.026
That doesn't mean I'm not sad, Just stings a bit

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:50.993
As I sit here while it's raining in the night

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:13.587
My, oh well

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:15.326
Oh, it's swell

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:18.575
Oh, enough

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:20.379
Had enough of this

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.405
Once I'm done here, I'll never have to look back

00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:27.374
That stupid light's enough for me to reminisce

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:30.385
Pretty tears are enough to make me crack

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:34.379
Move me from this cloudy world, leave me here ignored

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.326
Throw everything, my soul, my thoughts and all away

00:02:37.327 --> 00:02:41.375
But hey, I wanted to let you know, Have and always will

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:45.479
I love you from now till the end of time
