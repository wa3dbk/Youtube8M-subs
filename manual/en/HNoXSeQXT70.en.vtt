How to straighten a bent frying pan

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hello, I'm JUSTICE Kenshin Iwakura.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And now I would like to show you how to fix a frying pan that has been bent like this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
OK, so this is how to fix a bent pan.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Slide your fingers in to the end of the curled edges of the pan.
Hold the pan in front of your chest.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Try spreading the pan little by little.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It could be quite tough...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's really tough...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Inch by inch it's coming back into shape.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Wow, I'm losing my breath here...

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:16.000
After you get this far, the next step is to use the palm of your hand, your triceps, and your shoulder muscles to press the pan against your knee.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
While you press with one hand, use your opposite hand to pull the side of the pan.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000
After you come this far, now you gotta straighten out the edges.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Oh, well....This is how you fix a frying pan that has been rolled up.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's not perfect but the key is to use 2 opposing forces: Pushing and pulling.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
There you have it...
