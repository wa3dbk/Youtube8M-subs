00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.959
So are you ready for a

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:10.289
great Michigan journey?  

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:16.490
GO BLUE!

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.810
Hello I'm Steve Grafton, president of
the Alumni Association of University of

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.269
Michigan and proud to be bringing you
this latest edition of video update.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.960
Even though it's summer

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.650
the University of Michigan is never on
vacation.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.129
It seems like there's a seemingly
endless flow of students who are coming to

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.060
campus for the first time and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.060
participating in orientation, groups like
the one you see behind me.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.230
You know, there's a lot to talk about.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.910
Construction projects that are restoring 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.690
and making history.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.610
A milestone celebration at Camp
Michigania

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.720
A tasty tradition at the Alumni
Association,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.579
and some fun things that are happening
around Ann Arbor.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.280
Starting last september the bells inside
Burton Tower were silent

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.450
as workers completed renovations to the
building stone work

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.710
and the metal frame work that supports
the carillon.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.860
They've also reinstall the original
keyboard which had been in a warehouse

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.710
since the seventies.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.220
On June the twenty-eighth,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.680
Univeristy Carillonneur, Steven Ball,
performed a special carillon

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.729
accompaniment to a silent screening of
the Phantom of the Opera.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.720
It really has been nice to hear the
familiar sounds of our historic bell

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.530
tower once again.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.990
From the old to the new, The Big House
keeps getting bigger and better.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.490
This summer construction crews have been
working to install the new

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.390
high-definition video jumbo-screens.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.310
Now, Michigan fans at our games can watch
our touchdown replays in high-definition

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.650
glory.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.640
This summer marks an important milestone
for our beloved alumni camp.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.660
We'll kick off a three year celebration
of the 50th anniversary of Michigania.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.780
You cant periodically check the camp
website for events

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.500
receptions, tailgates, and more things 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.160
related to Michigania's 50th 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.510
anniversary celebration.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.080
One summer tradition that we all really
look forward to the Alumni Association's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.119
annual ice cream social.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.599
It's held in conjunction with the Ann
Arbor art fair in late July and it's

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.919
right here at the Alumni Center.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.809
The event is free for Alumni Association
members and current students.

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.889
So whether you're eight or eighty,

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.819
from near by or far away, just remember
that ice cream always taste better when

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.519
you eat it with your maize and blue
family.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.680
And speaking of the art fair we take
great pride in fact this year's featured

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.529
artist

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.059
is U-M grad, Julie Fremuth.

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.569
Her art is featured on this year's official
art fair posters

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.269
and art fair t-shirt.

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.749
On a final summer note, if you're ever
in Ann Arbor from mid-June

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.659
through early July you can enjoy the Ann
Arbor summer festival,

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.199
also known as Top of the Park.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.639
They set up a stage in front of Rackham
Auditorium to offer free nightly

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.129
entertainment. 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.059
For those of you need a reminder of
campus geography, this is all in the Alumni

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.249
Center's back yard.

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.149
So I hope you have a great summer no
matter where you are,

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.609
and if you're ever in Ann Arbor, please

are grate programs and services.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.289
