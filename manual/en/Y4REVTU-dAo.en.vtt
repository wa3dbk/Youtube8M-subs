00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:13.560
TRABTEC optimizes rail logistics. At the worlds most state 
 of the art railway loading yard Cologne-Gremburg,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.273
incoming freight trains are broken up, and new trains 
 are formed, bound for all of Europe.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.635
Deutsche Bahn AG has invested 85 million euros with two major goals: 

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:31.486
to provide totally automatic sequence control, and to ensure maximum equipment availability.

00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:39.195
A new age is dawning: operation is now done using a mouse 
 and monitor, and no longer with the press of a button.

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:46.254
TIEFENBACH GMBH is responsible for the complete development and implementation of this project. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.548
To accomplish the plan, the company is using high 
 quality, state of the art technology, 

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:56.471
fast connection terminal blocks and surge protection from Phoenix Contact. 

00:00:56.471 --> 00:01:00.720
A shunting engine pushes the uncoupled coaches over the two-track hump.

00:01:02.113 --> 00:01:06.432
The coaches then run individualy down on of the 31 sorting sidings.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:10.751
Several break systems are automatically controlled,

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:15.024
 ensuring that the coaches travel along the 
 track only at the permitted speed. 

00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:23.847
If the coaches are not close enough together, the cableways push 
 them together so they are ready to connect. 

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:32.717
Once the freight train is assembled, the locomotive is 
 coupled, and it leaves the yard on time.

00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:39.660
The data required for automatic sequence control is recorded by numerous sensors. 

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:44.400
Using Phoenix Contact’s fast connection terminal blocks, 

00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:50.390
all of the cables from the tracks are fed into terminal 
 boxes on the tracks and in the control box. 

00:01:51.642 --> 00:01:55.220
The terminal box provides quick and easy handling.

00:01:58.027 --> 00:02:05.880
Lighting strikes can damage equipment and put it out of 
 action, so reliable surge protection is critical. 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:15.140
Phoenix Contact’s PLUGTRAB provides reliable protection for the equipment 
 sensors. While VALTRAB protects the switch drones.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:22.520
Phoenix Contacts surge protection fully meets Deutsche Bahn 
 AG’s guidelines on lightning and surge protection,

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:27.120
ensuring a high level of equipment availability at all times. 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.370
during normal operation, standardized arresters, support service and maintenance work: 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.470
these arresters are uninterrupted, testable and pluggable, ensuring time 
 tables are met accurately and efficiently.
