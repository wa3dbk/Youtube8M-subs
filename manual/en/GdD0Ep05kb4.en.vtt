00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.040
Today is our very last day in Hanoi.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.090
We are leaving Vietnam, so as a little farewell
we are going to be watching a Water Puppet

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.670
Performance in the Old Quarter and this is
something that is very traditional in Vietnam.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.770
I've been to a water puppet performance before.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.750
It is quite an animated and exciting show.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.300
There is traditional music.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.660
The water puppets are very active in the water
and it is going to be fascinating to go again

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.830
one more time.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.219
So there are ten acts in this performance
and it is mostly focused on folk stories and

00:00:34.219 --> 00:01:00.309
some of them include, as in this brochure,
a fan dance, a Cham dance and a pan pipe dance.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:02:15.520
Lots of dancing today.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:53.129
Vietnamese music

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:11.930
Clapping.
