00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.000
There are shooters and then there are bullet-hell
games.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.700
Yes, we've said it before, but CAVE's long-running
obsession with placing players against impossible

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.930
odds is well known to iOS gamers now, but
even amongst fans there's a game that remains

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.610
utterly daunting.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.230
Bug Princess 2, the 2006 Arcade sequel to
the classic original, takes no prisoners thanks

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.850
to its ridiculously scaling up modes of difficulty.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.309
By almost all other accounts, Bug Princess
2 is easy to pick up thanks to its familiar

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.109
and simplistic features.

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.489
The value of gems collected by the player
increase as long as you remain untouched and

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.280
the two playable characters each sport a unique
firing pattern, complete with interchangeable

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.710
'bullet' and 'laser' weapon modes.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.819
If you're looking for a score boost, keep
an eye on the combo meter and switch between

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.620
weapon modes accordingly.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.739
Aside from this, the formula remains in tact
with the usual combination of mini-boss and

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.989
multi-stage final boss encounters, complete
with complex attack patterns ready to trick

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.060
you in to using up your final life.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.750
Except, the real challenge of Bug Princess
2 isn't in completing its normal mode - no,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.180
that's the easy route, even if you do kick
the difficulty up to 'Hell'.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.400
Where the game really shines is in the face-melting
challenge that comes from the unlockable 'Maniac'

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700
and even better, 'Ultra' mode.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.280
Keeping in theme with the already streamlined
simplicity of the game, these modes feature

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.970
bullet patterns so insane, that on ultra it's
not uncommon to see a screen that's almost

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.250
exclusively pink in color.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.490
By all accounts, Bug Princess 2 is not the
most creative effort by CAVE when it comes

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.740
to the gameplay.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.320
With that said, it's always a beautiful experience,
thanks to its detailed worlds that (when you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.450
can see it through the explosions) is jaw
dropping in its details.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.420
Once again, it's a shame more time wasn't
spent on adding richer features exclusive

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.520
to the iOS platform, but for shooter fans
after a pure experience, you can't go wrong

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.850
with Bug Princess 2.
