00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.700
Howdy folks welcome to my virgin kitchen it
is Barry here you are looking gorgeous, gorgeous

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.700
homemade daim bars, good times. That is
right homemade daim bars trust me these taste

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.250
identical, identical to the real things they
are so good and I made mine pretty darn big

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.779
as you will see any minute now this was part
of the recipe voter on myvirginkitchen.com

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.500
it was either funnel cake or the homemade
daim bars and daim bars just shaded it but

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.660
I do want to try and make a funnel cake so
maybe I will do that soon but people like

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.660
(reads out selected names of people who voted)
amongst many others voted for this you have

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.969
made a wise choice my friends we make this
together if you want to have a go at making

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.649
it hit pause on the video now write all of
these ingredients down this is how you do

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.570
it. First up we will make our moulds and what
I did was grab a sheet of foil and my phone

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.449
case I wrapped it around there to make a funky
little foil mould which worked a real charm

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.240
just to say guys that step is completely optional
if you want to make a huge daim bar traybake

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.119
and make it easier for yourself you can pour
the whole mixture into a silicone tray with

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.530
chocolate on the top but knowing you guys
you would have wanted me to make the bars

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
so I did the harder option.
To make our filling grab yourself a saucepan

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.000
whack in the butter, sugar, golden syrup aka
corn syrup and whack that onto your hob on

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.939
a medium flame mix it together as it melts
and it will start to bubble and go light golden

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.860
brown be very careful with this step but once
it is at the light golden brown stage take

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.430
it off the heat, pour in the almonds you want
to put that back on the heat to warm through

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.490
again mixing it through only for around about
4 or 5 minutes you want to keep it that nice

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.340
golden brown colour because if you burn it
that will be minging.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.670
With your filling at that stage it is time
to pour it into the moulds now obviously doing

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.970
what I do it is quite hard to film as it cools
down very very quickly so here is what I quickly

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.790
captured I started to spoon it into one case
but do that to all the others and what you

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.390
will find is that sets super super quick can
you hear that (bangs on chopping board) really

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.659
hard stuff so whack all of your moulds into
the fridge and it is time to melt our chocolate

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.499
yep so melt up the chocolate you know the
pan over the simmering water giant food style

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:15.340
and get it fully melted but then let it stand
off the heat for 5 minutes that way it is

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.700
slightly cooler and the chocolate will not
run off. With the middles out of the fridge

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.499
and all nice and cool remove them from the
foil moulds and slowly dip them into that

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.620
chocolate roll them around oh my goodness
that looks good carefully lift them out and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.049
droop off any excess chocolate before letting
them rest on a nice little rack do that to

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.540
all of them and then you are in heaven.
That is it then guys just to say when you

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.219
whack them in the fridge give it a good 2
hours to really firm that chocolate up otherwise

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.040
it will be sliding all over you it really
is worth it you get that amazing crunch on

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.219
