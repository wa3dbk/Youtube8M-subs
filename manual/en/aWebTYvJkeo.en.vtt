00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.720
The world is becoming more and more an urban
place.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.530
Today there’s 50 percent of the world’s
population living in urban areas.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.610
In the next 30 years we’ll add two-and-a-half
billion people to that.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.820
So by 2050 our expectation is that 70 percent
of the world’s population will be living

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.269
in urban areas.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.289
And I think the challenge for all of us is
to use this urbanization as an opportunity

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.900
to address some of the real challenges that
the world faces.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.820
Economic challenges, social challenges, environmental
challenges.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.760
Because they will exist in some ways they
have the potential to expand if we don’t

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.760
get ahead of them.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.059
And I think historically we have assumed that
we can leave this, all these challenges to

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.620
the government to solve these problems or
the nonprofit community to solve the problems

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.539
and the business doesn’t need to get involved.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.370
And I think that’s just no longer the case.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.750
I think business has to step up, has to play
a much more active role not to replace the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.510
government, not to replace the nonprofit sector
but to bring its talents and its expertise

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.939
and its resources to be part of the solution.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.790
I mean the reality now is government is able
to do a lot less.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.670
They don’t have the resources.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.970
In many ways they don’t have the collaboration.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.760
And what’s interesting right now is you’re
seeing in cities, in urban areas not just

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.200
all these people we talked about but you’re
actually seeing the kind of collaboration

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.540
between the public and the private sector,
the nonprofit community in a way that’s

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.799
addressing these challenges that you don’t
always see at the federal level.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:36.000
And I think the private sector has a genuine
responsibility to step up and to use in whatever

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.430
case they may have their unique set of capabilities
and the resources and their expertise to try

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.360
to address some of these challenges.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.159
We can’t thrive if the communities where
we operate don’t thrive.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.159
If the communities are failing it’s not
good for business.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.880
And I think that’s the mindset that more
the private sector needs to get into that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.210
this is not something that can simply be a
little sideshow or just contribute to some

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.870
charities and that absolves you of any more
responsibility.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.680
We all have a vested interest in the success
of our communities and in the success of our

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.120
cities and we’ve got to step up and make
sure that we’re doing what we can to help

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.840
them grow and to help them thrive and prosper.
