00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.700
pBoth: It's time for Food Adventure Program for Awesome People!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.220
S: The bean-y edition!

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.220
[FAPFAP theme song]

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.240
M: This is the bean-y edition.
Both: About the bean-y edition.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.100
S: Woah, how did I know that Martina was going to rhyme "edition" with "edition?" *insert sarcasm here*

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.300
M: I panic on camera, okay, there's nothing I can do about it.
S: Not a good freestyler.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.040
M: Okay we are going for, not just beans, you're making it sound like we're going to some place where people are like, "Here take beans!!!"  S: Beans!!!

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:37.300
M: I love beans!  S: Beans!  M: We are not going for just beans. We are going for sweet red beans called "pat," P A T with like a tongue between your mouth, like pat. (mouth noises)

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.000
S: I haven't washed my hands in like three days. M: Sick! I don't know where that's been.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.880
S: It actually  M: How far in do you go?  S: It actually barely goes up my nose holes.  M: Oh

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.820
M: Anyways, pat is a sweet red bean that's used for dessert, and most likely you've heard of it for "patbingsu." S: "Patbingsu," yes

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.980
M: But this is going to be the winter edition where S: There's no "bingsu" this time. It's just "pat." The ice is gone because it's winter. You don't want ice for winter.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.380
M: So someone just gives you bean. They're like, "here take bean."

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.940
S: Well we're getting like, "pat juk," which is just like red bean porridge."

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.400
M: I think we should probably just show people what this is. S: This is my first time having this so I'm excited.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.400
M: Really? S: I've never had this before. M: Okay then. Nananana S: Nananana?

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.380
M: There's two versions. You can get the traditional one and the sweet version.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.380
S: We got the traditional one instead of the sweet one.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.940
M: Because a lot of the stuff in Korea is heavy handed on the sweet. Like if it says, "sweet," I'm not getting it. S: You stay the hell away from it. M:You just stay away.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.140
M: But if you like sweet things, (S: You will die.) M: then you're gonna like it.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.000
S: So this is actually my first time trying "pat juk."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.940
M: One thing I will say is that it is not the most attractive thing in the world.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.920
M: I don't really think you can sexy up something that looks like a... (S: There are no sexy food porn shots for this today.) M: ....bowl of poop

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.240
M: But like, it doesn't taste like it.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.120
S: It's fascinating. M: Okay, it's not Simon's style, but he's never been a red bean fan to begin with. S: Noooo

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.200
M: I think this is lovely. It tastes kind of creamy. It has a bit of the sweetness of the red bean, but it's not like surgary. S: It has a beany taste to it as well.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.080
M: Yeah but it doesn't taste like, don't think like kidney beans or pinto beans.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.100
M: I mean it's literally a ginormous bowl of beans. So we are going to be farting up a storm tonight.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.200
S: We are going to be... M: By "we" I mean Simon because girls don't fart. Everybody knows that.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.720
S: We are going to be recreating the TL; DR theme with our butt holes. (Farting noises)

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.020
M: That's not TL; DR.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.080
S: Oh that's

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.760
M: No

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.600
Both: (Fart noises to theme song)

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.440
M: Use your indoor voice (something...). S: Sorry

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.060
S: Everyone's looking at me singing theme songs. M: You're such a loud foreigner.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.400
S: These are the traditional bowls of Korea.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:42.840
M: Did you know that these brass bowls were founded in the countryside, originally known as "je jugo," and "je jugo" was where they

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.740
M: unearthed the brass for the first time.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.560
M: His name was, "Kwang Frodo." S: It was forged in the mountains of Korea.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.360
S: By the one true, reign, (M: named) named Lee Sauron. M: Lee Sauron.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.760
M: I don't really know how you can explain it, besides if you've tried it before. S: It tastes like beans.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.140
M: It tastes like, like sweet beans. S: The sweet pumpkin one though, however...

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.500
S: Is fantastic. M: It's amazing.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.440
S: And you have to make sure to eat the "ddeok" very quickly because it melts and then

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.280
S: it gets the consistency of a lump of hard boogers in you're mouth.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.940
M: Wow.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.240
M: I am going to take my "ddeok" and put it back in.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.580
M: Because you made me feel a little bit sick in my stomach for saying that.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.820
Someone off screen: I'll eat your "ddeok."

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.480
M: You can eat the "ddeok" if you can answer...

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.800
S: The skill testing question.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.480
Some one off screen: Why? Why do we always have to do a skill...Why can't I do (something...)

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.240
M: Skill testing question. S: She got the last one too easily.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.380
M: I'm going to hum a song and you're going to tell me the name of the song, or the band.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.680
M: Humming

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.180
S: I don't even know this song. Off screen: No...nobody...

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.360
S: Ooooohhh

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.660
Both: Humming

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.280
Leigh: Is it the Wonder Girls?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.880
M: It is! S: Yeah! There you go! [Ding sound]

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.820
Leigh: I'm getting better at guessing K-Pop.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.660
M: You can have my snotty "ddeok."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.060
S: Hard, trippy boogers.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.000
M: Car/plane noises

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.220
Leigh: Yum

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.020
S: Did you know that Korea is one of the countries that have legalized pot?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.320
M: Get it?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.000
S: Pot? (meaning "pat juk")

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.700
S: I went to a restaurant to get some pot ("pat juk").

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.560
S: We also got the red bean bread that just looks like a bagel, but it's stuffed with other red bean stuff.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.800
[Birds and piano (fancy)]

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.300
S: It's really really good for dipping in your pumpkin soup.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.380
M: How is it together? S: It's great!

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.280
M: Which one is sweeter: the bread or the "juk?"

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.600
S: The bread is definitely sweeter. M: Is it?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.700
S: Yeah. M: So this must be using like the traditional kind of filling. S: Yeah, yeah

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.400
M: and he took the for his own use, until Lim Legolas came and took it from him.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.800
M: I've had pumpkin in Canada before. Umm, I've had pumpkin soup. Usually it goes on the savory side.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.520
M: They'll add like kind of a nutmeg, cinnamon flavor. Korean sweet pumpkin; it's really just like a dessert.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.160
M: It's like a sweet potato, which just tastes so sugary but not actually sugary.  S: Mmmm

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.520
M: and both of these come sprinled with, ah, some nuts. There's like uh some pine nuts in here and...

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.480
S: Uhhhhh M: Sunflower? S: Seeds...what are those...green seeds called?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.760
M: Uh oh. S: What are the green... Leigh: Pumpkin seeds. Both: Pumpkin seeds?

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.240
M: Isn't there like a professional name for that? Like peptid or soemthing? Oh, I was close.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.700
M: Okay, which one you like better Simon?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.800
S: Definitely go for the sweet pumpkin one. It's lovely.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.640
S: The red bean one is really interesting, but it's not my favorite flavor.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.340
M: I think for me it would depend on my mood because the sweet pumpkin one, it is really sweet. S: It is.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.540
M: It actually has a honey texture. S: Mmmhmm yeah, definitely.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.720
M: Like it's really thick. Like when you pour it, it's like  gelatinous almost.  S: Mmmm

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.560
M: I still would probably go for the sweet pumpkin, actually. S: Yeah.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.020
S: We love "patbingsu," like this is great if you have it with the ice and everything. But on its own, I think it's a little bit overwhelming.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.240
M: It's a lot of bean.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.960
S: And then (some name) said, "and my (arks?)."

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.120
M: and then that's how the fellowship was born.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.440
M: and then they journeyed together and then they destroyed the brass bowls...

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.520
S: So that's it for this week's Food Adventure Program For Awesome People!

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.660
M: I feel full.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.620
S: We had... M: And I feel full...

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.980
S: Too many beans. M: and I (something). Yeah too many beans.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.920
M: Umm, if you guys do come for this kind of food, I really recommend this chain because they do it right.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.280
M: Because it's not from a can, or it could be... S: I can't...I have no point of comparison because this is my first time trying it so...

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:15.560
M: I've had it before at other places and it was like, sugar, sugar, sugar sweet. This place is awesome, so look for the Traditional Brass Bowl. And (Hamu?) style housing.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.760
S: Come to Korea.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.120
S: There's so much traditon. M: Touch the brass balls...bowls!

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.120
S: Nananananananananananana.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.860
M: I don't know what you are singing.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.060
S: Nananananana

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.380
M: Oh, he's trying to sing Lord of the Rings. That's sweet.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.920
M: Let me do a better version for you.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.120
S: (Still nananana-ing)

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.740
M: (Proceeds to do the better version)

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.500
Both: (Fusion of good and bad)
