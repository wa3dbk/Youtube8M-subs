00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:21.180
Today we're showing you how to properly assemble
the Kill Shot Game Cart.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:32.480
Parts for assembly include Upper Frame Assembly,
Lower Frame Assembly, Side Rails, Axle, Lock

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.440
Pins, D-Pins, Hair Pins, Washers, and Wheels.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.239
Parts needed for step 1 include Upper Frame
Assembly and Lock Pins.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.690
To begin unfold and fully extend the Upper
Frame Assembly.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:10.180
Secure the Cart Handle in place using 2 Lock
Pins.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:19.420
Parts needed for step 2 include Lower Frame
Assembly, Axle, Washers, and Hair Pins.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.040
With the U-Shaped tabs facing down, align
the Axle Mounting Tubes and slide the Axle

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:48.170
through one side of the cart.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.420
Slide 2 Washers onto the Axle end that is
through the first Mounting Tube.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.390
Next, continue to push the Axle until it runs
through the Axle Mounting Tube on the other

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.890
side of the frame.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.540
Move Washers along the Axle so one is on each
side placed against an Axle Mounting Tube.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.670
Close to each Washer you'll find a tiny hole
that runs through the Axle.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:20.180
Secure Hair Pins through each hole.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.680
Parts needed for step 3 include Wheels, Washers,
and Hair Pins.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.019
Place one Washer on each Axle end that extends
outside the frame.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:41.040
Next, mount a Wheel to each Axle end, followed
by another Washer.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:03:16.829
Secure with Hair Pins.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:25.949
Parts needed for step 4 include Side Rails
and D-Pins.

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.870
Align the Side Rail mounting holes with the
mounting holes located on the upper and lower

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.430
U-Tabs.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:04:02.909
Secure with D-Pins.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:30.380
Repeat this process on the opposite side.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.260
