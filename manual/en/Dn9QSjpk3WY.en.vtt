Joey: Ah! Good day everyone and welcome to today's video!

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.620
Bet you didn't think that's how I was going to start today, did ya?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.120
No you didn't

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.200
Hair's gone wild

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.620
Joey's gone wild

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.360
WEEEEEEW

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.820
That's all you get

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.700
That's all the wild you're getting

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.240
Wolf, show them your nipples

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.200
Oh wait, you're a boy, you don't have nipples

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.280
I don't have nipples?

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.180
What? I don't have nipples! Oh my god

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.560
What do I do? I don't have nipples

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.540
Actually, he might have nipples

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.160
I'm not sure

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.020
Anyways, there's a lot of tape behind me

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.460
Taping up the walls

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.160
So, change of plans

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.380
The only walls that are being painted currently

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.880
Are gonna be that wall

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.000
And that wall

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.240
That's not taped up

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.060
Uhm, and I didn't like the lighter color

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.560
That I showed you guys yesterday

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.440
So I'm just sticking with this cool textured thing

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.060
It's gonna look like this after

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
This is how it's supposed to look

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.190
And here's like a close-up of the little thingy-ma-bobber

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.949
I don't know if you guys can

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.680
see can you see ya see it? Yeah,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.300
It's nice and shiny and shimmering, and splendidy.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800
*laughing*

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.960
Uh, so Daniel is helping me, uh, with the painting. And Wolf

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
is just sitting here trying to help, too.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.700
Wolf, we could put some paint on your brush,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.040
on your tail, and use it as a brush!

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.360
[In Wolf's voice] "No, I don't think I like that, actually.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.080
I don't know. I think I'm just gonna-- I'm just gonna lay here

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.720
and watch. I'll watch. Yeah.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.660
Oh, okay."

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.600
Oh yeah look at that motion.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.179

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.140

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.360
It feels nice and good like on my face as though

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.230
-[Daniel] Alright, get to work. 
-[Joey] *makes primal laughter*

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.490
JOEY: Daniel come smell it it smells so weird. Come here. Get over here and smell it.
DANIEL: Hold on.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.410
Smell the little brush.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.580
Bleh, I don't like it.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.650
It's like shaving. Yeah.  I'm nervous because I've never done this before. But here we go.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.520
D: No, start at the top. 
J: Start at the top?
D: Yeah, you have to start at the top like the video said so

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.200
[Both talking at same time]

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.810
D: Yes, you know how to climb a ladder?
J: Ready?
D: Top top up

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.700
J: No i'm gonna do it where I want,  how I want.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.280
D: Do it from top-down.
J: It doesn't make sense if you go like this.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.980
D: You have to go, OK, there. Sweetie, do it on the side.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:44.560
Yay. There you go. Okay you're not coloring the rainbow. Do it in little strides.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.560
There you go, dear

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.759
D: Okay, let the pro do it.
J: I'm doing it, I'm doing it. This is hard.

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.080
D: Cover those nipples up, you pig.
J: Cover them up with a little bit of paint.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.680
D: Ew.
J: What? She likes it.
D: Pornstar.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:17.800
Check it out! It looks like suede. So crazy, it looks like someone just, like, wiped a suede thing a bunch of different ways. Which, I think is so cool.

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:22.600
I was just gaming a little bit. But, I
don't know, I think it looks so freaking cool.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:30.600
It literally looks like a suede wall, I'm obsessed. I love it soy latte mucho. Mm mm.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.640
[howls] OK. So, I feel really stupid

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:40.619
because i freaking bought this thing
online thinking that it was like just

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:46.300
almost like toothpicky thickness of
six combined to make that wolf. But no!

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.300
It is a sheet of plastic. The picture was
deceiving. [SIGH]

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.500
Anyways, this is what the outside looks like right now. Freaking crazy. The grass is gone. No more grass.

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:02.779
Sorry grass. But my turf is coming in. Um..  so anyways I'm going to end the video here.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:10.500

J: I don't know. Haha.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.800

J: Haha.
