00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:02.342
- [Voiceover] The planets!

00:00:03.386 --> 00:00:04.742
Mercury.

00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:08.513
Mercury is the closest to the Sun.

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:10.636
Because it's so close,

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:14.394
a year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days.

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:18.153
Did you know that Mercury has wrinkles?

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.817
It has a molten iron core that cooled down,

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:25.028
making the outside contract and look all wrinkly.

00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:27.012
Venus.

00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:31.301
Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system,

00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:33.182
and there are more volcanoes on Venus

00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:34.975
than any other planet.

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:39.695
A day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days,

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:43.536
while a year only lasts 224 days.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.303
This is because it takes Venus

00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:47.403
longer to spin all the way around

00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:50.033
than it does for it to go around the Sun.

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:52.394
Earth.

00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:56.316
Our planet Earth is the only planet

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:59.158
not named after a Roman god or goddess.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:01.555
People used to believe that the Earth

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:03.715
was the center of the universe.

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:06.873
It wasn't until the 1500s that Copernicus

00:01:06.873 --> 00:01:10.222
realized that the Sun was the center of everything.

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:12.579
Mars.

00:01:14.527 --> 00:01:18.581
On Mars, the Sun looks only half as big as it does on Earth.

00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:23.178
Did you know that Mars is nicknamed the "Red Planet"?

00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:27.187
This is because it is covered in rust-colored dust.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.070
This is the same dust that causes

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.989
some of the most violent dust storms in the solar system.

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:35.867
Jupiter.

00:01:37.707 --> 00:01:42.090
Jupiter is over 300 times bigger than the Earth.

00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:44.475
And that big red spot?

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:46.887
It's actually a huge storm!

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:52.614
A day on Jupiter lasts only nine hours and 55 minutes.

00:01:54.183 --> 00:01:55.548
Saturn.

00:01:56.922 --> 00:02:00.559
Did you know that you can see Saturn without a telescope?

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:03.161
It looks like a really bright star.

00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:05.407
And with binoculars or a telescope

00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:07.973
you can easily study this planet.

00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:12.768
Saturn's rings are made up mostly of ice and carbon dust,

00:02:12.768 --> 00:02:16.338
and it has more than 60 moons orbiting it.

00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:18.696
Uranus.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.252
Did you know that the moons of Uranus

00:02:22.252 --> 00:02:25.314
are named after characters written by Shakespeare?

00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:28.452
It's also the coldest planet,

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:31.205
and is so far away that only one spacecraft

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:33.039
has ever flown by it.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.456
That was the Voyager 2 in 1986.

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:39.147
Neptune.

00:02:40.704 --> 00:02:42.488
Gravity on Neptune is almost

00:02:42.488 --> 00:02:45.188
exactly the same as it is on Earth.

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.027
But if you tried to stand on Neptune,

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:48.548
you would sink right to the center

00:02:48.548 --> 00:02:51.583
because it's just a ball of gas and ice.

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:52.925
Neptune does have some of

00:02:52.925 --> 00:02:55.694
the strongest winds in the solar system.

00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:58.230
They're eight times stronger than

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.875
the worst hurricane winds on Earth.

00:03:02.311 --> 00:03:03.642
Pluto.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.806
On Pluto, gravity works differently,

00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:11.022
so a 100 pound person would

00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:14.518
only weigh 6.7 pounds on Pluto.

00:03:15.823 --> 00:03:19.900
Pluto is the smallest and iciest planet in our solar system.

00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:24.552
It's actually so small, that in 2006 it got demoted

00:03:24.552 --> 00:03:27.729
and isn't technically a planet anymore.

00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:32.415
It's okay, Pluto, I'm not a planet either.

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.897
Thanks for watching!
