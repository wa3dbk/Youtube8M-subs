00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.790
Hey what's up guys, Sean Nalewanyj of EliteImpactLabs.com
here and today I want to talk about the concept

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.600
of hardgainers and hardgainer workouts.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.170
So the term hardgainer typically refers to
those with a fast metabolism, a smaller bone

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.860
structure and who generally have a tougher
time packing on muscle size and strength.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.500
Browse the online forums and facebook pages
and you'll see these quote unquote "hardgainers"

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.450
seeking out specific advice for their situation.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.630
What is the best hardgainer workout routine?

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.319
I'm a hardgainer and I need a good meal plan
and what supplements are recommended for hardgainers

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:38.550
etcetera.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.289
Now my advice here would be to drop your "hardgainer"
label altogether.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:49.339
Yes, there's no question that genetics do
play a large role in determining how slowly

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.190
or how quickly sombody can build muscle and
yes, it is true that some lifters will require

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.489
more time and patience in order to build the
physique that they're after.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.929
But whether you're a naturally gifted bodybuilder
with elite genetics or you're starting off

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.790
on the complete opposite side of the spectrum,
the same basic muscle building principles

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.680
are still going to apply.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.300
You need to train hard in the gym using correct
form and focus on progressive overload by

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.010
adding more weight to the bar over time.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.830
You need to create a proper calorie surplus
each day that involves high quality sources

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.030
of protein, minimally refined carbs and healthy
fats.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.950
You need to understand which supplements will
help to accelerate your progress and which

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.610
ones to avoid.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.230
You need to track your progress.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.640
You need to remain focused, remain motivated,
and stay consistent to your program over time.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.430
Calling yourself a "hardgainer" and seeking
out a specific hardgainer workout or meal

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.670
plan or supplement approach is not only totally
unnecessary but it also backs you into a corner

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.820
and leaves you with the false background feeling
that gaining muscle is going to be next to

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.409
impossible for you.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.259
Sure, you may not have been particularly blessed
in the department of muscle building genetics,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.369
but so what?

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.950
How does paying attention to that fact do
anything at all to move you forward towards

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.950
achieving your goals?

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.540
As with anything in life, you need to put
your focus on the things that you can control

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.069
and forget about the things that you can't
control.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.170
Pre-occupying yourself with your genetic makeup
is a complete waste of time because absolutely

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.889
anyone can achieve a strong, impressive, muscular
body if they truly want to.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:41.529
The only difference is that for some people
the process may be longer or shorter.

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.639
And whether you have "good genetics" or "bad
genetics", so to speak, the overall structure

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.450
of your bodybuilding approach is essentially
going to be the same.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.810
There really are only two primary factors
to pay attention to in terms of structuring

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.390
a muscle building approach that is tailored
to your specific body type.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.279
The first is going to be your overall calorie
intake.

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:08.700
So in order to build muscle, you have to create
a calorie surplus by consuming more calories

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.560
than you burn each day and this is accomplished
by finding your calorie maintenance level

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.370
and then increasing it by about 15 to 20 percent.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.769
And you can use our automated macronutrient
calculator over on EliteImpactLabs.com to

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.420
determine this for yourself and I'll link
that in the description box below.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.779
As a general statement, those who are naturally
skinny and refer to themselves as "hardgainers"

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:37.900
may tend to burn through energy at a faster
rate and will tend to have higher caloric

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.329
needs for building muscle.

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.340
However, even this is a general statement
and will not apply to every person in every

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.390
situation.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.400
And the second is going to be your ability
to recover from exercise.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.500
The basic goal when structuring a workout
plan that is ideal for you is to train as

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.989
often as possible while still fully recovering
in between sessions.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.019
The more workout sessions you can perform
and recover from, the more muscle building

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.069
"growth periods" you're going to create and
the more overall mass you're going to gain.

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.150
Those carrying the "hardgainer" label may
also tend to be those with less than average

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.159
recovery ability.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.100
As a result, they may need slightly less volume
per workout and slightly lower overall training

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.670
frequency in order to optimize their gains.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.110
However, this will also vary between individuals
and is something that each lifter has to experiment

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.570
with on their own.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.930
So, the bottom line here is that if you're
consistently coming back to the gym stronger

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.020
over time and you don't feel overly run down
or fatigued, then the overall workload that

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.410
you're using is within an acceptable range.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.360
And for most people this will involve 3 to
5 total workouts per week hitting each muscle

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.100
directly 1 to 2 times per week.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.810
So just find your individual calorie, protein,
carb and fat needs, structure a workout plan

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.520
that allows you to properly recover and make
consistent strength gains over time, and simply

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.850
move forward from there.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.230
Forget about the idea of being a hardgainer
altogether because it really doesn't help

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.120
you in any real way.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.520
