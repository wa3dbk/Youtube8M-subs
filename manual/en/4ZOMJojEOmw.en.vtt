00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.290
JAISAL NOOR: In Detroit, Michigan, the city
many consider the epicenter of the nation's

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.510
subprime and foreclosure crisis, banks continue
to evict residents from their homes at an

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.740
alarming pace.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.090
But over the past year, a growing grassroots
movement has blocked evictions and kept families

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.420
in their homes.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.650
Now some of those helped by the movement are
taking the reins of its leadership.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.380
JERRY COLORS: This is my home here.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.820
I'd like to welcome you to it.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.250
You know, come on in and see how it is.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.960
NOOR: Detroit resident and retired factory
worker Jerry Colors is proud of the home he

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.320
shares with his wife and daughter.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.079
COLORS: We bought this home, like I say, some
23&amp;nbsp;years ago, and we did a lot of improvements

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.079
on it here.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.410
NOOR: Colors added an expansion to his home,
redid the floors, and put a fresh coat of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.910
paint on the walls.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.340
But after living in and fixing up his home
for more than two&amp;nbsp;decades, Colors arose

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.770
to a jolt the morning of October&amp;nbsp;31 last
year.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.890
COLORS: We woke up, and a dumpster was sitting
right on the side of the house over here.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.130
You know.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.909
We were shocked about it, 'cause we didn't
know anything about it.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.470
We never received anything in the mail or
by phone as to what was going on.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.470
You know.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.649
NOOR: Under a 2007 Detroit city ordinance,
a dumpster must be on site for evictions to

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:26.850
proceed.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.960
Colors knew he had to act fast, so he reached
out to a neighbor who had faced similar difficulties,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.190
who put him in touch with Occupy Detroit and
a group called the Eviction Defense Committee.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.869
Dozens showed up that morning to help block
the eviction.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.820
COLORS: Before the bailiff came up, while
the dumpster was sitting there, we had a bright

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.400
idea as to the way we were going to stop them
from using the dumpster was to fill the dumpster

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400
up.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.020
And so we said, what are we going to fill
the dumpster up?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.909
So we started looking around.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.880
We had bags of leaves out here, all of them
down in the neighborhoods.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.480
So we got all the bags from all around the
streets around here, and we filled the dumpster

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.439
up with bags of leaves so they couldn't use
it.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.610
NOOR: By filling the dumpster with leaves
and using their bodies to block the movers,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.860
Colors and his supporters succeeded in blocking
the eviction.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.660
They then held rallies and marches and successfully
pressured Bank of America to refinance the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.660
mortgage.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.769
Colors has now become a leader in the anti-eviction
movement and chaired a recent meeting where

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.860
many facing eviction come to seek community
support.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.160
Among them was Rashida McDuffy, who shared
the story of how her aunt was recently evicted

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
from her home.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.140
CLIP MCDUFFY: Well, on Friday she received
a letter saying that she would be evicted.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.909
It was not signed by a judge.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.530
It didn't have a date.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.170
It was just kind of haphazardly sent to her.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.770
And on Tuesday, this coldest day, she was
greeted by a bailiff and several men who proceeded

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.989
to put all of her things outside.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.080
NOOR: Lawyers and activists at the meeting
said because she was a renter, McDuffy's eviction

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.360
was illegal, and the group vowed to support
her case.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.580
Despite the challenges of keeping up with
Detroit's high rate of foreclosures--currently

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.379
about one in every 500 homes--activists have
achieved a number of victories.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.950
They have helped family caregiver Jennifer
Britt, who had worked for nearly two years

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.260
to save her home yet still was served with
an eviction notice.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.680
Community organizer William Brice says dozens
of residents and neighbors held vigil on her

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.000
property and used their vehicles to prevent
the delivery of a dumpster.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.730
WILLIAM BRICE: We had cars prepared to block
the dumpster here at the corner.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.720
We had cars prepared to block the dumpster
if it came around off Grand River.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.019
We had cars down at the other corner prepared
to--we had cars down at the other corner prepared

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.890
to block the dumpster.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.040
And we had cars all the way along here on
both sides of the street.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.101
NOOR: The activists prevented the eviction,
Britt eventually secured a new mortgage, and

00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:14.470
like Jerry Colors, she's now helping save
other people's homes.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.549
Brice says people from labor, religious, civil
rights, and peace groups have all participated

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.200
in the anti-eviction movement.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.880
BRICE: And it's an incredible cross-section
of people who have come together in ways that

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.890
I have not seen in this city before.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.210
JIM DWIGHT: It's that they see it every day
when they come home.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.350
That's why they get together.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.280
NOOR: Jim Dwight is a member of the anti-eviction
campaign and president of his community board.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.870
DWIGHT: What can we do?

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.880
We've got to--I can't do one thing alone.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.190
But with a group of us, we can do things,
and we are doing things, and we are being

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.530
successful.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.680
We haven't lost a house yet.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.950
NOOR: Dwight says at least 20 homes have been
saved from foreclosure in the past year.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.950
Housing rights advocates in Detroit aren't
just stopping individual foreclosures; they

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.240
are suing financial institutions for refusing
to modify loans.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.510
One suit filed last July targets the Federal
National Mortgage Association, also known

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.410
as Fannie Mae, and what's called non-judicial
foreclosure.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.800
Plaintiffs claim that it's unconstitutional
to foreclosure on homes without a hearing.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.970
Attorney Jeffrey Goldberg with the group Moratorium
Now! filed the lawsuit.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.780
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: --in court, we've been [incompr.]
because the government now controls these

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.320
loans, everyone should have the right to a
hearing before their home is foreclosed upon.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.120
In 25 states, including Michigan, we have
what's called non-judicial foreclosure.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.490
All they have to do is post a notice of foreclosure
on your door, and then wait four weeks, and

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.230
they sell your home [incompr.]

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.470
You never get a hearing.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.470
You know.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.640
And when you try to go to court afterwards,
they say, well, you've already lost your home,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.640
it's too late.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.810
NOOR: While that case makes it way through
the judicial system, residents of Detroit,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.930
including Jim Dwight, say they'll continue
their work to keep people in their homes.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.540
DWIGHT: We have come together and really rolled
up our sleeves and said, we are going to go

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.040
to court, we are going to go to these homes
where people are potentially going to be thrown

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040
out of their homes.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.090
We are not going to let anyone take away someone's
home.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.090
We're not going to do it.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.630
We're just drawing a line in the sand.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.500
And we're willing to go to jail.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.470
NOOR: Activists launched a new campaign this
month calling on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.160
to stop all eviction and foreclosure proceedings
and negotiate with homeowners on principal

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.160
reduction.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.280
They say Fannie provided relief to Hurricane
Sandy victims, and Michigan families are victims,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.120
too, "of mass unemployment and mortgage banking
fraud."

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:55.130
