00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
(lively music)
(button clicks)

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.917
(gentle guitar music)

00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:10.790
- There's a couple considerations

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.310
when you're choosing a
site for your chicken coop

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.060
and your chicken run.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.548
The chicken run should be
five to 10 square feet in size

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:22.300
for birds, for chickens

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.650
for larger birds closer
to the higher amount.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.280
You want the site to be
relatively high and dry.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.490
If it's in a low spot that
collects a lot of frost

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.720
or collects a lot of water,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.270
that can wind up for messy conditions

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.900
and a poor quality of life for the birds

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.100
and trouble for you when you're trying

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.600
to clean the thing out.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.350
It needs to be built like
Fort Knox, quite honestly.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.620
A fence is really important
to try and keep predators out.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.360
Chickens are a pretty low
place on the ol' food chain,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.550
and anything with a backbone

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.500
and sharp teeth is gonna wanna eat 'em.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.410
I don't recommend chicken wire.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.480
I recommend a 1/4 inch hardware cloth,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.880
something that's heavy-duty.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.200
Make sure that the fence is
actually buried 12 inches down

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.160
and then toed out another six inches

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.280
in order to prevent digging predators

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.160
from going underneath and
into your chicken run area.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.480
Ideally, you're actually gonna
wanna have a protective fence

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.250
or protective strings over the top

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.920
of the chicken run as well.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.410
It's entirely possible
for swooping predators

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.890
like raptors, owls, and hawks
to get into a chicken run

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.713
if there's perches close by.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.380
A fence, a wildlife mesh,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.500
or even some zigzag
string will prevent some

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.570
of those swooping predators

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.900
from getting into your chicken run.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980
Lastly, just from a
biosecurity consideration,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.710
it's wise to have a
dedicated pair of footwear

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.690
that you're gonna be wearing

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.230
into your chicken coop and chicken run,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.850
and don't use those in other
people's coops and runs.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.120
The possibility of
transferring disease is real

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.180
and we wanna maintain healthy chickens

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.370
both for the backyard enthusiasts

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.463
and for the commercial
flocks around the state.

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:06.898

(button clicks)

00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:07.917
(note chimes)

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:10.584
(logo whooshes)

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.980
Bare minimum, you wanna
have one and a half

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.393
to two square feet per bird.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.040
Bigger birds, probably even
a little bit more than that.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.510
Make sure you keep the thing
raised up off the ground

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.790
so as not to be in
contact with water or soil

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.900
for an extended period of time

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.240
and rot the building materials.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.670
Inside that coop, you're gonna

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.440
need a couple of major things.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.540
One, nest boxes.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.070
Nest boxes are where the chickens

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.120
are gonna have privacy to lay their eggs.
