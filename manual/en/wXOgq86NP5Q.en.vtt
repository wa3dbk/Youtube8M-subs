Grrrrrrr! Thanks Lara, I use her to focus, the, camera...
For the shot...

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:13.433
**Music plays - A song that will one day save the 
 world from crazy ass sea lions with jet packs. 

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:19.754
Hey what's up guys! And welcome to the Minecraft Monday 
 Show!
Holy hell it is so cold in here!

00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:24.685
One day, one day we'll be able to 
 afford heat!
Never the less, here we are!

00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:24.685
One day, one day we'll be able to 
 afford heat!
Never the less, here we are!

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:29.321
Now Minecraft news wise, there's actually only really one 
 article. 
That someone just kinda wrote on. 

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:29.321
Now Minecraft news wise, there's actually only really one 
 article. 
That someone just kinda wrote on. 

00:00:30.088 --> 00:00:32.856
Giving their opinion on why Minecraft is bad for gamers. 

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:40.129
Mostly just them giving their opinion why they think procedural generation 
 and how it's become the staple "goto" for developers.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.201
I mean, yea ok, yea there's a lot of 
 games that have procedural generation now. 

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:49.355
But really? mehhh, it's a little over the top.
But honestly, that's 
 your only real news thing that's going on. 

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:55.069
So in other words, lets get supporting our Minecraft community!
If 
 there's anything awesome you wanna send me. 

00:00:55.195 --> 00:01:01.096
If there's anything awesome you wanna send me, hit up my Twitter
or my 
 Facebook. Or, anything else, send me mail, that's a thing. 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.237
Only if you send VHS though!

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:08.387
Ahhh I'm just trying to stay warm!
Wrap my body around you!

00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:13.820
First video, is all about a snowball gun! 
 Who cares if Christmas is over. Right?

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:19.022
But this is greatly animated! And by that I 
 mean
it's animated really well and smooth and awesome!

00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:23.820
And also this guy has like no subscribers, so be sure to check 
 this out and hell DIAMONDS TO YOU in his comments. 

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:26.636
And freak him out wondering "What the hell just happened?"

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:30.877
AH yesss, even more small youtubers helping to support them.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.458
Check out this one called "The End game". Enders, Enders game?
THAT'S A MOVIE

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:41.020
The Ender parody! Eminem song featuring Rihanna.

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:41.020
The Ender parody! Eminem song featuring Rihanna.

00:01:41.354 --> 00:01:45.340
Assassin Creed fans you guys are going to love 
 this!
It's called "The Great Haycard Escape" 

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:51.000
This is actually really witty, and it's pretty long for 
 an animation!
As it took them about 5 months. 

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:57.620
All about hanging out in a hay cart. It's just really clever and I 
 love how they did this. As a big Assassin Creed fan myself. 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.480
And again! Another insanely small youtuber, be sure to check these guys out!

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:06.750
Well finally a parody for the Coldplay song Paradise

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:09.620
Took this guy 1/2 a year to make! And 
 it does have a sad ending. 

00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:12.200
So prepare your feels!

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.970
But now it's time for me to unpoop your Mondays. 

00:02:14.974 --> 00:02:18.640
Because it's time to show you awesome things that are fully downloadable. 

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:23.430
In this segment I like to call "HOLY $#17 DID YOU SEE THAT?"

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:24.110
It's freakin cold!

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:24.110
It's freakin cold!

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:28.650
All fully downloadable, now it's not always about the big giant builds. 
 But also small detailed ones like this Air Ship. 

00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:34.160
A really creative designed airship that you can go 
 ahead and copy paste into your skies. 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.090
Next up I found for you, Pagoda, Spring and Autumn edition. 

00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:42.220
it's sitting on the edge of Spring and Autumn 
 Gorge. 
Which is a massive terraform map. 

00:02:42.223 --> 00:02:46.560
This is the first kind of Pagoda they've ever built. 
 
And you can probably expect more out of them

00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:54.800
And if you love tall builds 252 in height, then here 
 you go.
This is a desert monument. Whooo! Beautiful build. 

00:02:54.805 --> 00:03:00.920
Now this almost looks like it could be spawn maybe of 
 a server.
Or if they don't need to go anywhere....

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:04.300
That giant circle is really high in the air, 
 It's not going to be very helpful. 

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:04.300
That giant circle is really high in the air, 
 It's not going to be very helpful. 

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:04.300
That giant circle is really high in the air, 
 It's not going to be very helpful. 

00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:14.770
And finally, the Burn Minster. Recreating the city of Burn. 
A really nice 
 detailed build not too over the top anywhere to be honest

00:03:14.773 --> 00:03:17.920
Now one of my favorite segmen... They're all my favorite segments

00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:19.180
MOD TIME! 

00:03:19.184 --> 00:03:25.720
Alright now this one IPodMail found, because I don't have a lot of time 
 to check out every mod and give you a great review. 

00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.530
But I do have time to find them for you though and consolidate. 

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:35.500
This is the Dubstep gun mod that iPodMail found and did a review.
Oh my 
 go... I love the dubstep gun, i love all the saints rows. 

00:03:35.502 --> 00:03:41.960
Well now you can bring them into Minecraft!
This comes 
 with 3 different dubstep gun modes. 

00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:46.250
One for mobs, one for every block, and then 
 in general, 
more sub sub gun.
