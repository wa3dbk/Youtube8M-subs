This is Josh with Blog of Speed, and today
we're going to do a little gear review.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.130
Now, a lot of you guys out there use GoPro's,
like me, and you have this GoPro factory suction

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.130
cup mount.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.859
Now the adjustments on this, you stick it
on the car, loosen these knobs, and then you

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:28.769
can rotate the unit like so, rotate the head,
like so, and also you can pivot the head up

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.400
and down.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.610
I found this really inconvenient sometimes
when you want to get a high angle, low angle,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.890
just different shots, and this was a bit frustrating
to work with.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.760
The suction cup however, um, it does stick
on really well and I still use this as a dent

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.320
puller, no joke, it works really well for
that.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.500
Now this is what I replaced it with.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.010
It's by a company called RAM, it's made in
the USA, as are all RAM products, and RAM

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.240
makes mounts for everything from GoPros, to
GPS units, to even police laptops.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.860
So I wanted to give you guys a little review
of this unit, um, I have two of them, and

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.600
really, I couldn't do my videos without them.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.450
So, here's why the RAM mount is so good.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.079
You unscrew one screw on the side, and you
can articulate the bottom part in virtually

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.049
all angles, and the top part as well, in virtually
all angles.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.509
In addition to that, it has this little ball
mount for your GoPro so you can still pivot

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.719
your GoPro up and down.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:47.850
Regardless of what angle shots you need, you
can do crazy angles like, like this if you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.030
need it.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.389
It's especially good when getting creative
shots on cars, when dealing with different

00:01:53.389 --> 00:02:01.799
car windshields, and it's really a lot better
than a normal mount, because it's less constrictive

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.359
and you guys can be more creative.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.280
So, I just wanted to show you guys what the
RAM mount looks like, and tell you a little

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.619
about it, it's also fairly inexpensive.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:20.140
It's under $50 for this, well under $50, and
it's also modular, so you can add different

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.290
ball mounts for 1/4"-20 connectors for flashes,
microphones, GPS units, anything you can think

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.510
of really.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:37.540
RAM makes, like I said, laptop mounts, GPS
mounts, cup holders, docking stations, console

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.790
mounts, they make a lot of stuff and I've
been really happy with my RAM products and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.310
I figured I'd share it with you guys because
I'm an independent film maker just like you,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.799
and this has let me get the most out of my
GoPro.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.440
So uh, thanks for watching, and I'll see you
next time.
