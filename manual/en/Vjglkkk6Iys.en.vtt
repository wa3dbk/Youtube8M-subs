00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.970
At this point, we have our instrument set.
Our lights set. It is framed in the camera.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.100
We know where everything is. We have got all
the lights on. At this point, all I really

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.410
want to do is I want to go into the camera
and make sure I have everything set properly

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.779
for the kind of image and the kind of details
that I want. So, one of the first things I

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.380
want to do is within the camera I have gone
to the menu on this. And now, I am going to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.630
move down to the WB, white balance and slide
over in the menu to see which kinds of light

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.050
balances there are. And, luckily on this camera,
I can actually see what happens as I shift

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.330
the white balance from; auto, to daylight,
to cloudy sky. Can you see the shift? When

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.750
we put on cloudy sky, it shifted into a pink
for the background. If we move down to the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.710
next one, tungsten, it turned the, the background
turns blue. And, if we move to the fluorescent,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.900
it has a slightly pinkish orange cast. The
closest to pure white appears to be the auto

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.530
function, which is a little bit bluer than
the daylight function. Probably as a result

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.900
of that fluorescent light right there. So,
we will leave it on auto. We will set it to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.560
auto. And then, let us move down to ISO. Now,
why would we want to adjust the ISO on a digital

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.870
camera? It does not really make any difference.
In film, it makes a big deal of difference

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.351
because you have to put a four hundred speed
film in a camera and set the ISO if you are

00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:43.049
running under, using fast film. Or, you might
have to set it for sixty four speed ISO if

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:51.080
you are shooting, say, Kodachrome. And, the
ISO makes a big deal of difference in that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.370
digital, or, in that film realm. Whereas in
the digital realm, it is, what is the point?

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.130
The film, there is no film. So, you do not
have to worry about the ISO or the speed of

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.200
the film. Why would we want to adjust the
ISO on a digital camera? Well, because the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.450
ISO in the digital camera has to do with its
speed. The speed that it can capture an image.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.620
The speed that it can capture an image affects
the F-stop or the size of the opening required

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:32.370
in order to let the light in. So, we would
want to adjust the ISO, in order to adjust

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.440
those things that are affected by the size
of that opening. The most important of which,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.450
in this particular case, is being able to
control the depth of focus.
