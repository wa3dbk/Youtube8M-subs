[SOUND]
In

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.400
this video, we're gonna be introducing
prime contract change orders.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.010
We'll begin by navigating to the prime
contract tool.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.380
[MUSIC]

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.270
Here across the top, we see the sub-tabs
that make up the prime contract name tab.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.560
[MUSIC]

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.220
We've already set up some default
financial markups.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.630
So let's click on the financial markups
sub tab to see how this is done.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440
These are edited by clicking the edit
button.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.260
Here is where you set up your default
values for prime contract change orders.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.500
As you can see, we have already set up
overhead and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.740
profit with an 8% mark up and our bond at
1%.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.240
Let's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.540
get started by clicking on the change
order sub tab.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.400
In Procore, change orders are managed
through a three tier hierarchy.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.360
Change orders begin as a potential change
order.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.890
This is where the cost is entered by
building out line items.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.190
Potential change orders are then rolled up
into a change order request.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.970
Once your change order requests have been
approved, they're

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.590
once again rolled up into a prime contract
change order.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.630
Once a prime contract change order has

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.179
been approved, the overall budget is then
modified.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.110
In order to generate a potential change

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.200
order, change order request, or prime
contract change

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.120
order click on the corresponding orange
button

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.410
on the right hand side of the screen.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.150
Let's start by creating a potential change
order.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.390
First we will enter in a title and then we
can select a status.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.050
We can also create the change order
request, and prime contract change order,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.310
that the potential change order will be
rolled up into at this time.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.320
For the purposes of this demonstration,
you

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.220
will choose to create the change order
request.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.590
[MUSIC]

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.390
You'll also see that our accounting method
is inherited from the prime contract.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.660
Here, we can enter in a description,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.580
indicate who the request was received
from,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.500
indicate any schedule impact, and attach
any

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.650
files from your computer or from ProCore.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.790
[MUSIC]

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.000
At the top, you will notice our breadcrumb
trail.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.030
This is an easy way of always being able
to tell where you are in Procore and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.470
to be able to navigate back to a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.040
higher level simply by clicking one of
these links.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.370
Save your changes and let's continue to
build out

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.330
our potential change order by adding some
financial line items.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.740
We will begin by navigating to the
schedules

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.560
a values tab, and by clicking the edit
button.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.610
We will now enter in a financial line item
for division

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.840
16 electrical for a new subpanel in the
amount of $22,000.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.830
We will then click add.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.010
You will now see the amount we entered in

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.980
at $22,000 listed here for the new sub
panel,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.260
Procore automatically calculates our
overhead and profit and our

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.520
bond based on the financials that we just
set up.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.890
Now let's go out and get some vendor
pricing.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.920
I will now click on the create RFP button
next to the electrical sub contractor.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.740
[MUSIC]

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.720
As you can see, Procore has already
created this RFP.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.530
In a later video, I will show you how

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.060
to forward this on to your subcontractor
for pricing.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.170
Now, let's go up one level for the list of
change order requests.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.240
As you'll see, both the potential change

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.419
order and the change order request were
created.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.880
The change order request contains only the
one potential change order.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.870
Now let's drill into the change order
request.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.380
Let's assume that we have received
approval for this change order request.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.340
By clicking the edit button, we can mark

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.370
the status of this change order, as
approved.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.430
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.100
As you will see, this has also changed

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.380
the status of the potential change order
to approved.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.100
Now, let's go back to our change orders
tool.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.750
Now that we have the two approved change
order

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.840
requests, we're going to create a prime
contract change order.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.250
We'll start by entering in a title,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.700
selecting a due date.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.730
And selecting our owner from the drop down
list.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.990
We can enter in any other information and
then we

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.010
will select our change order requests from
the drop down list.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.750
You can attach any relevant files from
your

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.470
computer or from Procore, and let's go
back to

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.080
your change orders tool to look at how

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.820
our approved changed order has affected
our overall budget.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.420
If we click the PDF icon, it will print
our prime contract change order to PDF.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.830
We can also go back to the general sub tab

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.859
of the prime contract main tab to view our
financial summary.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.670
Here across the bottom we can see

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.930
our original contract price, or total
approved change

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.930
orders, our advised contract amount, our
total impending

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.020
change orders, and our impending revised
contract amount.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.870
We can also click to view the budget

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.639
summary report which summarizes all of
this information.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.950
This concludes our introduction of prime
contract changer orders.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.200
If you have any questions, you can contact
our support staff or browse our

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.840
forums by clicking on the support button
in the top right corner of the screen.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.200
