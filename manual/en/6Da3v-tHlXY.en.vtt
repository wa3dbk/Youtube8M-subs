00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.760
What up Undertoads and toadettes, if I haven’t
mentioned it yet, I’m a huge fan of gaming

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.100
nights with your friends, and this game is
right up there in my personal favorites when

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.910
it comes to playing with a roomful of people
looking for bragging rights.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.410
I am totally in love with games where you
partner up with someone and ride out the night

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.230
with he or she in a gaming tournament for
better or for worse.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
And if you’re on my team in this game, its
for the better.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.670
This is Summer Heat Beach Volleyball for the
PlayStation 2.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.230
During you journey across the country in your
Summer Heat U.S. Tour, or simply against a

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.390
friend in an exhibition, you’ll find that
the movements of the players are one of the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.950
best qualities of the game.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.501
It’s not a real stiff motion, but overall
your players handle well when going for a

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.220
spike on offense or for a diving save on defense.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.500
Mainly, what I love about this volleyball
game is being able to change the direction

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.330
of a spike at the last minute while airborne
by hitting the triangle button, but watch

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.330
it!

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.030
If someone expects your change in direction
close to the net they can block it, and since

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.610
your still somewhat in the air during the
block, the timing is perfect for your opponent

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.840
since you’re going to be out of position.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.110
In other words, you’re ****!

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.520
Music tracks in the game are very appropriate
given the beach scene of the game.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.450
You can sit back and just let them play through
since they’re mostly all enjoyable.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.090
What I like with the music is they allowed
you to pick whatever song you want whenever

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.500
you want by hitting pause to change it.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.340
Some of the tracks, however, are really irritating
to the point where I have to change the song

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.720
immediately!

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.810
But if you’re having a gaming night, you
can really just hit mute and put on your own

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.810
tunes.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.619
I’m not talking down the creators playlist
for the game, I’m just saying that a little

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.990
Bob Marley suits this game perfectly!

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.390
So for now, I guess I have to settle for Sum
41…

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.650
The unlockable characters are a little extreme,
but hey, as long as its fun I really don’t

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.650
care!

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.450
My favorite hidden player is the Enigma since
he looks like the matrix screen that they

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.570
watch in the real world.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.312
But if you’re going to play this with your
friends I’d establish first whether or not

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:21.510
a person is allowed to be one of these unlockable
characters because if a player on a team plays

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.650
as one of these characters and someone on
the other team doesn’t, to put it lightly,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.910
the team that simply chose characters that
are given to you at the start of the game,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.360
are going to get their asses kicked.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.810
Plain and simple.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.980
The unlocked characters are just too good.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.200
I found that if one person plays as one, everyone
should to keep it fair.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.000
If came down to it, I think Incognito could
take two people at once.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.540
I mean, her stats are just through the roof!

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.260
My friends and I have a rule, if you’re
going to be incognito or the Enigma, then

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.489
your partner has to be Tia since she straight
up sucks!

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.190
Sorry, Tia…

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.220
And if I haven’t mentioned it yet, I’m
all about the bonus mini games.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.840
Just as long as they’re fun obviously.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.870
I mean, if the mini game sucks they why even
put it in the game?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.870
Seriously!

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.860
I’ve seen mini games that are worth less
than an autograph from Corey Feldman.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.880
But that’s not the case here.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.000
This game is a party time game to the fullest!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.599
Not only is the volleyball gameplay sweet,
but you can also play three other games as

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.599
well.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.220
From my experience, the most fun is the Beach
Bowls game, which is actually Bocce ball but

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.290
played with beach balls.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.750
It’s a game of determination against your
friends to get that damn ball as close to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.890
the jack as you can.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.080
So if you’re a fan of multiplayer games
and unlockable content that allows you to

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.360
do more than just what the game was intended,
then this game was made for you.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.239
So in honor of the design of the Enigma, I’ll
wrap this up in Matrix terms, when it comes

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.730
to summer heat beach volleyball, without question
or hesitation, I recommend that you take the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:04:05.879
red pill.
