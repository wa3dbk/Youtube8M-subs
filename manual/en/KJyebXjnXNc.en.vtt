All right. It's that time of year again for pumpkin pies and candy apples,

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:10.157
which is probably why this pin is garnering a whole bunch of attention these days.

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:14.307
Suggested by InternetFad, Lena, Candace, MD Jester, and a bunch more of you,

00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:20.631
it's this delectable, delicious, glittery Jolly Rancher coated candy apple

00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:24.949
that you can simply make by melting some Jolly Ranchers and adding some edible glitter.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.891
Well this looks [beep] delicious. I picked myself up a couple apples, a package of sticks,

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.029
a small oven-safe dish, a crap ton of grape-flavored Jolly Ranchers,

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:38.556
and lastly some edible glitter. First I de-stemmed my apple and proceeded to pop in my stick.

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:44.163
That sounded weird. I just put the stick in the apple. Next, I unwrapped my Jolly Ranchers

00:00:44.163 --> 00:00:48.935
and I put them into my pan which, as instructed, I put into my oven at 250 degrees.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:53.144
After 10 minutes and not much melting, I raised the temperature to 350.

00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:57.474
Fifteen minutes later, I had a hot, bubbling pan of Jolly Rancher syrup.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.420
That's when I took my edible glitter and mixed it all in. Let's talk about edible glitter for a minute.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.561
It's a bunch of [beep], whether it's edible shimmer, glitter, sparkles, or whatever you get.

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:10.936
The effects are pretty underwhelming. Not really too much of a sparkle.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:16.241
So keep that in mind. Yeah, so as you can see, there's really no sparkle or glitter action whatsoever,

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:20.425
which is kind of a bummer. Now this stuff cools really fast, so I had to put it back in the over

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:23.869
another couple of minutes until it was syrupy again. Then taking my apple,

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.255
I carefully dipped and spun it around until I got a nice coating. Now beware, this stuff is super hot,

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:34.010
so don't burn yourself like an idiot. It's definitely drippy and a little bit messy,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.691
but I just kept spinning it around the apple until it was cooled and hardened.

00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:44.773
And this is what it turned out like. You know, I'll admit that my technique probably isn't the best.

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:49.069
This is the first time that I've really candy coated an apple, so I did an all right job I think.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.701
But I definitely didn't get that glitter effect, which I really wanted. So I wanted to try one more apple.

00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:59.796
This time I thought to myself, all glitter is pretty edible. Right? It's just whether or not you decide

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:04.801
if you want to eat it. And if you want to [beep] sparkles for a week.

00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:09.363
With that thought lingering over my head, I melted another batch of Jolly Ranchers,

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:15.273
added some regular, run-of-the-mill craft glitter, mixed it up, and mm-hm, there it is.

00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:21.273
There is the sparkle that I was looking for. Mm-hm. I thought so.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:25.186
I took another apple and carefully coated that one in my new mixture.

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:30.039
Dipped it, spun it, and now that is what I'm talking about. Huh?

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:36.458
Look at that. I'm definitely pretty excited about eating this. It's a littleâ€”a little on the hard side.

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:40.480
You know, but I've been drinking my milk. I've got strong bones and teeth. I

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.578
I think I can do this. All right. Here goes nothing.

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:48.826
I've got to find a good spot here.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.296
Huh.

00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:09.273
[choking]

00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:16.983
