00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If there is a God

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:07.000
At night, you come into my dreams

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
like walking into your own garden

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and though my wings have grown

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I shall not be missing from your side

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If there is a God...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Thousands of angels with their white 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
are sharing out twigs of forgetfulness

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and from my body, like stars

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
your own children are drawing breath

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If there is a God

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
All my friends, for years now

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
have paired off, have built homes

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
only for me, it still stands open

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
without a roof, the one and only the truth

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If there is a God

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
may you burn in flames

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and from my teardrop, may you drink fire

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:37.000
you can not, my heart, go on forgiving a life

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
If there is a God and if someone loves me
