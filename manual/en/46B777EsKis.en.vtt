00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:23.460
I got a call from a certain Henry Homeowner.
Circuit Detective here. You short 'em, we

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.170
sort 'em. Hey, Larry, um, look, I've got some
trouble over here. Some lights and outlets

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.070
went out. And now my wife'll be home in two
hours, and I know she's going to blame me.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.000
Why would she blame you? Well, she knows I've
done some rewiring around here. She's just

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.030
going to blame me and want an electrician
to come in here and fix things. I asked if

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.270
he had checked the circuit breakers. I made
it clear to him that you can't judge a breaker

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:01.100
by how it looks -- that you have to push each
one very hard OFF before you reset it to ON.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.740
OK, I've gone and reset all the breakers,
and there's no change. Maybe one of those

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.429
outlets with the little pushbutton thingy
on it has gone bad. A GFI? I doubt it. They

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.969
only kill power when they’re working. Besides,
they’re mostly for outlets, and you've got

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:28.480
lights out too. Then what's wrong?I'd say
you have a poor connection somewhere along

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.520
that circuit.
So how do I find that? Well, let's try the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.600
Jiggle Method. The Jiggle Method? What's that?
The idea is to try and disturb the poor connection

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.100
back into working for a moment. Here's what
I want you to do. Find a table lamp and turn

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.720
it on. Then unplug it, so that it will work
the instant you plug it into a good outlet.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.850
Only, I want you to plug it into one of your
bad outlets. OK, I can do that. I waited while

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.729
Henry got a lamp and plugged it in. I told
him an old-style bulb in the lamp is better

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:14.720
than a fluorescent. OK, I'm all set. Now what?
First you need a way to keep track of whether

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.220
your lamp ever flickers on for a split-second
or more. Is there anyone at home with you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.170
who can watch that lamp like a hawk? Yeah,
my kids, but they don't know about this little

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.000
outage and I don’t want them spillin' the
beans to their mom, y’know what I mean?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.510
OK then, you're the man. So you'll want to
get an extension cord plugged in instead of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.200
the lamp and then the lamp plugged into the
cord -- so you can take the lamp around with

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:56.520
you, so you can see if it flickers on for
just a second while you are jiggling. OK,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.460
I'm ready Now what you do is you take something
else that'll plug in -- another lamp, a coffee

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.740
grinder or a nightlight -- and I don't care
if it's turned on or not. Take this around

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.510
to each of the dead outlets. And as you plug
it into them, wiggle the end of the cord from

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.960
side to side a little bit. If the lamp you
are dragging around with you ever flashes

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.900
on or stays on, then the bad connection is
at the outlet you were just jiggling. OK,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:04:00.680
cool, I'll try that! Yeah, Larry, um, nothin'
happened. Well, don't worry. There's more

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.100
you can do. Think about other outlets in the
area, especially ones that are maybe closer

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.020
to your breaker panel than these dead ones.
Go and do the jiggle in them now. Are you

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.000
saying that the bad connection can be at an
outlet that works? You're catching on, Watson.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.389
Think about it. If a wire that's to feed on
from a working outlet is poorly connected

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:49.180
there, it will affect only the things it is
supposed to feed. OK. 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.629
Yeah, Larry, your special Jiggle Method is
not working. Well, it doesn't always work,

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:03.949
but we're not quite done. There's more wiggling
you can do at the switch boxes or even light

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:14.219
boxes. In the same general area of the dead
items and toward the panel, take the covers

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:22.389
off of switches and try to disturb the wires
behind the switches by poking at them with

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:44.710
something non-conductive, like a wood dowel
or a chopstick. I'll wait. Larry, you won't

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.210
believe this! I was poking behind the switch
for the hallway light, which works, and my

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:59.520
sidekick, the lamp, came on. Well, I believe
it, Henry. So now turn all your breakers off,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:07.599
loosen that switch up, and redo the connections
in that switch box -- any wires that are connected

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:16.129
to the switch, plus any connected in the colorful
plastic wirenuts that hold those wires together.

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:21.680
And that'll do it, Henry. You sure? You sound
like we're all done. Don't leave me. Well,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.340
yes, I'm afraid there are others who need
me more than you now, Henry. You’ll be just

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:35.580
fine. OK, Detective. That was great! Thanks!
Sure. And if your wife needs to know anything,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.009
tell her I don't think it was your fault,
it was just an electrical fault Hey, thanks.

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.280
Goodbye. Goodbye, Henry.
