00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
The President: I thought
I'd get the Cabinet

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.100
together this morning
because we all know that

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.800
America will be
busy this afternoon.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.800
(laughter)

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.800
Go, Team USA.

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:14.734
About the halfway point
through this year,

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.667
we can look back and see some
enormous progress that

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.066
we've been able to
make on the economy.

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:23.233
We continue to create jobs
with over 9.4 million

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:26.400
created over the
last several years.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.633
We're continuing to see
improvement

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.967
in the housing market.

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:33.734
We're continuing to see
real progress

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:38.367
in terms of the energy sectors.

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:41.367
But what we also know is,
is that there's

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:43.300
so much more that's possible.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.166
And part of the reason
that I wanted to bring

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.900
the Cabinet together today is
to underscore

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.467
for them my belief I think
shared by most Americans

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:58.867
that we can't wait for Congress
to actually get going

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:03.600
on issues that are vital
to the middle class.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.066
We've already seen the
power of some

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.133
of our executive actions in
making a real difference

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.166
for ordinary families --
whether

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:15.300
it's on minimum wage for federal
workers -- or for workers

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.800
who are with federal
contractors; equal pay;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.433
and the terrific work that's
being done around climate

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:26.900
change so we're transitioning to
a clean-energy economy.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.200
But what I'm going to be
urging all of you to do,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.567
and what I'm going to
be continually pushing

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.033
throughout this year and
for the next couple

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:40.133
of years is that if Congress
can't act on core issues

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.667
that would actually make
a difference

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:46.166
in helping middle-class families
get ahead, then we're going

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.533
to have to be creative about

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:50.533
how we can make real progress.

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.233
Keep in mind that my
preference is always going

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.266
to be to work with
Congress

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.233
and to actually get legislation done.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.667
That's how we get some
more

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.934
of the permanent fixes.

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:03.567
And as I mentioned
yesterday with respect

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:06.300
to immigration, whatever we
do administratively

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.233
is not going to be sufficient to
solve

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:10.533
a broken immigration system.

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.333
The same is true when it
comes to infrastructure.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.100
We'll be talking a little
bit about how we need

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.200
to renew the Highway
Trust Fund.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.700
But, more importantly,
we could potentially

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.567
put people to work all across
the country,

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:27.033
rebuilding roads and bridges,
putting construction

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:28.900
workers back to work.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.333
That could boost our
economy enormously.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.333
And now is the time

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:36.433
to do it, but that requires congressional action.

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:40.834
And so we're always going
to prefer working

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:43.533
on a bipartisan basis
to get things done.

00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:47.000
That's what folks expect
out of Washington.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.233
They're not looking for
excuses and they're

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:53.800
not looking for a lot of
partisan sniping.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.000
But if Congress is unable
to do it, then

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.300
all of our Cabinet members here
-- and the head

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.300
of big agencies that touch
people's live in all sorts

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.400
of ways -- and I'm going
to be continuing

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.800
looking for ways in which we can
show some real progress.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.333
And the second topic that
we're going

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:13.100
to be spending a lot of time
talking about is how

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.467
to do we continue to improve the
functioning

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:17.567
of government to make it more
customer-friendly.

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:20.567
This is something that
we've been working

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:23.000
on since Sylvia
was head of OMB.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.300
This is something
that Shaun

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.000
will be prioritizing.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.567
I expect every agency to
look

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:34.500
and see how can we get more bang
for the buck in the agencies

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.333
that we operate.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.667
And I know that many
of you can report some

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:42.767
significant progress in
reducing paperwork and

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:46.300
bureaucracy and red
tape for projects

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.867
and initiatives around the
country in education,

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:51.800
in energy, in housing
and in transportation.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.800
But I think we can
do even better.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.800
So I'm looking forward to
getting a report

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.967
from you on the progress
that has been made.

00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:02.333
And hopefully we can share
some ideas

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:05.200
to see if we can make even
more progress.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.934
The bottom line is this: I
went to Minnesota --

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.467
many of the press here
accompanied

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:13.767
me -- and had a wonderful
conversation with folks around

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:16.166
the country who are doing
their jobs every

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:18.233
single day -- raising families,
working hard,

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:23.567
contributing to their communities.

00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:27.433
And their hopes and
aspirations

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:31.900
are my primary focus and should
be the primary

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.600
focus of this town.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.133
They are extraordinarily
cynical

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:39.433
about Washington right now, and
rightfully so.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:43.834
They just don't see any
capacity

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:45.934
by Congress to do anything.

00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:48.033
We've seen a Congress that
said no to increasing

00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:52.333
the minimum wage; said no to
immigration reform;

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:55.500
has said no to equal
pay legislation.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.600
The only thing they
seem to say yes

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.266
to, the Republican in the House
at least, is more tax breaks

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:02.900
for folks at the top.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.900
And as a consequence, the
people who sent us here,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.300
they just don't feel as if
anybody is fighting

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.834
for them and working for them.

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:16.400
We're not always going
to be able to get things

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.967
through Congress, at least
this Congress,

00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:19.967
the way we want to.

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:23.633
But we sure as heck can
make sure that the folks

00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:27.600
back home know that we're
pushing their agenda

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.266
and that we're working hard
on their behalf

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:31.000
and we're doing every single
thing

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.166
we can do to make a difference in their lives.

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:37.233
So I want to make sure
that we emphasize

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:40.066
not what we can't do, but what

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:43.300
we can do in the coming months.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.300
Thank you very
much, everybody.
