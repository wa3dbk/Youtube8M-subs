00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.440
Sony Xperia V.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.410
Expected Q4 2012.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.510
The Sony Xperia V is very closely related
to the Sony Xperia T, but with a few key differences.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.950
Firstly, the Xperia V is an LTE-enabled device,
it is also dust and water resistant up to

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:38.070
IP57 standards, however the screen is a little
smaller and there is less internal flash memory.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.780
Inside the Xperia V is almost identical to
the Xperia T, with the same processor and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.710
RAM configurations plus NFC support, although
it has half the flash memory at 8GB.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.760
It also shares the T's 13 megapixel primary
camera and most internal features.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.710
The display is a little smaller at 4.3", but
that's still quite large and it retains the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.989
720 x 1280 pixel resolution of its sibling.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:10.759
LTE means that the Xperia V can take advantage
of 4G networks where they are available, but

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.969
LTE coverage is still only available in a
few countries.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:20.020
However, it will work on 3G networks too and
it will get download speeds of up to 42Mbps

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.869
on HSPA+.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.040
GPS/GLONASS, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity
are all included as standard.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:39.060
Inside is a 1750 mAh battery, and the Xperia
V measures 129 x 65 x 11mm and weighs 120

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.080
grams.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.120
Sony say that the Xperia V should be available
from Q4 2012 onwards in black, white and pink

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.120
colours.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.500
No guidance was given on price although we
would expect this handset to retail for upwards

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.509
of â‚¬500 at launch.
