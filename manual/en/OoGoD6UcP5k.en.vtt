00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:03.799
My name is Mike Myers.

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.719
I am the owner of Legion Marketing; my expertise
is in nightlife.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.940
I believe that I know the best and brightest
of everything that's in Las Vegas.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.359
I can help you skip the lines, skip the bad
spots, basically cut the fat.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:26.739
Head and shoulders above the rest is the Wynn
Encore Resort and Casino.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.579
The regular rooms are spacious and the entire
tower of Encore is all suites.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.149
With an 18-hole golf course, two world-renowned
nightclubs in Tryst and Excess, and two smaller

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.149
clubs and lounges, and perhaps the most lavish
pool anyone's ever seen in Encore Beach Club.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.210
They actually built a mountain out front that
makes it look like the hotel sits on a lake

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.430
in Tuscany.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.600
The only foie comes in the restaurants which
seem a little flat and stuffy, but still excellent

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.649
quality.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.239
The Bellagio is second when it comes to service
and beauty.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.210
The dancing fountains remain the single greatest
attribute and a defining visual to the excellence

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.560
that is The Bellagio.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.460
The villas are big and the rooms are lush.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.290
The Bank Nightclub and Caramel Lounge have
been staples in the Las Vegas scene for years,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.700
and the restaurants are a 'Who's Who' in the
culinary world.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090
It's lacking a pool party or a pool scene,
really of any kind.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.270
I would guess that is going to be changing
in the coming years.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.439
The Cosmopolitan is the newest casino to be
opened in Las Vegas.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.610
Bringing most of its influences from New York
City, the crowd definitely shows it.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.799
It's young and hip, and losing money, despite
being packed at all times.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.729
The restaurants like STK and Scarpetta are
very popular, and so is its night club Marquis

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.039
and a pool by the same name.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.659
The hotel was originally built as a condo
hotel, so every room has balconies and kitchens

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.670
in them, but the service is definitely lacking,
and if you're not in the night life or the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.979
scene, there's little if any to do on property.
