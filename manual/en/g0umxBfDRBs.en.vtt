Advanced Automotive Electronics Course, Ignition
Coil

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.100
Ignition coils are in essence dual coils or
step up transformers. Here we can see the

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.830
current flow of the ignition coil. Current,
according to the new theory, flows from negative

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.460
to positive. Any basic coil circuit has a
driver or transistor associated with it. The

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.031
transistor acts like an on and off switch
and is found inside the E C M. There is a

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:44.220
driver transistor per coil, as in any modern
coil on plug ignition system.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.790
In this circuit we can see an F E T transistor.
F E T or field effect transistors are voltage

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.340
devices, as oposed to regular bipolar transistors.
F E T are faster and tend to be used more

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.920
readily on automotive applications. F E T
devices are also more delicate to handle,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.299
because they are prone to static electricity
damage. But, regardless they see a lot of

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.540
use on modern vehicles, whether as single
units or as chip set.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.920
Here we can see the actual current flow on
a basic ignition coil circuit. The coil circuit

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.750
seen here is signified by a single coil to
denote the primary of the coil. The secondary

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.340
or high voltage side in simply tied to the
spark plug. An L E D is also seen here in

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.880
series with the primary to visually show the
turn on point.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.610
We can see the nature of the input signal
at the base or gate of the transistor. In

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.630
F E T or MOSFETs seen here, a voltage on the
oxide insulated gate electrode can induce

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.729
a conducting channel between the two other
contacts called source and drain. The channel

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.969
can be of n-type or p-type and is accordingly
called an n MOSFET or a p MOSFET. It is by

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.609
far the most common transistor in both digital
and analog circuits, though the bipolar junction

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.619
transistor was at one time much more common.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.290
In our diagram, a small voltage signal creates
a larger value current to flow at the primary

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.290
of the coil. Remember that ignition coils
need current flow at battery or 13.6 volts.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.760
The input voltage is always the same, but
the circuit does provide the right amount

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:37.109
of current needed to produce the hight spark
voltage.
