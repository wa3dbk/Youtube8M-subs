00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.590
hello namaste

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.210
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.679
Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to
learn Kadhai pulao

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.570
you know very very easy but there is a
technique to do first thing is you have

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.210
to let the kadai become hot

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.529
you know usually they do tawa pulao also
same thing they want the tawa to be

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.939
really really hot

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.670
that's when they add onion, green chilli, and even green peas after they add this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.809
you know

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.780
while they mix this is when they add butter if you add butter first the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.010
butter will burn

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.649
so now the butter will melt and you can
cook this onion, green chilli and peas in

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.969
this we're going to add some salt and
we're going to toss this

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.140
ok you want that sizzling sound to come
so that when it is made in front of the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.460
people on the roadside

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.900
it should look good and the added butter
is they add with effect as if they are

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.360
doing the biggest favor by adding butter

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.540
so let this saute little bit now in this you know we'll add some more good

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.750
stuff add julians of spinach

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.990
yes and in this also we're going to add boiled potato just cut into you know small

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.479
pieces like this in this add chopped
tomato now

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.189
all of this need to sizzle in the meantime we're going to add some chili

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.740
powder some garam masala and just move the vegetables on the side and add

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.149
small

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.600
you know piece of butter in the center
and add turmeric on top

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.350
you know I am cheating because i forgot
to add turmeric

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.070
you know I get the raw flavor out at the same time get the good color out of

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.759
this

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.969
now you know we're going to add some
mint leaves, some chopped coriander and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.640
just mix all of this

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.269
now you just want to make sure that all
these vegetables are slightly cooked and

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.040
also

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:24.010
sizzling and tasty ok so let's check
this definitely needs some salt and the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.540
spice is just perfect

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.900
you don't need more of it so just mix it
and what we're going to do is since the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.819
vegetables are nicely cooked we are going to move all the vegetables on the side

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.430
like this now add little butter and also some spring onion squeeze in a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.500
little bit of lime juice

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500
you know how on the street they like to
do all kind of drama

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.220
so now top

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.060
top it off with some hot rice ok and now
you know you have to do the showmanship

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.609
of mixing all of this

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.480
along with that see the thing is you
should not break the rice

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:14.439
you should just you know mix it so that
that the rice is nicely mixed and hot

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.239
along with all this

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.530
wow that's good now our kadai pulao is
ready and also tasty

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.519
whoo-hoo and this is best eaten with
some raita and it will taste fantastic

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.750
when it is hot when it is raining when
it is sunny anytime

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.049
this kadai pulao is a favorite now you know just

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.560

good pieces of chili along with any kind

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.370
of raita

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.760
you know one of my favorite is the
radish raita I have recently posted

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.099
it do check and make radish raita along with this and taste it

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:03.129

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.510
out

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.229
unionized

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:13.329
yes I was thinking the radish raita will go pretty much with anything and it's

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:13.870
