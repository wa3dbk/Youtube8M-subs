Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com.
In this segment we are learning all about

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:14.940
how to transplant tulip bulbs. Now we all
have tulip bulbs that we get in pots at Valentine's

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.970
Day or the middle of Winter and they are beautifully
in bloom and then the blooms fade away and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.050
we don't know what to do with them. Well I
always say if you ever have tulips in a pot

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.109
or they are in an area of your garden and
you want to put them in a different area of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.350
the garden move them any time they are not
blooming so as soon as they are done blooming

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.790
is the best time to transplant them and they
are always very easy to transplant. So I've

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.969
got these tulip bulbs that were in this pot
and they are done blooming and I have watered

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.500
the pots for the Summer because you never
want to keep these too dry either because

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.910
I think that is the number one thing that
we use our tulips in the Northwest because

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.270
we never water them in the Summer. So we put
them in a bed that is far away or we leave

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.980
them in the pot and they dry out and just
cook over the Summer so a trick that I've

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.260
found is to actually keep those tulips watered
over the Summer if you live in especially

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.200
the Portland area where we get really hot
Summers any more and they will do a lot better

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.509
and now it is the Fall and I'm going to transplant
them into my garden so that I can enjoy them

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.759
in my garden next Spring so it is very important
that you plant them about three inches deep,

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.509
they don't need to be any deeper than that
and I'm just going to put them in groups of

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.149
three or more so you don't want to have just
one by itself because they have not done anything

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:40.119
wrong. You never put your plants in time out
so I'm going to put three of these tulips

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:48.371
in a triangle. Next year they'll be just gorgeous
right here. So the trick is to just transplant

00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:54.470
them and to plant them back where you want
them as soon as you dig them up. You never

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.700
want to leave them out of the ground too long
and if you do it is a lot easier to leave

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.780
them in soil or just put them in a paper bag
so that they don't get too wet or too dry.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.080
When transplanting your tulip bulbs make sure
to do it right away because you don't want

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.700
to leave them out of the ground for very long
and you want to keep them dry if you need

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.870
to but not too dry that they just burn up
and at the same time you don't want to leave

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.650
them in mud or somewhere where they are not
going to get any air because then they might

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.960
start rotting so then the safest place is
always in the ground. So when you transplant

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.660
tulips do it any time they are not blooming,
the Fall or the Winter of course is the best

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.870
time but any more I'm finding that my garden
has no rules and that I try to transplant

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.209
and garden year round whenever I get a chance
and that is always the best time.
