00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.279
June 19th...next week....

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:09.820
I'm turning...

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.709
fifty years old

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.110
50? what is 50?

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.110
"crappin old..?"  I always thought when I turned 50....I would have some good advice for the younger men....and now that I'm turning 50 I realize that I'm

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.539
just as clueless as I was when I turned 30 or 40....

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.029
i don't have any advice.....there's no
advice.....it's old.....when you turn 50.....

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.150
you're OLD!! You turn 50 you realize....I've lost my boyish good looks....

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.209
I've lost my hair.....I've  lost everything
except that

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:46.050
stupid pug....."me not stupid..?" Yeah you are....there are wonderful things about

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.470
being 50 years old

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.820
I just have no clue what they are but I've heard that there are good things...

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.880
I remember my dad used to tell me "Tom
when you turn 50...."

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.330
what did he use to say?

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.920
Buddy why do you just sit there staring at me?
"because" It's creeping me out!

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.409
well....look at this

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.700
I'm turning 50 and I'm already getting grumpy.... I'm a grumpy old man....I should probably just be happy that I didn't get the beer belly....

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.390
I'll tell you one thing...I'm not changing my
diet just because I'm 50.... I'm gonna

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.460
keep eating all the bacon I want and I'm gonna go to fast-food - mcdonald's whatever....

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.950
whenever I want to - it's not
gonna change my lifestyle.....ouch....

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.890
you guys do me a favor don't worry about
me okay im fine

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.939
even if i had an opportunity

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.340
to go back to any age I wanted to.....I would stay where I am because I don't want to louse it all up again....

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.749
So anyway

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:40.490
I'm going to end it all.....

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.560

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.650
