00:00:00.852 --> 00:00:03.946
(elderly voice) Dial up Internet's fine!
I downloaded a whole song

00:00:03.946 --> 00:00:06.864
- in just five hours!
- (Ian) SHUT UP!!!

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.248
Dude, are you sure this is a safe shortcut?

00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:13.315
Yeah, man. My inner Christopher Columbus
is navigating us safely.

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:15.093
That's a terrible example, dude.

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:17.571
Christopher Columbus didn't even 
end up in the right country.

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:19.860
And then he brought a bunch 
of smallpox and death and all--

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.243
No, dude! Freedom.

00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:24.396
He brought us all freedom.
I mean, look around you.

00:00:24.396 --> 00:00:25.649
This is...

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:26.789
Really!

00:00:28.648 --> 00:00:30.944
- Dude, it's an iPod Mini.
- (sighs)

00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:33.439
Haven't seen one of these since 2004.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:35.963
Yeah, that thing's ancient, okay?
Put it down and wash your hands.

00:00:35.963 --> 00:00:36.822
It probably doesn't even work.

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:38.568
Hold on. Let me just try it.

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:43.737
What?! I'm the iGenie and since you woke 
me up from my slumber, I'm gonna

00:00:43.737 --> 00:00:47.747
grant you three wishes!
Yeeeah! Okaaaay!

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:49.559
Holy sh*t. Is this real?

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.723
What should we wish for?

00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:52.577
Just think of your greatest desire.

00:00:52.577 --> 00:00:55.117
Like, if it were me, I would wish 
for a black president.

00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:56.696
Okaaaay!

00:00:56.696 --> 00:01:00.749
- Uh, yeah, about that--
- Okay, he's probably not up-to-date

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.455
about all the current events.
Probably been trapped

00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:04.467
in this piece of sh*t since 2004.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:08.534
Ooh, that's why he's doing 
the Dave Chappelle/Little John thing.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.684
Sorry, we've just been exposed to it
for a few years

00:01:10.684 --> 00:01:12.678
and it's really f*cking annoying.

00:01:12.678 --> 00:01:18.423
Um...well then, iGenie,
I wish for the biggest TV ever.

00:01:18.573 --> 00:01:20.839
Hella kazam!
Alakazee!

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:24.708
Get these pretty-haired dudes
a big ass TV!

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.238
What the f*ck is that piece of garbage?

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:32.345
What did you wish for?
The biggest TV ever.

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:36.018
Look, it's state-of-the-art,
and it's easily the biggest on the market.

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:38.812
It weighs 300 pounds!
Yeeeeah!

00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:39.734
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.661
There's LCD screens way bigger than that!

00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:43.750
Y'all got LCD?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.835
Yeah.

00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:48.271
Nah, bra. I can't do that anymore.

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:50.334
You raver kids are crazy!

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:55.885
Okay, um...how about we wish 
for something a little smaller.

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:56.746
Okay.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:00.233
- Give me the new iPhone.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:02:01.473 --> 00:02:03.740
Alakazam!
Alakazone.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.605
Get these tight bottom dudes
the most state-of-the-art phone!

00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:11.152
- (chuckles)
- What?

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:15.027
Now, I don't know what an iPhone is,
but it can't be better than a Razr.

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:16.491
'Cause that's the sh*t!

00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.800
Look, it flips and it's got
the best predictive text on the market.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.604
But you can't even shoot 
video on this piece of--

00:02:22.604 --> 00:02:25.422
What?! A phone that can shoot video?

00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:28.779
Okay, future space man guy.

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.389
No, seriously, they all do.
I can show you on YouTube.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.043
What's YouTube?

00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:35.309
You know, the place 
where you watch videos?

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.648
Ooh, like Blockbuster Video.

00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:41.239
Uh, no. Video rental stores
don't exist anymore.

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.577
Well, how do you rent your videos then?

00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:45.189
The Internet?

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.900
Like where I send my emails from?

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.553
- Well, at least he knows email.
- Yes.

00:02:49.553 --> 00:02:50.807
- Yes.
- That's a start.

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:53.862
Man, you know I love my hotmail.com!

00:02:55.312 --> 00:02:56.481
(together) What?

00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:00.495
I mean, it's totally cool if...
you want to look at...

00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:02.164
males online, but--

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:06.470
What?! No, no, man! No.
HotMAIL.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.090
Like the email site.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.073
Oooh, I see.
When you put the emphasis

00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:12.891
on MAIL it kinda sounds like
you're talking about hot dudes.

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.615
See, I don't know what 
you guys are talkin' about.

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:17.670
I say Hotmail correctly.
You guys are sayin' it wrong.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.622
- Hotmail.
- HotMAIL.

00:03:19.622 --> 00:03:21.320
- Hotmail.
- HotMAIL!

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.462
- Hotmail.
- HotMAIL.

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:23.840
- Hotmail.
- HotMAAAAIL.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.075
- Hotmail.
- HotMAIL.

00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:25.902
- Hotmail.
- HotMAIL.

00:03:25.902 --> 00:03:26.819
- Hot.
- Hot.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:27.852
- Mail.
- MAIL.

00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:29.283
- Hotmail.
- HotMAIL.

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:30.174
- (together) Hotmail!
- HotMAIL.

00:03:30.174 --> 00:03:31.180
- Hotmail.
- HotMAIL.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.027
You know what?
This is getting weird.

00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:36.173
Is it cool if we just wish 
for our last wish right now?

00:03:36.173 --> 00:03:37.252
Yeah, go on.

00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:40.024
Okay, I wanna go on a date
with Jessical Biel.

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:43.267
Uggh! The little girl from Seventh Heaven?!

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:46.796
Well, how about somebody hot,
like Lindsay Lohan!

00:03:46.796 --> 00:03:47.496
Yeeeah!

00:03:47.496 --> 00:03:48.563
- No!
- Ugh!

00:03:48.563 --> 00:03:49.182
- God!
- Seriously?!

00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:49.887
No!

00:03:49.887 --> 00:03:52.677
Okay...uh, Amanda Bynes.

00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:54.617
No, that's worse.

00:03:54.617 --> 00:03:58.607
Okay, what about, um, my girl Avril.
I know she's still bangin', you know?

00:03:58.607 --> 00:04:01.345
(singing) He was a skater boy.
She says, "See ya later, boy."

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:02.788
She married the dude from Nickelback.

00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:06.590
Noooooooooo!

00:04:07.123 --> 00:04:08.197
What?!

00:04:10.037 --> 00:04:12.888
I give up! You guys do
your own last wish.

00:04:13.488 --> 00:04:14.080
Really?

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.461
Yeah, I'm sick of this sh*t.

00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:20.019
I think I'm gonna wish for something like
to become famous on YouTube,

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.450
for having absolutely no talent
except good hair.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.632
Wait! No.

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:26.377
Haven't you seen Aladdin?

00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:30.443
We have to use our last wish
to grant the genie his freedom.

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:36.650
You know what? You're right.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.008
iGenie, I wish for you to have freedom!

00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:45.650
Hey, what the f-ck is this sh-t!

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.007
Dammit, dude! Your idea 
of freedom is smallpox!

00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:52.137
Ah, goddamn it!
I'm just as bad as Christopher Columbus.

00:04:52.137 --> 00:04:54.139
I hate me so much right now!

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.625
Just screw you guys.
Just get outta here!

00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:04.087
You know what? It's kinda crazy
how quickly we forget about

00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:07.674
all these things and they really 
only happened a few years ago.

00:05:07.904 --> 00:05:10.818
Yeah, it's like we're so obsessed
with the new technology

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:13.195
that we forget the classic stuff 
that was just fine.

00:05:13.195 --> 00:05:14.677
So you gonna keep that iPod?

00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:17.207
Hell, no! It's an obsolete piece of sh*t!

00:05:17.887 --> 00:05:20.526
(narrator) This video 
was brought to you by Hotmail.

00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:22.271
Hotmail. Remember us?

00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:23.563
No?

00:05:24.283 --> 00:05:25.175
Yeah...

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:26.541
No one does.

00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:30.986
(Anthony) Hey, guys, so we somehow 
got a calendar with our faces on it

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:35.134
in a bunch of real stores
and it's also available online,

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:38.170
so click here to get it if you want
our faces on your wall,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.830
watching you every moment
of every day.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.657
And if you wanna watch bloopers
from this video, and this...

00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:55.278

00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:59.021
(Ian) And if you haven't already, 
click that subscribe button.

00:05:59.021 --> 00:06:01.680
Yeeeah! What?!
Okaaay!

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.703
(Anthony) Oh my god! Shut up!
It's not 2004 anymore.

00:06:04.853 --> 00:06:05.781
(Ian) Uh, okay.

00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:06.921
