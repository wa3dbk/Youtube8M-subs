00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.060
If you are pregnant, you probably have received
information about cord blood banking. This

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.160
is an opportunity for you to bank your child's
umbilical cord blood. When cord blood is banked,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.730
it is stored so that at a later time, it can
be used when needed. There are several key

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.579
reasons why anyone should consider cord blood
banking.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.720
Cord blood contains very important cells that
can help to grow a healthy immune system for

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.510
someone who has fallen ill. Not only can this
cord blood be used for your child, but for

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.369
others that have the same type of blood and
tissue. Although cord blood banking is expensive

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:52.510
when done privately, it can be life saving
and this is often the reason to consider it.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.030
Cord blood stem cells can be used to treat
diseases and conditions such as leukemia,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.640
myelodysplastic syndrome, anemia, sickle cell
disease, inherited red cell abnormality, lymphoma,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.259
plasma cell disorder, neuroblastoma and myeloma.
Today, there are over 75 different diseases,

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.189
immune deficiencies and other conditions that
are treated with cord blood successfully.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.280
With the advancement of stem cell research,
there is likely to be more uses for cord blood

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.700
in the future.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.850
If there is a family medical history or your
child has a predisposition to any of these

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.000
diseases, you should seriously consider cord
blood banking. Parents of children of ethnic

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.520
or racial minorities and children conceived
through in vitro fetilization are encouraged

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.409
to bank cord blood as it is more difficult
to find bone marrow match in these cases.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.110
Only 50% of people that need a bone marrow
or stem cell transplant are likely to find

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.500
a suitable donor to provide it.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.280
There are two ways to store your baby's cord
blood. If you choose public cord blood banking,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.740
your baby's blood is taken from the umbilical
cord, stored cryogenically and can be used

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.380
by anyone that is in need of it. However,
cord blood that is stored in a private bank

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.010
can only be used for your child or other family
members when required.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.950
The cord blood banking process can be costly
for a private storage facility, starting at

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.510
$2000 but the protection that it offers far
outweighs the costs. In addition, many families

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.650
find that this is an ideal way to protect
the child as well as other family members

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.900
from potentially fatal diseases or conditions.
The ongoing stem cell research for treatment

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.780
of diseases is promising. Cord blood stem
cells offer great potential for treating more

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.030
auto-immune and degenerative diseases. Banking
cord blood can provide medical insurance for

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.849
your child or other family members now and
in the future.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.040
There are still not enough cord blood donations
taking place that will provide for the necessary

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.250
help needed to cure conditions like cancer
and leukemia. Yet, with more people considering

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.030
cord blood banking, whether privately or publicly,
it is likely that more miracles can happen.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.030
Through better education, more parents will
see the true benefits of cord blood banking.
