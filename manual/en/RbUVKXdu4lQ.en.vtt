00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.830
On the 24th of December every year children
around the world put out milk and cookies

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.069
in the hopes of luring a magic fat man into
their home who will leave presents behind

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.150
before sneaking into the house next door.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.879
How did such an odd tradition begin?

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.360
You can pretty much blame Northern Europe,
where the winter weather is cold and dark

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360
and depressing.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.180
And the coldest and darkest and depressingest
day is the Solstice on December 21st or 22nd

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.090
when the sun only gives a few hours of weak
light if any at all.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.590
These sun-deprived people invented magical
characters to visit them and lighten the mood

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.610
by bringing gifts and celebrations.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.830
These characters ranged from elves to Gods
to goats, but there are two of particular

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.430
interest to the modern story.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.130
The first is St Nick, in The Netherlands.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.820
St Nick is thin and perhaps a bit stern, but
still brings presents to children early in

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.820
December.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.010
He dresses like a bishop in red and white
with a staff and rides on a horse named Amerigo,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.580
for whom Dutch children are encouraged to
leave out a carrot.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.870
St Nick is called Sinterklaas in Dutch.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.090
The second character is Father Christmas from
England.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.680
Father Christmas is a big, jolly pagan dressed
in green with a holly wreath on his head.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.191
Traditionally he is less concerned with children
and gifts than he is with food and wine and

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.340
celebration and is perhaps best known for
being one of the three spirits of Christmas

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.140
who terrorize Scrooge.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.280
When Europeans settled the Colonies St Nick
and Father Christmas and the other characters

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.030
began to mix together.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.890
This explains why the US version has so many
names.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.070
Santa Claus is the Americanization of Sinterklaas,
but he's also called St Nick and Father Christmas

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.070
and Kris Kringle which comes from Germany.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.570
In the old world these were different characters,
but in the new world over time they evolved

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560
into one which you can see happening in older
stories.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.780
For example, the poem, "The Night Before Christmas"
came out in 1823 in New York which established

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.460
that Santa lands on the roof and fills stocking
with toys.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.690
But this Santa is an elf, much like those
from the Nordic Countries.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.930
He's very small and drives a miniature sleigh
with tiny reindeer -- which makes a lot more

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.820
sense for someone whose job description includes
fitting down chimneys.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.500
Also, the word, 'Santa' appears nowhere in
the poem.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.150
The original title is 'A visit from St Nick'.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.150
As the 1800s continued a fat, human looking
immortal Santa evolved into the standard among

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.150
American authors.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.810
It was in the states that he gained both his
elvish workforce and a wife.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.190
By about 1900 Santa had developed his current
iconic style.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.010
It should be noted that, contrary to popular
belief, Coca-Cola didn't change his colors

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.299
to their corporate scheme but instead used
the conveniently red-and-white Santa in 1931

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.369
to help sell more soda during their off season.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.340
Though Coke didn't create him their omni-present
ads probably did brand this as the One True

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.739
Santa in the minds of millions helping spread
him round the world to many cultures with

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.739
no traditions of winter gift-givers.

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.150
This American Santa in-turn influenced his
relations in Northern Europe to become more

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.580
like him, although not always to the pleasure
of the locals.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.120
In particular, the British Father Christmas
has been completely assimilated into the Santa

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.599
collective to the point where many Britons
don't realize they were ever separate.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.210
In the Netherlands, however, St Nick is still
successfully holding his own as a distinct

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.210
character.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.540
The one last detail about modern Santa that's
still up for debate, at least between countries,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.830
is where exactly he lives.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.630
In the late 1800s his home was the magnetic
north pole centered under the aurora borealis.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.310
While this would be the most diplomatic option
for Santa Magnetic North has since moved off

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.340
the Polar Ice Sheet and into the Ocean, a
rather inconvenient place to set up a toy

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.340
factory.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.090
So Canada claims his workshop is somewhere
in Nunavut and has given Santa a post code

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.819
and -- no joke -- official Canadian citizenship.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.230
The American response is that the North Pole
doesn't refer to the obviously inhospitable

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.230
sheet of non-domestic ice but rather to the
little town of North Pole, Alaska.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.620
Denmark claims he lives in their former colony
of Greenland.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.510
And Greenland, not surprisingly, agrees.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.981
The Nordic countries quarrel about his exact
location but Finland is the clear winner of

00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:17.120
this argument with his workshop in Rovaniemi
on the Arctic Circle.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.500
For the evidence inclined, you can actually
go visit Santa there and see the elves, toys,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.450
reindeer and post office, which makes Finland's
claim pretty strong.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.410
Santa is even available during the off season.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.240
But, no matter where he might be based, Santa
still manages to get round the world in just

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:51.540
one night to deliver all those presents...
and eat all those cookies.
