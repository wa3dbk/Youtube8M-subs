00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.070
Dynamic Language Tools is a bookmarklet application
which helps you write and read in your own

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.800
language on the web. Though currently just
the Urdu language is supported, but I plan

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.750
to add support for other languages very soon.
So, let's get started. To use this application

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.420
you first need to create and save a bookmarklet
of it in your browser. The steps are easy.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.429
First go to the site home page. Once you are
there, you can go to the Products page. You

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.440
will find the bookmarklet link in the "How
it works" section. In FireFox, you can create

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.240
the bookmarklet as easy as by just dragging
and dropping on the bookmarks toolbar, and

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.810
that's it.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.360
This bookmarklet creation process varies from
browser to browser. For example, in IE, to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.600
create the bookmarklet you need to right-click
the bookmarklet link and select Add to favorites.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.210
In the Add Link preferences dialog, if as
folder you select the "Links", then you can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.490
show these links as toolbar in your IE window
as well. For the Chrome, the process is again

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.749
very simple as you can the bookmaklet by dragging
and dropping the link to your bookmarks toolbar.

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:22.420
Once the bookmarklet is created, you can rename
it to something which is more familiar to

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.759
you . For example, I'm going to give it a
name "Urdu Tools".

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:38.429
After you have created and saved the bookmarklet
in your browser, you can test it by clicking

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.979
on the "Urdu Tools" link. When you do this,
it will show a loading screen. Now when the

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.429
loading is complete, it will show the main
preferences dialog. This dialog contains some

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.369
handy functions related to the transliteration,
information about the transliteration, and

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.789
the preferences. We will be discussing these
shortly in detail. For now, let's see how

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.359
this Dynamic Language Tools helps in reading
and writing in Urdu.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:15.860
After Dynamic Language Tools are loaded in
the web page, you can write Urdu in any text

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.050
box by doing a simple control-click i.e. holding
down your control key when doing the click.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.581
When you do this, you will notice an "I" sign
in the text box indicating that now you can

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:37.190
type Urdu in this text box directly. For example,
if I search for something like "Mirza Ghalib";

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.410
this will be auto converted to corresponding
Urdu Characters. And now I can also search

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:50.980
for this in the Google. You can see that Google
is now bringing the Urdu results.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.410
This Urdu writing technique nearly works on
all the popular sites on the web. For example,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.900
while I'm on the facebook, then I can load
the Dynamic Language Tools by clicking the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:14.950
bookmarklet. After it's loaded, I can write
in Urdu to set my status. Like "Papu Yar Tang

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:26.800
Na Kar". Which means don't annoy me. I can
chat with my friends in Urdu. Again, I will

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:43.220
do a control-click. As you can see it's being
transliterated into Urdu. You can also give

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.740
comments on Wall in Urdu. There is one trick
though. It's an RTF. Which mean it's a Rich

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.350
Text Editor, and currently you can't directly
type/transliterate in this text box. There

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:17.180
is a workaround though, and that's first you
type whatever you like in the text-box. After

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.780
you have added the comment, you can highlight
and do a control-enter. When you do that,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.190
the text will be automatically transliterated
into Urdu and now you can share it with your

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.070
friends.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.110
Dynamic Language Tools application not only
helps you in the writing, but it helps you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.700
in the reading as well. For example, I'm on
the UrduPages.com, and I find a Ghazal which

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:51.320
is written in Urdu (Roman Urdu). Now I can
convert this to the corresponding actual Urdu

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.940
characters by highlighting this, and clicking
on the "Transliterate Selected Text" button.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:06.060
Now transliterating is in progress. Now you
can see that text has been automatically transliterated

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.120
to the corresponding Urdu characters. Once
the transliteration is done, you can also

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.200
review the words and correct them. For example,
this should be "Parayshan". Similarly, you

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:26.460
can review and fix the rest of the converted
Ghazal. If you rather convert the complete

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.250
page, then it's also easy. For this you just
need to click on the "Transliterate this Page"

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.860
button and it will start the transliteration.
This is a long process, so in the meantime

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:47.669
let's review the other preferences. In the
Urdu Tools, you can see preferences like the

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:55.740
Download link for the font. So in your case,
if you don't as neat font as you are seeing

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.590
in this video, then most probably you don't
have the Jameel Nori Nastaleeq font installed.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.139
If you like to try this font, then all you
need to do is click on the "Download" link

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.490
and follow the instructions on this page.
Give it a try. I have also added couple of

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.820
other popular fonts in the preferences. So
if you prefer "Urdu Naksh Asiatype" font,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:25.889
then you can use it. Let's try this. For this,
I highlight another Ghazal, and do a transliteration

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:34.410
with this new font. Now this Ghazal has been
transliterated, and is displayed in the Urdu

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.360
Naksh Asia type font.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:46.180
So using this tool you can not only Write
in Urdu on the forums, and your blogs, but

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.479
you can also convert most of the existing
content writing in roman Urdu to the corresponding

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.979
Urdu characters. Hope you like the tool. Thank
you.
