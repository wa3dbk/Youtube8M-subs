00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:15.333
(Oh, the Count!)

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.644
Death and war all over the world

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:19.143
I couldn't care less

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:21.968
In the rain forest trees get cut down

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.400
I couldn't care less

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:28.167
Dolphins in the tuna salad, how mean

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:32.660
But I couldn't care less

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.612
If the last whale decays on the beach

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.512
I couldn't care less

00:00:40.108 --> 00:00:42.220
Did the Backstreet Boys break up

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.188
I couldn't care less

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:48.052
And even if every politician was a pig

00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:52.043
I couldn't care less

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.604
You dance with me, the world is beautiful
(the world is beautiful)

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.700
If you dance with me I couldn't feel better
(feel better)

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.652
You dance with me, the end draws near
(the end draws near)

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:12.364
If you dance with me I'm spared this whole misery

00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:17.884
Four million unemployed roughly estimated

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:19.757
I couldn't care less

00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:22.563
My favourite show cancelled

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:24.446
I couldn't care less

00:01:24.862 --> 00:01:28.091
And if they lead gas again tomorrow

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:32.244
I couldn't care less

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.634
You sit on me, the world is beautiful
(the world is beautiful)

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:41.731
If you dance with me I couldn't feel better
(feel better)

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:46.765
You dance with me, the end draws near
(the end draws near)

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:51.871
If you dance with me I'm spared this whole misery

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:58.531
I don't care
(I don't care)

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:02.819
I don't care
(I don't care)

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.411
I don't care

00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:09.146
I couldn't care less!

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:13.615
You sit on me, the world is beautiful
(the world is beautiful)

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:17.871
If you sit on me I couldn't feel better
(feel better)

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.995
You sit on me, the end draws near
(the end draws near)

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:26.089
Keep sitting on me and I promise:
I'll stay hard

00:02:26.364 --> 00:02:29.429
You look at me and you're horrified

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.490
You'd never thought I'd be like that

00:02:33.114 --> 00:02:36.538
I don't care about the world if you sit down on me

00:02:37.714 --> 00:02:41.290
Sit down on me, sit down on me

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:46.706
Sit down, you swine, you motherfucker,
'cause you're an asshole, hey!
