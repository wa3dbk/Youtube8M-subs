Hi, Guys and Welcome to Studio Knit.

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.740
Today, we are going to create a Slouchy Beanie
from The Fault in Our Stars Movie.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.249
I loved the EGGING scene in The Fault in Our
Stars Movie TFIOS movie so much.

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:23.820
It shows how through it all, Hazel, Gus, and
Isaac are just real kids.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.140
I thought it would be fun to knit our own
Hat like Hazel wears.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.120
Check out my written knitting pattern for
the slouchy beanie!

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.260
Once my beanie is complete, I am donating
it to the nonprofit Halos of Hope, giving

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.350
free knit caps to cancer patients for comfort.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.180
The links for the movie scene, pattern, and
Halos of Hope are in the description below.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:58.190
Oh, and please Hit LIKE if you know why I
am wearing dark blue nail polish.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.300
The Materials we will use are
Size 8 circular needles

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.890
4 Size 8 double pointed needles
Worsted Weight YARN

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.290
Tapestry Needle
Scissors

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.930
The Red Heart Super Saver yarn that I used
was on sale at Beverlys for only $2.98 and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.400
I only used half of it!

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.520
So, letï¿½s get started.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:36.380
First, we will Cast On 73 Stitches with Long-Tail
Method.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.830
Now we will JOIN in the round.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.660
As always, when knitting in the round, make
sure not to twist your stitches.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.430
We will knit two together to join, and then
Knit in the one by one rib stitch all the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:00.690
way to the end of the row.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.550
The one by one knit stitch is knit one, purl
one, knit one, purl one.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:17.720
So, we now will Knit in the one by one rib
stitch for eight rows and the brim will measure

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:30.870
approximately two inches.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.540
So now, Knit all rows in the round until your
entire piece measures nine or ten inches depending

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.670
on how long you would like your slouchy beanie
to be.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.569
Once you are ready to decrease, we will follow
the pattern to the left.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.960
So, remember, you can download the entire
written pattern for FREE from the link below.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.790
And we are going to decrease by knitting two
together and then knitting the required number

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.190
of stitches, and every even row will be simply
be a straight knit row.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.770
We will have a decrease row, a knit row, a
decrease row, a knit row all the way down

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.959
until you have just eight stitches remaining.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.940
Switch to double pointed needles when necessary.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.540
Now it is time to cut your yarn, weave through
those remaining eight stitches and pull it

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.050
tight.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:44.790
To finish it off, just Weave-in your ends.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.520

So cool.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.030
Bye.
