00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.969
Introducing the Scosche RAILkase, a rugged
impact protection case for iPhone 4 &amp; 4S.

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.119
This case offers full impact protection

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.509
while maintaining a visually stunning design.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.820
The aircraft grade aluminum rail protects your phone from blunt force,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.430
while the soft silicone interior absorbs
impact.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.300
Do not attempt to re-enact any of the
activities shown in this video.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.390
Your phone will be protected against
most potentially damaging situations.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.850
We put it to the test at this set at
of stairs at the local high school stadium. 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.960
The iPhone survived that huge drop with
no visible damage.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.940
Unlike its competitors, the RAILkase
offers a high level of protection

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.459
without sacrificing design.

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.510
The RAILkase comes with a
black and white silicone skin

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.499
to match your iPhone. 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.289
It is available in black, silver, red, 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:20.699
blue and pink. 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.689
The RAILkase is rugged yet refined. 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.819
