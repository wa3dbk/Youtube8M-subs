00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.020
Bellerbys Oxford is a college specialising
in Arts, Humanities and Law.

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.500
Oxford itself is a hub of education, so we
have people from all over the world coming

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.089
to study. One good thing about being a humanities
student in Oxford is there is a whole network

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.229
of people you can meet in Oxford.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.460
Our objective is to get our students into the best college possible for their abilities.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.100
We're very proud to say that we've had considerable  success in getting students into Russel Group
universities.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.320
I arrived here about three weeks ago and I
was completely foreign to Oxford. I came straight

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.230
to the school, I didn't know how to get to
my accommodation. They provided me with a

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.170
map, they drew how to get from here to my
accommodation which was really really helpful

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.340
and they were really really friendly, they
brought us on a tour round the school!

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.140
Bellerbys have made an investment in a whole
range of equipment to support the creative

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.929
needs of our students. We've invested in video
and filming equipment, we have a full Mac suite,

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.469
3D printing which we are extremely excited
about.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.539
Humanities itself, the investment made is for the Enrichment programmes, ensuring students

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.950
have access to outdoor activities.
We have a wonderful Enrichment programme which

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.270
is working alongside their studies, which
means that they are able to explore their

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.110
specialisms in more depth outside of their
classrooms.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.520
Oxford is a very good city for students to
come and learn in. For an international student,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.229
they have a great exposure, it's very student
oriented.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.259
We're very fortunate to be a part of a city
that is steeped in history. We have a full

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.270
range of museums, we have active theatres.
We have an enormously rich multicultural and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.879
creative environment from them to immerse
themselves in.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.180
My ambition was to become a lawyer, when I
came here I saw the programme I was going

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.950
to study. It gets me updated with the world,
and allows me to keep up with current events.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.230
We get a lot of speakers coming in, we've
just had Lord Bradshaw from the House of Lords

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.829
coming in to explain to the students what
goes on in the House of Lords. We've got parliamentary

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:35.159
candidates from the three main parties coming
in, solicitors, barristers, all of this will

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.640
supplement the teaching we are doing.
We're going to the Crown Court here in Oxford, and I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.980
think next week we're going to the Parliament
in London, so that's something for me to look

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.280
forward to and I'm really really excited!

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.219
My favourite part about Bellerbys Oxford is that I could approach my teachers any time
that I wanted and they're most likely to be

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.599
free for me. I could just talk to them as
though they were like my friends.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.219
After they've been here for a year, you tend
to get to know them very well, and I'm still

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.679
in contact with many students who've gone
on to university, and gone on to successful

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.519
law careers and they keep in touch which is
nice.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.290
It's really enriching for our course, because
it's so relevant to what we're studying and

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.480
what we're doing. It shows us what happens
in the real world.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.159
My favourite part about working at Bellerbys
itself is the variety of students we get from

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.609
all over the world. It really makes the place
very interesting, because it exposes us to

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.180
so many different viewpoints.
As Academic Director, one of the benefits

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.849
of my job is to watch students arrive at this
college, unfamiliar with the UK, and either

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.289
one or two years later, see them being capable and
well-equipped

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:50.329
to make the most of their further education opportunities.
