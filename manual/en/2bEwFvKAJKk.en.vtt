00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.930
[Music full]

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.350
NARRATOR: A new kind of designated bike lane

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.030
along M-10 in Oakland County, the first of its type in Michigan,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.950
is just one of the ways MDOT is working to accommodate all users

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.920
of Michigan's transportation system.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.450
The new bike lanes are located along M-10,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.100
also known as Northwestern Highway, between 14 Mile and Inkster roads in Southfield.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.880
The new lanes, called "buffered" bike lanes, help separate bicycle traffic from motor vehicle traffic.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.770
At intersections with traffic signals, the bike lane is moved to the left of the right-turn lane.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.030
These “keyhole” bike lanes help prevent right-turning vehicles from turning in front of bicycles.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.260
Before a resurfacing project on Northwestern Highway was completed in October,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.630
bicyclists primarily used the shoulder of the roadway.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.110
At other times, to avoid conflicts with vehicles at driveways, they'd use the travel lanes.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.010
JOHN LINDENMAYER: "With the buffered bike lane, it's really neat, especially for

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.860
roads like this that have higher traffic volumes, higher speeds.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.770
It helps create order to the road, it gives a little bit more space for the bicyclists.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.730
They feel a little more comfortable, which is ultimately going to encourage more cyclists to use this route."

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.640
NARRATOR: The new arrangement provides a five-foot-wide bike lane

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.350
separated from traffic by a seven-foot-wide cross-hatched buffer.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.350
The bike lanes also include special green-colored pavement markings at the right-turn lane.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.520
At these locations, the bike lanes continue straight,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.740
and right-turning motorists must either pass the bicyclists if it is safe to do so or yield to them.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.450
JOSH DEBRUYN: "The order that is created with a buffered bike lane

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.440
is essentially giving the motorist an understanding of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.470
where the bicyclist is going to be anticipated or where they're planning to travel.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.160
It also helps the bicyclist know where they should position themselves

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.450
so that the motorists know where they're going to be as well."

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.960
NARRATOR: The Federal Highway Administration provided funding for the project's innovative technique.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.200
The design meets national standards and extensive national research has found

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.310
that it can improve safety for bicyclists.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.820
MDOT recently added a second buffered bike lane on M-43 in Lansing,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.470
which the bicycling community has enthusiastically embraced.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.270
JOSH DEBRUYN: "The bike lane has been in for only a short time

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.210
and we know that bicyclsists are out here. We know that they're using the bike lane

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.710
but we want to monitor the actual usage. So, in the spring of 2013,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.290
we're hoping to collect bicycle traffic counts both on Northwestern and on Saginaw Highway."

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.050
NARRATOR: The new bike lanes are just the latest examples of how MDOT is working

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.790
to put the State Transportation Commission's Complete Streets policy into practice.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.920
In accordance with the policy, MDOT is designing and building roadways

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.030
for the safety and comfort of all users.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.896
More information on the new bike lane is available online.
