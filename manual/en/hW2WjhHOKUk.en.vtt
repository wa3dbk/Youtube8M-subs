00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.235 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
  - Now, one question
  I always get is

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:04.437 line:0%
  what the heck is in
  your pack, Coyote?

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.740 line:0%
So what we're gonna do today is

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.908 line:0%
 take off Coyote's pack

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.510
 and see what's in it.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.515
(dramatic music)

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.287
 So, this is my adventure pack.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:24.157
  This goes absolutely
  everywhere with me.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.826
And it changes based on
what location we're in.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.262
  So right now we are
  in central Ohio.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:31.164
We're in the process
of filming Dragon Tails

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.599
 and Coyote's Backyard.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.268
  So I've got my kit in here
  that's specifically designed

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.703
  for those locations.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.072 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Now, with Dragon
  Tails, specifically,

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:42.175 align:start size:88% position:13%
on the outside I
always carry my scales.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.779 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I've got my typical
  50 pound scale

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.948 align:start position:0%
   for most snapping turtles
   that we come across.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.984
  This is the hundred pounder,

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.286 align:start position:0%
 and it's what we use to weigh
 alligator snapping turtles

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.654
and the common snapping turtles

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.156
that are over 50 pounds.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.357
Now, this is the part of my pack

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.059 align:start size:88% position:13%
  that usually
  doesn't get too wet.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.594
This is where I keep my iPhone.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.630
   I use my iPhone for taking
   a lot of the photographs

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.666 align:start position:0%
   that you guys see on
   Instagram and on Facebook.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.002 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I also have a bandanna
 in there because

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.005
 for some reason I feel
 I may wanna wipe mud

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.540
off of my face.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.475
 We know I get mud all
 over me all the time.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:18.445 align:start position:0%
   All right, moving down
   to this part of the pack.

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.246
  This is something
  that I take with me

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.715 size:88% position:44%
   absolutely every
   location I go to.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.684 size:88% position:44%
   This is a snake bite kit.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:27.487
  Fortunately I've never been
  bit by a venomous snake.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.888 size:88% position:44%
   I've never had to use it.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.457
   But even in Ohio I
   like to make sure

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.724 size:88% position:44%
   that I have this with me.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.159
 I don't know how well it works

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.461
  because I've never used it,

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.763
 but if I'm ever tagged
 by a venomous snake,

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.398
I guarantee you, you
guys are gonna see this

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.499
  come out of my bag.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.534
And we'll find out if it works.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.703
 I have all these cool
 little packs as well

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.505 size:88% position:44%
   from T3 Tactical.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.873
  I love these things.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.341 align:start position:0%
   They're great for
   keeping all your gear in.

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.643
   This one I keep my
   Petzl headlamp in.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.112
   This guy's perfect
   for when we're out

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.247 align:start position:0%
 on the night adventures
 looking for snapping turtles,

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
 looking for creatures
 in the desert.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.417 size:88% position:44%
   You name it, this
   has been with me

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.085 size:88% position:44%
   on almost every
   single adventure.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.187
  Then I've got my rope pouch.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.989
 You never go out into the wild

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.024
 without some trusty paracord.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:08.495 align:start position:0%
  Just in case I need to hang
  something up in a tree,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.530
  I need to secure some tarps

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.098
  to keep us out of the rain.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.567
All sorts of uses for paracord.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.071
I also carry with me a
compass everywhere I go.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.873
And it also has a signal mirror.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.341 size:88% position:44%
   See that?

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.210
  In case I get lost, you can
  use this to signal for help,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.845
  and use the compass

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.647
  to help get yourself

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.682
  out of any lost situations.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.886 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Fortunately, we don't
 usually get lost.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.521
 Oh, this is an important one.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:39.192 align:start position:0%
   This is a advanced
   medical kit with QuikClot.

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
Having a first aid
safety kit is something

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.495
 you always wanna have with you

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.663 size:88% position:44%
   on any adventure.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.698
   This also has band
   aids, has gauze,

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.234 align:start position:0%
  has needles, has just about
  anything that you need

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:50.036
 if you were injured
 out here in the wild.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.438
  Let's see what other sort
  of goodies we have in here.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:57.410
 Oh, this, Reptiles and
 Amphibians Field Guide

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.279
   with awesome color images.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.114
Now, I know most of the
reptiles and amphibians

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.982
 I'm gonna come across
 on these adventures

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.051
 because I do a lot of
 research in advance.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.220
  Extra pair of socks.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.822 size:88% position:44%
   Now you guys know
   I get soaking wet

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.291
and super muddy.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.660 align:start size:88% position:13%
But it feels really good
at the end of the day

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.428 size:88% position:44%
   to take off those
   wet muddy boots,

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:16.729
   those soggy socks,

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.332 size:88% position:44%
   and put on a nice
   fresh dry pair.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.867
 Of course, I'm just
 gonna stick these back

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.135
into the squishy boots,

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:23.736
  but just for that 30 seconds

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.405
when your feet are dry and warm,

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.307
trust me, it's worth it.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.842
 I always carry with me
 a little field journal

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.911
   that I can write notes in.

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:34.347 size:88% position:44%
   Whew, I got lots
   of stuff in here.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.182 size:88% position:44%
   Back to the first
   aid and safety,

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:39.252
 I always carry with me
 antibacterial lotion

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:42.288
 and just simple Wet One wipes

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.756
  in case you have
  to go you know what

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:44.691
 when you're out there.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.459
And if you're bitten by snakes,

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.860
 clawed up by prickers,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.762
  turtle claws, you
  wanna make sure you

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.699
 clean out your wounds
 as good as you can.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.168 align:start position:0%
   Let's see, in this
   important pocket up here,

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.470 align:start size:88% position:13%
 permits for any
 location that I go to.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.072
 You guys often wonder,
 how do you get to go

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.506
  into all these cool places?

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.041
   Well, we work with
   park districts,

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.310
and we make sure that we
always have permission

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.379 align:start size:88% position:13%
to come to these
locations ahead of time.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.780
  Keep these in a zip lock bag

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.415
 to make sure that they're dry.

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.918
And so it's OK for us to
be out here in the wild

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.653 align:start size:88% position:13%
  looking for all
  these cool animals.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.889
  Last, but not least,

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.325
 I always carry with me
 an extra pocket knife

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.827
 just in case.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.630 align:start position:0%
And this is my kit for whenever
I'm in a swamp environment

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.665
   like central Ohio,
   the Everglades,

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.367 align:start position:0%
   or anywhere that I'm
   gonna be catching turtles,

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.702
  snakes, alligators,
  or a number of other

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.171
 creepy crawlies that
 call home to the wild.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:37.744
  I'm Coyote Peterson.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.412 align:start size:88% position:13%
 This morning we're
 in the Sonoran Desert

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.381 align:start size:88% position:13%
 exploring the backside
 of Cat Mountain.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.316
  Sun's just cresting
  over the horizon,

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.585
 which is the perfect
 time to find reptiles.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.620
 Let's break trail and
 see what we can find.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:53.493
(dramatic music)

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:59.732
 The southwest hails as an epic
 backdrop for any adventure,

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.501
and there's no location
more picture perfect

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.769
than the Sonoran Desert.

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:03.936
   Toady the crew and
   I are headed out

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.338
to capture some of this beauty,

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:06.372
 but trust us when we say look.
