Hey Team Fortress 2 Players and
Traders and Welcome to the new official

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.689
TF2-Trader YouTube Channel

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.900
First off, I'm Anti-Protest, one of
the owners of TF2-Trader

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.519
The other owner is Mudguts, who will not be here due to time zone restrictions, but 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.979
will be in future videos.

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.390
We are the new owners of TF2-Trader. We've started this YouTube 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.260
Channel

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.130
to help players and share a little bit
about ourselves with you.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.380
Soon you'll see our first tutorial that
teaches you how to put on three effects

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.410
through the dual misc. glitch.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.080
with tutorials also on PayPal trading,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.970
utilizing middleman services,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.020
and doing thorough background checks on
potential buyers and sellers following

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.950
soon.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.790
They will be the first of many videos
and tutorials we will be releasing.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.850
We've made this video to show you some
of the changes we have made here at TF2-Trader

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.720
and to educate traders so they utilize safe and smart 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.570
practices.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.040
Also, we've added the Steam Rep Plugin,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.270
so any tagged profiles are
automatically banned from our server,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.290
We also have a new logo

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.620
a new MOTD

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.979
and an updated set of rules.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.750

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.130
Trade Unusual,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.010
has been updated with quite a few new
features.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.290
Including enhanced donator 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.320
and skybox.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.090
We encourage all of you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.400

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.920

Both of which are linked in the video's
description below.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.349
As the new owners,

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.109
we are taking a strong stance against scamming,

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.929
in addition to adding the SteamRep Plugin,

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:20.189
we have been doing our best to protect traders against scammers by

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.280
educating and advocating safe trade practices.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.010
As we said before, this channel will
serve to advise and help players like you

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.719
learn how to spot scammers

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.889
and make the most out of your unusuals.

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:39.889
So now that you've heard a bit about
the new TF2-Trader and ourselves,

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.989
