00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:09.700
Again, that shim seems to be a little bit
to low. But we have not yet adjusted the height

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.789
of the saddle. It may be perfectly okay, once
we determine whether it's in the range of

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:22.490
the saddle adjustment height. So in this particular
case, this particular kind of saddle, a Wilkonson

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.890
style saddle, has a locking mechanism, to
lock it vertically this way, and also locks

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.210
it in place horizontally, for the internation,
so we want to loosen that lock with a correct

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:45.020
allen wrench. And then lets bring up the saddle
height, and find the correct allen wrench,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.409
for the saddle adjustments, this one looks
like it's about right. Let?s see if this is

00:00:52.409 --> 00:01:06.580
enough to make a difference, and whether it's
within the saddle heights adjustment range.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.210
Now if you can see this up close, you can
see that this is a screw that fits under the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:25.590
saddle and helps force it up, you see it coming
up now. I want to make sure this is good and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:38.170
loose enough so it doesn't interfere with
our adjustment gear. It's getting there, we

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:47.750
may be close enough, when we make this final,
these adjustments on the saddle height to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:57.710
have the next set correctly.
It may have to go up higher. This one seems

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:31.980
to be locking it from going up high enough.
I think that this may get us there, may be

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:46.250
high enough.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:03:13.870
It's free sounding, that's a good sign. I
think that, that worked. Now you can see,

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:22.020
it's free to fret, and the action at this
end is much, much, much closer to the same

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.730
height at this end, so that's the processes.
So I'll go ahead and put the rest of the strings

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.750
on here and make the final adjustments on
the heights of the saddle this way in order

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.439
to get it all set, and we should be ready
to go to the next step.
