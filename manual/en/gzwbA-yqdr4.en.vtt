00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.960
Cross-breed Macaw

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.580
In Polish crossword puzzles

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.660
you can sometimes find such a clue:

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.560
a parrot of three letters, beginning with A.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.460
It is, of course, Ara, which is a Polish equivalent for a Macaw.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.780
This Macaw is not only the crossword puzzle parrot

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.500
but also a cross-breed parrot,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.260
which is mainly known as a hybrid.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.260
Hybrids are the offspring

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.140
of two animals of different species.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.360
They are uncommon in natural environment,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.260
but popular among breeders.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.680
People begun experimenting

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.680
with crossbreeding two different animal species

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.980
in order to create animals

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.540
whose features will better match human expectations.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.340
Bird hybrids have been known for a long time,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.540
but mainly among songbirds.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.840
Some canaries’ color mutations

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.860
were obtained from the interspecific crossings.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.480
When it comes to parrots,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.680
only closely related species crossbreed with one another.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.240
The Harlequin Macaw sitting on my shoulder

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.640
is one of such hybrids.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.960
It is a crossbreed between

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.440
the Blue and Gold Macaw and the Green-winged Macaw.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.200
The result of this “relationship” is such a hybrid.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.680
This Macaw is very colorful.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.120
Its parents contributed to the fascinating

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.020
blue, red, and yellow colors present on the parrot’s body.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.600
However, the arrangement of the colors of The Harlequin Macaw

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.900
is completely different than of its parents.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.620
When we talk about hybrids,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.840
we cannot skip over the ethics.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.620
That is, many people rightly believe that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.120
parrots of endangered species being under protection

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.980
should not be crossbred.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.940
In fact, there are two conditions to be met

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.020
in order to crossbreed parrots of different species;

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.420
firstly, the parrots living in their natural environment

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.240
cannot be endangered,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.760
and, secondly, the hybrids will not be released

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.080
into the wild.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.680
None of this parrot’s parents belong to the endangered species,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920
and, in addition, both parrots,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.380
the Blue and Gold Macaw and the Green-winged Macaw,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.420
reproduce very well in breeders’ households.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.680
As a result, since a few years ago,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.480
there is no obligation to register these species of birds

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.420
among European Union countries, but Poland is the exception.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.500
Macaw hybrids are rare in Poland,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.260
but extremely popular in the Western Europe and the USA.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.120
In fact, there are many Breeders Associations gathering members

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.960
who crossbreed different species of Macaws

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.760
and invent special names for their hybrids.
