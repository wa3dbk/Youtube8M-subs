hi I'm Todd from Sony and I'm here to
show you how to check the firmware version

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.580
on a Sony Blu-Ray disc player that has a
Xross media bar menu

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.310
the reason you want to check the
firmware version

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.750
is to make sure you have the most
current functionality and features

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.619
available for your product

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.820
for my demonstration I'm using the BDP-S580

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.260
products can be slightly different so be
sure to check the owner's manual or

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.190
visit us at esupport.Sony.com
for your specific features and menu options

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.530
to check the firmware version you will
need to access the menu of your Blu-Ray disc player

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.470
you may also want to have a pen and
paper handy so you can write down the version

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.440
so let's get started

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360
turn on both the tv and the Blu-Ray disc player

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.430
make sure the tv is set to the input
that you use to view your Blu-Ray disc movies

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.510
using the Blu-Ray disc player remote

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.740
press the home button

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.990
using the arrow keys on the remote

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.220
select setup

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.120
select system settings

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.400
press the enter button

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.270
scroll down and select system information

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.350
press the enter button

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.600
the firmware version will appear on the screen

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.320
this is the number you want to write down

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.500
now that you know what version of
firmware you have

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.150
