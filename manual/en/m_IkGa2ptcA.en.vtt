00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.910
hello everyone Michael here from daily note 2 
youtube channel and today it looks

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.099
like Modern Combat 4 Zero Hour

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.969
showed up in the google play store and
this one's going to hurt a little

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.640
bit as in terms of a storage on your
internal

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.960
it requires 1.87GB and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.619
it's probably that and then a little bit more

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.729
like usual but

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:29.869
let's fire this up.. it took about an hour
to download 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.190
addtional file and it was

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.990
6.99.. I tried to buy it in Korea
it said it wasn't

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.650
available for this country even though
it was a lower price I didn't understand that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.350
I bought it for 6.99 US
with my american google play account

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.450
there is a cool effect in the

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.860
beginning of the game 
let's do a new game here

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.470
just do eazy

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.470
cuz I do want to show you guys something

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.370
I didn't understand why
modern combat 4 was not available for

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.140
this country

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.610
it's not like the games too violent 
because they're giving away modern

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.950
combat 3 actually for the galaxy note 2
in samsung apps

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.530
so we did skip through that movie there
but

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.900
before jumping into the game
I want to point out a lot of cool things

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.220
here you could see that out there're some
really cool lighting effects going on

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.210
you could see

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.060
if you ever shot with the SLR

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.110
you got the lens drity you would get
that kind of effect and you get that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.150
smoke there as well.. that smoke looks
pretty awesome

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.140
and just looking around
the textures.. the texture seems

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.349
seems like they're much higher quality
than modern combat 3

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.169
it is literally like pc or console grade
not maybe

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.609
console of

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.489
today
but maybe console of

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.209
or pc of a couple of years ago

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.949
other thing is look at the reflection
off the gun

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.449
that seems very nice and

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.839
obviously it is a higher polygon

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.519
polygon connors as well
the gun looks 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.790
a lot more sharper

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.999
much more detail and it looks around
there too

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:49.539
and as in terms of fps
wise as enough frames per second

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:54.209
I really liked the modern combat 3
because

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.459
it really seems like 60fps
most of the time but you're not going

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.329
to get this here 
at lease on the galaxy note 2

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.689
i'm seeing somewhere between
20 to 30 if I'm just eyeballing

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.749
it here

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.290
also

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.869
see that

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:12.609
they want to show you the

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.559
flections off the water as pretty nice
and

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:22.049
sky looks amazing that really likes
looks like the real deal

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.739
with all these graphic 
improvements and there's

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.309
definitely a performance hit

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:34.589
one thing I do want to 
point out is that

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.589
in modern combat 3 if you hit

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.109
hit that zoom button

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:49.329
it automatically locked in onto target in eazy
I'm not sure of other modes but

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.449
definitely that isn't the case

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.650
you do need to get a pretty close
and you do need to do a little bit of

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.529
finding your enemy and then

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:04.189
and then that auto lock on works
but it's not as easy as before

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.769
maybe modern combat 3 was a
little bit too easy

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.549
and this is at least 2 steps more difficult
if you're looking for

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.280
that same kind of experience

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.220
obvously I can't do whole game review
since i just download it but i just

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.870
wanted to give you a quick glance of
what the game play looks like

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.810
you know it looks

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.360
really good

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.210
and I just wanna make a note that

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.229
now walking to discriminate here

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.479
I just wanna make a note that 
i try playing this game with the

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.000
USB OTG controller, USB OTG cable and the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.610
PS3 controller

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.740
i thought maybe they would make the
PS3 controller work this time because the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.620
PS3 controller did not work on
modern combat 3 the only mapped the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.059
buttons on the

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:57.469
on the right side of it

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.720
but i was surprised to find out that 
you can actually move

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.659
move forward, backward, left and right

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.449
but you are not able to

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.110
this part worked with the
deep as well but

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.360
they didn't map this part is only thing
they didn't map it seems

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.020
once again useless if you're not rooted

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.580
you would have to root

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.119
the device

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:24.419
and then use the

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.650
connect over bluetooth and use
the six access to

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.900
play

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.680
modern combat with the PS3 controller

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.650
anyway that's the end of this review 
I hope you got something out of

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.550
