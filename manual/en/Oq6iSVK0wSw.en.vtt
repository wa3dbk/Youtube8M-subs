00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:07.669
"One . . . two . . ." The Boss paused. "Oh,
dear. There's a problem, young lady."

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.760
"What?""You haven't got any shoes."Tally looked
down. In her confusion, she had stumbled barefoot

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.080
out of the bunkhouse.
The packed dirt of the Smoke compound was

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.300
easy enough to walk on, but in the forest
. . .

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.199
"You won't make it ten meters, kid."
The Boss pulled the duffel bag away from her

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.650
and handed her the plastic container. "Now
get going."

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.809
"But I . . . ," Tally said. "I don't want
to go back to the city."

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.530
"Yes, young lady, and I wouldn't mind getting
some decent dental work. But we all have to

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.960
make sacrifices.
Starting now!" On the last word, he shoved

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.459
her out from behind the drum.
Tally stumbled forward, utterly exposed in

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:53.329
the middle of the street. The roar of a hovercar
seemed to pass right over her head, and she

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.129
instinctively ducked, dashing toward the cover
of the forest.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.529
The Special cocked her head toward Tally,
calmly folded her arms, and frowned like a

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:04.729
teacher spotting littlies playing where they
shouldn't.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.890
Tally wondered if the pepper would do anything
to the woman. If it affected the Special like

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.310
it had Tally, she might still make it into
the forest. Even if she was supposed to be

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.560
the bait. Even if she had no shoes.
Even if it turned out David had already been

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.689
caught and she'd never see him again . . .
The thought unleashed a sudden torrent of

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.210
anger inside her, and she ran straight at
the woman, the container clenched in both

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.869
hands.
A smile broke out on the Special's cruel features.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.649
A split second before they collided, the Special
seemed to disappear, slipping out of sight

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.390
like a coin in a magician's hand. In her next
stride Tally felt something hard connect with

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.810
her shin, and pain shot up her leg. Her body
tumbled forward, hands reaching out to break

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.600
her fall, the container slipping from her
grasp.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.810
She hit the ground hard, skidding on her palms.
As she rolled through the dirt, Tally glimpsed

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.420
the Special crouching behind her. The woman
had simply ducked, invisibly fast, and Tally

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.619
had tripped over her like some awk- ward littlie
in a brawl.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.360
Shaking her head and spitting the dirt out
of her mouth, Tally spotted the container

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.610
just out of reach. She scrambled toward it,
but a staggering weight crashed down on her,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.000
driving her face-first into the ground. She
felt her wrists pulled back and bound, hard

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.790
plastic cuffs cutting into her flesh.
She struggled, but couldn't move.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.489
Then the awful weight lifted, and a nudge
from a boot flipped her over effortlessly.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.040
The Special stood over her, smiling coldly,
holding the container. "Now, now, ugly," the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.340
cruel pretty said. "You just calm down. We
don't want to hurt you. But we will if we

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.739
have to."
Tally started to speak, but her jaw clenched

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.470
with pain. It had plowed into the ground when
she'd fallen.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.659
"What's so important about this?" the Special
asked, shaking the container and trying to

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.280
peer through its translucent plastic.
Out of the corner of her eye, Tally saw the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.280
Boss making his way toward the forest. His
run was slow and tortured, the duffel bag

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.730
too heavy for him.
"Open it and see," Tally spat painfully.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.989
"I will," she said, still smiling. "But first
things first." She turned her attention toward

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.150
the Boss, and her posture suddenly transformed
into something animal, crouched and coiled

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.900
like a cat ready to spring.
Tally rolled back onto her shoulders, thrashing

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.019
out wildly with both feet. Her kick connected
with the container, and it popped open, a

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.049
puff of brownish-green dust spraying out over
the Special.

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.219
For a second, a disbelieving expression spread
over the woman's face. She made a gagging

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:45.150
noise, her whole body shuddering. Then her
eyes and fists clamped shut, and she screamed.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.219
The sound wasn't human. It cut into Tally's
ears like a vibrasaw striking metal, and every

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:55.829
muscle in her body fought to get free of the
handcuffs, her instincts demanding that she

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.670
cover her ears. With another wild kick, she
rolled herself over and stumbled to her feet,

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.989
staggering in the direction of the forest.
A tickle grew in Tally's throat as the pepper

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.329
dust dispersed on the wind. She coughed as
she ran, eyes watering and stinging until

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.329
she was half-blind. With her hands tied behind
her, Tally lurched into the brush off-balance,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.820
tumbling to the ground as her bare feet caught
on something in the dense vegetation.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.440
She struggled forward, trying to drag herself
out of sight.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.740
Blinking away tears, she saw that the Special's
inhuman scream had been some kind of alarm.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.170
Three more of the cruel pretties had responded.
One led the pepper-covered Special away at

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.520
arm's length, and the others approached the
forest.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.370
Tally froze, the brush barely concealing her.
Then she felt a tickle in her throat, a slowly

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.370
growing irritation. Tally held her breath,
closing her eyes. But her chest began to shudder,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.030
her body twitching, demanding to expel traces
of the pepper from her lungs.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.200
She had to cough.
Tally swallowed again and again, hoping spit

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.030
could put out the fire in her throat. Her
lungs demanded oxygen, but she didn't dare

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.390
breathe. One of the Specials was only a stone's
throw away, scanning the forest with slow

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.210
back-and- forth sweeps of his head, his eyes
searching the dense trees relentlessly.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.860
Gradually, painfully, the flames seemed to
expire in Tally's chest, the cough dying a

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.890
quiet death inside her. She relaxed, finally
letting out her breath.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.460
Over the thunder of hovercars and crackle
of burning buildings and sounds of battle,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.390
the Special somehow heard her soft exhalation.
His head turned swiftly, eyes narrowing, and

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.470
in what seemed like a single motion he was
by her side, a hand on the back of her neck.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.380
"You're a tricky one," he said.
She tried to answer, but wound up coughing

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.090
savagely instead, and he forced her face down
in the dirt before she could manage another

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.530
breath.
