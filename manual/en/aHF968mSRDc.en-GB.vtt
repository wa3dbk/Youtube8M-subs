This is my favorite Summer hair style.

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:05.929
It's great for hot weather because it keeps
the hair off your neck.

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:08.100
If you pin it enough it's ridiculously sturdy
too so great for windy days or bad hair days.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.360
You will need a brush, pins, hair ties and
something to decorate with.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.410
Brush you hair our and part down the middle
into two sections.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:35.199
Tie one of the sections into a pony tail to
keep it out of the way.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:58.690
You might want to pin your fringe out of the
way as well as any layers you want to leave

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:09.260
down.
Plait the other section of your hair tightly

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:25.710
down to the end.
You need to plait in an overhand way so the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:38.630
first step is taking the back section over
rather than under.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.630
This will ensure it sits flat against the
side of your head.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.630
Tie it off with a hair tie as close to the
end as possible.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.630
Now repeat on the other side but this time
don't tie it off.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.630
Many people have asked if this style works
for shorter hair, the answer is yes.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.630
Just pull the section of hair up so the plait
starts higher up the side of your head.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:02:36.239
Take the plait and pull it upwards and over
the top of your head.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.790
Take a bobby pin and slide it over the end
of the plait to hold it in place.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:52.430
You might need more than one pin but it just
needs to hold for a minute while we fix the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.730
other side.
Remove the tie from the other plait and pull

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:07.370
it up and over to the other side of your head.
Follow the same line as the first plait so

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.599
they cross over at the top.
Poke the ends of the plait under the beginnings

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.459
of the other one.
Pin it in place.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:26.650
Now move the beginning of the first plait
over the top so the ends are all hidden.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:35.809
You should add pins on both sides of it.
You can see the ends on the left are hidden

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:42.069
pretty well but ones on the right need to
be squished in more.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:51.709
The technique I used for pinning is to grab
a bit from the plait and a bit from the scalp,

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.979
pull away, rotate the pin in towards the plait
again and slide underneath.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:04.729
The twisting makes it very secure.
Now it's just a matter of straightening or

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:09.069
curling your fringe and the layers around
your face.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:16.290
And adding some pretty accessories.
I'm using a chain of felt daisies that I made.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.560
In the past I've also used little bows and
fake flowers, anything goes.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.860
And that's all finished.
Cute, sweet and very pretty for Summer.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:05:06.430
It's a little bit dreamy.
So it's perfect for imagining you're in a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.430
romantic novel and spend your days staring
longingly out windows and waiting for a lost

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.430
love.
