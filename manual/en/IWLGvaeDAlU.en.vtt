00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi I'm John Green.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.200
Welcome to my salon.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.780
This is Mental Floss on YouTube and IT IS
OUR BIRTHDAY!

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.460
Happy Birthday us!

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.700
We even got you a cake!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.809
Actually, we got ourselves a cake.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.030
Hold on, I'm gonna make a wish.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.170
I can't tell you what I wished for, but I
can say that I sure hope Beyonce is a guest

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.610
host of Mental Floss next year.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.550
So the Mental Floss List Show is officially
one year old.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.400
Today, I'm going to talk about some ways that
people celebrate birthdays around the world

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.460
in different cultures and different religions.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.449
Plus, I'm going to demonstrate some of these
so that we can properly celebrate our birthday!

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.050
And for those of you who've been complaining
that we've been a little bit USA-centric lately,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.129
we're gonna get very worldwide today!

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:47.190
Let's start with the actual origins of birthdays
themselves.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.570
They may have started with the ancient Egyptians,
like the Bible notes a Pharaoh's birthday,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.430
although it's possible that could mean the
date of the Pharaoh's death, like the day

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.329
that he became a god.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.000
The ancient Romans definitely celebrated birthdays,
though, and were probably the first people

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.320
to celebrate their family and friends birthdays,
not just those of rulers and gods.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.130
In Denmark, a Danish flag placed outside the
home means that it's somebody's birthday.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.409
If it's a child's birthday, the presents are
usually placed on or around the child's bed

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.690
so they can wake up surrounded by presents.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.690
That's nice!

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.160
Sometimes a "cake man" or "cake lady" is served,
depending on whether the party is for a boy

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160
or a girl.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.420
The head of the cake person is usually chopped
off first, which I will now demonstrate.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.020
This was a camel - And now it is a decapitated
camel.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.659
At birthday parties for children in Australia
and New Zealand, you might find Fairy Bread,

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.360
which is white bread, butter, and sprinkles.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.850
By the way, the round and colorful sprinkles
are called "hundreds-and-thousands" there.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.860
I'm now going to make some Fairy Bread because
it is basically the perfect food so far as

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.860
I can tell.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.560
What I'm not an expert in?

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
Butter spreading.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.930
All right, then you just.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.509
What do you do, you just kinda - WOAH!

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.329
Can you fold it up into, like, a Fairy Bread
sandwich?

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.430
Is that frowned upon, Australians?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.290
I don't know, I'm gonna try it.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.770
Good!

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.729
At a Brazilian birthday party, people might
pull the earlobes of the guest of honor.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.940
You can also probably expect to see Brigaderio
there, which are a kind of chocolate truffle.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.010
Ear-pulling is also a thing in Hungary where
there's in fact a rhyming song that accompanies

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.010
it!

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.940
The translation is, "God bless you, live so
long your ears reach your ankles."

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.660
Earlobe pulling is kind of similar to what
other cultures refer to as "the bumps."

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.040
The bumps are especially common in the UK
and Ireland where the birthday boy or girl

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.590
is lifted up and bumped on the ground once
per each year they have been alive.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.590
The U.S. and Canada also have a similar tradition,
but with punches instead of bumps because

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.610
we're much more violent.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.920
Another violent-sounding tradition in the
U.S. are "smash cakes."

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.420
These are small individual cakes given to
babies to do what they do best: make a mess

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.420
of their food.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.510
I'm not going to explain this one because
you're on the Internet, so I assume that you've

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.430
already seen how adorable it is to watch babies
destroy stuff, instead, I'm gonna demonstrate.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.030
So I am a father, I've seen children do this
a lot.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.120
Basically you just go in and you just..

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.410
Then you go...

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.090
That's basically it.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.450
In additions to punches, Canadians have been
known to spread butter on the nose of the

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.450
birthday person.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.710
Mark, I know that you're Canadian, but please
don't make me do this one because I just finished

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.660
cleaning myself up after the smash cake.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.240
Similarly, it's considered good luck in Nepal
to put colored rice yogurt on your forehead

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.240
for birthdays.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.980
Mexicans have a special birthday song, \'93Las
Mananitas (aka "The Little Mornings") which

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.030
is usually sung at a party before the group
eats cake.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.810
And of course, pinatas are a common way to
celebrate a birthday in Mexico.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.730
Although we usually think of them as Mexican,
pinatas actually originated in China and were

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.230
used to celebrate New Years.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.840
It was Europeans who eventually brought them
over to Mexico.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.180
In Ghana, a traditional birthday dish is oto
- mashed yams with eggs and onions.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.290
In China, Yi mein is commonly eaten on birthdays.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.870
In English, those are
Longevity noodles" or

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.010
long life noodles."

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.350
Also, be sure to avoid giving a watch or a
clock as a gift in China.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.240
These are considered bad luck.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.590
Celebrating individual birthdays is rare in
Vietnam.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.650
Instead, all birthdays are celebrated on the
Vietnamese holiday of Tet, which is a New

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.000
Years celebration.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.190
Children do receive gifts though!

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.440
Their elders give them red envelopes with
money inside.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.820
Korea operates somewhat similarly - first
birthdays are celebrated, but subsequent birthdays

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.660
are all celebrated on the New Year.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.500
Wishing someone "happy birthday" before their
actual birthday is considered bad luck in

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.500
Germany.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.320
On someone's 16th birthday in Germany, they
may have flour thrown on their head, which

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.340
may sound rough, but in Jamaica, throwing
flour on the head is an every birthday tradition,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.750
not just a one time thing.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.590
I'm not going to throw flour on anyone's head
here, but I will demonstrate with a doll.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.590
Happy Birthday, Yoda.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.370
What are you, like, a thousand now?

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.000
Anyway, back to Germany...On 18th birthdays,
the flour is replaced with eggs.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.050
And if a man reaches his 25th birthday before
he marries, his friends will hang a "sockencranz,"

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.210
or sock wreath, outside of his house.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.960
The "old socks" are a symbol of his old age.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.460
On that note, some cultures have different
traditions for when people turn a certain

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.460
age.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.930
Like, you probably already know that girls
who practice Judaism have bat mitzvah when

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.770
they turn 12 and boys have a bar mitzvah when
they turn 13.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.310
Those ceremonies represent a move into adulthood.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.230
Let's finish up with some more age-specific
traditions.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.860
I'm sure you've also heard of a Quinceanera...especially
if you were spending all of your free time

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.270
watching "My Super Sweet 16" in 2005.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.440
I'm not pointing any fingers, Meredith.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.710
In South Africa, when a person turns 21, their
parents present them with a key that symbolizes

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.840
responsibility and the future.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.840
In Holland, they celebrate "crown years,"
which are the ages 5, 10, 15, 20, and 21.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.120
On those birthdays, you get bigger presents.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.100
The 1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th birthdays are
the most important in Nigeria.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.380
Up to 100 people might show up to those celebrations,
which usually involve a feast.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.900
For boys who practice Orthodox Judaism and
Hasidic Judaism, the third birthday is important

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.580
because it's the day they receive their first
haircut.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.350
In fact, that tradition has now spread in
Israel and doesn't always apply only to religious

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.350
people.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.850
Similarly, people from the Indian island of
Minicoy shave their newborn baby's head after

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.850
twenty days.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.300
Then, the hair is weighed.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.320
Whatever the weight is will be given to charity
in silver or gold.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.650
That's not a birthday thing, really, we just
thought it was cool.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.160
And now I return to my salon to tell you that
the Chinese also a special first birthday

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160
tradition.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.630
The baby is placed in front of a bunch of
objects, like books, flowers, stationary,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.420
coins, and toys.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.460
Parents believe that the items the baby reaches
for are indications of future interests.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.060
So like if a coin is chosen, it's considered
good luck and a sign that the baby in question

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.270
will one day be rich.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:38.650
We're going to try this out actually with
our office dog, Alex.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.430
Thanks for watching Mental Floss on YouTube
which is made with the help of all of these

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.430
nice people.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.530
Each week we endeavor to answer one of your
mind-blowing questions.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.430
This week's question comes from TheNightTroll13,
who asks, "Why do we call a sixtieth of a

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.889
minute a second?"

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:57.020
Well, NightTroll13, this comes from a Latin
word, "secunda," which meant "second diminished

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.720
part" because the hour is divided twice by
sixty - the first division of it is minutes,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.370
the second division gives us seconds.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.680
If you have a mind-blowing question you'd
like answered, please leave it below in and

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.750
we'll endeavor to answer as many as we can.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.290
Thanks for watching and as we say in my hometown,
don't forget to be awesome.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.870
That's a pretty strong pinata!

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.810
Aaaahhh!

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.750
Finally!
