00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.030
Hey guys it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.320
It's been a while since I made Adventure Time
Cupcakes and I've gotten soooo many requests

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.070
for something specifically "Lumpy Space Princess."

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.800
I wanted to do something we've never done
before on Nerdy Nummies, so today we are gonna

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.710
be making lollipops: Lumpy Space Princess
Lollipops!

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.200
So let's get started!

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.300
The things you will need will be 1/3 Cup of
light corn syrup, 1/2 Cup of water, little

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.110
bit of vegetable-shortening, I'm using Crisco,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.620
star-sprinkles to decorate, 1 Cup of regular
sugar.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.420
Then you're gonna need 1/2 a teaspoon of flavoring.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.690
I don't like grape candy flavor, but it's
totally fine if you wanna do that but you

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.030
can use anything you'd like!

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.329
You could use, I've got "Cotton Candy," "Pina
Colada" or "Raspberry," whatever flavor you'd like.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.130
You're also gonna need 1/2 a teaspoon of Liquid-White
Food Coloring, I'll put a link down below

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.360
so that you can order it on the Internet if
you'd like.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.700
Purple food coloring, lollipop-sticks-
Oop! Oop!

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.700
A baking sheet, daisy-lollipop mold or
anything that looks like "Lumpy Space Princess"

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.289
Measuring-cup with a pour-spigot, you
can also use a pitcher, a medium-size sauce

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.109
pan and a candy thermometer!

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.270
All right, let's put it all together! What
the lump?!

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.729
The first thing that we're gonna do is grease
our pan so that our suckers do not stick to

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.329
the surface.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.299
I'm just taking a little bit of vegetable-shortening
and I'm taking a little paper towel- You can

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.319
use your hand but I just didn't wanna get
too messy.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.439
And you're just gonna rub it all over the
top of the baking sheet.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.109
Once that's done, you're just gonna take a
little bit more of shortening and we're gonna

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:05.289
grease the inside of the molds so that they'll
pop off very easy.

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.289
Once you've got all of these greased, what
we're gonna do is assemble our lollipop-sticks!

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.489
If you're using the metal ones, what you do
is you just use the little connector-bracket...

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.930
...and put 'em on the end so that they look
like that...

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.000
...and then you're gonna take your lollipop-stick
and you're gonna push it into the middle.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.110
And then you're just gonna do that to all
of your lollipops!

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.500
Once you have your molds ready, we're gonna
head over to the stove and make our lollipops.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.540
In a medium-sized sauce-pan, combine your
sugar, water and light corn syrup...

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.420
...then you're gonna stir it all together
on Medium Heat until your sugar dissolves.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.720
Once your sugar is dissolved, you're gonna
crank the heat to Medium-High and wait until

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.590
the temperature reaches 300 degrees.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.850
Once it reaches 300 degrees, remove the pan
from the heat immediately.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.870
Now you're gonna add 1/2 teaspoon of "Pina
Colada" Flavoring, 1/2 teaspoon of "White-Liquid"

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.310
Food Coloring and one drop of purple dye and
you're gonna mix it all together.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.430
Once it's mixed together, you're gonna pour
into the measuring-up and pour it into your molds!

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.340
After your lollipops have completely cooled,
this took about 20 minutes they're nice and set.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.320
I'm gonna show you how to pop off the little
lollipop-molds if you're using the metal ones.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.650
So you just pull off the bracket like this.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.370
All right!

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.830
And then they just pop off! Boop!

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.590
Now to decorate!

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.000
What you're gonna do is pick up a lollipop-
And this side's a little bumpy.- and so you're

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.510
gonna flip it over to the back 'cuz it will
be nice and smooth.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.420
You're gonna take a little bit of cookie-icing,
I'm using yellow cookie-icing so it will match.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.280
Put a little dot, right at the top and you
can draw a star with this, but I'm gonna take

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.790
these yellow stars...

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.630
I've separated a lot of yellow sprinkle-stars,
and I'm just gonna stick one right on the top!

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.520
Aaaand, stick! Oooooh, so cute!

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.760
Now you're just gonna do these to the rest
of your lollipops and make as many as you'd like!

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.340
Ta-daaaa!

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.150
Here are our Lumpy Space Princess Lollipops,
I'm so excited because we have never made

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.130
lollipops before on Nerdy Nummies until today!

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.580
And we also made opaque lollipops instead
of the clear, translucent ones so now you

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.150
guys know how to do that as well!

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.650
These are a really good idea for birthday
parties, slumber parties OR cartoon-nights

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.410
with friends which is what I like to do!

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.090
The recipe I used today makes about 5 lollipops,
so what I did is I just doubled it, I made

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.289
a whole bunch of them.

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.349
You can make as many as you'd like!

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.919

Nerdy Nummies, please let me know!

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.789

All right, thanks again you guys! Buhr-bye!

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.840
"If you like Pina Coladas..."

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.920
"And getting caught in da rain"

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.480
"If you're not into yogaaa's"

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.780
I am into yoga though!
