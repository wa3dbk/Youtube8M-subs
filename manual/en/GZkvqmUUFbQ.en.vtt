00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.509
well, this simple rocket is quite simple to
make. you require some card sheets, a bent

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.700
straw, rubber bands, cello tape, thread and
a balloon. from the card sheet make a doubled

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.700
rocket. on the fold at top apply some glue
and stick a straw. the straw will form a kind

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.110
of bearing through which you can weave a thread.
now weave a thread through the straw and then

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.560
apply glue and stick the rocket onto itself
so that it looks nice and colorful from both

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.240
the sides. the thread passes through the straw.
now you can spread out the tail of the rocket

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.230
and tie the ends to the door and when you
blow on the tail the rocket will propell forward.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.340
now stick a bent straw inside the rocket.
tie balloon to one end of the straw. again

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:30.539
weave the thread through the top straw nad
your rocket is ready to take off. blow from

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.490
the other end of the straw to inflate the
balloon. put a finger on the this tip of straw

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.619
and let go. the whole rocket will propel forwards
on the stretched string. see the rocket launch

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:54.779
again. as soon as you leave it the air pushes
out from the other end of the straw and propels

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.949
it forward. its a very delightful model for
children.
