00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.190
Choosing to do Animal Management here at Hadlow
is the best choice a student can make. Our

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.220
facilities are second-to-none, we have nearly
300 species of animal here at the centre,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.130
both inside and out. And we also have a really
strong focus on careers, so we're always looking

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.030
to make students employable when they leave
Hadlow College.

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.320
I chose this course because I wanted to expand
my opportunities and learn more to do with

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.870
animals. I wanted to be able to do more on
the practical side with animals, and I wanted

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.770
to improve my chances of getting a job working
with animals.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.840
I enjoy the fact that we get lots of practical
experience. But we also cover a wide-range

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.280
of topics in our theory based lessons.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.480
We have a wide-range of animals 
available for us to learn from.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.240
There are colleges close
to where I live that do Animal Management

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.870
as well, but I'm prepared to go the extra-mile
to come here, just because of the animals

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.910
that they have available to us.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420
Behind me you can probably see some of our

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.870
goats, we also have llamas here at Hadlow
and at our satellite centres we have alpacas

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.710
as well. We also have a wide-range of chickens
and ducks, and then indoors we have a wide-range

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.729
of reptiles, amphibians, aquatic species,
so all sorts of different fish, small mammals

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.929
including some nocturnal mammals as well.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.400
The facilities are really good, there's such

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.979
a wide-range of animals that you can definitely
find something that you really enjoy working

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.259
with. And, there's lots of different things
to do.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.939
The faculty stands out at Hadlow because we have
a dedicated team of staff who are actually

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.420
involved in the area, in industry, they know
exactly what they're talking about and how

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.000
to deliver it in the best way to students.
We use all our extensive facilities, so all of the species,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.540
and also the farm as well, so it makes 
it a truly memorable experience for students.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.200
It's more of a vocational course. It gets 
us prepared to work in the animal industry.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.671
Job opportunities are wide and varied, you

00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:16.730
can either become much more scientific and
go into things like feed management and nutrition

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.230
work, or you can look towards working with
animals in a hands-on sense. So either working

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.130
for agencies such as the RSPCA, local rescue
and charities, or you can also look at working

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.170
with kennels and catteries.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.480
I think it can give a wide-range of opportunities 
because it's such a broad topic.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.260
I'm passionate about equipping students with

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.260
the skills to go and work in industry, look
after animals to the highest welfare standard,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.940
and to be able to teach others 
how to look after animals.
