00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.600
Hi! How are you?
Now I will talk about the Desert Rose

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.000
I hope you enjoy it!

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.420
The Desert Rose is a succulent plant from Africa

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.240
It is very beautiful, 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.810
and it has these 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.330
super showy flowers

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.040
They can be soft pink, red

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.860
and there is also a kind of white flowers.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.850
The ideal substrate for this plant 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.550
is the substrate for cacti and succulents.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.810
I will post a link at the end of the video 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.100
to the video where I teach how to do these substrate for cacti and succulents.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.020
This is a plant that does not need much water, because as I told you,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.770
is a succulent plant, 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.740
so it is important when you have watering,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.130
that you observe that all the water have

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.680
left the pot, ok?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.730
Never let the water sworn in the small plate, 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.680
because the roots will rot.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.640
And during the winter also 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.960
is a time when plants are resting

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.920
and you can reduce the watering 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.570
without worrying about it.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.290
It is a sun plant, 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.730
or if you have a balcony, 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.830
put it where it can receive a lot of light, because it is a sun plant.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.480
So for it to flourish, it must receive a lot of light.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.580
I was preparing the video today, and I found out that my plant is being

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.660
attacked by scale insects, 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.990
so I will take the opportunity 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.970
and I will teach how to make a homemade insecticide using coconut soap.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.340
To make this homemade insecticide, you will need a coconut soap bar,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.910
a liter of warm water 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.170
and a spray bottle.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.400
So I picked up a knife, 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.179
scrape the coconut soap.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.800
To this amount of one liter of warm water, 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.920
a teaspoon of grated coconut soap is enough.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.660
If you have many plants 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.760
and want to make a larger amount.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.139
Five liters of warm water, 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.109
is a tablespoon 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.079
of grated coconut soap.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.589
You grate well, 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.159
mix, here calculates the amount, 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.959
mix in water, and set spray.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.499
This spray I need to give it a shake,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.460
put a bit of pressure and then I spray the plant.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.140
It is important to spray above and below the leaves because many

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.460
bugs like to hide in the back of the leaves.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.280
It is important to remember two things:

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.860
First, always make the application 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.860
of the insecticide after 4, 5 in the afternoon,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.920
when the sun is weaker 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.740
and there is no danger of burning your plant.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.140
Second important thing, 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.100
an application is not enough.

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.149
So it's important that you make more applications.

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.069
It's like medicine,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.680
 normal people, 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.920
only a dose normally is not enough

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.760
so we have to take more doses.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.920
How much? Normally I do three applications.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.280
I do one application per week for three weeks.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.440
If not resolved, I increase, I make two applications a week,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.879
for three weeks and so on.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:55.039
If I do two, two application periods, right? Suppose three weeks;

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.620
once a week three weeks twice a week and did not resolve,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.320
so I am going to use a more potent insecticide.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.600
I like to use, for example, neem oil.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.400
Later, I will make a video of how I use neem oil.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.840
A good way finish you pot is putting gravel.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.840
I like to use these so-little ones gravel,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.520
there are various types, you just have to  look around for a while.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.960
These here, I bought in an aquarium store.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.760
It is a gravel they sometimes use to line the tanks, right?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.140
So I'll use it to finish this pot.

Flowered Kisses!

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.620
 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.120
 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.620
