00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.073
(movie reel rolls)

00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:10.987
(HT Guy) From the film maker 
who ruined not one,

00:00:10.987 --> 00:00:14.257
not two, but three different super heroes,

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.003
comes Catwoman for men!

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:18.799
DareDevil!

00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:21.984
Before Netflix and Marvel studios team up

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:24.310
to hopefully do the character justice,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.740
return to the early 2000's

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.370
when super hero movies 
were still full of crappy CGI,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.690
Matrixing,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.140
Sopranos,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.448
and Izzies.

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:36.958
Wilson Fisk is in the hizzey.

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.232
(HT Guy) Fresh off Pearl Harbor and Gigli

00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:43.807
2003's least favourite actor 
Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock,

00:00:43.807 --> 00:00:46.734
a boy granted super powers 
after running face-first

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:50.781
into an absurd amount of gigantic 
unsecured toxic waste containers.

00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:52.551
With his eyesight taken from him,

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:55.431
he'll use his other 
four senses to see perfectly,

00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.731
yet still dress up like a blind guy 
to score sympathy points with hot chicks...

00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:01.441
- What are you--
- Blind? Yeah.

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.538
- I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:05.996
...which gives Ben Affleck 
an excuse to show off

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:08.144
his stupid cross eyed derp face.

00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:10.992
Erp meh gerd.
It's the derb devil!

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:13.820
By day, he's a lawyer 
who's terrible at his job...

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.788
Another rapist back on the streets.

00:01:15.788 --> 00:01:18.026
...but by night he's the Daredevil,

00:01:18.026 --> 00:01:21.873
a vigilante who beats up the man 
he's too incompetent to prosecute...

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.267
- I was acquitted.
- Not by me.

00:01:26.227 --> 00:01:27.471
(groaning in pain)

00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:29.227
...and lets innocent people die

00:01:29.227 --> 00:01:32.658
so he can have PG-13 sex 
with Jennifer Garner.

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:34.659
- I have to go.
- Stay with me.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.246
(HT Guy) Cheer for a super hero 
who's barely more powerful

00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:40.133
than your average cop
as this poor poor man Spiderman

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.190
fights crime with 
an odd grab bag of powers like:

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:44.826
super jumping,

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.519
creepy smelling,

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.299
and super heart rate monitoring.

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:51.959
(heart beats)

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:54.944
(HT Guy) So he's a human lie-detector

00:01:54.944 --> 00:01:58.669
and he still can't win a case?
Wow...just wow.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.446
Along for the ride on Daredevil's 
generic directionless quest

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:04.976
for justice is Elektra Natchios,

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:08.809
a girl who for the first half of the movie
is really just there to look hot.

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.369
You are so beautiful.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.949
Doesn't she look beautiful?

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.659
- You're beautiful tonight.
- I wanted to look beautiful for you.

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.097
(HT Guy) So hot 
that Matt will add stalking

00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:19.693
and sexual harassment 
to his growing list of crimes.

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:21.534
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:23.151
Wait a second.
Take it easy.

00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:26.089
I don't like being touched.

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:27.877
Why don't you tell me what you do like
and we'll start there.

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:28.858
(HT Guy) See kids?

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:32.029
If a girl doesn't like you, beat her up 
until she changes her mind!

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.110
Witness the least subtle super hero movie 
since Batman and Robin,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.800
as Elektra and Daredevil 
team up against the Kingpin,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.530
a man who wants to be a...kingpin.

00:02:42.547 --> 00:02:46.537
And Bullseye, a man who...targets things.

00:02:46.537 --> 00:02:50.154
As if the giant f*cking target on his head 
wasn't enough of a give-away.

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:51.804
Bullseye, heh?

00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:55.094
(HT Guy) But if you still manage 
to get lost, don't worry,

00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:57.594
because Ben Affleck will explain 
everything in voice-over

00:02:57.594 --> 00:02:59.754
that sounds like he's 
just waking up from a coma.

00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:03.100
My sense of sound gave 
off a kind of radar sense.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.540
There are days when I believe...
and others when I've lost all faith.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.407
I set out to save the city...

00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:15.041
But without Elektra's help, 
I saved myself instead.

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.215
(HT Guy snores and wakes up)
I'm sorry, what?

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:21.117
So settle in for what's 
basically Ben Affleck's

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:24.769
really disappointing audition 
to be the next Batman,

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.431
where he plays a bruting loner 
who becomes a vigilante crime fighter

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:31.011
after his dad is murdered 
by criminals in the alley,

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.081
uses a ridiculous Batman voice 
when he's in costume...

00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:36.188
- What do you want?
- JUSTICE!

00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:37.875
Stay outta Hells Kitchen!

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:39.493
...travels by grappling hook...

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:43.877
He's scared of bats...

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.217
...and refuses to kill.

00:03:48.217 --> 00:03:51.777
- That's the C Train!
- (screaming)

00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:54.207
(HT Guy) Oh, wait...never mind.

00:03:54.207 --> 00:03:55.285
He'll totally kill.

00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:56.743
I'm not the bad guy.

00:03:56.743 --> 00:03:58.931
(HT Guy) Yeah, you kinda are though.

00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:00.268
Starring...

00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:03.716
A Soundtrack Full of The 2000's 
Worst Nu Metal Bands:

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:05.074
POD,

00:04:05.074 --> 00:04:06.431
Hoobastank,

00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:07.649
Seether,

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:08.959
Drowning Pool,

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.318
Evanescence,

00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:11.906
Evanescence Again,

00:04:11.906 --> 00:04:13.728
And Nickelback!

00:04:14.338 --> 00:04:16.290
Batfleck Begins!

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.783
Um, shouldn't that be in Braille?

00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:27.921

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:30.846
Don't ever call me Kitty!

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:34.639
If karma doesn't come around 
and slap you in the face, I will!

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.713
I'm a banana.
I'm a banana. I'm a banana!

00:04:37.713 --> 00:04:39.129
Look at me move!

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.970
I'm here for the money!

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.137
The tacos are blue!

00:04:43.527 --> 00:04:45.434
I was frozen today!!!
