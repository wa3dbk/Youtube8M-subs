00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.100
Now we're going to cut our second piece of
fabric for our reversible poncho. You want

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.780
to lay your fabric down on the table with
the right side, the outside of the fabric,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.639
facing down. There is a little bit of a difference
in the fleece. This is, you can see this is

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.470
an almost a furry part on the outside and
on the inside it looks more like felt. Lay

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.850
that down flat and then you'll just place
your first piece that we cut already in a

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:35.430
square with the outside facing up so that
the insides of the fabrics are together on

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.190
the table like that and you'll match it up
and then just cut the two squares so that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.300
they're exactly equal. Now I'm going to demonstrate
how to cut the neck hole. We have our two

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.580
thirty-six inch square pieces of fabric matched
up together with the outside of the fabric

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.240
facing the outside and the inside of the fabric
that looks a little like felt put together

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:10.620
like that. I'm going to be showing you two
different methods to finish the neck hole.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.040
In this one we're going to do the woven neck
hole. You want to start by taking your squares

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.230
of fabric and together with the pieces together,
fold it in half. Along the fold you want to

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:34.420
feel that there are no lumps or bumps or that
it's nice and flat and even like that. Then

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.870
we're going to fold it one more time so that
we've folded it in quarters and again you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:47.000
want to make sure that there are no lumps
and bumps. You can put your hands inside the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.740
fold and kind of push against to make sure
that both pieces of fabric are perfectly flat.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.170
You only need to have this flatness, don't
worry about it down here, only for about the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.530
first four or five inches it needs to be perfectly
flat and together. So if you put your hand

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.450
in there and kind of stretch the fabric and
get any lumps and bumps worked out of there

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.150
and make sure that it is folded in quarters
exactly. That gives you the center of your

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.700
poncho and now we'll cut it. So the first
cut we're going to make this neck hole, it's

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.010
for a larger child, we're going to make this
neck hole three inches long. We're going to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.870
mark three inches. We're going to be cutting
this neck hole three inches. You can, there's

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.250
your ruler, and you mark it with a pin. The
first cut is going to be on this fold, the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.580
biggest fold and just take your scissors and
cut through all the fabrics right on the fold

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:03.790
line to your three inch mark like that and
then you're going to cut three inches on both

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.900
of these folds. So again, you can mark your
three inches with your pin so you don't go

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:24.150
too far and cut to the three inches through
both pieces of fabric like that. There's one

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:34.650
and then the other one. Then you're going
to open up your fabric and we'll cut the circle.
