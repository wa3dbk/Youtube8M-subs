Good evening everybody. Whether you're joining
this glimpse into the future in person or

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.280
online, because this is being webcast all
over the country, I'm delighted to welcome

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.660
you. As most of you know the new Architecture
Building is part of a much larger endeavour.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.869
In the next 5 years we will complete a physical
transformation of the kent campus. It will

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.869
include other new buildings and dozens of
major renovations to dozens of our buildings.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.870
The changes will be historic in size, scope
and significance.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.899
We decided to have a public evening presentation
because it really is such a monumental occasion

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.920
for campus. We've never undertaken a design
competition and it was really a once in a

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.820
lifetime opportunity, particularly for our
students on campus. We just thought it was

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.719
just a great way to help people see the process,
be exposed to a lot of different ideas, to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.730
see what architecture's all about, too because
it is always about different choices that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.030
we make and different options. There isn't
neccessarily one right solution.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.030
The enthusiasm that we had last Thursday night
with the 850-900 people looking at the designs.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.750
There's an enthusiasm around campus for design.
Right now we have students in 3 different

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.040
buildings. When there's 15 inches of snow
on the ground and you have to walk a quarter

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.590
mile, you don't do it so the fourth year architecture
students and the second year interior design

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.930
students do not meet, it's just separated.
Uh, I think by putting everybody in one building

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.560
there's a collaborative spirit. There's an
understanding that I can ask somebody that's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.040
sitting 40 feet away. It'll just incorporate
a great deal of things.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.380
From a design standpoint, we were looking
for something that really knits the campus

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.030
and the community together because it is such
a prominent building, that has, that has an

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.250
iconic image for campus, that people are entering
the Kent campus from the North and West. This

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.360
is, you know, the first major building they'll
see and that we wanna have it something that

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.590
we're really proud of.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.590
This is a link and in some ways it's a metaphor
for what architects do, and interior designers.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.840
They take an idea that's scholarly. they translate
it into the practical, the tangible and so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.700
that link should be represented in the building
and I think, I think it's gonna have a great

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.000
deal to do with a new image.
