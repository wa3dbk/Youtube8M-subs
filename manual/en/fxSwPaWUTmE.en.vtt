Hi Friends,
vegetable pancakes are one of my favourite

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.679
food to have for breakfast or brunch. They
are so easy to make and versatile; you can

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.820
use any vegetables you have on hand. And today
we are making a carrot, spinach and sweet

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.460
potato version. So let’s get started.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.340
In a large mixing bowl, add 1 cup of chickpea

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.880
flour or besan. Add salt to taste. 1 teaspoon
of turmeric powder.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.180
Mix the ingredients well then add 3/4 cup of water.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.900
I am adding 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder now. I actually forgot to

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.500
add this to the dry ingredients before adding
the water but that’s okay. Mix it well in

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:22.700
the batter. Now add 1/3 cup of cooked mashed
sweet potato and whisk well.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.380
Add a handful of chopped coriander leaves or cilantro.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.340
Then set the batter aside.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.000
Add the spinach into a heated skillet. The
heat is on medium.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.260
Allow the spinach to wilt

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.820
a little then remove it from the pan.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.140
Then cut the spinach into smaller pieces.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.060
If you are using baby spinach,
you probably need not cut them.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.460
Now add the spinach to the batter followed
by the grated carrots.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.200
Give everything a good mix.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.680
Now the pancake batter is ready.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.240
Heat a pan on medium and brush with a little oil.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.930
You do need a little oil for this batter
as the sweet potato will tend to caramelise

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.880
and stick to the pan. Laddle some of the batter
on the hot pan.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.040
Spread the batter out rather thinly. We want these pancakes to be thin and crispy.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.620
They'll be a lot tastier this way.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.520
You may make small or large pancakes, it's up to you.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.360
Cook the pancake for
3 minutes on one side before flipping it onto

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.560
the other side. Cook for another 3 minutes
then flip again and cook for one minute.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.680
Then remove it from the pan onto a serving plate.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.560
You can make larger pancakes if you want to

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.580
cook up a larger batch faster.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.540
I tried to do a flip there. I almost got it. Almost!

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.880
For larger pancakes you can cut them into quarters or even smaller bite size pieces and serve them as

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.800
finger foods or party nibbles.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.700
These pancakes are crispy on the outside and

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.800
chewy inside. The caramelised sweet potatoes
add a hint of sweetness and the herbs add

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.960
so much freshness and fragrance.
So, enjoy my recipe and I’ll see you next time.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.220
Bye!
