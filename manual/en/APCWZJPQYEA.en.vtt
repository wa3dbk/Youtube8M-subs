In this recipe for Coriandolina® frozen pops,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.369
We will be using the following
pre-measured ingredients:

PreGel Coriandolina® Frozen Pop Coatings

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.629
And PreGel Vanilla Velvet Gelato (optional: PreGel Coriandolina® Frozen Pop Kit)

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.000
In this demonstration, we are using vanilla velvet gelato, but any flavor of gelato can be used.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.309
Begin your recipe by piping desired
gelato flavor

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.309
Into PreGel's frozen pop mold and inserting wooden sticks. 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.770
Immediately place in the blast freezer
for about 30 minutes

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.479
Allowing the frozen pops to harden.

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.850
Once set, quickly un-mold frozen pops on a Silpat-lined sheet pan

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.000
and store in a regular freezer for at
least 15 minutes or until ready to coat. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.300
When ready to coat, melt desired Coriandolina® Frozen Pop coating in the microwave.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.100
PreGel Coriandolina® Frozen Pop Coating flavors include:

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.400

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.550
Coffee, and Chocolate.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.000
When ready, carefully dip frozen pop into
the Coriandolina® Frozen Pop Coating

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.970
Allow excess to drip off frozen pop.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.900
Repeat as necessary, then immediately
decorate as desired.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.500
Place on a Silpat-lined sheet pan and store in the freezer until ready to serve.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.800

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.800
