We are just tidying up so we can film a sketch
that i've wanted to shoot for about 3 years now 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.460
called 'Baby With A Gun'.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.340
I have a pram here.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.660
Baby pram!!

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.769
(Mother) Hello! Hello! Hello!

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.949
Can I trust... Can you hand over... Give the
baby the gun.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.989
Yeah, that looks good. It looks really good.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:21.889
(Mother) Yeah? Is that okay?

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.240

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.520

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.880
Ciaran on the scale of best things you've
ever filmed...

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.550
(Ciaran) It's. It's pretty high on the list.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.420
This is the weirdest video ever right?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.540
Please don't eat your hands you need those.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.140
Hello! Hello! Put your hand down.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.740
The baby is gone now! No baby!

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.519
I want to make it very clear that even though
we did put prop guns on the baby.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.299
Everything else in this video has no baby
involvement.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.140
(Dancing to Toms Dog)

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.549

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:51.920
Stop.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.020
NOOOOO!!

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.980
I'm ready to act Mr. Gorbachov.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.120

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.320
There's the teeth you don't have yet.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.460
Okay, it's not a baby. It's a teddy bear.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.920
(Inaudible noise)

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.740

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.640
(Music)

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.600
That's a baby with a gun.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.380
It's a bag of ants.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.280
Can you sigh into it?

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.150

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.400
(Tom) Hello! Hello! Awww! You are adorable.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.200
Put the hand back down. You were doing so well.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.860
(Laughter)

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.300
I kind of want him to shoot me is the next one. I kind of want him to shoot you.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.300
I mean I get that and they're not in any order so.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.560
You're a baby. You're nothing.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.870
That's why I do that. That's why I!

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.780
(Screaming)

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.940

(Laughter)

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.979

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.960
(Laughter)

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.720
