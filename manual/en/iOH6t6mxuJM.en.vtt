00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:11.594
Mr. Goolsbee:
Hi, I'm Austan Goolsbee from the Council of Economic Advisers.

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:13.861
If you've followed these White
Boards you know that the very

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:18.661
first one we ever did was about
the fight over the tax cuts.

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:24.127
And it was that the Obama
Administration wanted to extend

00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:29.695
tax cuts on the first $250,000
of income and that Republicans

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:35.861
wanted a priority to extend tax
cuts for very high-income people

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:40.695
and was holding hostage these
tax cuts in order that we extend

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:42.528
these tax cuts.

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:44.761
The President's position
has not changed.

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.928
He does not support and does not
think that this will work for

00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:49.661
the economy.

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:52.994
But the other thing that hasn't
changed is Republican and

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:54.861
transients intransigence
in Congress.

00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:58.628
And we have now come up to the
very deadline when these tax

00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:04.294
cuts would expire and deal a really heavy blow to the overall economy.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:08.294
That's why the President decided
we had to break this stalemate

00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:11.394
and we had to find a way to
prevent taxes going up by

00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:15.027
thousands of dollars on middle
income people in this country

00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:16.861
starting January 1st.

00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:20.461
In that negotiation, the
President identified his

00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:23.761
priorities as being what are
those things that will get the

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:27.528
economy growing, and
we should do those.

00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:30.861
Now, much of the discussion
was about the tax cuts and the

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:37.127
President's insistence that we
extend unemployment insurance

00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:39.961
for those people that have lost
their jobs through no fault of

00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:44.127
their own and are actively
searching for work.

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:47.528
But the President insisted we do
more than just that if we were

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:51.994
to extend these tax
cuts even for two years.

00:01:51.994 --> 00:01:57.394
That includes things like the
Earned Income Tax Credit for

00:01:57.394 --> 00:02:07.127
low-income working people; the
American Opportunity Tax Credit

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:15.127
giving up to $2,500 for people
who have a kid in college;

00:02:15.127 --> 00:02:20.728
the Child Tax Credit as well as
a significant cut in the payroll

00:02:20.728 --> 00:02:26.528
tax that all workers pay that will save them more than $1,000

00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:31.528
a year, and the President's
signature investment incentives

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:36.261
to give tax breaks to companies
to build factories and invest in

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:42.661
equipment here at home.

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:46.027
These things are key to the
short-run recovery of the

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:48.928
economy in getting
the growth rate up.

00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:53.861
And I will point out that these
Obama tax cuts are more than

00:02:53.861 --> 00:03:00.061
twice as big as the high income
tax cuts in this short period.

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:03.394
Each of these is important, they're targeted,

00:03:03.394 --> 00:03:06.528
they're temporary, so they
have no impact on the long-run

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:10.928
deficit facing the country, and
they add up to serious money

00:03:10.928 --> 00:03:13.994
that could help boost this
recovery in the short run.

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.661
The President is going to
continue fighting this.

00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.861
When these tax cuts expire in
two years the President does not

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:22.628
think that they
should be renewed.

00:03:22.628 --> 00:03:25.394
But at a time when most people
thought we weren't going to be

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:29.961
able to do virtually anything
to get the economy growing,

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:33.695
the President saw the
opportunity to stretch beyond

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:36.994
the ideology, get
these things in place,

00:03:36.994 --> 00:03:40.027
incentives for investment, help
to the unemployed and to working

00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:45.261
families, to parents, to the
parents of students, and others.

00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:48.294
He did this to try to
increase the economy,

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:51.428
to try to increase
economic growth.

00:03:51.428 --> 00:03:54.628
The fact, is we're going to grow
our way out of these problems.

00:03:54.628 --> 00:03:59.061
And the foundation of that
growth is going to be right here.
