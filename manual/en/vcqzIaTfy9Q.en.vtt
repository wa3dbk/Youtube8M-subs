You will find your serial number located

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.170
on the underside of the cover. The only tools you will need for basic, non-utility

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.869
track installation,

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.280
is the seventeen millimeter socket and
ratchet, along with a pair of standard

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.630
utility clamps.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.659
Step 1 of  the installation process,

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.520
is to begin installing the aluminum side
rails to the inside the bed of the truck.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.100
Once in position, use your utility clamps to hold temporarily to check for

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.340
proper fitment.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.360
 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.369
Once your side rail is temporarily
clamped into position,

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.640
it is necessary to check for proper
fitment. First,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.110
make sure that the outside of the side rail fits flush with the top of the bed

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.740
of the truck.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.009
Next, make sure that the raill has
proper clearance

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.020
in the rear of the truck, where it needs
the tailgate and check the front of the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.750
bed as well.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.750
Now that you have checked for
proper fitment,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.480
it's time to install the factory
provided, aluminum seat clamps

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.860
and attach the side rail to the inside of the factory bed

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.599
rear lip. Make sure to locate the
seat clamp,

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.310
in a level spot, so the rail remains
level to accept the cover.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.730
The next step,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.959
in your installation will be to identify,
the mounting and tension control

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.709
pre-punched holes. The elongated slotted hole

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.500
is for mounting and the 3 1-8 inch holes,
offer your covers tension control

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.379
settings.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.500
The factory presets and build the covers

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.920
to be set on the first, almost rear located
hole.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.360
Simply drop the tension control plate in
place

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.430
and now you are ready to mount the
combination bulk head

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.430
and cover. Now that the tension control
plates are in place

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.470
it's time to install your combination
bulk head tonneau cover.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.430
Simply position the sliding T-bolts
towards the end

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.470
of the bulk head channel and drop the ball through the hole

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.690
in the tension control plate and through the
side rail.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.299
Finish fastening the washer and nylon locknut

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.489
and tighten.

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.239
To unroll the cover, simply release the
safety J-hooks

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.580
and begin to unroll your cover.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.459
Once your cover is completely unrolled,

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.980
lift up the aluminum tailgate channel
and place into the lever blocks located

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.519
in the rear of the side rail. Pull down
on the rear of the cover

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.580
and allow the catch to be latched. Last,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.769
re-attach the side velcro to smooth
out the cover.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.500
 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.019
To release the cover, simply pull down on the rear of the cover

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.820
and push the lever towards the front of
the vehicle. There may come a time to

open position,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.600
simply loosen the nylon locknut and lift
the balk head up from the side rail

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.820
and with the tension control plate up, one
adjustment hole

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.240
on both sides of the truck. The single 3/16th adjustment will provide

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.520
enough adjustment to take out any slack

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.850
you might have in your cover. This is
recommended only during the warmest part

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.560
