00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.600
Ta, Ha. (1) We have not sent down to you the Qur'an that you be distressed (2)

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.100
But only as a reminder for those who fear [Allah] -(3)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.300
A revelation from He who created the earth and highest heavens,(4)

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.000
The Most Merciful [who is] above the Throne established.(5)

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.000
To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and what is between them and what is under the soil.(6)

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:40.000
And if you speak aloud - then indeed, He knows the secret and what is [even] more hidden. (7)

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:50.600
Allah - there is no deity except Him. To Him belong the best names. (8)

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.500
And has the story of Moses reached you? - (9)

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:15.500
When he saw a fire and said to his family, "Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire; perhaps I can bring you a torch or find at the fire some guidance." (10)

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.500
And when he came to it, he was called, "O Moses, (11)

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:33.600
Indeed, I am your Lord, so remove your sandals. Indeed, you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa. (12)

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed [to you]. (13)

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:55.000
Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance. (14)

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:19.100
Indeed, the Hour is coming - I almost conceal it - so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives. (15)

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.300
So do not let one avert you from it who does not believe in it and follows his desire, for you [then] would perish. (16)

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.300
And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?" (17)

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:46.600
He said, "It is my staff; I lean upon it, and I bring down leaves for my sheep and I have therein other uses." (18)

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.300
[Allah] said, "Throw it down, O Moses." (19)

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.000
So he threw it down, and thereupon it was a snake, moving swiftly. (20)

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.600
[Allah] said, "Seize it and fear not; We will return it to its former condition. (21)

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:16.600
And draw in your hand to your side; it will come out white without disease - another sign, (22)
