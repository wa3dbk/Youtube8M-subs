00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.520
Except for crack, shrooms, heroin, etc

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.260
And not to mention, SPELL CHECK.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.620
But seriously, no drugs were used...

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.720
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP MOOO

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.580
HOW TO SPOT A POTHEAD

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.340
With your host-

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.520
There's no host...

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.700
You might think a pothead looks like this-

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.440
But the Potheads we're talking about today look more like this-

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.500
Meet Tommy. He's your typical pothead.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.280
Notice how his eyes are small, even for an Asian.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.280
A stupid dumb guy look on his face,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.440
Clothes that look like they haven't been washed in years...

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.680
Tommy: I just washed this yesterday-

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.480
*throws something at him* SHUT UP TOMMY, you piece of sh*t

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.780
Tommy: oww dude...

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.260
You're probably wondering: what's so bad about a Pothead?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.840
EVERYTHING

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.260
Potheads are dangerous to society.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.200
We clearly see here that this man is stoned and up to no good.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.620
*drunk guy in the background, saying random stuff*

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.540
Notice the messy hair and smiling ILLEGALLY.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.140
In Background, 2nd Guy: who's this guy here...

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.720
Guys in background fighting...

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.860
Nobody wants to see a crime like this in their neighborhood.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.660
That's why we have our Criminal Justice System.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Hey! Police- freeze! *smacks hand*

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.940
Police: You come with me.  ....walk downtown...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.740
Wha.. I didn't do anything... Police: Yeah, yeah...

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.600
Hippie.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.440
*2nd Guy shoots 1st Guy in Background*

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.180
No more crime in this town, buddy.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.560
See, POTHEADS NEVER WIN

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.300
That's where the acronym comes from:

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.180
People Outta Think About How Bad Pot Can Be For You Especially At Dinner Tables

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.340
Tommy, I told you: no smoking pot at the dinner table.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.180
Tommy: Come on, Pop, It's just weed. What could happen?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.640
*Explosion*

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.420
You should've listened to your mother, Tommy Boy.(XD)

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.020
Here's a few more ways to spot a Pothead.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.820
If he listens to Bob Marley, Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa or Taylor Swift chances are-

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.720
-Romeo take me somewhere... (from Love Story by TSwift)-

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.980
You've got a POTHEAD.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.860
If you were born in the 60's...

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.580
The 1860's -calm down parents-

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580
Chances are- you're a POTHEAD.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.160
If he carries a lighter -POTHEAD-

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.880
If he carries eyedrops- POTHEAD-

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.440
And if he carries a boombox -POTHEAD-

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.520
If he likes the colour green he's a -POTHEAD-

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.820
If he wears the colour green he's a -POTHEAD-

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.840
If he is green he -RECYCLES-

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.860
And if he owns plants, he is definitely a -POTHEAD-

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.960
And those plants are most likely -POTTED-

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.600
Speaking of Potheads, let's check in with Tommy.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800
Tommy: I don't smoke weed anymore.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.580
I'm clean now. I'm actually a gardener, so don't blow me up.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.480
*crouches and starts pulling weeds*

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.440
Tommy: WAIT! This doesn't count, right?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.240
BOOM!!

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.100
Wrong again, Tommy Girl. (XD)

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.220
Weed is Weed and if you have it, you will explode!

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.380
A dead giveaway for a Pothead is when an individual defends the use of pot.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.220
Weed is not even bad for you.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.820
Pot's good for you, bro!

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.860
Pot makes people happy; it's not bad!

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.260
It's from the ground, dude.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300
It's a plant, it comes from the ground.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.100
Everything from the ground is natural, dude, everything.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.060
When I smoke pot, I'm happy.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.120
Wait...

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.160
Pot backwards is TOP!

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.720
...Unless you're a plant hater!

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.240
And when you're on TOP, you're HIGH!

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.860
...Like a Vegetarian...

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.380
And when you're HIGH, you're on POT! AND POT BACKWARDS IS TOP! Dude, fex.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.540
Hey you stupid Potheads, I got two words for you:

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.600
WEED IS ILLEGAL

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.060
So cut it out, right Tommy?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.580
Tommy: I'm out. I've stopped smoking weed, I don't even pull weeds anymore.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.680
Anything to do with weed, I've stopped.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.020
So stop blowing me up.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.900
I'm done. I'm d- *phone rings*

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.860
*phone ringing*

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.420
"Not like this."

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.420
(It's Taylor Swift!! LOL)

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.060
"Not like this."      {Movie Reference: The Matrix.}

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.420
*Explosion*

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.360
TEEHEE
