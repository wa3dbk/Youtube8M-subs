00:00:00.678 --> 00:00:03.279
- Good morning, clan.
And welcome to Friday!

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.673
I am sitting here at Park
Cafe with my lovely wife,

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.141
enjoying a white mocha, waiting for

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:11.438
our amazing breakfast
that we just ordered.

00:00:11.438 --> 00:00:14.661
- [Clintus] You wanna tell
them what we just did?

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:16.694
- What? Before this?

00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:19.678
Sierra's smarty-pants award ceremony?

00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:21.242
- [Clintus] What'd she get?

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:23.259
- She got honor roll.
- [Clintus] Which means?

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.569
- She got one B.

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:29.602
Which honor roll is A's
and B's, but she got one B.

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:30.998
- I don't remember if
I vlogged that or not,

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.458
but she got Principal's List last time,

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.409
which is straight-A's,
that was last quarter.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.299
First quarter: Principal's List,
second quarter: honor roll.

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:38.275
There's two more quarters,

00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:39.476
I told her she needs to step it up!

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:42.504
No, we're very proud of her,
obviously, getting A's and B's.

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:44.262
It was a short quarter,
the principal even said

00:00:44.262 --> 00:00:45.479
that it was a short quarter.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.928
And so, the fact that
she was able to maintain

00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:52.780
A's and B's just goes to
show how awesome she is!

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:57.904
- Ah, it's good!

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.085
- [Clintus] What'd I tell
ya? What'd I tell ya?

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:03.150
Look at that, huevos rancheros.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.522
I think that's your favorite
breakfast dish, isn't it?

00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:06.382
- Yeah.

00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:07.882
- And I ordered the shrimp omelet,

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:09.792
'cause it sounded amazing!

00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:11.059
It looks amazing.

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:12.561
I'm not gonna lie though,
I actually brought

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:15.174
Tiffany here today because
I wanted the chilaquiles.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:17.576
I remember them being amazing,

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.103
and I wasn't even gonna look at the menu,

00:01:19.103 --> 00:01:20.172
I was like, "That's what I'm gonna get".

00:01:20.172 --> 00:01:21.878
Then I looked at the menu,
and I saw the shrimp omelet,

00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:24.227
and I was like, "Um, I
think I should try that."

00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:26.044
I think I should try
that, so I'm gonna try it!

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:31.034
(machine whirring loudly)

00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:35.951
- [Tiffany] A halfer?
- Yep.

00:01:40.714 --> 00:01:41.193
- [Tiffany] Good stuff?

00:01:41.193 --> 00:01:43.241
- Yep. I got cherry and blue raspberry.

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:44.763
That one's all done.

00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:47.270
- [Tiffany] How was school, today?

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.526
- Good.
- [Tiffany] Good.

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:52.793
(dribbling basketballs
and indistinct chatter)

00:01:58.423 --> 00:02:03.004
(dribbling basketballs)

00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:10.813
- Okay guys, so it is nighttime,
as you can tell already.

00:02:10.813 --> 00:02:12.892
Tiffany and I had a
lovely morning together,

00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:15.806
and then I spent all day working on

00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:19.561
game videos and editing and
emails, all kinds of stuff,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.298
boring adult things that
aren't worth vlogging.

00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:24.038
So, here we are, like six hours later.

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:27.222
And I'm taking Sierra to
a new volleyball camp.

00:02:27.222 --> 00:02:28.354
So we're gonna check this
out for the first time,

00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:29.631
it's a couple miles from our house.

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:30.710
Hopefully it's awesome,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.353
and hopefully she has something
new to do on Friday nights,

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.752
with volleyball, while
Bryce is at basketball.

00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:40.752
(volleyballs bouncing)

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.250
- [Voiceover] Here we go!

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.233
(volleyball thumps)

00:02:47.712 --> 00:02:50.289
- [Clintus] Aw, Bryce
is makin' his own soda!

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.750
We got grape Fanta?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.329
So many to choose from!

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.254
- So I ended up ditching Sierra

00:02:55.254 --> 00:02:57.100
at that club volleyball thing

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.199
to grab dinner with Tiffany and Bryce.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.630
And we're at Pei Wei,
per Tiffany's request.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.985
Got hot and sour soup, trying
two different sushi rolls.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.514
What'd you get Bryce?

00:03:07.514 --> 00:03:12.329
- I got sweet and sour chicken

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.661
with noodles and vegetables.

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:20.061
- [Clintus] And mommy got Mongolian beef.

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:21.199
- Got veggies.

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.194
- [Clintus] Extra veggies.
Yum, yum, yum, yum!

00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:25.801
So what'd you think of
that volleyball, huh?

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:26.812
- It was really cool.

00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:28.055
- [Clintus] Yeah? You think it's something

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:29.320
we can start doing on Fridays?

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.926
- Yeah.

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.811
- [Clintus] I think so,
too. Now what're you doing?

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.786
- I'm gonna have a sleepover with Tatiana.

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:35.724
- [Clintus] Ooh, you
gonna ditch us now, huh?

00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:36.427
- Mmhmm.

00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:38.041
- [Clintus] Alright. Have fun!

00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:41.947
As I said before, busy
day doing things and stuff

00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:44.535
and game plays have been one of them.

00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:47.648
I haven't posted a ClintusGames
video in the last two days

00:03:47.648 --> 00:03:49.724
because I'm outta game plays.

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:53.009
I recorded two Unboxing
videos a couple days ago,

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.226
published one, I have
to edit the other still,

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:58.015
but I didn't want to do two
Unboxing videos back-to-back.

00:03:58.015 --> 00:04:01.903
I guess two Unboxing videos
are better than no videos.

00:04:01.903 --> 00:04:04.017
But anyways, I'm recording
a bunch of game plays

00:04:04.017 --> 00:04:06.002
trying to just record a bunch of them,

00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:07.535
as much as I can.

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:11.359
That way I have content all
the way through Playlist Live.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.651
So, I've got three or four GTAV videos,

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:18.089
three or four Advanced Warfare videos,

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.875
I'm getting ready to do
Farcry 4 for the first time,

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:23.057
and then I'll round it
out with some Destiny

00:04:23.057 --> 00:04:24.509
to end out the night.

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.413
So hopefully lots of, lots of good stuff

00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:28.654
over on ClintusGames for you guys.

00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:30.151
Alright guys, we're gonna go
ahead and call it a night.

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:31.335
Hope you enjoyed the video, if you did,

00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:32.589
(stammering) be sure
to give it a thumbs up!

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:33.657
I can't talk.
(humming lip flutters)

00:04:33.657 --> 00:04:34.830
It's three in the morning.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.269
I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed.

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:37.035
Hope you enjoyed the video.

00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:38.452
If you did, be sure to
give it a thumbs up.

00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:41.789
We'll see you tomorrow, Saturday, fun day!

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.077
(whispers) Vlog on!

00:04:43.077 --> 00:04:47.503
- [Clintus] I know, I know,
it's a short video, I'm sorry!

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:48.675
It happens sometimes.

00:04:48.675 --> 00:04:50.631
It happens when you go daily, you know,

00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:52.226
like some days are awesome,

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:53.278
and today was one of them,

00:04:53.278 --> 00:04:55.109
'cause I was busy working on stuff,

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:57.006
and taking my sweet time.

00:04:57.006 --> 00:04:58.575
On the screen though, two more videos!

00:04:58.575 --> 00:04:59.085
That's the best part,

00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:00.479
there's two more videos
here for you to watch.

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.197
So, even though this was
only like five minutes,

00:05:02.197 --> 00:05:03.759
here's two more for you to watch.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.328
One year ago, Bryce is
having a snaggle-tooth.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:08.767
I don't remember if I pull it out or not,

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.567
or if we leave it in,
I think I pull it out.

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:12.133
He had a tooth that was just
hangin' out of his gums,

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:14.343
it was kinda gross and turning black.

00:05:14.343 --> 00:05:15.796
I think I pulled it out.

00:05:15.796 --> 00:05:19.164
Two years ago, I explain
how I love a happy

00:05:19.164 --> 00:05:21.590
and complete ending of a movie.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.682
After watching a movie,
I was very disappointed

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:27.944
and I kinda talk about that
a little bit with the kids.

00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:29.501
So check that out, annotations
are clickable links

00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:30.836
in the description down below.

00:05:30.836 --> 00:05:33.097
And we will see you tomorrow
for a much longer video

00:05:33.097 --> 00:05:35.082
because it's Saturday, and Saturday videos

00:05:35.082 --> 00:05:36.945
are always long and awesome!
