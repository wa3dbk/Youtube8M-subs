Hello, Personal alright hope so

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.149
Well, today I'm going to teach you how to write games for PlayStation 2

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:10.829
In a blank DVD

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.959
Using the program Alcohol 120%

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:15.299
okay?!

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.640
is quite simple, but first of all you people have to know that the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.070
file format for you can save the game must always be in

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.640
ISO image

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.859
I'll show you one way really fast here

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.740
how to make the file ready to burn

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.800
you go where you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.940
recorded his Download

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.640
I left here in my folder of games I have

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.500
So I separated a game to do demo

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.780
When you download most often comes here

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.730
WinRar that format, which is here in this briefcase

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.930
Okay?!

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.410
you click with the right button mouse

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.230
and then click extract file

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.160
After you extract another briefcase will appear here

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.490
This is what you will use to make recording of the game in DVD

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.180
okay!?

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.990
It was just to explain quickly, now we go to Alcohol

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.090
Some people talk Alcohol

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.020
but

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.390
whatever's it, no problem

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.340
My version is still test version, but who want to buy can be

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.240
will

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.909
Next step, come on we will here 'Assistant

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.200
for image recording' here this second option

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.710
okay, this will open another screen, you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.220
Here you will 'choose' in

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.080
Then the game will show you extracted

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.500
after you click on the file twice

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.010
Sometimes, beyond the image you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.980
extracted, will spawn other

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.500
But it does not matter what you have to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.770
Choose, it is always the bigger picture, the size you see here

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.929
vai see here the largest file

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.649
and you choose to

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.199
Then you come in here next, which will open another screen

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.589
This is another screen to start recording your game

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:22.019
First thing you have to do is come here in recording speed

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.989
They'll have some options, sometimes will have multiple options, but you always

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.499
choosing the smallest possible, ever the minimum

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.969
If you choose the maximum or some faster

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.259
may be that the recording be pretty bad

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.839
or sometimes not record

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.899
then you always choosing the minimum

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:44.099
can be sure that will write ever

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.179
next you go on Recording Method

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:52.229
next will have a few options, at the moment has only one,

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.489
but most often appear other

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.389
but as for is PlayStation 2

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.359
you always choose the option DAO

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.519
DAO, okay?!

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.469
okay

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.839
the last here, you go on Data Format

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.169
you will see that they will have some options

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.199
but as it is for PS2, you will here PlayStation2

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.939
alright

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.449
well, this is basically just personal

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:25.459
Start here after you, will start loading the game

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.179
the recording

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:29.849
OK, when finished charging

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.059
and eject your DVD, you'll be all set to play, only you put the game on PS2

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.619
and you can be sure it will be ready and you will be able to play time

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.939

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.029

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:46.539
