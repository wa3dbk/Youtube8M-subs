00:00:14.990 --> 00:01:01.210
Hey what is up guys.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:02:24.410
Muwen360 is here and welcome back to another
video.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:05:01.569
So the LG G4 has been out on the market for
about 4 months after its debut.

00:05:01.569 --> 00:08:15.710
And I think at the 4 month mark, it’s a
good time for me to take a look at the device

00:08:15.710 --> 00:11:02.120
again and give you guys more of a long-term
review which I think is very helpful to a

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:48.339
lot of consumers out there.

00:11:48.339 --> 00:13:39.279
But anyways, with recent announcements from
manufacturers like Motorola, Samsung as well

00:13:39.279 --> 00:15:48.699
as the impending launch of the new iPhone,
how well has the G4 aged?

00:15:48.699 --> 00:17:58.130
How is the overall performance and experience
when it’s not shiny and new anymore?

00:17:58.130 --> 00:20:35.289
Well let’s find out in my video review as
we revisit the LG G4 – four months later.

00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:53.779
Stay tuned.

00:20:53.779 --> 00:22:35.470
So for this video, my structure and format
is pretty simple.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:24:17.529
I’m gonna discuss with you what’s awesome,
what I like about the phone.

00:24:17.529 --> 00:24:19.409
And of course I’m also gonna cover some
of its shortcoming and needs for improvement.

00:24:19.409 --> 00:24:21.419
The biggest change with how I’ve used my
G4 since my initial review is the addition

00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:22.419
of the leather back covers.

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:24.299
One of my complaints in the initial review
was that the G4 kind of feels cheap with all

00:24:24.299 --> 00:24:26.429
that plastic, but now after using the leather
backs, it feels a lot more premium like a

00:24:26.429 --> 00:24:27.429
premium as it should be.

00:24:27.429 --> 00:24:29.309
I have the orange one on here which looks
really nice and here are some of the other

00:24:29.309 --> 00:24:30.309
colors.

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:31.700
And the size of the patinas will vary as you
can tell depending on the color you get.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.700
LG says the type of leather that were used
to make these backs is handcrafted, genuine

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.700
full grain leather.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.080
Color is added onto the leather by employing
a vegetable tanning process which is an age

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.590
old tradition that requires skilled craftsmen
to produce and dye the leather.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.850
The colors of the leather on the G4 are rich
with warm tones that look authentic and change

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:40.850
over time to reflect your own unique style.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:42.350
Most importantly, vegetable tanned leather
is environmentally friendly and can be recycled

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.350
easily, since no harsh chemicals are used.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.360
If you want to learn more the process which
I think is quite fascinating, you can hit

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.740
up the link the description or the click the
on-screen annotation.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.750
And it’s refreshing to see LG has decided
to use leather instead of metal, which have

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.750
become standard across the industry.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.760
Though I will say the these leather back cover
are a little pricy but you get what you pay

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.760
for.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.890
And if you want your to look and feel more
premium, adding leather is definitely the

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:54.890
way to go.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.640
So the G4, even to this day, checks pretty
much all of the boxes for all of the things

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.769
that you would want to have in a smartphone.

00:24:57.769 --> 00:24:59.529
It’s got a beautiful Quad-HD 5.5 inch Quantum
IPS display, with excellent color reproduction

00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:00.529
and accuracy.

00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:01.909
And I just found out recently that the display
is calibrated to DCI standards for color expression,

00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:02.909
used actually by top Hollywood studios.

00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:04.539
So the display is still excellent which makes
watching videos and playing games a blast.

00:25:04.539 --> 00:25:06.549
Though I will say the screen doesn’t get
as bright as some of its competitors, which

00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:07.929
makes it a little bit difficult to see under
direct sunlight.

00:25:07.929 --> 00:25:08.929
And it doesn’t get as dim either.

00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:11.059
It’s not a big deal and overall my opinions
in regard to the display has not changed from

00:25:11.059 --> 00:25:13.070
my initial review and it remains to be one
of the best smartphone displays ever created.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.200
In terms of hardware, everything is fine,
the G4 does not bend in case you were wondering.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.330
I’ve taken good care of the G4 by using
screen protectors and cases so once you wipe

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.330
off the fingerprints, it looks brand spanking
new.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.710
The 5.5 inch form factor is again fantastic
for media consumption.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.470
It’s really comfortable to hold and easy
to grip thanks to that subtle curvature.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.720
But for me, it’s a little big for my hands
at least in terms of single hand use.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.600
But again this is just for me personally since
my hands are not the biggest.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.230
So I use the G4 mostly at home as kind of
a mini-tablet.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.370
When I’m out on the road, I usually resort
to something smaller, around 5 inch, 5.1 inches

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.370
is the sweet spot for me.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.120
Don’t really have anything else say about
the hardware, the rear keys are easy to get

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.120
use to and easy to use.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.880
The position of the speaker is not ideal,
it’s back firing but the quality and the

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880
volume is okay.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.010
Moving on to software, it runs LG’s UX 4.0
skin over Android 5.1 lollipop.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.520
The interface is clean, modern and still runs
very fluid and fast.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.269
I’ve noticed very little lag or stuttering
if any, during my time using it.

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:42.399
And so the software has not bogged down over
time and hopefully it can stay that way.

00:25:42.399 --> 00:25:44.159
Some apps do crash occasionally but that’s
not LG’s problem, because all Android phones

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:45.159
experience it to some degree.

00:25:45.159 --> 00:25:46.669
But LG wasn’t kidding when they said Qualcomm
worked with them closely together to make

00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:48.419
sure that the software and hardware are fined-tuned
and optimized perfectly and that translates

00:25:48.419 --> 00:25:49.669
to a very pleasant user experience even after
4 months.

00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:51.559
But LG’s track record with software updates
is questionable and I have yet to receive

00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:52.809
a single update for my G4 even after 4 months.

00:25:52.809 --> 00:25:54.809
but LG is making strides here with the promise
of frequent security updates because of the

00:25:54.809 --> 00:25:56.440
stagefright vulnerability and hopefully LG
can deliver the Android M update before the

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.820
end of the 2015 when it comes out later this
year.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.200
Oh and the camera remains to be of its best
features.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.080
A 16 megapixel rear camera and 8 megapixel
selfie camera capable of producing some beautiful

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080
pictures and videos.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.460
Manual mode was kind of cool at first but
I haven’t really used it much since.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.720
I’m fine with just using auto mode to take
pictures.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.720
So the G4 probably has of the best cameras
in a smartphone if not the best.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.230
Battery life and endurance has been steady
over these past four months.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.740
I usually get 5 and a half hours of screen
on time and it gets me through the day just

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.740
fine.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.240
And if that’s not the case for you, you
can always swap out the battery or use a quick

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.240
charger to rapidly recharge.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.250
Having the ability to add up to 2 TB of additional
storage has come in handy because the 32 gigs

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:17.250
of internal storage wasn’t quite enough.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.010
So on the whole, after 4 months of use, the
G4 as held up pretty well.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.020
If you’re someone who is looking to buy
a flagship device today at a cheaper price

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.269
than some of its competitors, the G4 should
be near the top of your list thanks to recent

00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:25.529
price cuts from carriers like T-Mobile where
you can pick up a G4 for only $480 full retail.

00:26:25.529 --> 00:26:27.659
But with the rumored LG G4 Pro on the horizon,
carrying some beastly specs including a Snapdragon

00:26:27.659 --> 00:26:29.789
820 and possibly a new design, you’ll probably
want to hold picking up a G4 this fall.

00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:32.169
Even if the G4 turns to be superior in someways
to whatever the rumored G4 Pro ends up being,

00:26:32.169 --> 00:26:34.179
you’ll almost certainly get a better deal
on the older phone, once the newer one hits

00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:35.179
shelves.

00:26:35.179 --> 00:26:36.179
So if you don’t have one already, I’m
gonna recommend you wait a bit.

00:26:36.179 --> 00:26:38.320
If you do, you can still feel good about owning
one of the best Android phones of 2015.
