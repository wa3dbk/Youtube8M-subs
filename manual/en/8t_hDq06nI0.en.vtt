00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.320
Dairy free Pumpkin Cream

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.520
Hello Friends! Today we will make a delicious dairy free pumpkin cream or squash soup

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.120
and this cream is ideal for anyone who wants to eat something delicious, healthy, and low in calories

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.340
It is, of course, vegan and vegetarian

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.040
so I invite you to see the ingredients and then the preparation

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.440
The ingredients for the light pumpkin cream are:

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.840
2 garlic cloves that we cut them in half

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.960
these are about 2 tablespoons of red pepper that are not peeled

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.120
this is a medium onion, cut into julienne strips

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.140
this is about 2 tablespoons of red cabbage, if you have the regular one, you can also use that

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.170
and we will use this to add a little bit of more flavor to our pumpkin cream

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.320
Here we have a whole medium zucchini, it has different names depending on the country that you live in

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.680
but we here we call zucchini

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:20.720
This is a medium carrot, the skin was not removed and it was cut into slices

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.980
and these are 300 grams of pumpkin or squash

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.840
we will use olive oil, 1 tablespoon

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.680
use the oil that you commonly use, we will use olive oil this time

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.380
and 1 tablespoon

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.620
1 teaspoon of salt, you can add more or less, that depends on your taste

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.020
It is up to you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.100
This is a medium potato left in water, and that is basically so that the potato will not be oxidized

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.580
here we have 1 liter of boiled water, but we could use less

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.700
we will see that once we start doing the pumpkin cream

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.720
and finally there are the condiments or seasonings

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.140
here we have ground pepper, that we will use to taste

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.440
here is a teaspoon of paprika

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.800
and finally, dried oregano, which is 1 teaspoon

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.480
Friends, the preparation is as follows:

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.640
let's light the stove up to medium heat

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.600
and we will use this wok, because it's ideal for this preparation and to show you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.380
so that you can see well

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.499
here we add the olive oil and these vegetables that always go first, we stir fry

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.480
the onion, garlic, red pepper and red cabbage

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.160
and then we will season the veggies with paprika, dried oregano and the ground pepper

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.840
and of course we add salt

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.700
we mix well, whith the help of a wooden spoon

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.180
and now we add the rest of the vegetables, such as carrots, the chopped pumpkin

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.280
The zucchini or courgette, as they call it in other countries

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.720
and finally the potato cut into 4 pieces

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.720
we mix well this ingredients

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.520
so that the spices are well integrated to the vegetables

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.160
and then we'll add 750 ml of boiling water

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.960
we will cover the pan and we'll let the vegetables to simmer for about 10 to 12 minutes

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.520
we will test them with a knife to see if the potato, pumpkin or squash and carrots are well cooked

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.019
and it's time to turn off the heat

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.520
and with the help of a skimmer, we're going to remove the cooked vegetables

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.300
and that will help us to cool down the veggies

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.800
that will go straight to the blender

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.880
and we will blend the vegetables. Also, we will look up the amount of water that we add

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.800
to the blender, because we want the cream to be dense

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.160
you see the soup was spectacular, then we'll freeze the leftovers

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.880
because we can use that for other preparations

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.360
Here we will use 1 ladles of vegetable soup

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.599
and we will help us with this kitchen towel, that's very useful if some of the cream leaks when we blend it

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.780
we will liquefy it completely, and continue adding all the vegetables

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.039
until it's completely blended and it has the consistency of a cream

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.060
it really is delicious, adults and children will love it

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:06.309
and now we are going to show you that it looks just like a cream without adding any dairy

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.800
and this goes to a soup bowl or cream, in this case

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.680
and we will decorate the cream with some parsley leaves

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.520
and enjoy it because it really is delicious

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.300
