00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.420
of our cool products this is my

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.279
absolutely favorite it's the envelope

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.460
template kit and it has I think six one two

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.279
three four five well maybe it only is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.880
five I'll count again one two three four five it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.430
has five templates in it and they're

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.619
really really cool they're all these

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.059
different sizes and so you can make

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.980
envelopes from almost anything 4 bar

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.710
get rid of this the biggest is the a7

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.660
the smallest is the 4 bar and then

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.730
there's three in between and they have

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.969
this cream little thing that gets stuck

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.140
in the template and you just pull them

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.640
out throw them away you guys remember

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.289
Julia Child's how great she was she

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.809
would just go with the eggshells that's

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.270
what we're doing here today my big lot

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.720
like that and then they can be used as a

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.270
place we're going to do the scoring I'll

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.090
show you that later so what's wonderful

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.300
about them is that you can use these to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.729
be really really creative i'm going to

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.509
show you first this calendar this

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.050
is a calendar by Cavallini so you pick

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.759
your first your page I have one here

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.080
it's a nice image of a clown and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.959
then you try to find a place on them i'm

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.009
going to use the 4 bar because

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.200
that's my favorite I like the little

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.170
envelopes here's the 4 bar so you put

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.929
it on and you can see through the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.500
template it's a translucent material so

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.819
you can see rather well and by the way

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.099
there are two sides a smooth side and a

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:02.479
rough side and if you put the rough side

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.509
down it doesn't move if you put the

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.520
slide this shiny side down it moves

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.250
pretty well so always put the rough side

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.410
down which is how you can of course read

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.340
and of course you can read that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.260
wonderful word Paper Source so you just

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.710
move this around and two

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.110
you get it exactly the way you want it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.680
and then I forgot I've got the whole

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.970
calendar under here that's going to make

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.860
life difficult I love it and then you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.440
take your pen and you trace around the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:44.430
sheet and yeah some people are really

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.010
good at this I'm not really good I did

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.520
well in kindergarten but tracings not my

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.320
strength so there you are and now you

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.940
can take your handy-dandy scissors I

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.590
love these new scissors from tonic

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.510
they're so good and you notice I cheat I

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.300
don't go like this with my scissors if

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.330
they're nice and sharp you can just open

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.210
them up and drag the scissors makes it a

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.600
lot easier and once you get the sucker

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.540
cut out then you take your little guy

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.580
like this and you put it on top and we

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.470
use your bone folder and you score and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.290
these little slots that are just perfect

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:48.960
and then you can fold the guy right on

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.370
those so you can see the score marks

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.320
from the back and then you fold right on

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.760
those lines and this is the order that

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.680
bottom flap always goes over the two

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.460
sides and then the important flap is

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.530
last and then you can glue it together

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.790
with either increda tape you just take a

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.110
little piece and you just can put it

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.830
down like this

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.480
pull it off right there now see I

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.730
cut my too long no problem you just

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.050
roll it over to the side like that

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.380
yeah that's enough now do you see look

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.130
you see my of the tape too high in

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.860
competence but you can fix it you just

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.220
roll it back something happened there

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.220
now it's covered perfect so you do

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.960
that all the way around actually let's

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.885
say I'm a glue stick kind of girl and I

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.060
just love always do it on the uh-oh

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:59.430
pretend I didn't do that like that like this there

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.310
so cute and then this is what goes through

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.010
the mail and there you are

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.400
and then you can just twist it around

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.440
until you get it until you get it just

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.880
like this one over here is on the move

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.520
I'm trying to make it look like this is

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.610
the one I did okay so you move it around

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.240
until you mmm again I had a perfectly

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.900
position
