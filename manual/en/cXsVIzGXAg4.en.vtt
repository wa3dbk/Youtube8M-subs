00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.500
hwangboel from Ontario YAY ONTARIO MY HOME PROVINCE asked the question

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.410
What are some of the cultural things you still can't get used to no matter how hard you try.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.640
OK ME FIRST!  I know what I want to talk about.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.540
Ok go ahead.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.340
Ok.  Korea.  We need to have a talk.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.860
Come closer.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.050
A little bit closer.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.480
Come on, a little bit closer ok that's too close back up a bit.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.190
Ok.  Korea, if you can't tell by now, we love you.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.400
You're a wonderful country.  We feel very very safe here.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.980
In the middle of the night we can walk through Central Park

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.840
and the worst thing we'll see are two people playing badminton.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.160
So we feel very, very safe here and we love it.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.060
BUT...the one thing that we can't get used to is how dangerously you drive.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.960
Oh yeah.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.560
Actually, if you're a pedestrian, you have to avoid being smushed by like

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.580
taxis and busses blowing through red lights.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.880
Or if you drive a car - in our case we drive a scooter

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.080
you have to avoid being smushed by people who don't check their blind spot

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.680
It's like, it's generally just a death trap.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.890
Red lights here are more suggestions than they actually are laws.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.050
I swear to you, just go to an intersection and watch for a couple of minutes

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.760
you will see a few scooters and a few buses, even a few taxis

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.250
blowing through red lights at their convenience.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.370
We're not joking when we say this: 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.480
you gotta look both ways when you cross the street,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.380
EVEN if it's a One Way Street.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.610
Because people will be driving on any side of the road that they want.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.600
It's really scary.  Korea: please stop trying to kill me.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.990
I'm not joking here: I do feel in danger when I go outside.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.240
So I'll tell you something funny: we have our scooter now for two years,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.840
and it's very easy to get a scooter license in Korea,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.750
but to get your license back in Canada

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.860
you have to go through very many different levels and tests

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.760
and I feel like saying to the instructors, "there is no test that you can give me

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.080
that is equal to the dangers and the perils that I have faced

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.610
while I was driving my scooter.  Your little closed circuits MEAN NOTHING!"

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.230
Alright.  I feel like I'm in a level of Frogger meets Contra meets Duke Nukem.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.620
And actually I think that inside of the buses are worse than outside of them,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.620
I don't know about that,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.550
Ok well I used to take the bus before I had the scooter,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.750
and when you get on the bus you've got to beep

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.620
and, like, run, and latch onto a pole

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.960
because that bus driver is gonna gun it,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.460
he's like an INDY 500 racer, and you will launch yourself across the side of the bus.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.660
We've been on buses in which an old lady would get on the bus

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.890
and before she even sits down the bus is gonna gun it

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.590
and she, like, winds up falling over

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.300
and it's so inconsiderate and scary and we really dislike it.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.930
Yeah, I've caught, like, three old women from almost smashing their faces on the ground

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.230
so...oooh!  Scary!  They're out to kill me!

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.340
Korea: great country, very nice people: not very good at driving.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.450
I remember when I was a kid in Canada,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.860
when you were learning how to line up for something, butting was a huge problem.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.780
I mean, if someone tried to cut in front of you in line,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.900
BUTTER!  BUTTER!  YOU'RE BUTTING!  MURDER HIM!  MURDER

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.590
This lineup process that we learned as children 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.800
didn't really seem to transfer over to Korea,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.630
So you're waiting in line on a hot summer day for a bus [HOT HOT SUMMER]

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.500
for about 20 minutes or so, you're in a nice lineup,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.330
everything's going well, and oh!  There's the bus pulling up!

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.550
Oh and look!  There's that random Korean girl that just showed up 30 seconds ago

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.430
and she's like "IS THAT THE BUS?" and she just cuts all of us off

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.140
and walks straight on because the bus pulled up in front of her.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.060
This is what my face looks like:

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.980
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.480
Now, this isn't only for buses.  You see this for subways as well:

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.710
if you're not pressed up against the subway when it's coming

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.010
people are gonna butt in front of you.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.770
So, we've learned a new technique to help us combat this.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.280
It's called boxing out. 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.500
Have you ever played basketball?  Need to go for a rebound?

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.620
What you need to do is you need to squat down low,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.430
put your legs wide, put your arms out wide

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.150
and make a little fence to let people know not to go around you or in front of you

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.860
Now since Martina and I are together it makes it a lot easier

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.280
because we can both form a fence together 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.110
and nobody is gonna butt in front of us!

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.920
But we feel kind of ridiculous that we've had to resort to boxing out,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.150
but you do what you gotta do to survive son!

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
It's a dangerous world out there.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.860
So that's it for this week's TL;DR.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.280
If there's a question you want us to answer for next week's segment,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280
head over to our Google Moderator page

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.110
and leave a question in the question box.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.400
Or, if you don't want to leave a question

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.220
you can vote up or vote down the questions that you like

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.810
and hopefully we'll answer it next week.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.260
Huzzah!

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.750
Box out!

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.040
GONG!

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.706
