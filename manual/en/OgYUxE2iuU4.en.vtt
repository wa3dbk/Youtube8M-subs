00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.980
Today, we're going to be talking about a
program called Tube Launch, which charges

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.270
you for a whole bunch of information you can
find online for free!

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:16.270
You know, there are two major problems with
the Tube Launch product. The first one is

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.419
the quality of the information. It's just
not high quality. As I said in the intro of

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.060
this video, you can find anything you find
in the Tube Launch member's area for free

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.399
very, very easily and you can also find it
explained in a much more condensed manner

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.050
because they are just filling it up with a
whole bunch of flap that you don't really

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.579
need to know. For example, I don't need
12 minutes to explain to you what Clickbank

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
is, which is one of the first videos when
you get in the member's area. The second

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.899
major problem with Tube Launch is going to
be the quantity of license they give you.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.300
Well, I will talk about both of those things
as we go a little bit through here.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.730
Now, I want to start at the beginning. When
you log into the member's are for Tube Launch

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.990
for the first time, you may be kind actually
kind of excite because they put together some

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.520
graphics. You know, they put together something
that looks kind of good and if you bought

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.770
a lot of products in this industry you know,
that is kind of rare. There are a lot of publishers

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.280
in this industry that throw together crap
and something that just looks like a skeleton

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.659
on the back end because they already had your
money. So you log in and you think, "Okay,

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.460
Tube Launch. I think I might be able to do
this. This looks pretty good," but as you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.420
scroll down a little and you start to look
at the content, the training that you are

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.140
being provided by Tube Launch, you might have
second thoughts and to start to think, "What

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.070
is this? What have I just paid for? Is this
it?" And so the Tube Launch member's area

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.640
is broken into three different sections. They
call them phases.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.020
The first phase is very simple. What you are
going to be talking about in Phase 1 is you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.799
are going to be talking about getting to know
Clickbank or in other words an introduction

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.439
to Clickbank. You are going to be talking
about how to shorten links, how to use a service

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.880
like Bitly, where you take a long link and
you shorten it and you condensed it into something

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.069
really small which is very, very simple. You
are also going to be talking about how to

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.590
go to other programs or websites and take
their video, rip it off of their website and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.239
be able to put it up on yours. They are going
to show you how to do that with some software

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.040
which by the way in almost every case is going
to be this funny thing called copyright infringement.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.989
I don't think I need to tell the people
watching this video, you guys that's kind

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.120
of a serious thing and something you want
to be careful of. It is something lot of internet

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.450
marketers do when they are getting started
and it is something you want to avoid, and

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.959
products like these are the ones spending
kind of bad information like that. So that's

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:42.900
Phase 1 of Tube Launch.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.739
Now, you might be thinking you have seen the
screen shots now, "Maybe, I can go ahead

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.159
and click one of these lessons and it is packed
with something really valuable, and unfortunately

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.620
it is extremely the basics still. You've
got the description and you've got a video.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.049
For example, this video that I am showing
here is a Clickbank, getting introduced to

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.010
a Clickbank video, which as I have mentioned
at the beginning of this review is something

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.010
that shouldn't take 12 minutes to explain.
So in the second you know, the Phase 2, I

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.870
would mind you at this point you are third
of the way through the program that you've

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.620
paid for. So hopefully you know, usually we
are getting into something intermediate stuff

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.239
by now, but in Tube Launch at the beginning
of Phase 2 you are going to start learning

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.870
really fancy things like how to create a Youtube
Account.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.310
Now, I would almost bet money on the fact
that you know how to create a Youtube account

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.090
or if you donï¿½t know how to create a Youtube
account, you can figure it out pretty easily.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.120
I think if you could get online and buy Tube
Launch, you probably know how to fill out

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.049
a few fields and create a Youtube Account.
And if you don't, you can find a lesson

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.290
and a really good walkthrough online for free
to do it and you don't need someone like

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.150
Tube Launch charging you for lessons that
you can get for free. So in Phase 2 besides

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.400
creating Youtube account, you are also going
to figure out how to put links in your videos

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.659
and you are going to learn how to upload multiple
videos at once which again is stuff that Youtube

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.049
will teach you for free as you are in their
member's area and uploading videos. It is

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.159
very, very quick and very easy to use. You
don't need to be paying for lessons for

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.690
stuff like this. So that takes us all the
way into Phase 3 and at this point keep in

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.060
mind we are almost 70% through the product.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.260
We have gone through Phase1, we have gone
through Phase 2, and now here we are in Phase

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.840
3. So hopefully we are starting warm-up to
some cool stuff here, but unfortunately, that's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.350
really just not the case. In Phase 3 of Tube
Launch you are going to be learning things

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.130
like how to link your videos together, how
to sign up for "view exchange programs",

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.720
and also how to buy views for your videos.
Now, not only are things like View exchange

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.720
programs and view purchasing programs highly
ineffective, but for example purchasing views

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.340
is going to cost you money, which is something
again ineffective and Tube Launch is taking

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.000
you down the wrong counter and teaching you
the wrong things. These are not the things

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.530
that you should be doing to try and make money
online and ultimately that"s what they promise

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.380
you they would teach you. Now as we have moved
through Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3, so

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.730
we have moved through the entire training
section of Tube Launch.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.910
I want to kind of make my next point and this
is my big, big gripe about Tube Launch is

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.880
that the quality of videos just isn't there.
We already talked about quality and you can

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.820
find all these stuff online for free very
easily and you can find better lessons for

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.750
free, but on top of that they are not even
giving you a whole bunch of lessons. They

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.680
are giving you kind of a handful. For example,
you paid $34 for Tube Launch and if you go

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.300
into the member's area, there are less than
34 videos, significantly less. So you are

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.320
actually over a dollar for a video which in
my opinion means that those should be pretty

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.180
high quality videos, but whoever published
Tube Launch apparently had something a little

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.990
bit different in mind. They thought that they
could just file those cost by teaching you

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.990
really, really basic things and not giving
you a whole lot of lessons. And so I want

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.100
to talk next about what Tube Launch needs
and what it is really lacking. And of course

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.320
I think by this point in the review, it is
kind of self-evident what Tube Launch is lacking

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.090
and that they are lacking at multiple levels,
but I want to highlight two points.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.680
The first point is if you are looking at selling
things on the internet, whether it is through

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.620
a video, through a written content, or through
email, any of those things, the number one

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.630
thing that you should be focusing on is high
quality content. How can you make the highest

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.750
quality content possible? Because that does
two things, it is going to build your credibility

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.740
in whatever you are talking about, because
it is going to show that you know what you

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.300
are talking about. On top of that, because
you are building your credibility, you are

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.750
also building trust with whoever is interacting
with your content, whether it would be a video

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.840
again, a blog post, or forums or email. Okay,
so you want to make sure if you are trying

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.270
to make money online through content of any
kind, you want to make sure that you are giving

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.580
the highest quality content possible. The
second thing that I want to highlight Tube

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.920
Launch is really lacking is they are claiming
to be video marketing course essentially,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.580
"We are going to teach you how to make money
through video," but they never highlight

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:26.000
how to create compelling videos, they never
highlight anything about sales copy, and creating

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.030
highly effective sales copy, which is just
words that you are speaking out loud or that

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.500
you are writing down. They are just teaching
you really, really basic things that you can

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.930
find online for free and most of them on Youtube's resources, on their very own homepage.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:46.930
Okay, so that in the end is what Tube Launch
sums up to. You are summing up to a product

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.130
that gives you very low quality lessons that
you can find for free and they are not giving

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.390
you very many of them. Okay, and that's
just what Tube Launch breaks down to. It is

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.020
not worth your time and it is not worth your
money. So thank you for watching the video

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.360
and my name is Ian from Nomorebsreviews.com.
I hope you found that helpful and be safe

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.610
out there on the internet.
