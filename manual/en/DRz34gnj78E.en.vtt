00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.290
The Fotodiox 312AS

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.120
dimmable LED light is an amazing constant
source light for photographers and

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.980
filmmakers.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.320
The light is dimmable: you control the
amount of light falling on your subject.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.090
A second knob controls the color
temperature. Go from cooler to warmer

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.869
colored light

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.970
with a wide range in between. Lightweight LED
lights generate practically

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.050
zero heat and operate cordlessly with the
included rechargeable

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.070
Lithium-Ion NFP style batteries. We
include a dual charger that runs off of AC

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.610
power

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.870
or your car's accessory port. The
intelligent charger

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.940
tells you the battery's power status
while charging and a battery tester on the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.980
light itself

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.420
tells you how much power is left.
Included

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.070
is a magnetic diffuser to soften the light.
We also include a versatile ball mount

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.020
for positioning the light on your camera's
accessory shoe or for attaching to a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.229
light stand. Everything fits it this
custom zippered case with a handle.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.260
You get everything you see here:
the 312AS dimmable LED light,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.070
magnetic diffuser, a pair of batteries,
intelligent dual charger,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.509
AC adapter, car accessory port adapter,

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.280
ball mount, and custom fitted case all
for one

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.470
low price. Here's what our customers are
saying:

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.600
I am so glad to finally have color
temperature control

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.840
built into the light rather than
constantly adding filters.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.380
It is so much more natural and
convenient. Sell your other flash because

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.840
you'll never use it again.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.400
This Fotodiox LED light is that good.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.880
This Fotodiox LED light is worth the
investment. I have filmed my

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.950
newest movie with it, soon to be entered
in film festivals.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.020
