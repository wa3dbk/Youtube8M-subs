00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.220
Owning a Harley

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.410
and being able to visit the museum

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.200
it's a bucket list item.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.600
It's a must do.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.440
You're in the world's greatest museum.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.660
"How are you? Are you guy's having fun?"

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.120
"Yeah!"

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.100
It was Willy's grandpa

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.640
that started Harley-Davidson back in
1903. This is my

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.280
great-grandfather William A Davidson,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.200
their good friend Bill Harley...

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.660
This is Walter Davidson,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.060
and Arthur Davidson.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.460
This is what everybody sees when they come

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.680
into the museum.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.000
It's in chronological order.
It just shows the evolution of our motorcycles.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.660
This is the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.910
oldest

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.500
Harley-Davidson in the world.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.500
The founders, they worked for the Milwaukee railroad.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.080
They would go home

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.590
and tinker on

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.000
the motorcycle that they created.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.780
There was a transportation

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.480
transformation taking place.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.840
They were in their mid-20's, young
entrepreneurs, inventors...

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.180
It's neat to think about

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940
them rolling this out of the shed

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.860
and taking it for a spin on the streets of
Milwaukee. People must have

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.840
just been in awe.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.680
Well I think one of these is your first logo you did.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.240
Yeah I did that one, I did this one,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.820
I did that one.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.640
Wow.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.740
Wow.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.320
We have the biggest collection of un-restored Harley's in the world.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.380
There's about 150 in the museum and about 300 here.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.900
My first street bike was an SX175 Aermacchi

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.600
I wish I still had that bike.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.380
We have been riders all our lives.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.560
There's my dad.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.880
And, you know...I...this is my father's writing.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.640
You can recognize a Harley-Davidson

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.020
by a certain sound, look, feel

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.320
and the bikes have changed over all the years, but we haven't lost the essence.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.060
And dad taught me how to ride, I was six.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.560
I'll never forget that sense of freedom.
