You can use Apple Motion to create amazing
animated text effects.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.160
Check out this tutorial on how to make a title
that writes on like a cloud of fog.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.940
First, open the project pane window by using
the keyboard shortcut command 4.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.110
Then, open the timing pane by using the keyboard
shortcut command 7.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.029
Now go ahead and click on the text tool within
the toolbar area located at the top of the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.409
canvas window.

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.789
Go ahead and type a title within the canvas.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.239
A heads up display window should appear for
the text object so you can pick a font and

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.820
text size.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.589
Move over to the project pane, and right click
on the Fogwriter layer within the Layers tab

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.859
to duplicate the layer.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.940
Go ahead and give the new layer a new name
called 'Fog Layer'

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.949
Navigate to the library tab within the project
pane.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.780
Click on the livefonts category.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.999
Look for the Fogwriter font.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.089
Drag the Fogwriter font onto the fog layer
within the project pane.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.899
This changes the top text layer into a LiveFont
made of fog.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.890
Move down to the timing pane and move the
playhead indicator forward a bit so you can

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.270
see the fogwriter font draw onto the screen.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.939
Within the canvas window, stretch out the
fog layer to it closely matches the text underneath

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.170
it.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.299
Navigate over to the project pane and click
on the inspector tab.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.600
Then move down and click on the text tab and
then the format tab.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.310
Find the livefont timing parameter.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.520
Adjust the speed so it's 200%

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.530
Adjust the sequence parameter to a value of
around 5%.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.549
Within the timing pane, drag the bottom text
layer forward 18 frames.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.060
This is where our bottom text layer should
start to fade up.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.789
Navigate to the add behavior button within
the toolbar and select text-basic, fade characters

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.890
left in.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.390
Okay, that's it, Go ahead and play the animation.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.640
Now, if the timing of fade behavior doesn't
match the timing of your livefont, you'll

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.910
need to adjust the behavior within the timing
pane until you can get things to match up.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.860
You may also need to experiment with these
controls within the project pane to get the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.240
fade up behavior to match the timing of the
fog.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.720
