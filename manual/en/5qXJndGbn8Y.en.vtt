then her those phones we'll know in a
little

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.860
and it says a somewhat I've never really
played in public

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.330
some will use again and again to try and
improve the way the my

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.410
homeworks because this time control is
absolutely essential for playing the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.070
very best acoustic blues are you can
play now the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.509
the two parts and labor dollar very
simple for civil

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.479
well the the working away and it's just
walking up the bases

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.140
and the sound like this mom

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.869

bomb

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.420
mmm Hui wen

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.619
which is a piece a cake we play nice and
slowly let's take a look at Meijer

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.580
my right hand in close 0 and you see
that up at the bottom of the page as

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.020
well

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.950

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.109
and that we do this twice

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.609
and after this the film based turns into
this

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.969
moving

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.110
mmm who

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.390
so it really is a piece a cake with
issues in the film we could play this

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.200
low risk factors we like

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.800
Mon

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.430
who the mistake we look to my right and
again

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.129

I'll now this is where the fun starts

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.659
mister not put them together and then we
have to try and focus in some way work

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:15.769
out how we're going to the

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.139
lead of film I don't think this work
independently

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.490
they're not really working independently
though because we're painting together

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.830
it's just that the film needs to change
from strings

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.669
world we also got the the friend thing
to do with the left them acoustic guitar lessons

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.100

very simple to and it's a great exercise
