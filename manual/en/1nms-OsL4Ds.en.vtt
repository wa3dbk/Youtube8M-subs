00:00:00.028 --> 00:00:03.241
See the difference with and without step one!!!

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:07.976
Now, I would like to show you

00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:12.727
the most important step in badminton

00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:16.509
I call it starter step

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.161
the fact in badminton is

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:26.259
the player does not know where opponent will hit

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.094
so the player have to wait until opponent makes shot

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:36.194
and then he or she can only move after

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:38.512
its like traffic lights 

00:00:38.512 --> 00:00:42.495
you drive car and you approach traffic lights

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:45.878
you have to wait there until the light changes

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.847
and then you can start

00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:52.796
the question is after the traffic light change

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:54.882
after opponent hit

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:57.682
how fast can you move

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.747
that is the point

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:03.948
the player cannot move before opponent hit

00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:08.698
player cannot move same time as opponent hit

00:01:08.698 --> 00:01:10.933
because he can't see

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:15.034
because he does not know where it is going to go

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:19.549
so the fact is the player have to wait

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.066
and act after

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:26.183
now that is the fact, then we have to think

00:01:26.183 --> 00:01:32.682
what kind of step allow the player to act fast

00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:35.535
after he saw the shot

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:38.150
I call it step one

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.515
have a look this is it

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:44.984
ready

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:49.808
you have to do, before you go any where

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:53.843
in badminton there must be this step one

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:55.126
that one

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:57.655
because that one 

00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:02.560
will allow you to explosively push off

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.060
for example shuttle is there

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.291
you saw it, then it should be 1 2 3

00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:11.460
1 2 3

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.225
rather than

00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:17.376
1 2 3 4

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:20.844
1 its not possible in real badminton

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:28.493
but 8 or 9 out of 10 club players

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:33.129
are currently practising

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.564
1 2 3 4

00:02:36.564 --> 00:02:40.161
1 2 3 4

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:41.879
backhand

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.291
1 2 3 4

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.579
1 2 3 4

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:56.248
which is not happening in the real match

00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:01.536
so if you don't do one

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:09.784
it looks like you are starting your car with gear 2 or gear 3

00:03:09.784 --> 00:03:12.084
will be very slow

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:14.185
so let's say over there

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:15.085
it should be

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:16.685
1 2 3

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:17.468
there

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:19.322
1 2

00:03:19.322 --> 00:03:20.020
side

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.553
1 2 3

00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:23.371
1 2 

00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:24.121
back

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.238
1 2 3

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.053
1 2 3

00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:29.038
now compare

00:03:30.904 --> 00:03:32.932
if I don't do one

00:03:32.932 --> 00:03:35.465
how fast can I get

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.698
ready

00:03:36.698 --> 00:03:37.700
1 2 

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:40.832
1 2

00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:42.598
compare

00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:44.082
1 2 3

00:03:44.082 --> 00:03:45.015
1 2

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.750
so where ever shuttle goes

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.484
before badminton player move anywhere

00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:03.336
there will always be step one

00:04:03.336 --> 00:04:04.719
for example clear

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:07.852
step one

00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:09.769
lift

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:12.369
step one

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:14.638
drive

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:16.236
step one

00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:24.606
because you have to pause until your opponent hit it

00:04:24.606 --> 00:04:31.755
you land, because you land you can push off

00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:33.270
compare

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.481
hit

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.880
stop

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.115
and then go

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:44.970
hit stop and then come back

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:55.371
but, I saw so many club players still practising

00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:59.003
the movement without one

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:11.574
no one, no step one, no badminton

00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:13.941
this is that much important
