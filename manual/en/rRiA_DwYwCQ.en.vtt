00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:13.066
Having the beams and columns assigned , we'll 
assign fixities to base joints and masses at the 
Floor joints...

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:17.066
Select the joints at the base of each column.

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.033
Click the Assign tab and select Joint, and then 
Restraint...

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:33.066
In this example, the columns are fully restained.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:44.000
Select the Fast Restraint that restrains the joint 
for both translation and rotation.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.066
Click OK.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.033
The symbol at the base of the columns changed 
to indicate fully restrained joints.

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:05.066
Now we'll assign the masses of each floor and 
distribute them to the joints of each floor.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:15.000
Assuming the weight of each floor is 1200 kips, 
convert units of weight to mass.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:22.066
So the mass is 3.11 kips seconds squared per 
inch.
0:01:22.066,0:01:22.033

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:30.000
Now the floor mass may be distributed to each 
floor

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.033
The mass will be assigned to the left node of 
each floor.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:45.066
Click the Assign tab and select Joint, and then 
Masses...

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:54.000
Go down to the mass and enter 3.11 for local 
directions 1 and 2, which are lateral directions.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The local 3 direction is the vertical direction, 
which may cause problems in this example.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.066
Notice the units in Kip, inches.
0:02:03.066,0:02:03.000

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.066
Click OK.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:10.033
Now the model indicates the masses at the left 
nodes.

00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:14.066
Next assign slab constraints.
0:02:14.066,0:02:14.000

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We must do this because up to now the model 
only knows about the beams, and not the floor 
slabs.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.033
The slab constrains all the joints along a floor 
level.  Which means that all these nodes must 
move together.

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:27.066
The slab constrains all the joints along a floor 
level.  Which means that all these nodes must 
move together.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.066
Select the top level of joints

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:33.066
Go to Assign, Joint, Constraints.

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.399
Choose the constraint type "Equal",

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:40.033
Choose the constraint type "Equal",

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:43.033
Click add new constraint...

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:55.033
Name it Floor 5

00:02:55.033 --> 00:03:01.066
Select only translation in the X direction

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:04.000
Click OK

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Click OK

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.066
Click OK again

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:09.000
Click OK again

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Click assign...joint...contraints

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.066
Select equal from the dropdown and click add 
new contraint

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:32.000
Name this floor4 and select only translation in 
the X direction... Click OK

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.033
Click OK again

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:46.066
This process should be repeated for the 
remaining floors
0:04:06.033,0:04:06.000

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Now that we have defined the material, defined 
our members...

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.033
Fixed our base, defined our masses and floor 
constraints, we are ready to run a modal 
analysis

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:24.000
Click the play button on the toolbar
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The modal case is set to run so click Run Now

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.033
The frame must be saved to run the analysis

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:49.033
So save the frame to your favorite spot

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:57.066
The analysis has been run as SAP is displaying 
the deformed shape in the 3D view

00:04:57.066 --> 00:05:02.000
This concludes this video
