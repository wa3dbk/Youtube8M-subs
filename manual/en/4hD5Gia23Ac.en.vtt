[HOME FOR BABY ANIMALS]

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.120
[SEOUL AMUSEMENT PARK &amp; ZOO
SOUTH KOREA]

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.320
What is this place?

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.080
It's an artificial cage.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.600
Infant animals are taken care of by the staff at the zoo.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.440
This is Gun [Air], who has the darkest fur.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.480
[KIM KWON SIK
BABY ANIMAL EXPERT]

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.640
This is Gon [Earth].

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.600
Come here.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.080
This is Gam [Water].

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.280
Come over here!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600
This is Ri [Fire], the youngest.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.960
Okay, alright.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.080
Why were they separated from their mother?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.640
Since lions are wild animals, the mothers are prone to attack or kill their babies.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.720
When lions give birth, we have to separate the newborn babies from the mother

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.400
and raise them until they are grown up to prevent them from being killed.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.280
Not all the lions in our zoo are that wild, though.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.960
When will they leave this place then?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.800
Within a year, they will be sent to their mother again.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.080
[JUST LIKE HOMEMADE FOOD]

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:43.080
We prepare the meals here. We chop and cook everything here.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.440
So, everything is done here. Over there is the bread and meat.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.160
These are the four lions' meals.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.280
Come here!

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.200
They are not listening to me.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.040
Come over here!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.240
When the lions are gone, you will miss them a lot.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.240
Well, I would rather be happy for the lions,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.920
since they will finally meet their mother and live together.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.760
Goodbye!

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.560
Goodbye!
