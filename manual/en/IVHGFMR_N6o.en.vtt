00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:02.784
Hi guys!

00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:07.002
Today we'll be exploring the
marvellous world of University

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.034
Here we are in Trieste, Italy

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:10.175
and this is Piero

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.582
Hi Piero!

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.023
He is an Italian student

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:19.455
and this is his university.

00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:21.123
Today we'll follow him through

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:22.925
one day of typical student life

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:27.326
This morning Piero's got
calculous class

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:32.154
better hurry, or you'll be late!

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:41.519
Oh oh...

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:45.550
looks like the course doesn't exist anymore!

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:53.055
Things that happen i guess...

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:53.921
don't they?

00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:57.361
Not so bad though,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.692
he'll have the time to check in

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.885
the scholarship he was waiting for so long

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.854
Lucky day! No line!

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.196
oh perfect!

00:01:12.283 --> 00:01:13.955
There is something for Piero

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.991
I bet he can't wait to open
that envelope

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.774
That doesn't look so good to me...

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.095
with THAT money 

00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:32.847
he'll hardly buy a pack of cookies

00:01:32.817 --> 00:01:33.623
surely not the

00:01:33.623 --> 00:01:33.903
Ocean

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:34.208
Optic

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:34.508
HR

00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:34.923
2000

00:01:34.923 --> 00:01:35.324
portable

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:35.828
reflectance

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:36.408
spectroscope

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:36.715
UV

00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:37.802
he needs.

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:43.081
Better not thinking about that Piero...

00:01:46.308 --> 00:01:46.946
Oh look,

00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.282
he's right over there.

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:51.001
shhh! He's studying...

00:01:54.023 --> 00:01:55.220
what's the matter Piero?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.202
... what the...!

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.256
This doesn't make any sense!

00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:04.576
Where did everybody go!?

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:16.657
This was quite a bad day for Piero

00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:22.248
everything went wrong...

00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:28.631
Piero is sad, because he can't see why

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.533
so many trouble for someone who

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:31.926
just wants to learn!

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.600
Piero is angry

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.271
because no one gives a s**t

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:51.925
maybe someone...

00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:54.367
doesn't want him to study?
