00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.710
Hello Space Fans and welcome to another edition
of Space Fan News.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.680
This week, ALMA is at it again.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.570
Astronomers using the world's largest radio
telescope the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.780
array (that's what ALMA stands for) have found
the most massive star in the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.430
ALMA is composed of 66 high precision antennas
located on the (oh man, I have no idea how

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:35.379
to pronounce this) Chajnantor plateau, which
is 5000 meters high in northern Chile.

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.930
So while sitting high atop the Chajnantor
plateau looking all high and mighty, astronomers

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.889
pointed ALMA towards the constellation Norma
(The Carpenter's Square), yes that's a constellation,

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:53.999
and looked at the dark star forming cloud
known as Spitzer Dark Cloud 335.579-0.292.

00:00:53.999 --> 00:01:01.159
There, looking in the microwave region of
the spectrum they found the most massive star

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:08.039
in our galaxy 11,000 light years away.

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.530
SDC335.579-0.292 was first discovered as an
environment of dark, dense filaments of gas

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.159
from observations using the Spitzer Space
Telescope and ESA's Herschel Space Observatory.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.979
Now ALMA has looked at it with it's high sensitivity
in detail at both the amount of dust and the

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.250
motion of the gas moving around within the
dark cloud — and there they found a really

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.250
massive star being born.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.009
The goal here was to observe how really massive
stars form and these observations hit pay

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.369
dirt: they found the largest protostellar
core ever seen in the Milky Way.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.149
This core has over 500 times the mass of our
Sun swirling around inside.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.680
And the ALMA observations show that much more
material is still flowing inwards and increasing

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.179
the mass still further.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.000
This star formation region is forming many
stars and the 500 solar mass core is the most

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
massive of several.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.579
This material will eventually collapse to
form a young star up to 100 times as massive

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:05.960
as our home star.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.899
Only about one in ten thousand of all the
stars in the Milky Way reach that kind of

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:11.899
mass.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.930
Not only are these stars rare, but their birth
is extremely rapid and their childhood is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.260
short, so finding such a massive object so
early in its evolution is really hard, making

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.819
this a spectacular.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.030
Different theories exist as to how massive
stars form but the team's findings lend weight

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.870
to the idea that the entire cloud core begins
to collapse inwards, with material raining

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.239
in towards the center to form one or more
massive stars.

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.939
Sounds good to me.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.550
Next, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope
have figured out the actual visible-light

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.709
color of a planet orbiting another star 63
light-years away.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.870
If we could see this planet directly, it would
look just like that famous 'pale blue dot'

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.409
picture of Earth taken from the Voyager 1
spacecraft back in 1990.

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.040
Unfortunately we can't do that yet so what
they did instead was point Hubble's Imaging

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.720
Spectrograph at it to measure changes in the
color of light from the system before, during,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.819
and after the passage of the planet behind
the parent star.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.909
We got lucky here, this technique is possible
because the planet's orbit happened to be

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:26.140
tilted edge-on as viewed from Earth; and because
of that, it routinely passes in front of and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.750
then behind the star.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.900
Here's how they did it.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.269
It's quite clever actually.

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.190
In order to measure what this planet would
look like, the astronomers measured how much

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.719
light was reflected off the surface of the
exoplanet known as HD 189733b — a property

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.400
known as albedo.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.930
Now this planet is faint and close to its
star.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.620
To isolate the planet's light from this starlight,
Hubble measured a small drop in light — about

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.079
one part in 10,000 — of the star's light
when the planet went behind it, along with

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.590
a very tiny change in the color of the light,
too.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.409
As it moved behind the star the light become
less bright in the blue, but not in the green

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.500
or the red.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.120
This meant that the planet that went behind
the star must be blue because light from was

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.439
missing in the blue, but not in the red when
it was hidden.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.500
The planet was contributing a tiny amount
of blue light to the star's spectrum as it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.940
passed in front.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.200
So, it must be blue.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200
See?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.200
Clever huh?

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.610
Now the Earth looks blue from space because
the oceans absorb red and green wavelengths

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.520
more strongly than blue light.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.990
In addition, the oceans reflect Earth's blue
sky where the shorter blue wavelengths of

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.610
sunlight are selectively scattered by atmospheric
oxygen and nitrogen molecules in a process

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.990
called Rayleigh scattering.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.790
But that's not why this planet is blue, far
from it.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.060
HD 189733b was discovered in 2005.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.360
It is only 2.9 million miles from its parent
star, the planet is so close that it is gravitationally

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.100
"tidally locked" so that one side always faces
the star and the other side is always dark.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.700
In 2007 the Spitzer Space Telescope measured
the infrared light, or heat, from the planet.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.960
This observation produced one of the first-ever
temperature maps of an exoplanet.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.630
The map shows that the dayside and night-side
temperatures differ by about 260 degrees Celsius.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.100
This temperature difference would cause fierce
winds to roar from the daytime to nighttime

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.260
side of the planet.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.200
So why is this planet blue?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.110
According to the spectra there are silicate
particles laced in the high clouds of the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.220
atmosphere.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.600
Because the temperature is so high the silicate
particles could condense and form very small

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.260
drops and they would scatter blue light more
than red light.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.870
So let's put all this together, here we have
a planet with a daytime temperature of over

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:54.710
1,000 degrees Celsius, and it possibly rains
glass — sideways mind you — in howling

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.780
7,000 kilometer per hour winds.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.170
Just like downtown.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.890
Well, that's it for this week Space Fans.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:33.220
Thank you for watching and as always, Keep
Looking Up!
