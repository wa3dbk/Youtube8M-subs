00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
Okay, this here is called the Honeycomb Stitch, and the Honeycomb Stitch

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.598
causes the actual material to have really large waves in the material.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.779
So you'll have a beautiful, up and down wave with this particular one. Again we're gonna start it like we have the rest.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.550
We're just gonna wrap it around your finger twice.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.260
Make sure you leave quite a bit of straggler here at the end, because we're going to be weaving that in later.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.930
So we take the back, over the forward, and

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:32.159
then now grab this one and push up, and you have your perfect slip knot to start your project. Again if you're, I'm right

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.969
handed, so I'm gonna put it on the top right hand side, and pull.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.690
And

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.110
what we're gonna be doing, instead of, before

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.339
we did a criss crossing action. We're gonna be doing it, but we're gonna be doing it slightly different.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.469
So we're gonna go directly across.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.120
Okay, and underneath, putting up over, and then we're gonna go down one.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.419
Okay, so then wrap, and then we're gonna go across.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.250
But when we go across, don't do that, because what happens is you need it to criss cross here, at the pegs.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.268
So what you have to do, is when you come back across, you come under.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.319
Okay, and now we jump down to the next one down, and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.460
then wrap.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.320
So again, just like, so we can't go down like that, we have to go down across, go down, and under, over,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.850
go down one.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.850
Okay, and now we're gonna jump.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.589
So why does this particular stitch

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.790
create the waves?

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.710
Because the simple fact is, is that you don't have anything joining in between. So you're gonna have this, you can actually see the zigzag

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.509
formation right now that it's going to cause.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.049
And uh,

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.069
and so then that, so they don't link together that way, and

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.849
what happens is, is that, for this one, you're gonna see, the front side of the stitches, which is the beautiful ridge.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.909
But then, because there's a gap, when this pulls out and

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.679
expands on your table, or wherever you're doing, you're going to see the backside of the stitch, which is the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.259
the groove in the middle, and it's gonna cause the grove to expand and show a wave.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.619
So we've decided, I'm deciding that this is enough. So if you wanna go more, you just follow this same configuration.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.380
And just like before, when we come across,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.139
okay, we're gonna come, sorry we're gonna come down and over. Okay like so. And what we're gonna do, is just push down.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.699
Okay, so I'm only going about half way, cuz I'm a trained professional. (said in a silly voice)

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.029
Okay, so what we need to do, is that we need to do like we did before. So we have to come across straight across,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.200
okay, and then over under. And what we have to do, is we have to jump to this one here.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.339
But when we jump, don't jump like this, because there's your next peg over here.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.260
You have to create that, that twist. So you have to go over under.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.760
So now, once we get that edge done, okay, we'll just have to follow the same configuration that's already there.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.940
Okay, so, so we just have to follow exactly where that string is going.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.459
It's just on the edge pieces. So we're gonna pull over.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.089
Okay, so there you can still see the gap,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.010
so you don't have the criss crossing like you did see before. So we finished on this peg.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.829
So what we're going to do, is just grab the bottom and pull it over.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.980
Okay, now we can let it go it won't fall off.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.240
And I'm gonna work my way down the peg, pegs on this side, because that's, I finished on this side.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.120
Okay, now I'm going to flip it over,

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.770
and take the bottom. And again the same concept like before, because you've already pulled this side off. It makes this side Loosey-Goosey,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.570
and that is natural. That's just the concept of loom knitting.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.790
So don't worry about it. And if anything, you get this side when you go across, is so easy and fast,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.310
because it is loose.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.619
Okay, so what we're gonna do, we've finished. You can see there's only one on each, on there. So we're going to just push down.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.269
So grabbing your material again, We have to then load up again. And

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.769
we are gonna come over, so we're gonna come back across.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.410
Okay, so under over, under

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.930
over, and now we're gonna jump to this one. So under over, because you had to create that, that twisting.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.070
Just like so.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.390
So now we just follow the same configuration that's already there.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:53.429
So we just come under over, and then down, under over across, under over down, under over

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.249
okay across, over under, down, over under across, over under.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.719
Okay, and now we're gonna get to the end.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.339
So I'm just gonna hold it, and now I'm just turning it over, just pushing the bottom over, so now I can let that go.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.799
And now I can just work my way back across

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.640
the loom. So just like before, because I finished off,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.700
like we're always going to finish off on the same side,

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.330
so therefore the one, this side is going to have a little bit of a different look.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.869
It'll look a little more tense, of a pattern on top, where the other side will look kind of Loosey-Goosey,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.250
but very blending. So it, you just create two different looks, on

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.960
depending on what side it goes.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.830
So because this is a little complex. I'm gonna go one more round.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.530
So we're now finished.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.220
Okay.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.900
So I'm pushing down.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.840
And you can see that the configuration, of the zigzag, is now coming out of the bottom.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.509
Okay, so let's go one last time. So we go over okay, under

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.810
okay, and then straight across, over and now down.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.999
Okay, so you just have to look that you make sure that that criss crosses at the edge. If you do not crisscross, and you

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
go like this,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.539
and you go like this,. What happens is, that when you go to push that off,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.350
you're, it's not, it's gonna do, your project is totally gonna fall apart. So you have to make sure it does do that criss cross.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.350
Just like so.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.040
Okay, and now we just follow the same configuration.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.719
And again, it's just a matter of getting used to the way that it's,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.830
twisting

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.339
on there. And you'll find that you go really fast.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.530
I've not done a whole project like this, yet, but I do like the look of what creates.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.199
Creates a really kind of very wavy

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.010
concept. So I don't know what you'll be using it for, but this would be a great table runner. Maybe even a placemat.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.580
I guess the sky's the limit on what you can use this

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:14.319
Loom Knitting for. So this was the Honeycomb Stitch, and good luck with that, and we'll see you guys next time.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.420
you
