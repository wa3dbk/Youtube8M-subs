Hi and welcome to Hair with Hollie on Videojug.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.620
Today we're going to be doing the iconic Breakfast
at Tiffany's Audrey Hepburn updo, and we're

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.210
going to pop in some gorgeous hair jewellery
too.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.210
[Music]

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:19.920
Okay, we're going to start this look with
a kind of French twist at the back of the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.830
hair because that's what Audrey had.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.870
So, working on the back of the hair, just
going to split the hair in two first of all,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.020
going from ear to ear as your guide.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.929
I'm going to pin this hair up out of the way
for the time being.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.410
So, with the rest of the hair that you have
left here, we're going to twist it into a

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.910
French twist, which is really easy to do.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.180
So we're going to pull it into a low pony,
and then twist.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.550
And as you twist, all the way up to where
it hits the sky.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.681
So it's a good idea as you're doing this stuff
to use bobby pins that are the same color

00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:02.589
as your hair because it gives it quite a seamless
look.

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.240
Once you've secured the back of your hair,
we're going to work on this one section.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.400
So what we're going to do here is split this
into two.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:18.390
We're going to pin the front section up and
we're going to pull back this section.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.390
So, working on this middle section here, we're
going to pull it back into a high ponytail

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.425
and merge it with any hair that you have left
over from your French pleat.

00:01:25.425 --> 00:01:30.670
If you have thinner hair and you wanted a
bit of volume, you can back-comb through the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.990
front sections of this, and just using your
comb, work down the length of the hair, closest

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.050
to the crown, just to give it a bit of a full
effect.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.870
So, once you're happy with the volume that
you have, we're just going to pull all of

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.850
this back into a high pony.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.290
So it's a good idea here to use a bobbin that's
the same color as your hair, just so it kind

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.600
of gets invisible.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.710
And don't worry if it's a bit messy along
the sides because we're going to cover this

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.080
with the hair at the end, so it's fine.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.890
So, the next thing we do is, once you have
your bobbin, or your ponytail in place, we're

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.030
going to lift it up and we're going to back-comb
the front section, do you know what I mean?

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.599
So back-comb the front of the hair like this
to give it volume.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.069
Now, if you have quite long hair like our
model has today you won't need to do too much

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.680
back-combing because you're going to get the
volume from the bun anyway.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.810
Now what we do is just simply roll it down
into a bun shape, just like so.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.480
Tuck in any bits that are flying off, and
once you're happy with the size, just pin

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.769
a pin in the front, in the front-middle section,
and this will allow you to play around with

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.489
the size, so just kind of anchor it with a
pin and then we can pull it out just like

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.810
a little fan.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:09.150
And then pin these sections down so they're
nice and secure.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.450
So now we're going to start working on the
front sections of the hair.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.139
What I'm going to do here is I'm going to
use quite a deep side-parting somewhere in

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.359
the middle of the brow for the guide, and
to get that authentic Breakfast at Tiffany's

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.299
look I'm going to keep a few layers of the
fringe down, which we're going to curl.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.769
If you don't want to keep any hair down you
can just pull it all back with the rest of

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.400
the hair, no biggie.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.819
So, working with this hair, I'm just going
to brush it back, so this is quite a sleek

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.819
look.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.000
Make sure if your hair isn't so straight that
you run a straightener over it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.269
So we're going to pull the hair back, brushing
it as we go, bobby pin at the ready.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:58.609
Going to wrap it all the way around here and
then back to the top of the bun.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:05.680
And we're just going to do the exact same
thing on the other side now.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.480
So I'm brushing the hair as we go, and try
to pull it back so that it meets where the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.739
bun ends.

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.590
As you can see, it's so handy because it crossed
over any of the bumps you may have made.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.630
Swing it around here, and then pin it in place.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:35.830
So, what we're going to do with these front
bangs are, we're going to curl them in towards

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.289
the face to make them look a bit shorter,
so you've got that kind of short fringe effect.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.419
I'm just going to wrap the hair around the
wand.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.910
Just hold it for a few seconds, until you
can feel the heat coming through, and then

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.949
it should stay.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.280
So with the bottom end, you're just going
to pin it in under the hair so you've got

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.020
that quite short fringe effect.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:09.620
So, I'm just going to finish off the whole
look with a lot of hair spray, trying to flatten

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.210
down any little flyaways you have to get a
sleek and polished look.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:26.650
So for the finished look, you're going to
pop in a little bit of hair jewellery, just

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.800
in here kind of at the cusp of the bow.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.100
What I have here is just a little bracelet.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.020
You're just going to pop it in, and just going
to secure it with a few bobby pins so that

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.330
it'll stay in place.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.569
So there you have it, the finished look.

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.770
