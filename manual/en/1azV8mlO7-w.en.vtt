00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.770
I do conventions a lot.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.920
So, obviously, there's a lot of marketing
before conventions whether it's presale of

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.779
shirts, presale of prints, or setting appointments
for the day.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.620
That's basically what all our social media's
for.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:31.280
Every show I go to, I'm booked before I go,
just because it's out there, that I'm promoting.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.860
With conventions I'm promoting their convention
along with myself being there.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.370
It's like a toss up on everything.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.570
You know, we're all promoting that one show
and we're all promoting ourselves at the same

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.570
time.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.560
So it's a big, happy family when we actually
get to it.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.980
With the flash, and prints, and stuff like
that there are contests that we actually enter.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.670
We'll enter the flash category, we'll enter
a cover up category, and every category under

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.070
the sun to show our work.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.220
It's a very cool opportunity.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:19.880
I was just in Philadelphia and won cover up
for first and second because I do so much

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.360
cover up.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.270
I have a whole shop of trinkets and trophies.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.930
It's basically one of those things where I
want to put it out there that I'm trying my

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.340
best to be the best at what I do.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.659
It's not being a bad ass or whatever.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.650
It's being competitive in nature.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.369
I always think of myself as less, because
I want to show this business what I can do

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.810
and make it better.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.090
That's what it is with conventions.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.789
You know, we're all around our peers and we're
all trying to be the best that we can be.
