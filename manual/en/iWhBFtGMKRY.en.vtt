Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now I would
show you how to make a mane out of yarn. You

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:15.120
want to get a piece of cardboard that is this
cardboard; it is thirteen inches. You can

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.840
make it even longer and we are going to wrap
the cardboard with the yarn. You want it to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:32.469
be four to five inches wide. It depends if
you want your mane to be much longer. If you

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:39.739
want a real flowing mane, you can make it
even wider then that. You would just first

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:48.760
hold on the yarn and wrap it. Wrap it! Don't
wrap the yarn, don't pull it tight as you

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.559
wrap it because when you cut it, it is going
to shrink back and it will shorten up the

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:03.649
mane. So you just want to wrap that loosely,
not too tight and if you go like this quickly.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:15.009
Then slide it down you want to make it fairly
thick so you want to wrap that quiet a while.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:23.729
So wrap that and make it pretty thick. Just
keep wrapping, not pulling the yarn to tight

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:35.549
but wrapping it loosely and then pushing down
to gather it up. So you have a nice full mane.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.670
The tighter you make it the thicker you make
it the thicker your horses mane would be.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:53.670
So it is really up to you how much yarn you
put on. Now when you have all of your yarn

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.749
wrapped around card like that is because you
want it. We are going to take the scissors

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:08.270
and cut; cut it off of the cardboard. So slip
your scissors underneath and you want to cut

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:19.930
it right at the edge. Make sure your scissors
are in there and you are getting all of the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:29.840
yarn and don't let it go flying away. Keep
it nice and neat like this, it is all loose

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.890
once you cut it. So you want to be careful
not to move it around too much just keep it

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:55.250
nice and flat.
So now you have one cut edge and one folded

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.930
edge and you can just shift it down a little
to make the two edges even. Leave it sort

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.060
on the cardboard like that and then we would
show you next how to apply the fleecy mane

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.139
and the yarn mane to our horse head.
