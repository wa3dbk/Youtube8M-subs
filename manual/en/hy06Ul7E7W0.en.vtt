00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.330
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with a review of the Nokia Lumia

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.350
920.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.149
With Windows Phone 8, a unique build and one
of the best smartphone

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.139
cameras out there let’s take a look.

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.799
Pop open the box and inside you’ll see
the phone itself and a tool to eject your

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.799
MicroSIM.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.140
Dig a little deeper and
you’ll find an NFC demo tag, extremely boring

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.820
safety info, a quick start guide
and a little smart setup guide.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.050
Lastly you’ll find a MicroUSB cable for
charging

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.230
and syncing along with a USB wall adapter
to juice the phone up.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.560
It won’t take
you long to see the Lumia sticks out from

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.369
other smartphones in a big way.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.180
Decked out in a glossy yellow finish there’s
no doubt it’s unique and I’m a big

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.530
fan of how it looks.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.590
Of course if you want something a bit more
tame it’s

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.390
available in other much more boring colors
including black.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.810
The Lumia is also a
very big phone at 10.7mm thick and weighing

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.690
in at almost 50% more than the
Galaxy S3.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.450
The overall size is quite large as well with
a footprint roughly on

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.160
par with the Nexus 4 but with a smaller screen.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.680
All of that said, I actually
really didn’t mind the added heft as it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.450
reminded me of the old indestructible
Nokias with excellent build quality.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.110
The body is a single piece of
polycarbonate, aka plastic and as it’s colored

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.590
all the way through you don’t
have to worry about scratches removing the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.590
finish.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.219
Up front you’ll find the 1.3
megapixel front facing camera which is capable

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.439
of 720p video and your
speaker grille and below are the capacitive

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.640
back, Windows and Search keys.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.070
For some reason the screen and buttons are
offset quite a bit from the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.240
bottom of the phone, making the entire front
appear off center.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.869
Up top is the
headphone jack and MicroSIM slot and on the

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.110
right side is the volume rocker,
sleep button and the dedicated camera key

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.700
which is nice to see.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.229
On bottom is
your MicroUSB port for charging and syncing

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.189
along with the very impressive
speaker.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.520
This is by far one of the loudest speakers
I’ve heard on a phone in

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
quite a while, delivering enough volume to
fill a decently sized room with

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.640
music.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.880
Finally on back you’ll see the 8.7 megapixel
camera and LED flash

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.590
which I’ll get into in a minute.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.439
It's also compatible with the Qi wireless
charging standard and AT&amp;T is bundling a free

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.979
wireless charger with the Lumia
right now.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.479
The screen is a 4.5 inch IPS panel with a
resolution of 1280x768

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.119
making it slightly wider than normal 720p
phones and a huge step up from

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.409
older Windows Phones.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.469
It is a bit smaller than the 4.7 and 5 inch
screens on

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.430
most smartphones today but you aren’t losing
out on too much and it makes

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.829
up for it with 332 pixels per inch.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.040
The display itself is very nice with good
black levels and decent saturation, both of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.830
which are important with the Live
Tiles on Windows Phone.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.680
The star of the show here is definitely Windows
Phone 8.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.230
Just like the Lumia itself it's a very different
experience than your

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.530
average smartphone and it's easily one of
the sleekest and smoothest UIs out

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.530
there.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.080
The home screen is all about Live Tiles which
do double duty as app

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.360
icons and an at a glance bit of info for example
a missed call or a new Tweet.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.800
You can also resize the tiles and rearrange
them as much as you'd like.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.740
Just
like Windows 8 you can customize the color

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.931
of the entire OS but beyond that
what you see is basically what you get, this

00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:43.130
is definitely not a phone for
people who really like to customize.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.530
As a Windows Phone you'll find
integration with SkyDrive, Office and Xbox

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.530
Live.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.520
Office is included and is
decent for viewing or editing a Word or Excel

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.110
doc on the go but not much
more than that.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.400
Gaming was originally supposed to be a strong
suit of Windows

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.700
Phones as you can connect your Xbox Live gamertag
and get

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.340
Achievements from mobile games but the selection
is lacking.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.800
You'll find a
few games like Angry Birds and Final Fantasy

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.410
but overall there really isn't
much in the Store right now.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.350
App support is a little better.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.490
You can find an app
to do most things but a lot of what you'll

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.590
find is really lacking in quality.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.260
The
Google app isn't bad if you want to avoid

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.130
using Bing but it hasn't been
updated in nearly eight months.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.030
The Twitter app is just terrible with constant
crashes however and the list goes on.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.280
That's not to say some apps aren't great,
amazingly enough Internet Explorer really

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.450
isn't bad.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.720
Just like the rest of
Windows Phone it's buttery smooth most of

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.740
the time and is one of the fastest
mobile browsers out there.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.770
SunSpider is a great example of this, it notches
a

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.760
score which is able to clear the iPhone 5
and Nexus 4.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.070
You'll run into
occasional issues with fonts not rendering

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.810
properly but overall it's a really
nice browser.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.890
I don't want to give the wrong impression
here, Windows

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.440
Phone 8 is a major step forward and in some
ways surpasses both iOS and

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440
Android.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.050
The big issue is the lack of apps which hopefully
will improve now

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.150
that Windows Phone and Windows 8 share a lot
of DNA but right now it's far

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.980
behind its main rivals.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.000
The camera on the other hand is the best you’ll
find on

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.670
a modern smartphone period.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.920
With 8.7 megapixels and an LED flash to work
with it might not seem too great on paper

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.680
but it has one major advantage:
optical image stabilization.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.840
With tiny springs inside the lens to keep
it steady

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.330
this allows the Lumia to deliver spectacular
low light performance.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.810
Comparing
it to the iPhone 5 and Nexus 4 you can see

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.430
there’s really no contest, it pulls in
images better than some point and shoots.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.680
In normal daylight the images are
quite nice as well although not a huge improvement

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.460
over ordinary
smartphones.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.490
That optical image stabilization makes a big
difference for

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.490
video.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.189
So I’m walking around on some pretty uneven
ground here and yet the

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:31.460
camera keeps it nice and smooth, as in fact
I’ll go ahead and bring it down

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.460
here for you guys.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.150
You can see that 1080p video looks really
nice on the Lumia

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.150
920.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.720
Inside you’ll find the Lumia 920 is powered
by a 1.5GHz Snapdragon S4

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.220
dual core processor and 1GB of RAM.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.129
Windows Phone has always been fast
and this does a great job of making sure the

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.039
phone stays incredibly smooth.

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.999
The Snapdragon S4 is starting to show it’s
age as the S4 Pro has been released

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.499
but it’s still an entirely competent performer.

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.259
Impressively the phone
includes 32GB of storage which is generous

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.840
considering the price.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.229
Call quality
is quite good on the AT&amp;T network and with

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.840
LTE on board if you have it in
your area you can expect impressive speeds.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.810
Unfortunately it hasn’t rolled
out here yet so I did my testing on HSPA+

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.840
which can still give you reasonable
speeds above 5Mbps.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.830
Battery life was good enough in my testing,
delivering

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.330
enough juice to make it through a day of moderate
use thanks to the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.240
2000mAh battery.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.810
The Nokia Lumia 920 is easily one of the most
unique

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.080
phones out there, definitely in a good way.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.220
It looks and feels like nothing else
and Windows Phone 8 finally delivers modern

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.120
specs including a dual core
processor and HD screen.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.810
It’s incredibly smooth and the camera is
stellar but

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.060
app support is severely lacking and it is
a big, heavy phone.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.419
It’s not going to
be for everyone but for only $99 you could

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.060
do much, much worse than the
Lumia 920.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.280
