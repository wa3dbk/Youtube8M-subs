00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:09.600
Mohair as a luxury fibre, is important that
it has good handle. It should be nice and

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:18.750
soft to the touch, it should also have high
luster. High luster will produce a better

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.480
article at the end of the dying process.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:38.719
Then the fibre should have style and character.
The character is the wave in the fibre, and

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:48.430
the style is a twist in the fibre. It should
also be uniform from the base to the tip and

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.600
also from the tail of the animal to the neck
of the animal, so what we’re looking for

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.920
is a nice even fleece. The neck is one region
that would usually be the first area to go

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.899
coarse on an animal, so a superior animal
would also have a fine neck.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:17.639
Obviously, the most valuable fibre is the
finer fibre and the more you have on the animal

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:22.630
the more dollar she will produce for you.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:31.729
Goats should be upstanding and it would be
advisable to buy animals from a flock that

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:41.600
is actively involved in foot improvement.
If you see an animal whose feet haven’t

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.819
been trimmed you know that is a natural animal.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:55.329
If a new entrant was looking at purchasing
angoras it would be beneficially to perhaps

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:04.829
have someone with experience to help. Many
sheep or cattle farmers would have a very

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:14.319
good idea on what constitutes a good animal
and as a judge of stock, I would believe they

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:24.360
would have few problems, apart from perhaps
evaluating the fleece on the animals. In which

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.150
case, someone with experience would be beneficial.
