00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:05.225
- We're told that Mika can
eat 21 hot dogs in 66 minutes.

00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:09.419
She wants to know how many
minutes, m, would it take her

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:14.419
to eat 35 hot dogs, if she
can keep up the same pace.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:18.432
So, big clue is the same
pace, I have to remove a hair

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:20.266
from my tongue, alright. (laughs)

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.147
A big clue is the same pace.

00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:28.147
That means that the hot
dogs, hot dogs per minute,

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:33.754
per minute, is going to be
constant, is always going to be

00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:37.024
the same, always the same.

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:40.270
Always the same, because
this is essentially the pace.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.425
Her hot dogs per minute
are going to stay the same.

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:44.545
She's gonna stay at the same pace.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:47.180
So, we it tells us that
she can eat 21 hot dogs

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.397
in 66 minutes.

00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:52.184
So, her hot dogs per
minute, at least up here,

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:55.016
is 21 hot dogs in 66 minutes,

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:58.857
So, it's 21 hot dogs in 66 minutes.

00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:01.942
Well, if her pace is always
going to be the same,

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:05.181
well it's gonna take her
this ratio over here,

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:09.604
is going to be the ratio
between 35 hot dogs

00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:14.066
and however long it takes
her to eat 35 hot dogs.

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.984
So, once again hot dogs
per minute are going,

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:19.921
has to be a constant because
it's gonna be the same pace.

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.546
Hot dogs per minute.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:25.037
If it takes, 21 hot dogs
takes 66 minutes, 35 hot dogs

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:28.538
take m minutes, these two
ratios are going to be the same.

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:31.546
We're dealing with a
proportional relationship.

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:34.007
It's going to be happening
at the same rate.

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:35.794
And then, we're left with a situation

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.851
where we just have to solve
for m, and there is a bunch

00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:42.498
of different ways you could tackle this.

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.988
The easiest way, that I
can think of doing it is,

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:47.662
I like, I don't like this m
sitting here in the denominator,

00:01:47.662 --> 00:01:50.971
so let's multiply both sides by m.

00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:52.837
Let me do that in a different color.

00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:57.819
So, if I multiply that side
by m and then this side by m,

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.337
and so what do we get?

00:01:59.337 --> 00:02:03.388
On the left hand side,
we have 21 over 66m.

00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:08.378
21 over 66 times m, times m,

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:12.011
is equal to, is equal to,

00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:14.391
well, you divide by m and multiply by m.

00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:17.788
Those are gonna cancel out
and you're just gonna have 35.

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:20.469
And now, you just have to
solve for m and the best way

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.965
I can think of doing that,
is multiply both sides

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:26.227
times the reciprocal on, both
sides times the reciprocal

00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:28.079
of the coefficient on the m.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.749
So, let's multiply both sides by,

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.126
let's multiply both side by 66 over 21.

00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:36.447
Once again, I've just
swapped the numerator

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:38.518
and the denominator here
to get the reciprocal,

00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:40.200
but I can't just do it to
one side of the equation,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.291
I have to do it to both sides, otherwise,

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.417
it's not going to be an equa,

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.903
it's not gonna be equal anymore.

00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:48.903
So, times 66 over 21, this
is just going to be one.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.215
You multiply something
times it's reciprocal,

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:52.921
you're just going to end up with one.

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:57.402
So, you're gonna be left
with, m is equal to.

00:02:57.402 --> 00:03:01.051
Now, 35 times 66 divided by 21.

00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:04.255
Well, 35 is the same thing as,

00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:07.842
35 is five times seven

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:12.279
and 21 is three times seven.

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.040
So, you're multiplying by seven up here

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.129
and here, you have a
seven in the denominator,

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.426
you're dividing by seven, so
they're going to cancel out.

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:24.426
So, this is going to simplify
to five times 66 over 3,

00:03:27.134 --> 00:03:29.578
and then we could simplify it even more,

00:03:29.578 --> 00:03:34.198
because 66 is the same
thing as three times 22.

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:38.041
Three times 22 and so, you
have a three in the numerator,

00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:39.643
you're multiplying by three
and three in the denominator,

00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:40.641
dividing by three.

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:42.916
Three divided by three
is one, so you're left

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:47.916
with five times 22, which is 110.

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:51.724
So, it would take her m
minutes to eat 35 hot dogs

00:03:51.724 --> 00:03:53.326
at the same pace.

00:03:53.326 --> 00:03:54.736
Now, when some of you
might have tackled it,

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:57.615
you might have had a different
equation set up here.

00:03:57.615 --> 00:03:59.716
Instead of thinking of
hot dogs per minute,

00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:01.852
you might have thought
about minutes per hot dog.

00:04:01.852 --> 00:04:04.210
And so, in that situation,
if you thought in terms

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.633
of minutes per hot dog, you
might have said, ok look,

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:11.143
it took Mika 66 minutes to eat 20,

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:15.370
to eat 21 hot dogs,and it's
gonna take her m minutes

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.777
to eat 35 hot dogs and
if it's the same pace,

00:04:19.777 --> 00:04:22.374
then these two rates
are going to be equal.

00:04:22.374 --> 00:04:24.346
They have to be the same pace.

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:26.273
And so, then you can
solve for m and actually,

00:04:26.273 --> 00:04:27.639
this one's easier to solve for m,

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.460
you just multiply both sides by 35.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.431
Multiply both sides by
35 and you're left with,

00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:36.632
on the right hand side
you're left with just an m,

00:04:36.632 --> 00:04:39.906
and on the left hand
side, same, same idea.

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:44.433
You're taking 35, you have 35 times 66/21,

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:46.651
which we already figured out is 110.

00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:50.223
So, 110 is equal, is equal to m.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.918
So, once again, multiple
ways to tackle it,

00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:56.080
but it's important that
we got the same answer.
