00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.460
Hi! I’m Malik the magic guy for expertvillage.com.
I want to show you a couple of presentational

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.880
ideas for the clock trick and how you can
make it even more amazing. So let’s do a

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.299
quick review. Mr. Hand when he did the trick
took off 5 cards and he stuck those in his

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:25.250
pocket. Then I dealt 12 cards to make the
clock and I put the rest of the cards aside.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.250
Now I had a prediction that was written down
but if you like you can use like a card from

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.680
a little deck. These are kind of fun to use.
That is going to be our prediction card, the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:47.650
little 4 of Diamonds. Then we were going to
make our clock. There’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.690
7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Now we know that the
4of Diamonds is going to be the card selected

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.220
and one thing that I did was I changed it
because I was using a red deck so at the end

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.670
when I go the selected card was the 4 of Diamonds.
Here’s the prediction. I was so sure that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.780
I took it out of the deck with a different
color back and the reason that works is when

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.920
we are handling the cards here, we are handling
them all face up. We never see the backs of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:30.950
the cards. So what I did was

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.230
when I put the 4 of Diamonds 13th from the
bottom of the deck, I just put a black one

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.450
or you could use blue or whatever, I put a
different colored one in instead of the red

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.650
one and the trick worked exactly the same
way and that gives you like a little extra

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.369
presentational point on the end. But you can
use different colored cards for predictions;

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.780
you can have the predictions sealed in an
envelope if you like. You can do all kinds

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.970
of neat things limited by our imagination.
So have fun playing with some different ideas

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.760
with the clock trick.
