00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.780
Today on our 2011 Jeep Patriot, were gonna
be installing the Hidden Hitch part 87606.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.450
This is what our hitch will look like once
its installed; now well go ahead and give

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.769
you a couple of measurements.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.789
From the center of the hitch pinhole to the
outermost edge of the bumper is 6 inches.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.180
From the top of the receiver tube to the ground
is 14 inches.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.140
This will assist you in selecting accessories
such as a draw bar, a bike rack or a cargo

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.140
carrier.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.810
Now lets go ahead with the installation.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.750
Before we can install our new hitch, were
gonna need to cut a notch in the rear fascia

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.761
for the receiver tube.

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:37.090
To do this, well follow the instructions using
the measurements provided.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.450
Our first measurement is to find the center
point between the two fascia tabs.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.920
We can do this in two ways.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:01:11.390
The measurement provided 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:02:10.950
is 6 5/8 inches from 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:37.450
the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:03:07.160
center of 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:23.629
the 
fascia tab.
