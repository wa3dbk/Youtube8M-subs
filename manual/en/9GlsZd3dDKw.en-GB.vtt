00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.980
Rawr

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.900
I'm taking a gamble, wearing this today,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.480
but I miss it.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.760
This was my first ever wig and it's my favourite.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.415
It's not in the best condition anymore but it will do.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.100
Toaday, I am doing a "Haul" video.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:18.394
(All the stuff I'm about to hold up, I didn't buy in one day, no.)

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.060
Let's go.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.047
Well first of all, I bought this top.

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:23.554
I bought it from H&amp;M, it's very see through.

00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:26.200
But I think to myself, what's the point in buying nice bras,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.280
if no one's going to see them, hey you can sorta see my bra!

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.560
Erm, I hate wearing bras.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.433
I do, sometimes it feels like there's this massive cage around my chest.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.474
Let's casually move onto Lush.

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:40.434
Over the last month, I've spent many days in Lush stores.

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:42.953
A big shout out to Regents and Waterloo.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.060
You guys are awesome and friendly and yeah!

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.463
You're almost like my teachers and I'm very grateful for your help.

00:00:49.463 --> 00:00:54.380
The guys and girls at Lush have been trying to help me find products to help my various problems.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.963
So first of all, they gave me several testers to try.

00:00:56.963 --> 00:01:00.368
Enzimyon, Herbalism, Dark Angels and Angels On Bare Skin.

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:03.574
And eventually, I settled on a huge tub of Herbalism.

00:01:03.574 --> 00:01:05.487
Does look quite...peculiar.

00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:10.280
I think I bought too much, but then I found out I can use this on my body as well. So we'll see.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.120
The second big product I bought, was Enzymion.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.920
It's a moisturiser for oily skin.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.075
I don't know what it is, I just get so excited when I go to put this on in the morning.

00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:21.674
The smell's gorgeous, it makes my face feel good.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.880
VERY VERY HAPPY!

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.000
Oh my goodness.

00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:29.668
It's called a "Bubbleroon" and it's for the bath and smells of Rose Jam.

00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:33.455
But the thing is, I don't think I'm gonna use this in the bath because whilst I was staying in London,

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:36.560
it smelt my flat out it, it stunk it out of Rose Jam!

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.760
So I'm just gonna put this on my windowsill until I can use my bath and just have a nice aroma.

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:44.894
And the very very last Lush product I bought was a bath melt.

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:47.680
This reminds me of Kentwell Hall and The Tudors.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.320
That is so nostalgic.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.615
The next wonderful place I've been spending too much time is CassArt

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:56.114
Seriously, the day I walked into CassArt for the first time,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.440
my eyes just went BOOM!

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.794
And my dimples hurt.

00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:04.200
CassArt is just a normal art shop but there are discounts all the time.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.320
Products that are normally something like £70 are discounted to like £20.

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:10.274
Which is insane, it's great.

00:02:10.274 --> 00:02:12.020
So here's all the stuff I bought:

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.413
Some acrylic paint brushes.

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:15.734
Some acrylic paints cause all of mine have dried up.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.100
Water colour paper.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.795
I also bought some flesh...

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.440
paint.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.740
I know, that's cheating.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.920
The amount of acrylic paint I go through to try and achieve those beautiful flesh colours

00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:28.694
this just saves time, money and paint.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.420
Flesh, ooh.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.900
I bought this tiny book to doodle in but I've ended up (The Office)

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.828
I ended up painting in it instead.

00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:37.700
I want to take this everywhere with me.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.234
Some goulash, gouache.

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:41.440
Even in the store, I kept calling it goulash.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.660
Goulash is soup.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.954
Gouache is inbetween water colour and acrylic,

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:46.574
it's like a happy medium.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.200
Middle?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.716
And already, I've been painting.

00:02:49.154 --> 00:02:50.754
And feeling very happy.

00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:52.447
I'm happy, can you tell?

00:02:52.447 --> 00:02:54.654
One of the favourite things I've bought, is this.

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:57.820
First of all, I got it in a sale. I got like £10 off!

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.534
Some perfume is dear! (expensive!).

00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:03.074
I have wanted this since I was twelve/thirteen.

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:04.895
I am very protective of this.

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:06.854
I bought some gloves from Accessorize.

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:10.440
This year is the first year where I'm getting Chilblains in my fingers.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.953
And I'm not a happy bunny.

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:16.200
They are a bit big, but I was using them yesterday and they kept my hands so warm.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.300
I bought this scarf in a charity shop.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.020
Woohoo, we're going for a....I think everything's kinda blue today!

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.613
Pink is my favourite colour but blue is my favourite colour to wear.

00:03:25.613 --> 00:03:27.454
Blue is often more appropriate.

00:03:27.454 --> 00:03:29.981
I bought a "star mucks", marks? MARKS?

00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.741
I bought a starbucks mug... cup.

00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:37.734
It's a recyclable cup and when you use it, they take 25p off a hot chocolate!

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:40.516
Personally, I find Starbucks too expensive,

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:43.634
So something like this, makes it more worthwhile.

00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:45.460
I even put an "R" on the bottom. Look at that!

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.034
The only thing about this, is I'm nervous I'm gonna throw this away.

00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:49.568
No, I've got to protect it.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.880
I bought this huge coat!

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.280
I saw this in a charity shop for about £14

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.560
and although green is not my colour, it felt nice, it fit and I've been wearing it for about two weeks now

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.360
and it keeps me so warm!

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.860
There was one night when I was walking home from work wearing a hat and this

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.654
and I swear I felt like Eponine.

00:04:06.654 --> 00:04:10.474
Depending on what else I wear, I do feel like I'm David Tennant with this.

00:04:10.474 --> 00:04:12.074
It's almost like I'm wearing a dress.

00:04:12.074 --> 00:04:15.774
I don't think I've felt this excited about a coat in years.

00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:19.514
I've been in what feels like twenty shops, over the last month.

00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:21.215
I found this.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.300
It looks like halloween on the inside.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.555
Now I must admit, I went a bit crazy on the hat front.

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:30.180
I've got a maroon and blue one of these, so now I've got a green one.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.380
It will go with the coat.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.460
Horray.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.994
This is the first time I've worn it with a wig, wow.

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:38.260
Especially when I take the wig off and wear my own hair under my hat,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.280
and wear certain clothing, I do feel a bit like Modern Millie.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:44.114
Except my tap dancing isn't up to scratch.

00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:45.974
Right my hair is back on.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.360
Oh my gosh, I bought another hat, didn't I?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.000
I was in Oxfam (charity shop) and saw this.

00:04:50.334 --> 00:04:51.934
This is the Eponine hat.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.780
Sort of.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.880
When I was trying this on, one of the girls at the counter recognised me and was like:

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.900
"Are you Beckie0?"

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.660
And I'm like "Yeah".

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.734
Actually my first response was "OH NO!".

00:05:00.394 --> 00:05:01.434
This is so warm.

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.080
Whoever made this, well done, it's a great hat.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.873
It is amazing what you can find in charity shops.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:09.974
Er, give or take one or two things, I think that's about it.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.700
I feel like I've spent alot.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.120
Now that I'm back at home, I will not be spending anymore.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.933
Thank you for watching and I'll see you soon.

00:05:18.243 --> 00:05:18.743
Bye.
