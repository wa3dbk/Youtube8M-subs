00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.790
I've never been much of a possessions
kind of person, as long as I had

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.799
a rugby ball.

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.459
I was pretty happy.

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.080
I've always just wanted to be stable
and have a family and

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.390
be able to retire comfortably.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.599
I've never cared for being, um, 
outrageously rich or anything.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:23.960
I've always been quite

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.599
cautious with spending money.

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.579
Seeing mum

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.410
struggle with money when I was young

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.140
probably may me aware a bit earlier
than most young kids, about

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170
uh... the importance of money and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.069
of paying bills, and all those kinds of things.
That's probably where my saving instincts

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.070
kind of started.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.950
I'm pretty stingy with my money.
Um, yeah, I don't like

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.620
spending it for nothing really.
So, if I can save it, I'll

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.780
save it.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.440
Sometimes I'm known in my family -

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.490
I'm the barginer.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.089
[laughs]

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.280
And my mum and dad and my brother, 
they get me to bargin stuff for them

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.180
but they won't come with me, 'cus
they feel too embarrased.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.890
A few times I've come up with a price, and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.480
if they've agreed straight away - I'm like,
far out, I should have gone lower. [laughs]

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.330
If I see something I like, that I can afford to buy,
I'll go buy it but if it's a bit more expensive,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.390
I'll save for it.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.610
I've never felt the impulse
to just go right out there

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.060
and spend a whole heap of money.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.729
Yeah, yeah, that was my first car

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.579
a '99 Subaru V4 legacy. I saved up and 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.229
that paid for this car in full.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.230
Yeah, it went pretty fast and stuff, and

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.990
I actually got a speeding ticket.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.909
Which, yeah, taught me a lesson, 'cus I hate spending money.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.630
Nothing's for free in this world.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.270
Whenever the bills come in,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.409
I, um, pay them straight away,

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.990
and then i usually just put
all the money away that

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.979
I can save.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.330
I think saving is paramount.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.510
Don't go crazy spending money on
silly things like clothes and cars

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.259
and all that.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.129
You can make some good decisions
with the money you save, but just work hard

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.119
save your money and, yeah, make good choices.
