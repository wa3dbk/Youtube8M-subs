My name is Brandon Sarkis, on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.710
to make Hungarian meatball stew. All right,
so our first step is to make our meatballs.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.599
So what we're going to do is we're going to
take our breadcrumbs, our egg, and our ground

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.330
beef, and just plop them down here in the
bowl. And at this point, you're also either

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.529
going to want to have rubber gloves around
or very, very clean hands. In the event you're

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.380
like me and have clean hands and not rubber
gloves, you're going to want to make sure

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.240
that you do things like take off your ring
because food gets stuck underneath that, and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.350
it gets really disgusting. Something else
we're also going to need here just for seasoning's

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.430
sake, a little bit of salt. And don't be afraid
about over-seasoning these because they're

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.690
meatballs and meatballs are supposed to have
lots and lots and lots of flavor. And some

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.340
pepper. And you can actually do this in a
mixer if you wanted to, but it's not as much

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:11.860
fun. You don't get to play with the food that
way. All right, that's probably good enough.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.590
So next up, take your hands, your nice, clean
hands, and just start mixing. Start going

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.390
for the meatballs. You want to make sure that
your egg gets mixed in there evenly, too.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.140
That's one of the harder things to do, and
all you have to do to mix meatballs, really,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.240
is just grab a hold of it and just give it
a good squeeze and let it just come through

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.360
your fingers like that. And next thing you
know, you've got meatballs. So don't worry

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.270
about your breadcrumbs sticking to the bottom
of the bowl because as you mix it up, it will

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.790
pick up all those breadcrumbs out of the bottom
of your bowl and everything will be just fine.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.630
What you're looking for here is you're looking
for a nice, even consistency. And you're looking

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.180
for the -- everything to be mixed together
well. My hand's getting very, very cold doing

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.049
this. It's also very important when handling
ground beef that you keep it really, really

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.110
cold at all times because ground beef is one
of the easier ways to get food poisoning.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.780
So I had this right in the fridge until I
pulled it out, so it's really, really chilly

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:23.319
right now. So we're looking pretty good here
for our meatball sauce...our meatball sauce

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.180
 -- meatball base here. So the next step,
we're going to actually make some meatballs.
