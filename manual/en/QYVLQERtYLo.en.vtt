First of all, I want to tell you that a countries development

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.640
is primarily based on their educational quality and their capability to develop technology.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.820
Technology development is not just a matter of first world countries,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.320
but more about the will to do it.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.700
Hello I'm David Bustos, co-founder of Briko. 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.920
Hello I'm Diego Peláez, co-founder of Briko .

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.660
I am Bernardo Fernandez and we have a project called Briko.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.440
Briko is a kit to learn electronics, robotics, and programming, in an easy and fun way. 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.100
What makes it unique is that to use each module you simply have to connect one cable.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.960
The idea is to inspire kids to create technology in the future

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.580
for them to be the ones that could create a product like Briko.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.840
What is cool about Briko is that it's very simple to use.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.620
Kids can use it to create diverse projects, for example a robot or an alarm that are very simple to program. 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.140
Briko is currently in a beta phase. There is already a completely functional product. 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.720
By the end of July the goal is to have the final product, how it’s going to be packaged and sold.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.480
In order to prepare for mass production, for example injection molds.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.300
In parallel we are going to develop various MVPs to validate the market to make sure it’s the right one. 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.840
We are almost certain that they will be kids from ages 12-16.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.220
Without forgetting about the growing maker community.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.560
Currently we are 9 people working on the project,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.260
4 co-founders and 5 interns,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.400
who are students from various universities and careers and who are also a great help for the project.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.740
People do not create or develop technology,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.060
 we simply buy cellphones or computers,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.900
 but in reality, how many Mexican technological products exist? 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.340
That is what Briko is going to change.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:18.580
We want to create a generation of kids, who are able to create technology from an early age. 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.380
That is why we developed Briko, to put in the hands of the people the ability to create whatever they imagine

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.020
and primarily to put in the hands of the people,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.360
a tool made in Mexico, especially designed to develop technology.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.600
We want you to join the team, so that together we can create the Briko generation.
