00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.620
plummeting moving into a situation where
you with roommates who you might not

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.419
have known they want to choose your
roomate carefully unfortunate in using

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.320
becoming long after you've already been
assigned a roomate but whatever works

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.809
and i talk about it'll be fun now there
are a lot of reasons why you don't want

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.440
to have about a roommate their stress in
order to get in fights in in fact uh...

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.470
it's college roommates conflict with
roomates is one of top five reasons

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.619
since dropout accounts that's really
significant but is actually new

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.019
information this is coming out of a up
professors work at dartmouth they can

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.930
actually ruin your grades to you if you
have with cut conflicts will

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.550
relationship with her roomate i did have
a horrible remaining college it was like

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.510
neither of us have that remain friend

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.580
the sophomore year and we were like
friends of friends and so they can't

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.170
sustain definitely initial friend of the
great him toward home

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.559
naina and not having an end

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.210
you know that i don't see it

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.600
this is such a good care

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.570
okay i couldn't stand here and she was
just like cell selfish in cell

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.640
rainy and you never

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.400
play friend over all the time and they
weren't

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.460
surrounds

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.060
i like the idea of who you ask for
anyone missing and don't do a super loud

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.990
and i'm like right next door

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.420
eliminates door is a group

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.080
a benefit for for that

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.740
speakers twenty-one let yes i'm i'm not
going to tell me never expected

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.920
like my grades fell but it doesn't make
you miserable because every time you go

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.979
home and it's like they are cleaned a
lot i mean it was a look at the many of

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.140
the key night

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.180
tapping here yeah still with a fully
universities have like increasingly

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.700
sophisticated ways of trying to pair
people up

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.610
and so hopefully you can rely on that if
you have about roommate like nobody

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.740
likes to switch roommates like midway
through the process of the art if so

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.970
many things going on but if it's
possible you should consider it because

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.200
they can impact your grades impact their
relationships that lead to stress in

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.400
depression and things like that

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.380
but to make you feel bump it better if
you're currently living with someone you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.910
hate then as a roommate we've actually
got one that's far worse since this

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.130
happened in nineteen ninety-five uh...
missus from sesame do te da c a harvard

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.750
junior ethiopia she was not very popular
not doing very well in school and shes

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.899
rooming with a girl

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.869
uh...

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.590
training fom hole

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.450
who's doing better schools more popular
an unfortunate her senior year that girl

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.729
said no i i think of the move-out
include somebody else

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.679
and her roommate was so andrea about
losing the person who sort of entering

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:28.249
them to success in popularity betsy i
stabbed and killed her and then killed

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.819
herself

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.919
so if anyone

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.180
