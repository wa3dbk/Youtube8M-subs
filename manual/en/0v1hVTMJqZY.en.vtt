00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.560
Uriel has found new information on
the story from the old diary. Seek

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.410
Uriel out and find out more. 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.270
"How are you? Do you remember that
diary and the story in it? The one that

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.930
abruptly ends on the thirteenth and
final page?"

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.790
"Yes, naturally. Seven people ran
from Lee Seop and his cavalry into

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.170
the Hwang Temple and in their
desperation, they enacted the

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.130
forbidden black witchcraft... in the
end, only one of them survived."

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.160
"Correct. I have carried out further
research and found that the seven

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.040
members of the holy cult were the
Dragon Priestesses. In old scrolls

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.810
they are associated with a theocratic
people named the Dark Nation.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.390
Were these Dragon Priestesses part
of this mysterious nation? Here, read

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.460
this scroll through carefully and then
talk to me again once you are done."

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.000
According to Uriel's investigations the
seven Dragon Priestesses are from

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.240
the Dark Nation. Examine the old
gravestone on Mount Sohan. It is

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.070
supposed that the capital of the Dark
Nation was once at that location.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.550
Before you go, speak withUriel once
more.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.800
"Their unbelievably high-developed
witchcraft and the fact that according

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.570
to the diary, they have been
destroyed by Lee Seop all points to

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.300
the idea that the seven Dragon
Priestesses were actually part of the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.180
Dark Nation."

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.960
"In the old scrolls there is a map.
With closer inspection, you can

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.920
determine that the capital of the Dark
Nation must have been located on

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.740
Mount Sohan."

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.680
"Mount Sohan? I saw an old
gravestone there once!"

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.410
"You don't perhaps remember any
inscription on it? Evidently not. This

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.960
gravestone may be able to provide us
with valuable information on the Dark

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.500
Nation. Could you perhaps go to
Mount Sohan and make a copy of the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.300
inscription for me?" 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.460
"According to Uriel's investigations,
the seven Dragon Priestesses

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.500
belonged to the Dark Nation. Examine
the old gravestone on Mount Sohan.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.330
The capital of the Dark Nation was
supposed to be there, once long

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.000
ago."
