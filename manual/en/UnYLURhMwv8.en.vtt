00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:05.399
hello everyone I'm Michael from the
daily note 2 youtube channel and welcome 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.949
to another episode of galaxy note 2
tips and tricks episode sixteen

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:14.029
the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 comes with vice
commands that are separated from google

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:15.510
and google vice search

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.200
so I will quickly run through them and i'll
show you how to enable and disable them

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.640
because those settings are not easy to
find

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.640
so here we go, reject

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.570
answer

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.000
snooze

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.260
snooze

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.850
snooze, stop

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.390
capture, shoot

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.810
smile, cheese

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.010
next

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.780
previous, pause, play

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450
volume up

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.340
volume down

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.440
mute

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.440
next, mute, pause, play, stop

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.350
as you could see it did pretty well there
I couldn't get the snooze

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530
for the alarm clock but

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.309
I got it to everything else

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:44.210
another thing is i would say mute
and it would go back to previous

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.720
so i thought that's interesting
considering it doesn't recognize other

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.430
words but seem to recognize mute

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.590
but it wants to go back a track so

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.870
anyway

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.080
so to trigger as voice by doing double tap

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.750
if you did turn that off you could

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.780
find S voice in your apps and
you would do the same thing then go to

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.889
settings..hit menu and go to settings

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.709
and then you're going to see

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.379
control apps

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.430
and then if you have it off

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.549
all of these functions that we saw
would be disabled

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.529
and maybe it would save you some battery
as well

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:23.809
but

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:28.289
let me show you one
interesting troubleshooting tips before

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:29.569
we move on

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.769
say that

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.509
say that we had this turned off

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.900
because you don't want any kind of like

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.039
alarm voice controll or music voice control

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.769
but say you go to the camera app

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.389
you go to the camera app

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:53.709
and you want to use those voice
functions

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.699
.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:56.690
take photos

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.709
using voice and you want to turn that on

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.280
when you turn that on the entire

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.499
voice control

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.169
turns on. so let me show you

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:14.139
so when you turn that on this whole
switch flips

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.489
and it is not just the camera
that gets enabled

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.879
it's whatever you had set before
so

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.749
just letting you know

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:30.080
you might be turning something on
by indirectly switching

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.209
switch on the camera app

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.069
this episode was

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.579
inspired by somebody who commented that
they really like this feature on the

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.749
galaxy S3 and they had a really hard time
finding it

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:47.809
even called samsung and they didn't even
know how to do it so he told me about it

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.719
and i think it's a great feacher i have it on
and I think it would be great for music

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.419
one thing is
when you answer a phone call

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.029
by voice it automatically turns out the

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:01.689
speakers so i think that's very
intuitive

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.649
so anyway

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.340
there you go i want to show you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.039
how to turn it on or maybe you want to turn it off 
so save some battery

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:14.839
and how to get to it because it is not obvious
you cannot go to settings and it

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:20.509
is not anywhere in here so i think
it's definitely worth pointing out

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.900
so if you haven't been to my channel yet
please come by and check it out

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.220
if you haven't been to my chennel recently

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.780
I've reorganized everything because

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.669
I used to have all the videos together at once
