00:00:04.058 --> 00:00:06.276
[lively electronic music]

00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:15.987
[speaking Ukranian]

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:18.096
(female translator) The only difference from able-bodied

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:20.058
biathlon is that we don't carry guns on our backs.

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:22.176
We come to the shooting range, coaches place

00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:26.343
the guns, we fix the arm, shoot, and fly away.

00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:39.967
From the start everything is the same. The distance

00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:42.854
is the same, the penalty loop is the same. The only

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:47.195
thing that differs is the percentage system.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.187
[speaking Ukrainian]

00:00:57.187 --> 00:00:59.297
(male translator) I'm class LW-8. I've got a

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:02.020
hand impairment, amputated fingers. There are

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.603
also impairments where people have no hands

00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:07.520
at all or finger impairments, so they ski without

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.631
ski poles.

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:13.511
And there are also classes for athletes

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:15.377
who have problems with their legs. They ski with

00:01:15.377 --> 00:01:17.657
two poles but they have prostheses on their legs

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:20.137
or their legs can't bend because of problems

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:23.757
with their knees.

00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:29.097
The classes are separated and depending on how

00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:31.978
they are separated each athlete gets a certain

00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:35.598
percentage of time.

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:44.103
Well I have, for example, 97% in freestyle. Someone

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:47.938
without ski poles can have 91 or 88%. Depending

00:01:47.938 --> 00:01:50.298
on this, the leaders time is reduced for him,

00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:53.817
so for example, over ten kilometres, I have to win well,

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:56.974
let's say, three minutes.

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:05.169
[electronic music, clicks of gun cocking and firing]

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:10.020
(female translator) We lie down, place the hand, put

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.817
the rifle on the spring; we press it to ourselves.

00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:15.377
The way you press it is up to you. You shoot,

00:02:15.377 --> 00:02:18.878
leave the rifle, and go.

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:21.137
[speaking German]

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:23.020
(male translator) The distance for all categories is

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.770
ten metres, rather than the 50 metres for the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.198
biathletes. The air rifle can be used at ten metres.

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:33.771
[speaking Ukranian]

00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:35.737
(male translator) Well, when I get to the line, my pulse

00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:38.929
can be about 130 to 140.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:43.518
[thumping of heartbeat]

00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:48.103
Then it can fall to 100, but my heart starts beating

00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:51.687
hard. When shooting you need to hold your breath.

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:54.576
That is, you shouldn't breathe. You breathe out,

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:57.377
breathe in, and then you make a small breath out,

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.988
hold your breath, then pull the trigger to shoot.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.771
[speaking German]

00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:06.438
(male translator) A rifle check is carried out before

00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:10.136
every important race. Each nation, each athlete has to

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:14.103
submit their rifle for inspection. I would say this rules out

00:03:14.103 --> 00:03:16.988
any possibility of cheating.

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.854
[speaking Ukranian]

00:03:20.854 --> 00:03:22.688
(male translator) Each athlete has lots of pairs of skis.

00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:25.188
It's not just one pair. They might have ten. And before

00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:27.578
the competition you need to choose the best one.

00:03:27.578 --> 00:03:30.177
So we choose a point on a slope and let the skis

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:32.770
run down. The pair that goes furthest is taken to

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.597
the start.

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:48.137
The human body adapts to anything, and skiing

00:03:48.137 --> 00:03:51.988
with one stick does not make me feel uncomfortable.

00:03:52.017 --> 00:03:54.336
(female translator) It's cool with one pole. I'm already

00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:57.557
used to it; I like it.

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:00.416
And when it's the final straight, when you have one

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:03.771
or two seconds left, then you're firing on all cylinders.

00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:06.377
Because you may still lose. You may lose by a metre

00:04:06.377 --> 00:04:08.737
or a half, and it would be a shame if you get

00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:12.756
a wooden medal instead of the normal one.

00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:25.354
(male translator) When you are approaching

00:04:25.354 --> 00:04:27.378
the finish and your entire body hurts, and you can

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:29.937
no longer race, you must fight this. You need to

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:32.604
overcome yourself and find those reserve powers

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:35.218
which are almost gone and race to the finish.

00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:43.358
That is very difficult and many people fail.
