00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.870
Today I am going to take you on a behind the
scenes tour of me getting my hair done.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.370
A lot of you guys ask me what salon I go to
and who styles my hair so I thought it would

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.880
be really fun to have a sneak peak, behind
the scenes, so I can introduce you to the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.950
salon I go to.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.820
And you guys can get a real-life look at the
process that I go through to get my hair trimmed

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.970
and re-touched.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.960
I kind of bounced around from salon to salon
over the past few years looking for the perfect

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.410
place and the perfect person, someone who
understands what I want and great customer

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.910
service and all of that so I am finally sharing
the place that I found that suits me and my

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.336
purposes, and who I find to be very talented
and gifted, especially when it comes to doing

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:41.336
short hair styles.

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:45.770
Because they are a lot more involved and a
lot more technique required for shaping and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.250
texturizing, and thinning out to really give
a pixie the body and shape and texture it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.250
needs.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.780
So this is the before.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.270
All nice and shaggy and out of control.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.080
And you guys will have to wait till the end
of this video to see the after.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:02:06.340
So I am about to head over to Hair Do so you
guys get to come with me and see what it's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:26.340
like.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:03:46.329
We're going to go.

00:03:46.329 --> 00:04:10.189
So I just got back from Hair Do, and as you
can see, I went a little bit shorter this

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:17.239
time.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:38.409
I love it!

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.909
I am really excited about the toner, because
I love me some ashy hair.

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.260
I love the intensity of the toner too on the
first couple days, it's just so strong and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.960
ashy and I just love how cool the tone is.&nbsp;

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.919
I want to know what you guys think; do you
like it better short like this?

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.560
Or do you like it when it was long before
with the heavier dramatic bang?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.020
Or do you like the pale/yellow blonde?

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.169
Or this ashy cool tone?

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.540
If you're looking for a new stylist for yourself,
or a great salon to go to, I'll leave the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.909
information for Hair do so you can check it
out.

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:18.319
And my stylists name is Suzanne, so if you
want a pixie cut, or someone who specializes

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.229
in short haircuts, I recommend asking for
Suzanne.

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.699

scenes of my little hair transformation.
