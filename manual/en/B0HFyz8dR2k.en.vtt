Hi, I am Carolyn and I am going to demonstrate
the lion clip on a cat named Twyla and there

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.760
are two ways to do it. One you start back
here and that is actually prettier I think,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.760
but the other one is more of a maintenance
cut. And you go the way the hair grows; you

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.760
go straight down the back and like right over.
You can decide on this yourself where you

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.760
want to stop. But it leaves a rough like the
lionâ€™s and then you hold them up so that

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.760
you tighten the skin and just follow that
same line you started around there with and

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.760
you basically going to cut all her hair off
except for that rough like a lion. You make

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.760
each side match so get like a bone or muscle
to be your guideline and so that way you can

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760
do each side alike. We have to look this way
little girl; what you are going to do is cut

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.500
all the hair off except for that around their
head. Like on the lion that is where it got

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.980
its name. And this one I like the best; her
hair is already short but if it was long she

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:32.700
would look like a male lion. Then you do the
tail like a lion but that is optional. If

00:00:32.700 --> 00:01:22.760
you do it for a friend or somebody, you ask
them if they want the tail off because it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:58.550
takes forever for the tail to grow back. It
takes mine a year for their tails to grow

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:18.239
back and their body hair grows about the same
rate as people about an inch a month. It is

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.689
basically like that; only if she had more
hair this would be real full just like your

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.010
male lion.
