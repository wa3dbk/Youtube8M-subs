00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.100
There are two things that make fitting shutters
simple and will give you the confidence to

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.530
order and fit them yourself. The first are
the 'easy fit frames', they allow the shutters

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.770
and frames to be fitted as one unit. This
saves you messing around trying to fit the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.440
frames to the window or wall and then wondering
why the shutters don't fit.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.760
The second is what I call the shadow gap,
the shadow gap is the clearance gap left between

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.550
the window recess and the shutter frame. This
shadow gap allows for the walls to be out

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.600
of level or any bumps in the plaster, it ensures
the shutter frame to fits easily into the

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.300
recess with a little bit of clearance all
round, the frame can then be adjusted left

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.620
or right or up and down until there is an
equal looking shadow all round the frame.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.031
The combination of the easy fit frames and
shadow gap allows you to wedge the shutter

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:56.800
frame into place align the shutters within
the frame and then fix it to the window as

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.800
one unit.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.380
It is far neater to leave a natural shadow
gap than using filler. When the shutters,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.430
wall colouring and the window sill are all
different shades of white or colour, the filler,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.899
which is normally in another shade of white,
can crack and look untidy depending the quality

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.100
and how it's applied.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.310
The shadow gap is the neatest and easiest
way to fit shutters, it creates a professional

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.289
finish and draws your eye to the square shutter
frame rather than the wonky window and this

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.869
is what makes fitting shutters yourself easy.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.920
We generally leave a 5mm shadow gap all round
the frame, because your using the smallest

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.730
sizes this can be larger in some cases, but
as long as you check your measuring, ensure

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.959
the width and height are the right way around
you'll find the shutters slip easily into

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.289
place.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.130
The measuring and design are very important
for a successful shutter installation, but

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.090
the shadow gap makes the fitting easy and
neat.
