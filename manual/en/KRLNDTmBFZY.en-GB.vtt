00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.509
In this lesson, we are going to learn about
diffusion of gases. This will help you to

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.490
understand how gases behave and also explain
why smells spread.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.150
Before we start, you need to recall what solids,
liquids and gases are like in terms of their

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.090
particles. In particular, I'd like you to
ask yourself, how are the particles arranged

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.130
in a gas? Pause the video and restart it when
you think you have the answer.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.719
The answer is: The particles in a gas are
spaced out and move about very quickly in

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:42.730
random directions. Did you get it right?
This, of course, explains why a gas takes

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.659
the shape of it's container. It's because
the particles will each continue to travel

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:55.429
in a straight line until they hit the wall
of the container. So, the smelly gases given

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:01.870
off by rotting vegetables in a sealed box
will fill the box with rotting vegetable smell,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.000
but you won't be able to smell them outside
the box.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.869
However, take the lid off the box, and those
particles will no longer bounce off the lid

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.240
and be contained. They will start to escape
into the air around the box. You'll soon notice

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.500
the effect and will be able to smell the rotting
vegetables; that's those gas particles reaching

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.890
your nose by diffusion!
Diffusion is the random movement of gas through

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.109
another, from a region of high concentration
(in this case, inside the box) to a region

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.179
of low concentration (in this case, outside
the box).

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.439
It is a process that doesn't rely on wind
or air currents; it will happen even if you

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.200
are inside a building and the air is completely
still.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.560
There are many examples of diffusion; but
smell is probably the most obvious one. These

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.040
could be food smells, body smells from other
people, the scent that a plant gives off to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.910
attract pollinating insects. The same even
happens with the smoke from a candle after

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.620
it has been extinguished - it spreads out.
It's all due to diffusion.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.470
Here's challenge for you. If someone walks
into a room with some fresh flowers, why does

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.650
it take a while for the smell of the flowers
to fill the room? Why can't you smell them

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:39.610
straight away? Pause the video and restart
it when you think you have the answer.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.860
Just as the gas particles can hit the walls
of a container and rebound, the particles

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.450
can also hit each other. It doesn't matter
if there is only a single gas or a mixture

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.910
of gases, these collisions between particles
are always taking place. It's very similar

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.780
to trying to walk in a straight line through
a busy crowd of people - it's very difficult

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.170
to do without bumping shoulders with someone
and changing direction.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.590
This explains why it takes a while for a smell
to get from one part of a room to another.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.240
The high concentration of gas (or smell) particles
takes time to spread out due to the collisions

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.400
with the other gas particles in the air.
And that... is diffusion.
