00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.290
So in this clip, we'll actually be doing the
Neti technique. I've filled the Neti pot with

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.310
body temperature water. Filtered water. And
I'm going to add some sea salt, and depending

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.290
on the size of your Neti, and also just depending
on how sensitive you are the amount of sea

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:25.840
salt will vary. I usually put a good, I don't
know, ten second sprinkle. And then you're

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:37.460
going to want to shake it up. The salinity
of your water should be about what your tears

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.960
taste like. So that's about the appropriate
salinity of your body. And then this next

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.569
step might be a little freaky, but it's totally
safe and totally easy. You just position the

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:58.339
nozzle in one nostril and you tilt your head
so it's about on the horizon. And you can

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.879
see that the water pours in one nostril and
out the other. And I can totally talk, and

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.450
totally breathe. You just give it a good flow.
You might feel some pressure in your ears.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:19.571
And then when it's time to change sides, you
want to give a little blow from the side that

00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:32.109
you poured out first. I blow out that side.
And then I would do the other side.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:47.390
The sensation is not much different from getting
water up your nose at the pool. And then,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.979
so, you might have some tissues handy, when
you do the blowing through one nostril at

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.659
a time after the water. You might see some
mucus and some stuff coming out, especially

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:08.300
if you're congested already. Then getting
the nasal passages dry is also important.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.250
So we'll look at some breathing techniques
in the next clip, to show you how to do that.
