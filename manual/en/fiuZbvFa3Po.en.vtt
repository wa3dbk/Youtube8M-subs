00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.359
My name is Christine Marquette and I'm a Registered
Dietician with the Austin Regional Clinic

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.030
and I'm going to talk to you about how to
drink a gallon of water a day. This can actually

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.379
be a relatively easy to achieve if you use
water bottles that have the amount of ounces

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.090
written on them. For example, you can buy
a lot of the portable water bottles that are

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.019
the size of 32 ounces. And the easiest way
to do this is just to basically sip on your

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.189
water throughout the day. If you're not use
to drinking a lot of water, you definitely

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.520
don't want to start drinking a gallon of water
a day right away. It's something that you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.770
want to work up to. So again, get your 32-ounce
bottle, start sipping on that, once you're

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
able to drink that whole thing down you want
to move up to having two bottles of that in

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.351
a day. There you're already at 64 ounces,
that's already half a gallon. So once you

00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:55.790
have that into your belt, you can again add
one more of your 32-ounce bottles of water,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.700
you're three quarters of the way to having
a gallon. After that point, once you get used

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.330
to that, you basically add in your fourth
32-ounce bottle of water and you're up to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.840
a whole gallon. Again, this is something that
you want to work up to. Some people may not

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.520
necessarily need the entire gallon of water
a day, your fluid needs are based on a couple

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.250
of things; they're based on your body weight
and they're also based on your level of physical

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.759
activity as well as weather conditions. So
a rough rule of thumb is to take your body

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.549
weight, divide it in half, that's the number
of ounces of water that you need on a daily

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.329
basis. Of course, if it's very hot outside
and you're doing a lot of activity outside,

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.799
you're probably going to need more water than
that. So again, really spend sometime looking

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.030
at how much you weigh, how much physical activity
you're doing and whether you're sweating a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.429
lot because it's very hot outside and use
that to gauge whether you really need a gallon

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.250
of water. Maybe you need more, maybe you need
less. But, a method for achieving that is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.719
again to use 32-ounce bottles and work your
way up to having four of those and that would

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.159
get you to a gallon of water a day.
