00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.490
Hello dear friends of the analog entertainment
to a new episode of Hunter &amp; Cron.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:13.990
This time with "Om Nom Nom".
From Meelis Looveer. Brain Games.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.090
And who thinks, that's a totally idiotic title, let me tell you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.889
this title is the universal word of all living beings on this planet,

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:30.860
what they utter when they eat: OM NOM NOM.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.740
Unfortunately it is a totally stupid game.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:41.940
Who always wanted to own a game, which polarizes your own board game group more than Escape and Galaxy Trucker

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.250
and God knows what else.
Then you need Om Nom Nom!

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.850
There is a game board, with a hedgehog on it.
Underneath is a frog and at the bottom a fly.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.079
Quite clearly these are feeding hierarchies. For example:
Cat eats mouse, mouse eats cheese.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.419
Then you have prey dice, a lot of them.
At the beginning of the game this dice are rolled

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.509
and distributed on the appropriate fields.
And they show all prey that can be eaten.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:17.350
Of course the prey, which is here at the bottom,
is the most difficult to eat.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.909
That's worth two points each.
And a frog here, would be worth one point.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.809
And of course I'll try to make as much prey as possible.

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:30.319
How do I do that?
Each player has an identical set of cards here,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.229
where all the animals are displayed.
Then you choose a card, put it on the table face down.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.559
Then all their cards are flipped over and then you see which animal makes prey and which is eaten by other animals.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:45.379
Now supposing, down here is a lot of cheese.
Then of course I think to myself:

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:49.469
Clear. I could play a mouse ,
but Cron is likely to play a cat.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.479
Yes, psychology! Get inside the minds of your fellow players.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.779
Consider how they think, what they do and you can see it in their eyes,
what animals they will play.

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:05.050
But because Cron thinks, that I think,
that I will not play mouse ...

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.719
of course I can still play a mouse!

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.040
And then you just need to think around one more corner
and counter with the corresponding animal.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.740
But because Cron thinks, that I think, that he thinks
that I think, I do not play a mouse,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.400
I can yes ... again play a mouse.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.810
But then I think again, because Hunter thinks,
a mouse, a cat, a mouse ... I just play a mouse.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.030
Because he thinks, because I think, because he thinks, 
because I think, because he thinks, because I think,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.230
I do not play a mouse ... I just play a mouse.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.100
And do you know what happens then?

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.300
And at the very end, I just play the cat
and consume Hunters mouse.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.110
No matter what I do, or no matter around which corner
I think.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.910
It is psychology and tactics on a very high level!

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.120
At the end I am always getting eaten somehow.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.120
Because some people think,
there are no tactics and psychology.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.020
And that's exactly what you shamelessly exploite to your advantage
and just always think around one more corner

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.110
than all the others at the table
and so you win every game Om Nom Nom

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.210
That's why I can tell you,
keep away from Om Nom Nom,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.510
because it just drives you to madness.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.540
And if you behaved,
Then you might find in your Santa Claus stocking

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.840
this beautiful, entertaining Om Nom Nom.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.030
And if you were very naughty, and didn't play your games,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.900
then comes Santa's Little Helper and forces you to play Om Nom Nom for one day straight.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.930
That's about the worst thing I can imagine.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.480
So however you look at it,
it seems you can't avoid Om Nom Nom.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.740
Om Nom Nom, I tell you.
Yes, and we see us next time at the same place

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.530
Hopefully with a game that does not torture me so.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.730
Om Nom Nom 2!

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.230
Om Nom Nom ... Until then, ciao!
