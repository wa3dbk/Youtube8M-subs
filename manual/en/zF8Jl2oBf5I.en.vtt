00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.050
Greater black-backed and herring gulls breed
on Appledore Island of the New England coast.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.550
Here the gulls court, mate, nest, and fledge
young,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.630
all in three short months.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.590
But these two species are both predators.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.910
Eating anything they can catch, kill, and
tear apart, including other gulls.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.370
How can thousands of birds each a potential
predator on the eggs and chicks of their neighbors

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.790
coexist on a 95 acre island?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.420
The answer, these birds have evolved a complex
system of social signals that keeps violence

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.020
to a minimum.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.450
The gulls use these signals to carve out and
hold small territories spaced just 4 to 5

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.530
meters apart across the rocky island.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.660
Territoriality begins when males arrive in
spring followed closely by their mate returning

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.130
to the same patch of rock they held in past
years.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.600
These experienced pairs strut about.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.620
Inspecting the site for appropriate nesting
spots and reenforcing territorial boundaries.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.900
Boundaries must be constantly defended.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.880
An interloper or neighbor approaching another's
territory is met with a series of signals

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:57.029
or displays intended to drive him away.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.560
This is a long call.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.120
In a territorial context, a long call is a
threat directed to trespassers.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.540
The mew, is also used in territorial disputes

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.020
often calling in support from a mate.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.720
The Kek Kek is used when the colony is disturbed
or in boundary disputes.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.989
The Yeow, serves these same two functions.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.760
This visual display is an Upright Posture.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.950
The Upright Posture is rigid, neck stretched
up and forward, head pointed slightly down.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.540
Wings are cocked forward and slightly off
the sides, poised to attack.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.400
Still more aggressive is the charged display.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.730
A ritualized attack that is amplified by out
stretched wings, making the charging gull

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.550
appear larger.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.860
Fights happen, in spit of the signaling system.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.440
But fights are risky as severe injury to a
parent will doom their eggs and chicks.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:42.510
Over evolutionary time, selective pressure
on individuals has favored communication over

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.520
conflict resulting in a signaling system that
reduces violence in the breeding colony.
