Friday, March the 8th, 2013. 
This Week on GOG: In case you missed it, here’s what’s new.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.200
In Realms of Chaos, a classic action game from Apogee Software,
the land of Mysteria is tormented by a magical, corruptive force

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.320
and the only heroes who can stop it are Endrick, the warrior,
and Elandra, the sorceress..

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.000
As you explore and fight your way through 26 action-packed stages,
you can switch between the characters at any time to utilize
their respective strengths and weaknesses

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.000
Beware, though: unspeakable dangers and fearsome monsters await!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.900
If you're a fan of platformers focusing on free-form exploration,
Waking Mars is a title you should definitely give a shot.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.900
In this original science fiction game you'll be jetpacking across
the Martian underworld, admiring its eerie beauty, and trying to
figure out the secret co-dependencies between its inhabitants.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Understanding this alien ecosystem and learning how to use it to
your advantage is crucial to your survival in this strange
and dangerous environment. 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.800
Original gameplay mechanics and great attention to detail
make this title well worth your while.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Blade of Darkness is a third person stabber action-adventure game,
set in a fantasy land plagued by forces of chaos.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.000
Sargon the knight, Zoe the Amazon, Tukaram the barbarian,
and Naglfar the dwarf will meet the demonic minions of Darkness
in hand to hand combat.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.000
Each character has his or her very own adventure waiting ahead,
so you can experience four different scenarios in this game

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.600
The sorceress calls upon thee, hero! Are you bold enough
to claim the mystical weapon of light and rid
the land of chaos once and for all?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There are some secrets to building a successful civilization--
and you'll be learning many of them while playing the classic
The Settlers 3: Ultimate Collection--like micromanagement. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.100
Your citizens might can't find their own backsides without
a map if it wasn't for you--their leader.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.500
With 150 unique characters that need your guidance, you're
guaranteed to satisfy the control-freak inside you.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.900
Add 100 varied structures to build and three different
nations to rule, throw in every single add-on that's been
published for this title,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.200
and there you have it: The Settlers 3: Ultimate Collection,
the perfect game for every aspiring despot--erm.
I mean: powerful and wise regent.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Next week's classic release teaches us that some in cases
a soul just cannot find rest. Any guesses what it might be?
The release, I mean. Not the reason for restless souls.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.200
