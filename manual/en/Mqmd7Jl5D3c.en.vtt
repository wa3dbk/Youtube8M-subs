Hi! I am Elise Paffrath with Breeze Thru Agility
here in Brattleboro, Vermont. I am going to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.000
be talking on behalf of Expert Village at
Expertvillage.com. I am going to be talking

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.020
about beginner agility. So as far as breed
and size, this is Scout, Scoutie sit, Good

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.530
girl! She is a mixed breed adopted from a
shelter and she weighs about 38 pounds, but

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:44.970
I have had dogs of all sizes… Scoutie down…
and all breeds and mixes. Unlike breed shows,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.979
agility welcomes all dogs whether they are
mixed breeds, whether they are big, small;

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:57.140
everything from a Yorkie to a Great Dane can
play agility. So one another thing you should

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.090
think about is “does my dog listen to me
a little bit?” Does the dog know how to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.590
sit? Does the dog stay? And mostly does the
dog enjoy doing stuff with me? In agility,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.770
responsiveness to the handler is really more
important than their athletic abilities. That

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.860
being said, I have seen a lot of dogs become
in better shape, lose weight and also become

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.430
more attentive to their handler as a result
of doing agility, so basically I welcome any

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.520
dog into my class. One thing that you might
think about is “has my dog been to new places?”

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.130
“Have they interacted with other dogs?”
But we do start beginner agility all on leash

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.020
and so mostly the dogs are near their handlers
and not are not going to be interacting with

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.800
each other, but if you take the prerequisite
obedience class, it will certainly help, Scout

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.120
is exhausted already, okay, Scout, a couple
of little things that would be good for the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.060
dog to know are sit!, a sit command, Stay!
and I am going to reward her with a little

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.879
treat for stay, also… Scoutie ready? Okay
come. Having the dog come to you is good.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.349
They don’t need to know a heel but being
able to have them sit next to you is always

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:27.459
helpful. Okay, another little plus is Scoutie
down!, Good girl… I also like to teach my

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.489
dogs a lot of tricks but you don’t need
to know too many tricks to start agility.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.799
So one other thing you might think about is
finding a good training program in your area.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.129
You can check out the Internet and often you
can call local vet’s offices and find out

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:49.560
if somebody is teaching agility, Sit! Call
them and ask them what their experience is,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.579
how long they have been teaching agility and
also go visit a class, watch a class, see

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.379
if it is something you would be comfortable
with because you want to go into a program

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.509
where you and your dog are going to get the
most out of it.
