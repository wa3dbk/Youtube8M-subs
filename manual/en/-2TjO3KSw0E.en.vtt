00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:01.924
- So check this out, it's Trevor James,

00:00:01.924 --> 00:00:04.144
and today I'm with my
local friend, Chuchu.

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:06.281
And we're at a famous
spot here in Chengdu,

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:07.114
it's Jinli.
(crowd talking)

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.724
It's a local food street
and tourist street.

00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:10.711
We are hungry,

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:14.128
and we're gonna go for some local snacks.

00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:18.390
- Okay, check it out.
- Come on.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.140
(crowd talking)

00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:22.814
- Ah.

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:28.248
- Oh.

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:32.782
(hands clap)

00:00:34.032 --> 00:00:34.865
- Okay.

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:44.239
- Okay.

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:48.836
- Ah, okay.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.440
- Good, let's try it out.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.773
(pop music)

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:01.658
- Okay.

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:04.485
- Okay.
- Ohh.

00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:06.347
- It's covered in sesame

00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:07.665
and red sugar.

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:08.498
(Chuchu laughs)

00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:09.331
Look at all that goop.

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.248
Okay, let's try it out.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.839
(Chuchu laughs)

00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:16.895
Mmm.

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:20.499
It's super sweet, the red sugar.

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.191
And a strong sesame flavor.

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:24.443
And this sticky rice, it's
made with sticky rice,

00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:26.407
so like a giant sticky rice,

00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:28.003
squishy sticky rice ball.

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.862
Actually, really nice, right?

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:31.695
- Mmm.

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:34.075
Next stop is choudoufu, stinky tofu.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:36.388
And Chuchu isn't very happy about it--

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:37.221
- No.
- but

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.113
we're gonna try it together, okay.

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:40.021
So let's try a bite choudoufu.

00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:41.213
(Trevor speaking Chinese)

00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:45.380
(people chatting)
(pop music)

00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:48.320
- Aww, no!

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:51.195
(Trevor speaking Chinese)

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:53.310
(people chatting)
(Trevor speaking Chinese)

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.738
(pop music)
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:01:55.738 --> 00:01:56.571
- Okay.

00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:58.604
Look at that.

00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:02.104
(Trevor speaking Chinese)

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:08.129
She doesn't like it.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.078
Okay, let's take a smell here.

00:02:10.078 --> 00:02:10.911
- Oh, no!

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:13.033
- It doesn't smell bad.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.642
I've smelled worse choudoufu.

00:02:14.642 --> 00:02:17.095
This one does not smell
like garbage or socks.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:17.928
- I hate you.

00:02:17.928 --> 00:02:19.196
(Trevor chuckles)

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:20.069
Oh, no.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.402
(pop music)

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:24.476
- It's good.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.309
- Come on.

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:28.755
- It's good.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:31.453
There you go.

00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:32.974
Get in there, yeah.

00:02:32.974 --> 00:02:33.807
(Chuchu groans)

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:34.640
(Trevor chuckles)

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.843
It's actually not that stinky.

00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:38.934
I would say it's more
fragrant, like durian.

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:43.101
I can see a bit of an old
rotting sock flavor in there.

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:48.899
(Chuchu groans)

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.551
But it's good.

00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:52.827
Okay, so this street is kinda
like a fake tourist street,

00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:55.327
but that's fine because the
food is actually not bad.

00:02:55.327 --> 00:02:58.300
We're going for the
world-famous dan dan mian here.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.293
- Yeah.
- We're gonna try a bite.

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:00.577
This is the dan dan noodles.

00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:02.252
You can see there's a
layer of ground pork,

00:03:02.252 --> 00:03:04.256
and chopped green onions on top.

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:07.229
And the bottom is a classic chile oil.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.062
- Oh.

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:09.019
- There's usually a little sesame.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.189
This one I'm a little hesitant,

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.827
'cause there's no peanuts.

00:03:11.827 --> 00:03:13.295
And I'm a huge peanut guy.

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:14.851
But you just gotta mix it up.

00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:15.684
- Oh.

00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:16.584
- That's the most important part.

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:17.417
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:18.525
Oh, it's fragrant.

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:20.258
Look at that oil.

00:03:20.258 --> 00:03:21.405
(crowd talking)

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:22.722
And there's this ya tai.

00:03:22.722 --> 00:03:23.625
Usually there's a little ya tai,

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:24.995
so it's a little ...

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:26.308
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:03:26.308 --> 00:03:29.422
A little sour pickled vegetables.

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:31.181
- Okay.
(Chuchu laughs)

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.195
(Trevor chuckles)
There we go.

00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:36.486
- Mmm, that's good.

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:39.153
(Crowd talking)

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:41.781
- Mmm, it's like the
perfect mix of flavor.

00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:44.083
It's spicy, it's fragrant,

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:47.930
it's oily, and it's a little
numbing at the same time.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.398
Also a little sour from the ya tai.

00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:52.898
(Trevor speaking Chinese)

00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:55.059
Yeah, very fulfilling.

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.892
It's not bad, but I like it

00:03:55.892 --> 00:03:57.874
with a little peanuts, to be honest.

00:03:57.874 --> 00:03:59.902
I've had better.

00:03:59.902 --> 00:04:01.369
- Mmm (speaking Chinese).

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.202
- It's good though, right?

00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:03.747
(Trevor speaking Chinese)

00:04:03.747 --> 00:04:05.540
We're ordering zhajiangmian,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.209
which it literally means, one noodle.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.492
(Man speaking Chinese)

00:04:11.492 --> 00:04:13.780
(Woman speaking Chinese)

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.101
Take a look.

00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:16.417
Okay, so it's soaked in a ton of chiles--

00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:17.589
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.579
and (speaking Chinese).

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.437
So it's soaked in a lot
of chiles ... cilantro.

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:25.553
Oh, there's some beef in there.

00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:26.785
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:28.187
It's hot.

00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:29.486
(pop music)

00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:32.844
(people speaking Chinese)

00:04:32.844 --> 00:04:33.828
(Man loudly speaking Chinese)

00:04:33.828 --> 00:04:34.661
Mmm, mmm.

00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.477
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.412
It's just like a classic beef noodle soup.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:40.245
A little spicy--

00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:41.078
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:04:41.078 --> 00:04:41.911
And a nice cilantro flavor.

00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:44.370
Check this, there's a knot in the end.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.203
See ...

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:47.286
She's gonna eat the knot.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.210
It's good?

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.043
- Yeah.

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:57.472
(Man loudly speaking Chinese)

00:04:57.472 --> 00:04:59.096
Oh, it's nice.

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:01.007
(Woman speaking Chinese)

00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:01.840
(Man speaking Chinese)

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.673
(Trevor speaking Chinese)

00:05:02.673 --> 00:05:04.312
Okay.

00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:06.062
Just like a pork rib.

00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:08.305
Smoky flavor, smoky smell.

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:12.063
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:05:12.063 --> 00:05:13.146
- Yeah, yeah.

00:05:16.923 --> 00:05:18.460
Actually, I'm gonna give
this to my camera guy,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.377
he's tired.

00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:27.006
(Trevor laughing)

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:29.756
(people talking)

00:05:32.393 --> 00:05:35.060
(lips smacking)

00:05:35.923 --> 00:05:37.340
- So what's this?

00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:42.592
- Oh, okay (claps hands).

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:43.425
So ...

00:05:48.768 --> 00:05:49.601
- Okay.

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.029
Okay, so you can see the outer chile ...

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.862
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:05:54.862 --> 00:05:56.695
The chile skin, uh ...

00:05:58.368 --> 00:05:59.669
- It's really oily.

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:00.941
Looks like a rice flour ...

00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:01.774
Sorry--
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:03.561
It's like a sticky rice with sesame.

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:04.894
Let's go for it.

00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:07.810
(pop music)

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.532
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

00:06:09.532 --> 00:06:10.365
- Good stuff.

00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:12.488
Yeah, it's super spicy and crunchy.

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:15.100
And like a strong sesame flavor.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.009
A little peanuty.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.133
Yeah, it's very, very peanuty as well.

00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:19.647
(Chuchu speaking Chinese)

00:06:19.647 --> 00:06:20.480
(crunching)

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.055
Yeah, 'cause its peanuts in there,

00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:24.400
and that flavor is infused throughout.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.017
Okay (hands clap), so thank
you so much for watching

00:06:26.017 --> 00:06:27.293
these food and travel videos.

00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:28.126
(Man singing in Chinese)

00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:29.251
Today I'm so thankful to have Chuchu here

00:06:29.251 --> 00:06:31.519
by my side to eat all
this delicious food with.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.651
We're successful.

00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:34.191

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.667
