00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.450
Another very basic and very important maneuver
is the ability to get your front wheel of

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.610
the ground. This helps you know if you have
to get over something like this root here

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.390
or you know something more complex like a
aactual bunny hop which is where you pick

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.590
up the entire bike. So the easiest way to
figure out how to execute this maneuver it

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.680
helps if you lower your seat. I have my seat
at full high right now which works fine for

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.030
me cause I'm use to riding with it but most
people when they are doing hard things they

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.200
want to lower there seat. Some bike have a
quick lever like this which is just like a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.240
lever you have to hold your wheels on so you
loosen it and lower my seat a little bit so

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:54.960
I got more room to play with and now you know
I'm going to get on the bike and get ready

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.440
to get my front wheel off the ground. So it
helps if I'm in a easier gear but if we are

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.750
just going to focus on doing you know in place
just pretend I'm riding in low speed and I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.430
just pull up my front wheel. So I do it by
bringing my weight back and pulling on the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:24.470
front wheel with my arms. So if I put my bike
in a easier gear like I'm doing now I should

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:33.159
be able to ride a wheelie for a little bit
of time. So I'm in my easy gear, I have lowered

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.700
my seat a little bit, I'm going to be ready
to ditch myself up off of the bike just encase

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.369
if I go over cause there is a balance point
where you front wheel like to be at and I'm

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.680
going to cover the back brakes so I can bring
my front wheel down if I have to. So that

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:59.329
is you know the basic concept of how you can
get your wheelie up just with gearing so if

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:07.399
you apply both the weight shift and the paddle
to the wheelie it is you know a pretty minimally

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.849
tasking way to get your wheel off the ground
which is a center component in the most advance

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:26.480
technical maneuvers. So it allows me to miss
around a little bit, go down the hill and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.569
just have a good time.
