Hi everyone ! 

00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:10.963
Xavier for Xm STudio and today,

00:00:10.963 --> 00:00:12.660
it's my pleasure to do two unboxings :

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
of two microphones, small mics...

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.660
portable, with a hot shoe support, 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.660
design to be used on a DSLR (or equivalent)

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660
but eventually also with small camcorders

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.220
for anyone who wants a better sound quality.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.696
We're talking about the brand Boya, 

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:25.954
I di'nt knew so far, 

00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:28.634
The Boya BYWM100S

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:30.500
SO, 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.440
We open it right the way, 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.880
cardboard box, everything within foam...

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 In the end, offering a good protection, even if it's quite simple...

00:00:44.364 --> 00:00:46.364
We immediatly have a sort of a manual

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.214
It's more like a flyer, 

00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:50.772
it's a nice paper though... 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
they show you how to place the batteries.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920
this one uses two AAA batteries, 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.780
And in the back, we have a small drawing of the mic 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.940
and more importantly, the frequence response curve, 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.380
and the audio capture pattern. 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.320
Now the cotent so to say of the box :

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.034
there is the hot shoe support, 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060
I find it quite good, cause quite compact

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.980
and because it also has a 1/4 screw port

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.620
so you could use it as well on a hot shoe

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.731
classic, 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.400
but also if you have a tripod : you can screw it on.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.180
and adjust it as needed, 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.060
either on a small tripod, to have it on a set or report... 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.829
you also have the cable : 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.380
mini jack to mini jack (3.5mm)

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.360
that can be handy as well if you wanna replace it or buy a longer on

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.610
and finally the mic itself.

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:50.862
that I find quite elegant, 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.120
the name is writtent on top, 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.100
it 's quite elegant, 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.160
and rather small : watch compared to my hand ...

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.500
It's quite lightweight in the end,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.360
the external ody is in aluminium, 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.660
even if the inner body is in plastic, 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.480
but the protection is made of alu...

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:17.426
you can find in the back : 

00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:18.660
the mini jack output

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:21.204
the low-cut button

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:22.915
and the on-off button

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040
and I guess a small led that indiquate

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.860
weather if it is on or not, 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.280
so a very simple packaging

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520
but quite efficient in the end. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.540
Well that's it for the unboxing of those Boya mics, 300PS and VM100S

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160
This one is definitelly my favourite,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.300
he'll compete with the Audio-technica Pro-24CM

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.500
and maybe with the 6250, even if the audio is les good...

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.720
But it's a good small portable mic, this other one more broadcast 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.540
And that's it, it'll all depend on the price they'll cost...

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.700
I also would like to thank Digistore for lending me those two mics

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.641
as well as the videomic for the test

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.960
and see you soon on xm-studio.com

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.540
for more tuto, tips reviews and more

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.385
bye !
