[ chatter ]

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:13.246
The pumpkin is my friend.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Hi! 
How ya doing?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.456
Very good!  Got coffee, so... we're gonna make it.

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:28.236
Hi!

00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:30.564
How are you guys doing?  
Good ---

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:33.564
It's wet -- [ laughter ]

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.433
Whoo!  Happy graduation, University of Rochester!

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.805
Wringing out the hoods.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.842
I am so excellent right now.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.913
She's like famous.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:50.181
I'm famous! Guys, I'm graduating and I'm famous!

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:53.386
Whooo!

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:56.954
I was thinking on the top button. 
Why?  --Oh!

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.524
[ carillon bells ]

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.129
OK? It's just on the rope from the outside.

[ band music ]

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.009
Don't fall!

00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:24.383
Hi!

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:27.752
Happy graduation!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.991
We're very, very proud of you. You're a great class.

00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:33.660
Another great class graduating from a great university.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.660
Fifty years ago - in fact more than 50 years ago -

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:39.000
I saw where you sat.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.500
I was part of the class of 1958.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.668
We were better than good and better than great.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.273
I don't exactly remember  what the chairman said

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:50.876
but since I put my fifty years in,

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:53.114
and I've collected a lot of advice along the way,

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:54.114
some very good mentors, 

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.281
I'm going to give you the formula for life.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.000
It comes in four parts:

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:02.185
Find partners, find passion, find rules, and find a dream.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.500
That's my little piece of advice this morning, 

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.592
on a non- ahem - cooperative morning.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.296
All right!

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.500
There has never been

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.568
an unhappy graduation,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.500
rain or shine! We are here to graduate

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.785
a great class!

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:23.574
[ cheers ]

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.000
I've had a blast this year, and I'd like to thank my

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.880
peers for giving me the honor of serving as your class president.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm proud to know all of you, and it's my pleasure to address you today.

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:36.187
This moment means a little bit more to me than you'll ever know,

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:39.423
so please excuse me if I take a picture with my iPhone.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.100
if all of you can just smile a bit, 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.130
and yes, I did get all of you text messages right now.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.900
so one... two... 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.940
three.  Thank you. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.278
You heard a little bit about David Kearns earlier, 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.779
he was a predecessor of mine,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.600
 and he was a distinguished alumni of this university.  

00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:06.000
and a board member, etc, etc.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.185
He would say the following thing to me all the time, and it hangs on my wall.

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:12.723
It says, "Don't do anything that wouldn't make your mother proud."

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.194
All right!

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:19.496
Snap quiz! Greatest film musical comedy of all time?

00:03:20.368 --> 00:03:22.368
Why, the answer of course is "Singing in the Rain."

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.100
And now, I'm going to ask

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.109
those in power to do so, to join us as we all rise

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:36.113
and sing our alma mater "The Genesee."

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.200
As flows the river gath'ring force

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.254
Along her steadfast way, 

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:49.226
May we along life's devious course 

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:53.297
Grow stronger day by day. 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.969
And may our hearts, where'er we roam,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.340
Forever loyal be 

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:11.148
To our beloved college home 

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.988
Beside the Genesee.

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:24.027
Whoo!  [ cheers ]

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.500
As we conclude 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.500
this part of the commencement festivities,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.000
Let me highlight the brunches, receptions and diploma ceremonies

00:04:31.018 --> 00:04:33.018
that will continue into the afternoon

00:04:35.476 --> 00:04:37.200
ALL of them, all of them

00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:39.278
have one thing in common:

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.247
they are all indoors!

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.685
Class of 2011, one more time,

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.685
