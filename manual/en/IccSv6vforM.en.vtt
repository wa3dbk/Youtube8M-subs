00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.080
There is nowhere better to be right now than Brazil, with the World Cup and the Olympics coming up!

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.080
So we're going to show you some amazing street food in the form of coxinhas and salsa.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.860
These amazing brazilian street food snacks need a filling,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.699
a pastry, breadcrumbs and then frying.
Ah ha.
Plus we're going to serve it with a salsa.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.939
We'll start with the filling though.
Now, I've got two chicken breasts.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.599
Yes.
I bought a whole chicken, I took the carcass and I made a chicken stock.

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.539
Out of a carrot, an onion, some bay leaves, some peppercorns. 
Then strain the stock and reduced it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.500
right down. And that's what I've got in here.
So you got rid of the thighs?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.250
Well I used them for something else. 
But the whole dish is based around thighs?

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.820
Coxinhas, if you translate it, it means "little
thigh" because it looks like thighs.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.530
But we're making our own thighs instead?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.640
We're making our own thighs out of breast meat, but that's kind of where this dish started.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.550
This is our chicken stock and they need to just gently simmer and poach.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.829
Next up, the pastry. 
Now this is a very unique pastry that I hadn't heard of before

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:54.410
this dish.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.149
Okay. 
Because what you have in 250 ml of chicken stock.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.010
Quite a strong, concentrated chicken stock, 
a generous pinch of salt

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.060
and then 250 grams of flour. 
You stir that until you end up with a smooth

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.890
pastry.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.900
Eventually, it comes together into one dough.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.939
So these things kind of remind me mind of...
well the Italians have

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.020
arancini balls. 
Yep. 
The english, we have scotch eggs.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.259
So anything that is breaded and fried. 
Yeah.
Little snacks.

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.909
Some of the best street food around.
Albeit it's quite hard work,

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.650
you'll come together with something you can
mould later on.
Is that done?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.939
Errr... yeah. Pretty much. 
When I first made this I wasn't entirely sure what I was aiming for

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.540
and I thought it might be a little bit wrong.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.829
You do now? 
But you're looking for a really stiff thing

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.000
that eventually you can kind of take when it's cold enough you can mould into a pastry

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
that you can then put a filing into it. 
When you say it's cold enough?

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.030
Well not yet! 
I forget you haven't got normal fingers.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.329
No. 
We'll leave that to cool down for a little bit and come back to it shortly.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.390
But we can carry on with all all the rest of our filling, which is

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.240
plenty of... 
Did you just try and eat that?
I did.
It's definitely raw flour!

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.350
So corianader. Get rid of some of the stalks if
you can chop all of that up

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.410
that'd be great and here I've got cream cheese. 
This is just regular, full-fat cream

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.989
cheese

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.290
squeeze in the lime and then add your
chopped coriander. Salt and pepper

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.720
into the cheese and when I got here is
some

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.450
chicken breast that we poached off earlier.
Exactly the same as this, just 15 minutes further on.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.670
More for later.
And cooled down so that we can do this with it.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.940
Which is just rip it up. 
And you kind of want all chicken

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.430
and that will then mix into our cream cheese.
So our cream cheese with the lime

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.670
and the cilantro (or coriander). 
The cream cheese and the lime help to make our

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.120
chicken breast, 
which is already succulent because we poached it,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.680
really succulent as we try to replicate thigh meat.
Is that traditional?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.599
I think so. From what I've read you
can add loads of other stuff to it.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.569
We had one in a restaurant the other day
with smoked paprika.
We did.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.550
Was that traditional?
Who knows. What would you put in yours? 
So next up, we can begin to shape them

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.090
with our pastry. 
So grab yourself some of this and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.730
roll it out nice and flat. 
I'm done, well ahead of you.
Yeah, it needs to be a bit thinner than that but you are well

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.060
ahead of me. That's true enough.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.480
Now this is the bit where you have to turn it into its very traditional

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.709
style and shape.
Yes, so they resemble...
a teardrop?

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.319
...well they are tear drop shaped. But they resemble chicken thighs.
Oh, okay.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.680
Well I've heard a different story then.
What's your story? 
Well my story came from the community.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.430
Okay. 
They said they're in the shape of a teardrop

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.920
because it's the way it makes you feel. 
It makes you want to cry it's so good.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.349
Oh good. Tears of joy. 
I hope so.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.959
So once you've rolled it out as thin as you possibly can, place

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.920
sort of a teaspoon into the middle. 
And then you want to fold it up and around that,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.959
and the important thing

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.170
is don't let the filling touch the
outside. Because that's when later on when you

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.750
fry it, it'll explode if any is leaking. 
And then, this is fiddly

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.760
but basically bring your edges up, a bit
like

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.930
if it was Chinese cuisine it'd look a bit like a wonton

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.409
or something like that, or a dumpling.
Then this is similar,

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.060
but a brazilian version.
As soon as you finish shaping them, you can then take them

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.689
dunk them into beaten egg and then breadcrumbs. 
The breadcrumbs stick

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.709
and then they'll be ready for our fryer.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.650
So they've gone into the fryer and need
three or four minutes

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.750
at 160 degrees celsius. 
So what's next? 
Salsa.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.650
Of course, a classic Brazilian... 
dance.
No, that's samba isn't it?

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.239
But basically it's a very very simple salsa to
dip with our coxinhas.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.030
Which is amazing street food. 
What are you chuckling at?
Just made me giggle that did.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.020
So tomatoes, on the vine.
Do you do the Samba?
Mmmmmmmm...

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.889
What's the difference between salsa and samba. 
Well I used to do evening
classes... but it went very wrong!

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.150
Less about the samba, more about the salsa as we've got peppers, tomatoes.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.280
I'm only going to go with half of this onion, as raw onion is quite strong.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.410
1 clove of garlic, a generous pinch of salt and pepper,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.419
a pinch of sugar which really just helps the tomatoes

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.900
and...
I'm nearly crying from those. 
You getting emotional?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.400
And a good handful of fresh cilantro,
a little bit of

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.979
vinegar, a little bit of oil. 
Sounds like there's a lot going into this but the work is really easy

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.050
because the machine does it all.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.050
Clamp it on and blend it up, about 30 seconds is all you need because you want it quite chunky.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.700
Transfer that into our bowl. Our coxinhas can come out of the 
fryer now.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.940
Now, if you haven't heard of this before, you would have heard of football.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.680
Football in Brazil is the biggest thing
out. Come on, it's bigger than food!

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.010
One of their biggest exports after sugar
cane... or Samba.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.270
Ha. Best footballer of all time?

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.440
Errrr... PelÃ©? 
Is he the only Brazilian you know?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.720
Go on, give me another one.
Errrr... probably. That's it. That Ronaldo bloke?

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.720
Ben-aldo. Basildinio.
That's it. I'm out!

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.620
Right, enough about football, have you tried that salsa? 
No.
So simple,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.150
take seconds, unbelievable. 
That sugar makes so much difference!
It just lifts the whole thing.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.250
And look at these... crispy and beautifully

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.240
golden. 
There we go, our take on little thighs, or chicken coxinhas.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.960
If you'd have done anything slightly differently, please let us know by commenting down below.
Sorted!

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.849
 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.259
Finger food at its best! 
All of that amazing filling inside.
Oh yeah!

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.069
And that salsa is unbelievable
Just so simple as well.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.490
Brazil... thank you! You have produced some of the most incredible things

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.969
in the world and this is definitely second best
after Ronaldo.
Who?
