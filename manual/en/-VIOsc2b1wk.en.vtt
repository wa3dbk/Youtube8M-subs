00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.929
Hi! I am Michael Webb on behalf of Expert
Village.com. Right now we are going to make

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.689
the flower for the stem that we just made.
Now you want to go ahead and start off by

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.810
folding it across diagonally. This is just
going to give you sort of a reference line

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.620
in your crease and you are going to open that
back up. You are going to take your top edge

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:42.820
and you are going to fold it down until this
side meets your crease; and you want to crease

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:53.910
that and you are going to do the same with
your bottom.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.670
Now that you have those two reference creases,
go ahead and open it back up and turn it around

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.100
so that you got the edges facing you; and
you are going to bring this point up to where

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:13.110
it meets this point, so that you have basically
a little white showing on both of the edges.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.619
Go ahead and crease that and you are going
to fold until these two white edges meet each

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:31.090
other and that makes a symmetrical pattern.
Now you want to flip the whole thing upside

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:40.470
down and open up just your bottom petals right
there and bring them up to the top so that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.950
the inner section of these two comes just
right underneath that point; and your going

00:01:48.950 --> 00:02:00.790
to flip it over and just do the same with
that and bring it a little lower, so that

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.860
you can see there you have got five points.
Now flip it over again and take your edges

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:22.390
here and bring them up, until you have a point
down on the bottom of your flower.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:32.750
Now taking a pair of scissors you are going
to want to just cut that bottom piece off;

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:47.230
and you can kind of use one edge of your scissors
here and open it up a bit;

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.530
and then you are going to take the stem that
we just made and you are just going to insert

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:03.670
it right into that flower.
There you have a stem and a flower.
