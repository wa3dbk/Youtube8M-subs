00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.660
And eh... I designed a logo.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.200
The 'k' in Kicks is a little foot.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.760
Sounds wonderful.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.100
I can't thank you enough for taking the time to do this.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.380
Oh, you know. Anything for the kids.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.800
You're such a good father.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.220
It's a shame that Judith didn't appreciate you.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, you know, she just needed a little time to sort things out, but eh...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Yeah.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.080
It's a shame.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.260
Look at you!

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.000
A succesful chiropractor, intelligent, dedicated...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880
Ah, you're embarrassing me.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.520
I'm sorry.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.080
Let's get back to your...

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.040
Little logo.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.400
Ahw.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.180
What's wrong?

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.740
Oh, nothing.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.700
It's my neck.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.320
I must have slept wrong.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.200
Well, why don't you make an appointment with my office and we'll see if we can fix that.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.260
Oh, no. I'd feel funny.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.260
We know each other.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680
Don't be silly, it's what I do.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.840
You know what? Turn around. Turn around. Go ahead.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.680
Are you getting enough calcium?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.360
I guess.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.560
It's really important for a woman your age.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.060
Osteoporosis is a real problem.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.500
Curvature of the spine.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.800
Last thing you want is to wind up with a hump.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.380
Knocky, knocky.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.140
Oh! Well, I hope you didn't start without me.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.080
Truthfully, I think that my ex was intimidated by my...

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.060
sexual...

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.440
I don't even know, how to say it...

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.520
Appetite.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.260
Hm.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.340
So we're agreed we'll set aside six inches for the editorial column?

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.260
Oh, I'm sorry. Eh, yes! Six inches.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.720
I don't know how I got so off-topic.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.680
I know exactly how you got off-topic.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.080
Okay, I think the next piece of business is to decide on the paper color.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.360
I brought some samples. We've got goldenrod, salmon, mustard...

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.340
You had me at goldenrod.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.060
Oh, everybody has you at goldenrod.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.300
Well, look at the time.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.680
Maybe we should get going.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.100
Give Gloria a chance for a little quiet time before her many, many kids come home.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.620
I don't need any quiet time.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.800
Don't be silly. Alan, would you mind driving me home? I'm feeling a little tipsy.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.060
A little tipsy? How about a little obvious?

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.280
I'm sorry?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.900
Can I talk to you for a minute?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.260
Eh, you know, it is getting a little late...

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.020
Sit down!

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.760
We'll be right back.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.260
I think she's going through the change.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.940
What do you think you're doing?

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.060
What? He's in play. I'm playing.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.400
I'm the one who told you he's in play.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.280
Oh, please. I told you two years ago that marriage was toast.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.720
So what?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.420
He's in my house on Taekwondo Wednesday and I don't have time to mess around with you.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.360
Well, why don't we just let him decide?

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.460
Let him decide?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.700
He still thinks we're doing a soccer newsletter.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.060
You don't even like him, do you?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.160
He's okay.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.100
He's here and it's Wednesday.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.660
Well, I happen to think he's hot.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.660
You wouldn't even know what to do with a hot guy.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.900
Oh yeah? Watch me.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.720
Great.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.220
You broke him.
