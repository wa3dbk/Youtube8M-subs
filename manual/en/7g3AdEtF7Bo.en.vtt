00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.560
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to replace your engines

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.559
timing belt and water pump. In this step,
we're going to talk about the proper method

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.120
for reinstalling your vehicles harmonic balancer.
What I have here in my hands, is the harmonic

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.570
balancer. Now it's made in three pieces. What
you have is the inner cast iron piece, that's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.230
this chunk right here, a layer of rubber,
which is this piece right here, it runs all

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.410
the way around, and the outer portion, which
is going to be the pulley for all of your

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.040
belts. Now the reason why they call it a harmonic
balancer, is this rubber inside here, deadens

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.110
the vibration on your crank shaft. It makes
a harmonic vibration, just when the engine

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.280
runs, similar to rubbing your finger around
the edge of a wine glass. Now without this

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.600
balancer on there, it will eventually shatter
the harden steel crank shaft, just like breaking

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.350
a wine glass. How you install one of these,
you're going to want to take and pay attention

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.960
if there's a key way. You'll notice there'll
be an index inside here, and there'll be a

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.770
corresponding index on the crack shaft itself.
There either is, or there isn't, there's no

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.930
half way. This one doesn't have one, so this
one just slips on anyway you want, it's going

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.730
to go on just like this. You're going to want
to pay particular attention, make sure to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.070
put it on the right way, because they're extremely
tough to pull off. You're going to want to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.180
take a look at it. As you can see here, you
can see the tooth marks embedded in the iron

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.350
from the gripping teeth, on our washer, that's
going to indicate that this is the outside

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.560
of the pulley. What we're going to do, is
take and line it up, on the end of the crank

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.380
shaft. I'm going to hold it steady, just like
so, and just get it started by tapping on

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.210
it with a rubber mallet. Now you're not supposed
to beat these very hard with a steel mallet.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.420
One thing you'll do is mushroom the end, and
make it difficult for your bolt to go through.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.830
The other thing you're doing, is, you're going
to be jamming the crank shaft, which is not

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.670
a good idea, it's very tough on the bearings
and it can be tough on the transmission as

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.820
well, because you'll be jamming the bearings
inside the transmission. You're just going

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.560
to take your rubber mallet, and give it a
couple of taps, just to get it started. We're

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:26.720
going to actually use the bolt to pull it
down tight. Once you have your harmonic balancer

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.140
tapped on, just enough to get a couple of
threads started. What I mean by a couple of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.870
threads, is about that much of the bolt. We're
going to need enough to grip it strong enough,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.751
to pull it down. But you're not going to want
to beat your harmonic balancer on. The one

00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:45.430
thing you're going to want to avoid, is getting
that balancer jammed on there crooked, you'll

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.341
never get it off, or get it on right, for
that matter. What you're going to see is,

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:54.310
have it on there; I got about a quarter inch
of threads, which is enough to get me enough

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.420
grip, to pull that harmonic balancer down.
Now your engine is designed to rotate, and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.610
it's going to want to turn, instead of pull
this balancer down. I'm going to take and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.220
hold onto the pulley with my hand, and just
crank it down. You may have to use a small

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.209
pry bar, just take, and insert it in here,
to hold it steady. Make sure to not pry against

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:37.340
anything plastic, or anything that may break,
while you're tightening down your harmonic

00:03:37.340 --> 00:04:00.709
balancer. Alright, and there you go. That
is the proper service procedure for installing

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:01.770
your harmonic balancer.
