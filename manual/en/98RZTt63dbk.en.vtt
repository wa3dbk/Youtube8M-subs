00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.600
These are the materials we'll be using to
make our heavy duty recycled jeans tote. You'll

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.470
need two pairs of jeans that are about the
same size. You'll need a good sharp pair of

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.100
scissors, some pins, and some heavy needles
for your sewing machine - whatever needles

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.080
that your machine takes - these are a jeans
and denim needle. Okay, we'll start by preparing

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.379
our jeans. You're going to prepare both pairs
of jeans the same way. First you want to choose

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.179
the length - how deep you want your tote to
be. So, I'm going to cut it about here, and

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:52.050
cut straight across the leg. And then if you
just fold it over and cut across the second

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:04.640
leg. Okay, save those extra leg sections for
the straps, and open that up, and we're going

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:15.260
to cut open the crotch area. So, just cut
right along the inseam to cut that apart,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:27.050
right along the inseam. And then we'll turn
the jeans inside out, and we'll pin and trim

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:44.180
to close the section up. So, turn your jeans
inside out.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:53.630
Okay, and lay them flat, and we'll just pin
the leg section together. And put the pins

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.270
exactly where you want to sew it, so that
you can see how it's going to lay. So, if

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:14.180
you put the pins going right along the seam
that you want to sew. And that way, you can

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.340
open it up and check it and make sure that
it looks neat. I think that's good. Here I'm

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:30.719
going to pin it a little bit more there. And
then turn it over and pin the back section

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.569
the same way. You could take a look at what
your seam is going to look like, going like

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.959
this. It's a little bit bunchy here, so I
want to open that up again, and re-pin it

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:58.939
until I like the way it looks. We'll turn
it over, okay that's better. You're not going

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:05.799
to get it 100% perfectly flat here. So, I
think that'll be fine if we press it, that'll

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.359
look fine, and that's a nice straight seam.
And then you want to do the same thing for

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:21.609
the back section. Okay, this is probably...the
best way to pin this is to lay it flat this

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:33.469
way. And, following the seam line down, just
put your pins in a continuous line. You have

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:51.279
a seam line right here, we'll just continue
down. Okay, and before you sew it, you want

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:59.959
to turn it again and make sure that you like
the way it's pinned, because that will be

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.969
the way it will be sewed. So, you can just
check it out, and then re-pin it if you're

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:15.450
not happy with your pinning job. But, it should
be like that, pretty flat. And, you're always

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.760
going to have a little bit of a pinch or a
bulk there, but that's fine.
