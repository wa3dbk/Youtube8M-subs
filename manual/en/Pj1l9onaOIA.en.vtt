00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.340
Knock Knock!

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.320
I'm Mr. Kate!

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.800
I'm here! I'll take a look at your place. Oh hi!

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.880
I'll drop for awhile "Mr. Kate!" I'll help you find your style. "Mr.Kate!"

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.760
We'll laugh, we'll paint

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.920
I'm Mr. Kate!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.100
Yeah!

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.840
Hi Threadbangers! Mr. Kate here I am so happy to be doing another how to video for you guys.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.240
And today, I'm gonna do something really fun and easy to accent your shelves.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.500
I'm always on the lookout for fun DIY decor pieces for your home.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.680
And I think that using these on a little pedestal and some paint is gonna make something really cool

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.400
for my shelf and your shelf!

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.180
So let's get started!

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.280
All you need for this DIY is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.480
coral, from your local pet store or I'm sure you could buy this online too.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.540
It's made out of plastic.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.080
It looks pretty real.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.720
For the pedastals I'm gonna use old candle containers.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.440
I've since enjoyed these beautiful aroma therapy candles.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.800
They're all gone and I'm gonna use these as a pedestal for my decor piece.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.420
And then the final thing, most important, to make it look totally new and different

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.940
is some spray paint.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.440
So I'm gonna go outside and get my spray paint on.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.340
Let's go!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.060
Now I'm just gonna wait, uh, oh, dries in fifteen minutes, fifteen minutes.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.180
And then I'll display them on my shelves.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.980
I just turned my home into a coral exhibit.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.320
Beautiful and easy

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.060
Thank you Threadbangers for watching I'm Mr. Kate, and i'll see you next time.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.000
Mr. Kate!
