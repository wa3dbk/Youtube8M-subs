00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.740
In today's tutorial I'm going to show you
how to install Magic Thumb in Magento.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.530
You can see the product image currently looks
flat on my page.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.510
So I want to change that from this to this.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.260
The image comes to life by having an enlarged
effect and being able to move between product

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.990
images without going back to my thumbnails.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.070
To get this effect we need to go to the Magic
Toolbox website.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.810
If you go to the Magic Thumb product page,
you'll see the Magento icon on the right hand

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.620
side which will take you to the Magic Thumb
for Magento page.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.800
Click the download button and save the zip
file to your computer.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.340
Extract all the files.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.039
And the magic thumb folder is what we'll upload
to our server.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.680
I'm going to use FileZilla for this.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.040
Find the magic thumb folder on your computer
and upload it to the Magento directory on

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.679
your server.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.530
This will take a few minutes so pause the
video here and start again once your folder

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.960
has uploaded.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.729
My files have now finished uploading and you
can see my magic thumb folder is showing here.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.600
Next we need to disable the compilation process.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.260
We can do this by going to System, Tools,
Compilation.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.790
You can see my compiler status is Enabled
so I need to disable it.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.880
Next we're going to install Magic Thumb.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.390
To do this enter your Magento website url
and after it enter magic thumb.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.579
You'll be taken to this page and all you have
to do is click Install.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.740
Now go back to the Compilation page we were
just on and this time click Run Compilation

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.740
Process.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.590
Of course, if you don't use the Magento compiler
then you don't need to do this step.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.570
Next we need to clear the cache.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.780
Go to Cache Management.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.700
Select all.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.149
Make sure the Action says Refresh and click
Submit.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.239
Magic Thumb is now installed.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.849
If you refresh your product page you'll see
it in action.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.000
Remember to only upload large images as they'll
be used for the enlarged effect.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Magento will automatically resize the large
images to fit other areas of your website.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.560
Now that Magic Thumb is installed let's make
a few changes.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.980
First we'll change the enlarge effect.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.390
We'll also change the caption at the bottom
of the image.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.500
And finally we'll add a background color around
the enlarged image.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.890
To do this, go to the Magic Thumb settings
page.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.900
Scroll down to the Effects section.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.769
Change the expanding effect from Linear to
Bounce and also change the restoring effect

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.000
from Linear to Bounce.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.840
Under Title and Caption you can see Show Caption
is marked Yes.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.810
The Caption source is currently set to Title,
I'm going to change this to Short Description.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.489
I'll change the Background Opacity from nought
to thirty.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.760
And the background color is defaulted to black.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.060
I'm going to change this to red.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.050
So if we fresh our product page you can see
the expand effect now has a bounce.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.989
The caption has changed so it's now pulling
in my short description and the enlarged background

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.220
color is red.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.959
There's so many simple customizations you
can make which look really effective.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:52.040
Try all the options on the Settings page and
see what works best for your Magento website.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.970
As well as adding Magic Thumb to your product
pages, you can also add it to your CMS pages.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.560
You can see on the Settings page Magic Thumb
is automatically activated.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.270
If you want Magic Thumb to work on the Category
select Yes here.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.890
But for Magic Thumb to work on your CMS pages
select the Include Headers on all Pages option.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.930
This will bring in the CSS and JS files to
your CMS pages.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.570
You can see at the moment my home page is
blank.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.720
To change this go to CMS, Pages.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.660
Select the page you want.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.840
Choose Content and select the HTML icon.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.020
This will open a HTML window.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.420
Next, go to the Magic Thumb Integration page.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.790
Under point four of the Install section, copy
the code shown and paste it into your HTML

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.790
window.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.830
The href reference is the large image which
will be your enlarge effect.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.850
We have the Magic Thumb class and the image
source is the small image which will appear

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.950
on your web page.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.230
So I'm just going to enter my large and small
image references.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.070
The click Update and save your page.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.610
Now if we refresh our home page you can see
Magic Thumb is now working.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.020
At the top of each page on our website is
a Contact Us link.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.910
So if you have any questions about any of
our tools, just get in touch.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.800
If we're not online when you send your message
through, we'll get back to you the very next

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800
day.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.800
And that brings us to the end of this tutorial.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.880
Thanks for watching.
