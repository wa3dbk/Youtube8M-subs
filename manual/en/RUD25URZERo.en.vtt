00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.200
(music)

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.139
We have a process where every 20 years we renovate campuses to bring them up to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.270
code, bigger class sizes and make them
equal to the other schools. Summer's really

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.750
a good opportunity when no one's there
to get a lot of things done that you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.380
can't get done during the school year.
You have a short window when you don't

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.210
have students and teachers at the
campuses. We kick off as soon as we can.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.440
We're usually at a campus, especially a campus like this one, the day after school's out

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.000
and with a demolition crew.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
(music) (construction noises)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.500
Summers are very intense. I mean the schedule we have

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.219
basically 10 weeks to complete our
schedule to let the kids come back to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.050
school. During that 10 weeks we spend two weeks gutting the school completely.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.210
We're running right now from a 160 guys to 180 guys on this job

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.310
site. We are working seven days a week. We have crews coming in at all times of the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.480
day. The heat just staggering for a lot
of the guys working up on the roof.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.700
Bigger bite of the school if you will
and less time to do it in.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:02:06.100
(music) (construction noises)

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.840
The school is just over 60,000 square
feet and when we walk away we'll be

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.350
right around 90,000 square feet. So it's
gonna be a pretty big school. School

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.790
districts by and large finance their
capital needs their facility

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.990
construction and major renovation
through selling bonds. Very much like a

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.100
homeowner taking out a home improvement loan or taking out a mortgage; you borrow

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.030
money for that capital improvement than
you pay it back over time. Our most

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.670
recent bond program was approved by the voters in May of 2008. Initially planned

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.600
to cover the next four years which kind
of historically is what the school

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.990
districts done. The district should be
proud of the fact that we were able to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.360
double the length of the life of bonds.
We manage the money and we see exactly

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.060
each and every day where every penny of
district money is spent. They have to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.840
invest that money into those buildings
in order for them to be able to have a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.490
good learning environment for the kids.
Every year we go through every school in

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.320
the district and paint all the hallways,
every campus throughout the district

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.190
which is a pretty big feat. I'm Mary Bond
and I'm the Lead Cook at Williams

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.410
High School and I've been doing it for you know like 31 years now so

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.100
and I'm sticking with it. Well I've
worked through the painting department

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.360
for 21 years and I've only missed one
week out of 21 years because I enjoy

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.810
what we do. You know I like the
challenges of you never know what you're

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.710
gonna walk into and get it done. I
oversee the girls then if the other

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.180
guy's not here I go over and oversee the
other five girls. If they need paint or

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.480
whatever they need I go get it and I
just make sure everything gets done and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.430
in a neat timely fashion. I used to be a
daredevil when I first started I'd go

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.780
straight up 30 foot ladders everything. I
like working with the kids at school.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.520
They always tell me at work Mary will do
anything so I go and do whatever I need

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.990
to do. You take a job you do it to your
best ability. I'll paint long as they'll

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.990
let me paint; every year, one year we
didn't paint because they didn't have

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.820
the funds and we sure missed it. It's
great to see people coming year after

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.630
year. They know what to do and it really
helped us to making sure that number one

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.500
we'll be ready for the next year. We have
to remember that we're the visitors in

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.790
the neighborhood. We really try to blend
in with the neighborhood; a lot of times

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.840
we'll pick brick that is kind of common
in a neighborhood

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.490
just for the school. Yeah I think the physical look of a school really does add to the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.759
neighborhood. We're trying to save energy
at the same time and save the district

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.500
money. We've put motion sensors or
occupancy sensors in every single

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.940
classroom. That's twenty-five percent
savings for each classroom as well as

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.060
upgrading the light bulbs. With the bulbs
we're going from a T12 to a T8 which is a

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.720
thirty percent savings and then the
ballast we're going from a normal

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.460
ballast to a programmable ballot which
allows for nine percent saving of the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.039
lifespan of the (inaudible). New construction wise everything from here on out is to be of

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.590
the same standard. I think it's a great
way to save a teacher's salary if we can

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.620
save money just by changing a light bulb. The students, the parents, the faculty all

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.710
come in and marvel at what we just
created over the summer. It's a very good

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.090
feeling and that goes to everybody
that's involved with this project. Plano

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.110
has been very good in giving us
projects and the trust to build those

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.789
projects in time. I think we're ahead of
the game as far as what we offer. It's a

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.569
good feeling to walk away from a building
that you have completed for the

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.430
neighborhood and for the district. You
try not to be noticed but you do also take

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.449
a lot of pride when you see something
that was well done and that the students

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.710
and teachers are excited about. I think to
the students it's very important. We'd

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.759
like to every child to have the same
educational opportunity regardless

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.400
of which building they're in. I think the
excitement that a kid sees with a

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.180
nice-looking school whether it's renovated or it's brand-new certainly adds to their desire

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.580
to be there everyday and learn.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.220
