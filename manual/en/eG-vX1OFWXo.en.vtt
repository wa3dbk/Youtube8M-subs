00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.200
In thin tutorial we are going to discuss how

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.900
to detect the difference between

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
a well cut and a poorly cut gemstone

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.900
We'll explain how to recognize a windowed gem

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000
Facets that don't meet

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.900
poor polish

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.900
and crooked girdles

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.900
This will help you distinguish between

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.500
well cut gems and poorly cut ones

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.800
One of the most common signs of poor cutting

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.400
is the window

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.300
in many cases such as this.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.600
you can actually read through the gem.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.800
So, what makes a gem have a window?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.200
A gem is windowed because it is cut at the wrong angles

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.200
This is usually due to either primitive equipment

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.000
or an attempt to get as large of a gem as possible out of the rough.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
with a disregard to optics

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and proper cutting angles

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.800
In this illustration

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.800
the orange line shows the path

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.800
the light follows through the gem

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.600
You can see that in this gem

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.200
which is cut with angles that are too shallow

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.600
the light goes directly without coming back.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.200
This creates a window

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.000
and reduces the total brilliance of the gem.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.200
In contrast,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.600
this gem is cut at the proper angles

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.200
and the light which enters the gem

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.500
is returned back in brilliance and beauty to the viewer.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.100
Another way to recognize a window

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100
is when you see a ring of brilliance

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.800
around the outside of the gem

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800
and the middle is dead or dull looking

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
like the gem shown here.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.700
Here is another gem with a window

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.900
or a blank middle

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900
which is also known as a fish eye.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000
Here are two examples of gems that are well cut

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and no fish are involved.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.700
Fantasy cut gems have a whole set of rules of their own

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700
They sometimes will use windows

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.000
as a design element.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.700
and since they're cut for artistic purposes

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.500
This is acceptable and the overall affect is attractive.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.000
Meet points are best seen using partially reflected light

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
like the whitish facet in this picture

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.200
This allows you to see how the corner of the facets meet

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.200
or the meet point

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.200
Straight lines

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200
and good meet points are a sign

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200
of a quality of a well cut gem.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.200
Another sure sign of sloppy cutting

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200
is a poor scratchy polish

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200
like this.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.200
It's best to examine the polish

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.900
with some magnification.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.900
using partially reflected light

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.900
as when checking the meet points.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.900
To give a gem

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.000
a high polish, takes three to ten times longer

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.000
That's why lines that meet

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and polish, are some of the easiest

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.100
way how much time and care was taken

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.100
during the lapidary process.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.100
Also,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.700
Check the girdle, which is the widest part of the gem

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.700
Think of it like a belt that goes

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.700
around the middle of the gemstone.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.900
The girdle should be straight

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.500
and of an even thickness all the way around the gem.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.000
This is important

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
because the girdle is where the gem is gripped

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.800
by the pros when they are set in jewelry

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.800
If poorly cut gems like these seem familiar to you,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.100
Don't be surprised

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.900
The great majority of gems in the market today

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.000
are poorly cut.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.000
Most are cut overseas

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.800
using antiquated equipment.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.300
Where speed is of more importance

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.600
than bringing out the gem's maximum beauty.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.600
Hasty and careless

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.500
cutting results in windows,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.900
crooked meet points,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.700
and scratchy polish

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.700
On the other hand

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.100
a well crafted gem

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.600
is a thing of rare beauty.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.600
and all the extra lapidary care

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.600
and skill, which is required, is well worth it.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.200
So, remember

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.200
when selecting your next gemstone

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.400
take an extra look at the middle of the gem

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.000
The meet points

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.300
the girdle

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.300
and the polish.
