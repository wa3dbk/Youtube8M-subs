Hi I’m Jenny from the Missouri Star Quilt
Company. Take a look at this beautiful quilt

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.860
behind me. This is one of those plus quilts
and plus quilts are all the rage right now.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.830
See how these go together to make these plus
signs? They are so popular and everyone loves

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.040
them. And I want to show you a super easy
way to do this using just charm squares. So

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.390
the charm square we are using today are called
“Indian Summer,” and they’re by Dover

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.820
Hill for Benartex and they’re just beautiful.
I just love those shades of blues and greens,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.230
they’re just gorgeous. This quilt is about
58 by 68 and we have used four charm packs

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.190
in the making of this quilt. But what you
really need to pay attention to is that each

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.899
plus takes five squares. So you need to be
sure and check your charm packs to see if

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.610
you have extras or you know if they have put
doubles in there or triples or if they’re

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.390
just singles, because you need five squares
of each color to make this plus quilt.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.840
So this whole quilt is all about the layout.
It’s as easy as a charm pack quilt. So what

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.310
we’re going to do, I’m going to show you
how to lay this out. We’re going to open

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.330
up these, this charm pack. This is an Indian,
this “Indian Summer” charm pack. And you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.350
will notice right off the bat that I have
several of each color in here and that makes

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.139
this a real easy quilt. And so I’m going
to open up this second one. And I’m just

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:40.719
going to, what I’ll kind of do is just stack
them together so I know exactly what I have.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.039
So what I’ve done here is I’ve taken two
of the charm packs and I’ve open them up

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.119
and the fun thing about this “Indian Summer”
is there are several pieces of the same fabric

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.490
in these charm packs so you can build your
little stacks easier. I’ve stacked them

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.590
all out here, lined them up in order of color,
because this helps me when I am putting them

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.360
together.
So for those of you who love games like tetris,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.099
you are going to love this quilt cause it
is going to make so much sense in your mind

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.040
and it’s going to go together like clockwork.
For those of you who are a little angley challenged

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.390
like this girl here. You’re going to need
to really watch the layout and really make

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.610
sure you have, you know all your things lined
out. What I do to help me is I make the pluses

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.750
and then I fit them together how they go.
So let’s start here with this one. And I

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.001
going to make my plus by putting one above
a row of three like this and one below. That

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:43.390
makes my plus right there. So then I’m going
to make another plus right here and I’m

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.810
going to put that up here. I going to make
three in a row and I’m going to slide that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.960
up here, right into this spot right here.
And then I’ll put one above and one below.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.090
Now if this row ends up being my top row I
will end up discarding that one. But for just

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.300
for now for the sake of being able to see
it and how the layout works and how it goes

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.790
together. I’m just going to leave that one
there.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.740
So then over here, you know I’ve got one
here, one here, now I’m going to lay one

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.880
out right here. And I’m going to put this
here and I’m going to have a couple here

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.790
like this, but if this is the edge of my quilt
I have to stop right there and I’m just

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.930
going to make a half a plus. So then my next
plus right here, let me scoot these out of

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:40.790
the way a little bit. My next plus right here
is going to squeeze up into here and I’ll

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.710
have three of these and three across, and
one at the top and one at the bottom and it

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.030
makes your plus. So as you go along you’ll
want to have a nice big floor to lay this

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.230
out and you’ll want to be able to see how
all your pluses go together. You’ll want

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.600
to watch this very carefully make sure that
you have, you know that they’re in the in

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.709
the right places. And then what we’re going
to do is we’re going to sew this together

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.130
row by row like this.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.790
So what I do then if this is the top of my
quilt is I’m just going to sew this row

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.990
together. And it’s just like sewing a charm
pack quilt. You’re going to take your two

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.169
blocks, you’re going to put them right sides
together, you’re going to sew a ¼ of an

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.169
inch, you’re going to press to the dark
side. And then you’re going to just lay

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.860
them out and sew a whole row. Then you’ll
attach the next row and so on and so on and

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.020
it’s just going to be so fun and you’ll
have a plus quilt just like this. Now I want

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.770
to show you one more cool thing about this
quilt. We had some leftover squares some leftover

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.770
charms. So what we did was we took a piece
of the border. But up here in this top corner

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.210
you can see that we put in some squares and
we did that on this top corner and we did

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.629
it on the bottom corner down here too. Just
to offset it and give it a little more pizazz.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:01.110
Also you guys know I don’t like waste. So
that enables us to just go ahead and you know

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.639
use up those extra squares on the outside
of the border.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.080
So I hope that you guys have fun making this,
because this is a really fun idea. The plus

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.509
quilt is so popular and they’re just fun
to put together and just be careful with that

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.909
layout. Watch what you’re doing. So we hope
you enjoyed this tutorial on how to make the

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:41.220
plus quilt from the Missouri Star Quilt Company.
