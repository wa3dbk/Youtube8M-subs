00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.510
When you're designing PowerPoint slides,
have you ever wanted to highlight text

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.620
like you can in Microsoft Word?
Well in the next few minutes you'll see

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.740
a neat way to do that. In fact you'll
learn three main tips: First how to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.300
highlight some text on your slide using
Word. Second how to copy the highlighting

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.510
to other text in PowerPoint. And third
how to remove the highlighting. I'm using

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.170
PowerPoint and Word 2010, but it works
much the same in 2007. Okay first up then,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.760
to highlight some text on your slide
using Word, you'll copy a bit of text, go

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.739
to Word, highlight the text and copy it
back. So go to the slide where you want

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.989
to highlight some text and copy one word
from it. Next go to Word and press ctrl+V

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.329
to paste the text you copied. When you
press ctrl+V, this little button

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.579
called Paste Options shows up near what
you pasted. Click the button and choose

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.320
Keep Source Formatting. That way when you
copy your text back to PowerPoint it'll

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.080
still have the same font, size and text
color as it did before. Now select the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.990
text again and highlight it by clicking
the Text Highlight button.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.679
Now you've highlighted it, copy it again
and switch back to PowerPoint.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.710
Okay, now, like you did in Word, press ctrl+v
and choose Keep Source Formatting to

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.600
paste the text.
Cool! You've now got highlighted text on

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.960
your slide.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.980
Right, for the second tip. you'll see how
to quickly copy the highlighting in

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.690
PowerPoint, without going back to Word. To
do that you can use the Format Painter

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.500
button, which copies the formatting from
whatever text you have selected to the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.140
text you select next. I'll use it twice: To
show you how to highlight just one word,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.520
and then to highlight neighboring words.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.790
So double-click to select your
highlighted text. Click Format Painter to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.869
copy the highlighting (which puts a
paintbrush on the mouse cursor, showing

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.720
that Format Painter's active) and just
click in a word to highlight it.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.940
Now, to highlight neighboring words, we'll
use Format Painter a second time so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.950
select some highlighted text, click
Format Painter and drag from one word to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.760
another to highlight all the words you
touch.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.010
And by the way, if you edit, copy or move
any highlighted text, the highlight stays

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.660
with it. So this method's easier than
workarounds you might see, where people

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.659
just put yellow shapes behind the text,
or use a separate text box for

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.090
highlighted text and change the box's
background color.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.810
Okay, now you've seen how to copy text
from your slides to Word, so you can

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.760
highlight it and copy it back, and you've
seen how to quickly copy highlighting in

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.210
PowerPoint. Thirdly, let's just see how to
remove the highlighting when you no

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.950
longer need it. There are two ways to do
that: You can select some unhighlighted

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.510
text, click the Format Painter and then
click a highlight to remove it, or you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.860
can just click in a highlighted word (or
select some highlighted text) and press

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.110
Control+Space to remove the special
formatting. So there you have it. You've

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.740
seen how to apply, copy and remove
highlighting when you design slides.
