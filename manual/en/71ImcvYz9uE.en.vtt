CRAIG BROWDER: So if you think you can do
it just go ahead and do it but we are going

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:18.820
to start at the bottom then work our way up
so let us do that. Let this point [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.619
_____ &lt;00:23&gt; now you are seeing I have got
this down, this is exciting creating all these

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.560
crazy objects. This is where they have this
box continue back here, let us actually draw

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:44.490
him through so we got to see where he is going
and line this guy up. At this point you just

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:52.320
kind of have to eyeball it. I like to lean
it to look but pretty much you just eyeball

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.770
it and you can see it but you know it is like
_____ &lt;00:54&gt; this is the only part we are

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.520
going to see but I am going to draw all the
way through because I told you we were going

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.352
to make some cut throughs into this in this
big guy back here so eventually we want to

00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:10.140
see this line alright. Okay let us finish
drawing this guy up and making him nice and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:28.800
solid so you know what the heck we will look
at that--frontline. Remember, if we have parts

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.810
that intersects you know you got to be careful
with the lines so this is going to go all

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.570
the way up but it is going to stop right here.
Now we got the little gap there. Let us see

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.480
with the back one here, let us stop right
there. We are not going to see it until way

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:57.610
over here alright and actually just team up
and there is the corner and there you go.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.890
We kind of got an idea--we got these crazy
shapes all kind of connected. Alright from

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.560
here let us have--if you are you know confused
at this point you should probably just you

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.152
know stop and take a look at your drawing
and see if it makes sense to you and make--you

00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:22.329
know if you need to correct anything or whatever.
I am using a pen but if you know you are still

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.099
kind of confused about this stuff you can
use like a pencil.
