00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:08.928
Hey babe, you look exhausted.

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:10.058
I am!

00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:14.988
My parents offered to buy me a computer for
college and I have been doing so much research

00:00:14.988 --> 00:00:19.878
to find a good one that I can't even imagine
what college will be like.

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:21.888
Not this hard I'm sure.

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.037
Why are you having such a hard time?

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:28.778
Because, it's that never ending cycle like
the commercials.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:33.877
PC or Mac, Mac or PC, Justin Long or John
Hodgman?

00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:34.918
Wait what?

00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:35.918
Uggghh...

00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:37.278
I just can't decide.

00:00:37.278 --> 00:00:40.008
Well, do you like my Mac?

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.668
I do, but I also like Jan's PC.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.818
Okay, well which do you like more?

00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:50.158
Well if I knew that, I would have already
made a decision.

00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:53.398
So, what's the big debate about?

00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:56.148
Okay, well for starters.

00:00:56.148 --> 00:01:01.358
Mac's don't require as much maintenance as
PCs, and they have fewer viruses.

00:01:01.358 --> 00:01:06.218
This is a good thing for me because I don't
keep up with things like updates and I hate

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:07.878
all those little pop ups that try to remind
me.

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:08.878
Alright.

00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:10.768
Then, PCs have more things that adapt to it.

00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:15.468
Macs are so prejudice when it comes to software
and stuff, it would just be easier to get

00:01:15.468 --> 00:01:19.648
the software I need instead of searching for
something compatible with a Mac.

00:01:19.648 --> 00:01:21.538
Okay, that's a good point.

00:01:21.538 --> 00:01:23.658
I just can't choose.

00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:27.388
Justin Long is so cute, but John is so practical.

00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:32.428
I don't understand why you keep talking about
guys... what do they have to do with computer

00:01:32.428 --> 00:01:33.928
choices.

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:35.678
The commercials babe!

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.058
Don't you listen to anything?

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:43.158
So, you're making this a choice between guys
rather than the computers now aren't you?

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:45.257
Well what am I supposed to do?

00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:48.258
It seems like the best way to handle this.

00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:49.708
It's such a big decision.

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.528
You're insane.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:55.678
I'm not very high tech babe, but I sure do
know how to pick men.

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:57.967
Ha, yeah babe, you sure do.
