00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.250
Ottawa's downtown area is an exciting
part of the city. It is packed with business,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.189
entertainment, restaurants and history. It's 
a busy area and travelling through the city's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.580
core can be difficult at times. The answer
for a safe and comfortable commute is to cycle

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.080
on the new Laurier Avenue Segregated Bike
Lanes. Whether for business or pleasure, cycling

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.800
is a healthy choice for both you and the environment.
It's also an affordable choice for people

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.199
of all ages. The City of Ottawa is building
the first downtown segregated bike lanes in

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.839
Ontario another important step on the path
to becoming a greener and more sustainable

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.190
city. Painted bike lanes are available throughout
the city but busy streets with lots of traffic

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.930
can be intimidating for some people. We have
learned from other cities that bicycle lanes

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.930
separated from motor vehicles provides comfort
and safety for all road users. Now, new segregated

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.610
bike lanes have been installed on both sides
of Laurier Avenue in opposite directions between

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.720
Bronson Avenue and Elgin Street. These new
bike lanes are separated from motor vehicles

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.720
through the use of concrete curbs, plastic
poles, parked cars and planter boxes. A new

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.190
traffic sign will instruct motorists to remember
to yield to cyclists and pedestrians when

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.980
making right turns. A straight arrow signal
followed by a green ball will allow pedestrians

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.980
and cyclists to move through intersections
ahead of turning motorists. The new left-turn

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.800
bike box makes left turns simple and safe
for cyclists. Proceed through the intersection

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.700
on the arrow or green ball and enter the painted
green box, turn your bike and wait for the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.700
signal to change before continuing on your
way. Right turns on red lights will no longer

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.140
be permitted along this section of Laurier
Avenue including all of the north-south cross-streets.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.260
This makes it safer for cyclists and prevents
motor vehicles from blocking the new left

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.890
turn bike boxes. Cyclists remember to watch
for pedestrians at taxi and loading zones

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.750
and at on-street parking locations east of
Lyon Street. Pedestrians will be crossing

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.140
the segregated bike lane at these locations.
New loading zones and on-street parking has

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.510
also been added on Gloucester and Nepean streets
to replace those spots removed from Laurier

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.510
Avenue. ll see some other changes on Laurier
Avenue as well. When travelling east on Laurier

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.880
the O Connor intersection will see a shared
through/right turn lane. Left turns from Laurier

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.870
Avenue onto Metcalfe Street will be restricted
during weekday peak periods. These turns will

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.870
not be permitted between 7 and 9 a.m. and
3:30 and 5:30 p.m. At Elgin Street, there

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.890
will be one westbound through lane and a dedicated
left turn lane that will be available throughout

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.200
the day. The Laurier Avenue bike lanes are
an important step in connecting cycling paths

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.560
across the city. East of Elgin Street, new
painted bicycle lanes link you to the Rideau

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.250
Canal pathways via the Queen Elizabeth Driveway.
Cyclists heading west can choose to bike through

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.760
Chinatown and Little Italy via the new signed
biked route west of Bronson along Cambridge,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.760
Primrose and Empress Streets. Alternatively,
westbound cyclists can also link up with the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.040
Ottawa River Parkway by choosing Bay Street
and Wellington Street. Mayor Jim Watson! Since

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.280
2005, cycling is the fastest growing mode
of transportation in the City of Ottawa. In

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.849
fact, over the summer months cyclists make
about 60,000 trips per day around the city.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.739
This bike lane is one of the initiatives we
are focusing on this year. It will make the

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.200
downtown more inviting and safer for everyone.
This project supports business, the environment,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.569
tourism and your health. I invite you to take
your bike out for a spin and join me on the

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.569
new bike lane. The New Laurier Avenue Segregated
Bike Lanes Pilot Project is an important addition

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.860
to Ottawa s cycling network. Grab your bike
and come on down to shop, visit, work or play.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.749
