Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, here
with a way to add a little pop of color into

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.230
the interior of your early S197, thanks to
this pre painted center console arm rest console

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.980
fitting all 05-09 Mustangs.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.840
I'll be the first to admit, painting the interior
parts for your Mustang can usually be a recipe

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.920
for disaster, sure the good intentions are
there and all, but poor prep work and improper

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.330
paint can usually lead to inconsistent and
sketchy results.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.710
On the other hand professionally painted parts
like this arm rest cover or even our center

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.780
console trim kit which is available separately
can make a huge improvement on your rides

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.989
interior, to the point where people will actually
ask you if the painted parts were a factory

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:48.989
option.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.510
The reason people may get these parts confused
for original equipment is the quality of materials

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.050
used and the quality of the color match.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.000
That's because we do spray them right here
at AmericanMuscle.com headquarters, using

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.430
the same base and clear coat urethane paint
Ford uses in their factories, matching your

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.160
car's exterior perfectly.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.880

on our site and you want to see a complete

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.100
list of all the colors available, just click

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100
page.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.820
While on the product page you can see all
the colors available for this armrest cover,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.420
and you can even check out a couple of user
submitted images of the cover in action.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.500
As for the cover itself, it is made with a
very durable automotive grade ABS plastic,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.200
and attaches to your factory armrest cover
using the preinstalled 3M tape located on

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.380
the back.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.090
As far as the installation goes, all you need
to do is simply clean the factory armrest

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.090
first using the supplied alcohol prep pads,
remove the protective backing on the 3M automotive

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.610
tape, and adhere carefully to your ride.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.130
Getting everything done should only take you
a few minutes.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.130
This reminds me, if you haven't already, subscribe

link below, or up in the corner.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.290
In each product overview, I tend to try to
give you guys a little insight on the install,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.369
just so you know what to expect when the product
does arrive to you.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.880
Introducing small splashes of color to the
interior with these pre painted parts can

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.979
really make a big difference that will help
get you noticed, so if you want to spice up

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.470
the interior of your 05 Mustang, be sure to
