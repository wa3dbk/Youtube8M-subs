Very good, I'm Alex and in this video we will see how to make a Hard Reset, a reset

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.169
the LG Optimus Black, better known
as LG P970

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.750
we will realize through two
methods, if we can do

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.669
see the menu

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.749
and if we can not through
a combination of buttons

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.909
as always we will check the
android version which has been based

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.300
this reset, since it does have a
earlier version

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.970
varies fully

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.370
for that we enter into

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.570
settings

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.990
down way down

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.430
about of the phone

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.020
software information

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.480
and we see that you have version 4.0.4
Android

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.790
We went back 2 times

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.289
and enter into backup

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.440
and restart

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.960
down factory reset

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.830
restart phone

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.560
erase everything

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.560
press the button to accept hope
it would restart and reset

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.790
to perform reset through
combination of buttons must be in

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.380
that we have to have the last
software version installed

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100
otherwise we will work

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.530
why after those instructions
reset, ie the end of the video

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.540
we are going to explain how to update
the software in case we have

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.760
blocked the terminal code
security and do not know the password

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.470
well in this case we see that this phone does not have the security pattern

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530
locked and do not know

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.810
in that case we have to do

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.540
It is to remove the battery and put it not
to turn off and on the phone

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.850
once off press buttons
decrease the volume and the G key is in the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.120
side and press and hold the
power button to turn it on

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.340
we release the power button but
Other buttons let them until

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.339
Android appears the doll that
screen

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.789
once it appears wait for it
turn and no longer be reset

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.309
to do anything else on this phone

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.519
we give fast camera to
but ye see the process takes about three

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.349
minutes

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.429
more or less to power

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:33.259
to update the device
blocked by the screen pattern

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.899
we have to install the security
PC Suite software

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.919
We can not search google

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:44.579
or within the page of LG, in the
aftermarket section

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.469
after-sales service

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.239
PC Suite

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.639
and this gives us the option to select
the device in this phone case

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:56.999
mobile

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.869
Smartphone

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:07.469
and put me down to LG P970

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.219
we accept

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.960
download PC Suite 4

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.889
We wait for it to download, and once
downloaded open it

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.909
to run the exe file

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:33.809
begins the installation install it like any other program by choosing 
Next, accept, install, etc.

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.879
once opened, if you plug the
We device will not connect

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.849
the reason is because in itself
device should show us a

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:42.829
screen

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.509
you have to select LG software

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:50.059
and we can not be selected because
we locked screen with

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.939
security pattern

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.180
in that case what you need to do is
get in

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.699
up device and then
Emergency Recovery firmware

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.329
press OK and we will appear

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.349
the option to run a program that
called LG Mobile support tools,

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.679
we need the run, and once installed

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:18.669
us this screen appears press OK, connect the device

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.660
and when it recognizes

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.039
we have to press the start button
update you see above

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.580
on the left

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.370
once you install the
update, we may appear

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.039
We have another update available
what

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.120
continue until

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.919
finally no longer appears no
update, and then could

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.680
make reset as indicated
above through the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.330
combination of buttons

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.240
and that's it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.130
