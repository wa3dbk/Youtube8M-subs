00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.600
Hey, I came to London for a quick visit and we came up with the idea to use this opportunity to make a video

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.300
now that I got a director and editor to join me for this project too

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.120
First we came here to my first flat in London

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.740
I lived in Sussex Gardens, which is between Lancaster Gate and Paddington station

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is such a beautiful area

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.520
My taxi drove past here yesterday and I almost started missing this place again

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.720
So this is where I spent my first year in London

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.600
My main reason to move to London was my studies

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.100
I of course love the city too, but the course at UAL was the reason I came here in first place

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.340
This is the main building that is located on the Oxford Street

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.220
right behind a huge H&amp;M

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.640
Quite a dangerous location because it's so close to all my favourite shops

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:21.508
For the past 3 years I've spent my time in this building 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.920
Soon there will be no reason to come back here anymore

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.100
I'm slightly different compared to an average Londoner, as I actually like coming to Oxford Circus

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.740
I loved shopping around Oxford Street

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.771
This place is full of tourists

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.720
and most of the Londoners would probably stay away from here

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.100
...but Iike it here because you can find all your favourite shops on the same street

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.960
If you're in hurry though, it might be annoying when you can barely cross a street because it's so packed in here

00:02:06.447 --> 00:02:11.287
If the masses of people are not an issue for you, I'd recommend Oxford St as a place to shop

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.260
if you prefer something else, Westfields in Stratford could be an option

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.460
it has most of the same shops and I like to go there as well

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:31.148
...and there are many good looking guys around here too :D

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.520
We came to Lobster Roll Deli for lunch

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.196
Burger and Lobster has been one of my favourite restaurants in London for a long time

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:47.116
until my flat mate told me about Smack Deli

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
which is a lot cheaper option

00:02:54.302 --> 00:02:59.042
At Burger and Lobster the meals are 20 pounds, whereas here it's half the price

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.580
(confusion around the name of the place, is it Lobster Roll Deli or Smack)

00:03:07.713 --> 00:03:10.473
(we come to the conclusion it's Smack)

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.640
This is right opposite Selfridges

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.980
...so a perfect lunch spot when shopping at Selfridges

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.160
I think that it's slightly easier to be a blogger in London in some sense, 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.020
because there are so many different places to take photos, as well as many restaurants

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.160
and places to go and do things

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:47.568
For me being a blogger is maybe easier in Finland though

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.500
because my sister and people who take photos for me are mostly in Finland

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.020
And it feels like the blogging "culture" is not as clearly part of the every day life in here

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.240
it feels normal in Finland to see someone snapping photos at a restaurant

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.120
but here I haven't felt like taking photos all the time or even carry my DSLR to every place

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.360
mostly just mobile photos from here and there

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.440
This city has a lot more to offer for a blogger

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.660
but me personally, I get more out of Helsinki than London when it comes to blogging

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.380
This is the Italian Gardens

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.100
and this is very close to my first flat in London

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.080
A very beautiful and calm area

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.620
Whenever someone comes to visit me in London, I take them here

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.780
There is something so calm and pristine in this place - right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the big city

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.920
There's been a lot of talk about studying fashion in London

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.760
It's funny how some people might have a certain image of people who live in London 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.940
and what type of people study fashion here

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.700
It seems that people think that if you study fashion in London or Paris you have to have a certain look

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.880
...or they think we all wear Dries van Noten and Zac Posen all the time

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.800
From a fashion student's viewpoint, London is very interesting as it has all the brands and shops one could think of

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.380
so for a fashion student this is an amazing city to be in

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.360
and it is interesting to study fashion here because there are so many designers who come from here

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.160
British designers who have achieved amazing things

00:05:47.038 --> 00:05:49.578
I really don't feel like going back to Helsinki now

00:05:49.592 --> 00:05:51.592
it's such a nice weather in here

00:05:51.592 --> 00:05:53.460
I wanna stay here!

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.960
but luckily I get to come back here in a month's time

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.840
Even though this may not be a place I want to live in long-term, this is an amazing place to visit as a tourist

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.720
so I don't really feel like leaving, though it's always nice to return home as well

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.220
Now we'll go back to Helsinki

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.540
I hope you have enjoyed this video

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.860
Bye bye!
