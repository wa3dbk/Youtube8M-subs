Hi! Karriann Graf with Creative Cooking Corner.
We are going to make a Homemade Applesauce

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.449
that consists just of Macintosh Apples and
a sprinkle of cinnamon. And that’s all we’re

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.800
going to add. It takes… you know… about
40 minutes or so. All we have to do is peel

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.800
the apples and cut them up, add them to a
pot and cook on low.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.800
So we are going to start with peeling our
apples. I’ve got six Macintoshes here and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.850
I’m just going to peel them. I’m done
peeling, so now I’m just going to cut it

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.449
up. And I’m just going to cut it up. It’s
just a rough chop. I’m not doing anything

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.020
fancy by any means. I’m not too worried
about coring it completely. I’m just trying

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.120
to get off the skin for the most part. Then
I’m just going to cut it. Okay? It’s not

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.619
fancy.
So I’m making this Homemade Applesauce just

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.149
to serve with some baked pork chops that we’re
going to be making. So you can see I’ve

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:17.440
got all our apples cut up and I’m going
to add like a half cup of water. I just want

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.289
enough to cover the bottom. I don’t want
it to burn. So I’m going to cover up the

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.580
pot and the apples will just start to soften
up and kind of disintegrate.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.220
They are cooking now for roughly 20 minutes.
It’s still a little bit clumpy, but it has

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.690
a very nice texture. I’m just going to add
some cinnamon. Sprinkle some on it. Stir it

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.940
in. Now I’m going to take the top off and
just let it simmer for about 10 more minutes

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.860
just to let some of the liquid evaporate.
Once it cooks for 10 more minutes, it will

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860
be ready to serve.
