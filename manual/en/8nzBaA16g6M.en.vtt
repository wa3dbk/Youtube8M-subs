00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.580
In this segment we are going to cover how
to write good dialog. And I have brought you

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.940
out to our quiet, out of the way location
because with dialog the best thing is to hear

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.800
it instead of sitting and writing it in your
head. Sometimes if you say it out loud that

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.340
works a lot better. Now an important starting
place is to realize that if you are writing

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.190
a novel or if you are writing articles or
even poetry those are the end product that

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.140
are meant to be read. Now on the other hand
if you are writing a play or a screenplay

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.600
you are simply writing a blueprint that is
to go to producers and directors and actors

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.179
to breathe life into it and that production
is the final step. So you have to think you

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.819
are not writing the dialog to be read you
are writing it to be spoken. Now you see in

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:55.949
some plays and even on TV. sometimes all the
characters talk exactly alike. The exact same

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.010
infliction, excitement, but people are not
like that. People are all different and it

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.430
is important to breathe life into each and
every character and one way to do it is the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.329
way they talk. Can you picture some kid coming
in with his skateboard looking down at a spill

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:17.409
and going "Good land." But grandma might come
in and come up to this spill and say "Oh,

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.829
good land." The dialog fits the character.
It is not just all the same and it is not

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.609
how you or I as play writes would say it necessarily.
We give it to our characters to say. With

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.280
my play "Ticket to Paradise" for instance,
I have a man behind the counter and I have

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.280
characters coming in asking to buy a lottery
ticket. Now, it would be easy just for a play

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.040
write to have each one go "Hey, can I have
a ticket, please?" But if you can make different

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.960
dialog or even something so trivial as asking
for a lottery ticket it can help really establish

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.159
those characters more. So the first person
we have in is a CEO and he is going to say

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.610
"Yeah, I want a lottery ticket. Now how come
you guys don't have the percentages posted?"

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:11.000
Something like that. Then maybe a woman will
come in who is a little more wealthy and well-to-do

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.120
and she is flirting with the counter guy a
little bit and says "I think I will have a,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.140
give me some Clove cigarettes," and she is
looking around. "And I'll take a lottery ticket."

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.890
That kind of thing. Then you might have a
let's say a blue collar worker come in and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.470
ask for a lottery ticket. And instead of intellectually
thinking, "Now how would he ask for a ticket?"

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.190
Actually, we are out here in the middle of
nowhere so we can sort of get into this character

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.860
and see how this guy might kind of talk like
this "Yeah, yeah give me a, yeah, give me

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.820
a couple tickets there. Give me a lottery
ticket there. Hey, you got any beef jerky

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.810
too?" You know maybe something like that.
Just anything that will give you an idea to

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.880
latch onto where their dialog is not all the
same. And even the simplest things will make

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.430
that character stand out. And all of those
things together will help the play move along

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.230
and help your characters become so much richer.
Now just because you are writing dialog does

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.451
not mean you need to write as much as possible.
I mean unless of course the character is a

00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:23.180
chatty type character. But sometimes it is
best to say as much as you can visually. Like

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.590
for instance, say I am walking in, someone
is sitting here on the bench, I am sitting

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:35.310
here. I will walk up and I am a guy who is
kind of bitter and hates all the pigeons.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.610
So I will come up, sit down, look around and
say "I hate these pigeons. Somebody ought

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.330
to clean these up. Why isn't the city doing
something about this?" I can go on and on

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.930
and on and then my conversation with this
fellow starts. Better yet, what if I came

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:02.440
in and put my arm around the bench and just
got my hand in some pigeon droppings and "Pigeons!"

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.250
And then I begin the dialog with this character
here. I got the same thing across with fewer

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.790
words and that meant more and you see that
it is more real than just talking. So as much

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.060
as you, can get reality and make the dialog
more precise and express something visually

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.480
the better.
