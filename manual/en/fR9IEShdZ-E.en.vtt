00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.409
So I'm kicking off a weekend of fighting games
here on the Undertow, and I'm starting with

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:29.759
the most hardcore. That's right, it's Bishoujo
Senshi Sailor Moon S - Jougai Rantou!? Shuyaku

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.870
Soudatsusen, the Strange Anime Licensed 2D
fighter that's the best thing since Ranma

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.170
Â½ Chougi Ranbu Hen, and only slightly more
annoying to pronounce. The full cast of various

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.109
sailors take the field in a game that, to
be honest, kinda caught me off-guard. I wasn't

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:57.019
expecting anything nearly this good, or nearly
this customizable.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.620
So before there was Arcana Heart or Skullgirls
or even Dead or Alive, there was the cast

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.509
of Sailor Moon beatin' each other up for fun
and profit. And... well, it's by no means

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.200
what you'd expect out of a modern fighter,
but for 1994 this is still pretty boss. You've

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.890
got back-dashing, desperation attacks, and
fair level of combo complexity. Everything

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.420
runs off quarter- and half-circles, like most
games today, so it'll be exceptionally easy

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.539
for your average player to pick it up and
jump right in. That's the good news. The bad

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.909
news is that, for whatever reason, the story
mode completely hamstrings your character

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.899
of choice... or, more accurately, buffs the
hell out of your opponents by giving them

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:39.419
120% health and ridiculous defense, compared
to the wet tissue paper you call a body. That

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:44.139
is, until you figure out - in my case, a week
later - that by hitting Select during the

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:50.819
controller configuration screen, you can actually
tweak each character's parameters on the fly.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:58.130
And that's awesome.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.020
By doing this, the game goes from "Massive
uphill climb" to "very flexible, if a bit

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.891
easy." But I'm gonna go out on a limb and
presume that you're not in it to show your

00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:10.750
hard macho buffness to the world, you just
want to have a good time with a 2D fighter

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.030
that might include Jupiter putting Mars here
in a giant swing and doing a pile of damage,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.700
or Chibi-moon latching onto an opponent's
head and wreaking havoc. There's a good bit

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.830
of gameplay diversity between the characters,
which is good, because let's face it they're

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.060
all teenage girls in very similar outfits.
You need a scorecard that differentiates between

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.950
hair color to keep 'em straight.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.260
Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S - Jougai Rantou!?
Shuyaku Soudatsusen (man, just saying the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.390
title of this thing is eating into my time)
might not've set the world on fire like the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.232
Mortal Kombats or Street Fighters of its day,
but it's good to see licensed games that can

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:55.110
actually take the whole 2D fighting idea and
do it right. Heck, it took Ranma three tries

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.040
to be playable, and Sailor Moon did it in
one. Our thanks go out to Tony at Games Unlimited

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.790
in Delaware, Ohio... wait a second. Is it
Delaware or Ohio? Or is it like Indiana, Pennsylvania?

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.330
**** IT, WE'LL DO IT LIVE
