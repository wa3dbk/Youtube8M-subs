Hi, everyone ! Here Tabernak along with ShoukaSeikyo. Hi, Shouka !

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.620
Hi !

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.140
And Aurelien behind the Camera. Hi Aurelien.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.090
Hi !

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.660
So welcome to this first episode of CleverCraft of this season.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.380
This show is mainly about the redstone usage in the game and plugins, but

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.400
about others things like mining or building tips.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.020
So, Shouka, to introduce you shortly : You're a member of the EvenTime since almost the beginning,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.930
you're the main administrator of the server and with your spare time, you do plugins.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.230
The reason we're here today is one of the plugin you've done, RedClock, can you talk us about it ?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:56.130
Of course. The main purpose of the plugin is to create a sign that will synchronize with the world time to active redstone.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.040
To who your plugin will be useful ?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:09.500
Mainly to people doing redstone circuits who want to synchronize them with the server time.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.770
So it's more useful for a server. In singleplayer, it lose it purpose.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.980
Obviously, in singleplayer, it's clearly useless and it isn't even available for it.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.410
How long did it take you to make this plugin ?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.360
A few hours of programming like everyone.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.280
You have already quite some downloads, how many do you have right now ? What are the opinions of your plugin ?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.290
It's around 1500 downloads for now. Except the little errors, I have good reviews from the people who use it.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.920
Good, good. It's about time we go test it out.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.430
Yes, we're going to stand up.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700
Let's go, I follow you.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.880
So here is our construction site to show you how the plugin works.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.570
We'll start with the simple circuit here.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.510
You can see here a door and a redstone lamp who need to be activated.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.990
I'm gonna create the sign.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.070
Aurelien will put the used syntax on the video ... later.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.280
It'll be activated from 12PM to 1PM.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.110
Now we have a awesome little sign created by the plugin.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.790
It shows us that the redstone will be activated from 12PM to 1PM.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.330
That's about it.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.750
We'll use a command to change the server time.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:51.820
When the redstone needs to be active, the sign turn itself into a redstone torch who acts just like a normal redstone torch.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.530
It activate the door and the redstone lamp.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:03.820
That's basically what the plugin is all about, but we can add this to more concrete circuits.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.050
Like this one. I use it for lighting.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:20.540
So I'll just put a sign active from 7AM to 7PM.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.240
And I made a mistake in the syntax of the sign.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.330
We can see what we shouldn't do.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.770
Exactly !
We can see what we shouldn't do.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.790
We can see what we shouldn't do.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.610
The door from the earlier circuit have closed.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.680
Of course, since It's already passed 1AM.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.460
It's awesome.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.280
It can be useful for the shops who need to be opened for only the time of the day.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.460
Aurelien, if you may come up here.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.790
When It's between 7AM and 7PM, the block is at two of height.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:11.570
If we go to 7PM ... the block will go down from two blocks to let the glowstone lights.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.130
It can lights the street at night.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.550
Really good.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.090
Behind you, Aurelien.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.060
But you can also make a road of redstonelamps and light it ...

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.680
from doing the inverse.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.590
The redstone will be inative from 7AM to 7PM.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.420
And I failed again the syntax of the sign. I'm the creator of this plugin and I make mistakes, pretty badass, isn't ?

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.750
So now, this torch will be active inside the hours who aren't between 7AM and 7PM.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.290
By example, if we go to 7AM ...

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.270
the sign will be back and the street won't be lighted.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.020
It's pretty good so far.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.270
I wish you to have more downloads thanks to this video.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.480
I wish It'll interest redstone circuits makers, because having the time for circuits is so great.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:54.570
Here a little more concrete example of the usage of the plugin. The RedBlock are activating the redstonelamps to show the current hour on the clocktower.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.800
Thanks Shouka for this presentation of your plugin RedClock while hoping that this video will make it more popular.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.870
Thanks for watching. Bye bye !

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.950
