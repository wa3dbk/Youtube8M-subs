00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.980
Can I welcome everyone here to the Australian
Institute of Sport which seems like an appropriate

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.760
location to be asking these big questions.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.430
I feel a bit in awe looking around the room,
and having had a look at the list of people

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.420
who are in the room today I feel a bit in
awe and slightly intimidated by the brain

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.500
power that we have in this room, and what
I’m really impressed with is the great cross-section

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
of representatives we have.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
I suppose a little challenge I’d like to
put to all of us today is that if we can’t,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.430
as a group, come up with some good ideas and
some good thinking then what group in Australia

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:04.339
could, or indeed the world could.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.030
The future of Australian sport project looks
at trends in sports from social, economic

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.729
and environmental trends, and major shifts
in the nature of sports we play and the types

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.409
of sports we play into the future.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.550
The aim is to inform government and industries
so they can make wiser choices on behalf of

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.550
the Australian people.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.159
It’s going to tell us what we need to teach
the future sport managers – what skills,

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.340
what knowledge they’re going to need to
have in order to engage with the future of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.780
Australian sport as identified by this very
important seminar.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.880
Our project has identified six megatrends
about sports, and these are major shifts to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.079
the types of sports that Australians are playing.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.130
These projects give us an insight into what’s
happening in the future so; a better informed

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.659
government can make wiser choices, a better
informed industry can make wiser choices.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.880
We’re aiming to build the information environment.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.880
Now, because it’s a future we don’t know
for sure how things will change so we’re

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.689
exploring possible scenarios and trends, trying
to understand what might happen into the future.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.960
But ultimately the aim is to help people make
wiser choices about the management of sport

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.329
which matters so much for Australia – culturally,
economically and socially.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.870
And it’s good that there’s the debate
there…

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.780
I don’t think anybody in that room thinks
they have all the answers and that’s why

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.530
we’re collectively trying to come up with,
and identifying and reaffirming some of those

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.440
trends and maybe some of the responses, helping
inform the responses that the Australian Sports

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.350
Commission and Australian Government will
be able to put in place.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.760
It’s important that we think with one mind,
albeit there can be robust discussion in getting

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.330
to that one mind, I think it’s critical
that we send out clear messages about the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.940
importance of participation right from community
sport through to elite sport.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:56.420
In terms of netball, the key role we can play
is as a social change agent around empowering

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.330
women and girls’ social, economic, health
benefits, as well as their sports ability

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.030
in terms of whether it’s on the court, off
the court.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.840
Those are really one of the key trends for
us.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.410
For us in skate there’s all the six megatrends
that we discussed today, they are all very

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.360
much relevant to our sport.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.860
We have a particular connection with youth
of today, so generational change is very relevant

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:27.660
to us and being able to adapt and be flexible
to what the needs of today’s society is.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.820
Right now we’re actually going through a
process ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games thinking

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:40.620
about our 2016 strategic plan so I guess it
will be quite important for us to ensure that

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:49.270
as we look at these trends we have some strategies
in place to deal with those not just for 2016

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.270
but well beyond.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.400
It’s vital because I think the Australian
Sports Commission are probably the only people

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.160
who can do so, and it touches upon the different
aspects, so everything from the SIS/SAS’s

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.950
(State Institute of Sports/State Academy of
Sports) through to the state departments,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.250
and the sporting organisations themselves.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.380
It’s been fantastic to get together with
a whole bunch of people right across the sports

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.380
sector.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.500
Sport is really important for Australians
and what we know is that there’s lots of

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.730
change occurring in society and that will
occur – economic change, demographic change,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.160
social change and we need to be aware of that
and use that to help set strategy in the future

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.889
and partnership with the sports sector.
