00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.042
Hello, I am Merve.

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:05.417
I realized you wanted to get to
know me better on the comments.

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:07.500
I really want to introduce
myself to you, too.

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:09.667
I hope this answers your questions.

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:12.292
I was born in Istanbul.

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:16.250
After finishing high school, I
decided to begin work early...

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.000
...and I started working as
a fashion consultant at Vakko.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
After working in Vakko for
about a year and a half...

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.458
...I continued on Pronavias which is
a Spanish wedding dress company...

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.833
...as a fashion consultant.

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:33.458
While I was working on Pronavias,
I received a great offer from Chanel.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.492
I was the deputy manager on the
store for about a year and a half.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.042
At that time, I met with my
boyfriend who is my husband now.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:45.458
I had already talked about my
desire to return to school to him.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.750
And he really supported me
on this matter and...

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.750
...I dismissed my career and
returned to school.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.042
I studied Communications
on university.

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.958
I worked at advertisement
agencies while I was studying.

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.083
My first job after I graduated was
a costumer representative...

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:00.958
...work at a advertisement
agency.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:05.875
My next job was online marketing
in an international magazine group.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.125
I arrived at a cross-road at
that time of my life.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.292
I was working ever since I
was 19, so, while...

00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:15.208
...deciding on whether to start my own
business or continue my career...

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.833
...I found myself establishing
a new website about...

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.750
...new technologies
and new enterprises.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.458
This website is some place that
contains unique ideas.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.750
I am actually "the Merve"
you know who likes...

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:28.625
...shopping and makeup but
on the other hand...

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.208
...I really likes to deal
with the technology.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.583
This enterprise of
mine is new.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.667
I hope to be successful in
this too in the near future.

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.417
I moved to the European side
of Istanbul after my wedding.

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.167
My family is still on the
Asian side.

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:45.250
My only complaint is that
I don't get to see them often.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:47.792
I have two sisters, I am
the middle child.

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.167
My big sister has the
cutest son.

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:52.833
I am learning to be an aunt
at the same time.

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:56.375
I really like to be active,
to discover the world and...

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:57.875
...share it with my friends.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.292
By the way, my husband is truly
a "modern aircraft" enthusiastic.

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:04.833
Although this hobby takes hours,
I really like to see him happy.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.292
This is the summary of my life.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.250
I would like to answer
anything you wonder.

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:12.375
Thank you very
much for watching.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.292
See you, bye!
