00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.240
Hi Guys, today we are going to talk about
7 foods that help you sleep.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.969
There are some people that have difficulties
falling asleep, while other individuals have

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.030
a difficult time staying asleep once they
nodded off.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.120
However, there are foods you can eat throughout
the day to help you fall asleep at night.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.480
Here is what you should eat in order to obtain
a better nightâ€™s sleep:

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.480
1.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.220
Fish - Eating fish, especially tuna, halibut,
and salmon will increase the amount of vitamin

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.330
B6 in your body.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.230
The vitamin B6 is necessary to help make melatonin,
which is the sleep inducing hormone in the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.340
body.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.450
2.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.829
Jasmine Rice - Studies have shown individuals
that ate dinners that were rich in carbohydrates

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.360
fell asleep faster than those who did not
eat a meal high in carbohydrates.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.730
Researchers believe that the amount of carbs
you consume increases the amount of Tryptophan

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.010
in the body, which allowed the brain to rest,
thus allowing you to drift off into a comfortable

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.829
and relaxing slumber.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.030
3.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.809
Cherry juice that is tart in taste - During
one controlled sleep study, tart cherry juice

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.440
that was high in melatonin was shown that
it could help aid in sleep.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.580
Adults with chronic insomniac symptoms drank
a cup of this juice twice a day and experienced

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.930
a little bit of relief when attempting to
go to sleep at night.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.930
4.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.320
Yogurt - Research indicates that individuals
who are calcium-deficient have a difficult

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.050
time going to sleep.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.670
Dairy products increase the amount of calcium
in the body.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.900
5.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.560
Grains - Barley, bulgur and other types of
whole grains contain a high amount of magnesium.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.030
When an individual does not have enough magnesium
in their system, staying asleep becomes a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.030
chore.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.030
6.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.020
Bananas - This fruit is known for being an
excellent source of magnesium and potassium,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.100
which help to relax overstressed muscles.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.250
They also contain tryptophan, which convert
to serotonin and melatonin, the brain's key

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.750
calming hormones.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.920
7.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.520
Almonds - These nuts contain magnesium which
promotes both sleep and muscle relaxation.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.860
They have the added benefit of supplying proteins
that can help maintain a stable blood sugar

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.720
level while sleeping.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.750
Whatever your reason may be, there are millions
of people in the world that admit to not getting

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.500
enough sleep every night.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.330
Even though the health benefits of obtaining
an adequate amount of sleep are endless, there

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.620
are a lot of people that do not get the chance
to enjoy quality sleep.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.520
Sleep helps to keep your mood high, your brain
sharp, your immune system healthy, your waistline

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520
small, and your skin looking radiant.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.920
The good news is there are certain foods that
you can add to your diet to help increase

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.720
the odds of getting a great night of sleep.
