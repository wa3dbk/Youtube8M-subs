00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.820
Today many people around the world 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.620
who have the Bible in their language

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.550
still haven't experienced it for themselves.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.860
Whether they come from an oral culture or simply have never had the opportunity to learn to read

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.240
the Bible remains inaccessible.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.820
But a production company in Guatemala is trying to change that.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.900
Vi単a Studios is a Guatemalan organization

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.500
founded in 1992 with one goal in mind - 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.780
to use the power of visual media to reach people with Biblical truth

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.540
in the languages and forms they understand best.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.040
One particular program called Deditos

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.640
has seen an amazing response.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.440
Deditos is a series or short videos that use finger puppets

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.100
to teach Bible stories and introduce people 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.260
to the good news of the Gospel.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.760
The Vi単a team builds elaborate sets to accurately portray Bible stories.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.800
It's always surprising and I love this, that we produce Deditos with such simple

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.640
materials right from our communities - fabric, sand from the riverbed, sawdust.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.580
Yet we can transport audiences to Biblical times

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.040
and tell the stories in a visual way that impacts 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.720
the hearts of kids around the world.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.900
The response to the videos has been overwhelming.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.400
So much so that Deditos has already been translated

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.011
from Spanish into 22 other languages.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.560
Wycliffe wants to help Vi単a continue their great work,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.460
and we need your help.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.840
Please consider praying for Vi単a Studios and financially supporting their team

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.560
as they continue to reach people

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.160
in Central America with God's Word in the languages and forms they understand best.
