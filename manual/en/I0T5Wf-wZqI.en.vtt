00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.100
Today's hidden singer will sing Baek Ji-young's "Won't fall in love ever again."

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.080
I tried to do that. I tried to go back to where I was.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.720
I now knew why you were so cold to me.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.960
I can't feel you touching me anymore.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.160
I now knew it. That you don't love me anymore.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.680
I was just trying to deceive myself that you still love me.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.060
But I still console myself.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:12.460
Now I take pity on me, who still can't live without you

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.620
I will try to erase everything about you, at least from now on

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.360
I won't love you ever again.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:33.040
Telling you now, I think I can't ever meet you again, I won't fall in love with you ever again.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.640
I won't ever fall in love like a fool.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.480
But still, I'm telling you "I love you."

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.560
Just forget about me. Just erase me.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:59.500
If you think this hidden singer, Park Haeyoung sang well to imitate Baek Jiyoung's voice, click "O" button!

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:10.980
You only got 5 seconds to click the button!

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.160
Time to reveal the face of today's Hidden Singer, Park Haeyoung!

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:32.460
Please.. this is the only thing I wish for.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.320
Don't talk about me that easily.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.960
But rather, just tell others that you don't know me.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.440
You'll soon know it. The real value of my love.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.900
I won't ever fall in love again.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.060
Cuz I can't meet a person like you ever again.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.160
I really can't fall in love with you again.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.960
I won't fall in love like a fool.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.780
But still, I'm telling you "I love you."

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.260
Please forget me, please erase everything about me.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.160
Without me, a person who is not me.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.880
Don't fall in love with other people

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.640
If we can meet somehow, if we can fall in love again,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.320
It will hurt me again.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:55.320
I still can't tell you that "I love you", looking at you whom I fell for before.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:05.240
Baek Jiyoung's "Won't ever love you again"
