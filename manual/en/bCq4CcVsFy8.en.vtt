Text on screen – Tilly at the National Breeding
Centre, six weeks old.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.410
00:00 Our 100th sponsored puppy Tilly, a yellow
Labrador puppy, starts off lying down on the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.410
grass.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.410
She stands up and starts trotting over to
our photographer who’s taking pictures of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.410
her.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.410
00:10 Next scene she runs over to a member
of Guide Dogs’ staff with one of her siblings,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.410
who’s a black Labrador.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.410
They run around on the grass and when they
stop, the black Labrador rests their head

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.410
on Tilly’ back.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.410
00:41 - In the next scene Tilly playfully
shakes her head and runs over to the staff

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.410
member, with the black Labrador for a cuddle!

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.410
She then excitably runs around on the grass.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.410
01:03 – Tilly opens with a big yawn and
then trots over for another cuddle.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.410
She then trots around the garden again with
her sibling.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.410
01:29 – Tilly is now in the arms of the
staff member where she’s receiving a lot

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.410
of attention, and clearly enjoying being made
a fuss out of.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.410
Tilly is then carefully placed on the grass
so the photographer can take a photo of her

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.410
sitting.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.410
01:42 – Tilly is now inside and is sitting
in front of a white back drop.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.410
She looks at the camera, has a big yawn, and
then walks over to the camera man to say hello.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.410
