00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.103
The President: Well, It
is wonderful to be here

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.404
at the Department of
Energy with some

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:07.040
of our outstanding
private sector partners.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.876
Secretary Ernie Moniz is
in Geneva doing some

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.045
important work on behalf
of our national security,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.281
but I want to thank him
and his team

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.118
at the Department of
Energy, as well as our

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.552
folks over at EPA.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.522
And Administrator
Gina McCarthy is here,

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.724
as well as
Christy Goldfuss

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.794
at the Council on
Environmental Quality.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:32.198
This has been a team
effort to make sure that

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.801
we are doing everything
we can to boost

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.337
the energy efficiency
of the American economy.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:40.440
And since we've
said it's important,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.442
we thought it was
important for us to lead

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.644
by example here
at the federal government.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.112
As you know, I
just took a tour

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:49.949
of the solar-powered
roof upstairs.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.652
And those panels are not
just for show --

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:55.455
they produce power
that the government

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.657
doesn't then have to
buy off the grid.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.659
And more and more businesses
and more and more

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.265
homeowners are following
suit not because it's

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.300
simply good for the
environment, but because

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.569
it's good for their
bottom lines.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.571
Thanks in part to the
investments that we've

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.274
made over the past six
years, the United States

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.644
is rapidly becoming a
leader in solar energy.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.513
Last year was the biggest
year for solar power

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.514
in our history.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.384
And, in fact, the solar
industry is adding jobs

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.220
10 times faster than
the economy as a whole.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.990
So we're proving that it is
possible to grow our economy

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.694
robustly while at the same
time doing the right thing

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.097
for our environment and
tackling climate change

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.532
in a serious way.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.534
Over the past six years,
we've done more than

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.603
ever to combat
climate change.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.206
Last year, the federal
government used less energy

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.776
than at any time in the
past four decades.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.245
And in a historic joint
announcement that many of

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.981
you saw, China
committed to limiting

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.250
their emissions for
the first time.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.552
So today, America once again
is going to be leading

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.553
by example.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.822
This morning, I signed an
executive order that will

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:03.823
do two things.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.960
First, we're going to cut
the federal government's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.265
greenhouse gas emissions 40
percent from the 2008 levels

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.501
within the next 10 years.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.337
Second, we're going to increase
the share of electricity

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:21.808
that the federal government
uses from renewable

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:25.778
sources to 30 percent within
the next 10 years.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.181
These are ambitious goals,
but we know that they're

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.182
achievable goals.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:32.051
And I want to thank the
executives of some of our

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.621
leading companies in the
country who are here,

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.423
because they're
stepping up and making

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:39.125
similar commitments.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:43.930
Folks from IBM to GE,
Northrop Grumman -- some

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.334
of our biggest Fortune 100
companies are setting their

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.636
own ambitious goals.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:54.007
And, cumulatively, what this is
doing is allowing us across

00:02:54.007 --> 00:03:00.613
the economy to not only hit some
key targets that are going

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:03.249
to be required in order for us
to reduce climate change,

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.852
but they're also saving money,
helping their bottom line,

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.721
and they're giving a boost to
the industry as a whole --

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.857
because as we get
economies of scale,

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:16.496
and demand for solar and wind
and other renewable energies

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.500
grows, obviously that can
help drive down the overall

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.202
price, make it that much
for efficient, and we start

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.872
getting a virtuous
cycle that is good for

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.207
the environment and creates
jobs here in America.

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:32.211
So we very much want to thank
our private sector partners.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.514
You guys have done
an outstanding job.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:39.385
And because of the prominence
of many of the companies here,

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.255
and the fact that they've got a
whole bunch of suppliers up and

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:47.093
down the chain, what you do with
respect to energy efficiency is

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:49.329
going to have a ripple effect
throughout the economy.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.564
And we're very
pleased with that.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.600
So thank you very much.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.168
Thanks everybody.

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:55.868
Thank you, guys.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:56.502
The Press: Iran?

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.037
The President: I'm sorry,
we're talking about energy,

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:01.841
and it's a great story, so
hopefully you'll focus on it.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:02.642
Thank you, guys.
