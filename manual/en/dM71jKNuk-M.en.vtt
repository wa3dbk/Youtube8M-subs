00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:12.691
Hey Friends! How are you today?

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:17.370
Hmm hmm hmm..

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:19.096
There I go again,

00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:21.973
I just can't get this song out of my head

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:26.673
but hey, there's something else
that's rattling my beard right now

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:30.169
Umm.. what's that?

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.846
Wow o! There goes a Butterfly.

00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:38.359
Come let me tell you
about the life of a Butterfly!

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.372
Zoom In.

00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:43.468
There are four stages in the life of Butterfly

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:44.884
The egg,

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.495
the caterpillar,

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:48.253
the Pupa

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.599
and the Full grown Butterfly.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.418
This life cycle is known as Metamorphosis.

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:02.833
A Butterfly's life starts inside a tiny little egg.

00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:06.945
The egg can be of various shapes and colors.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:11.812
They have a thin
but tough shell for protection.

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:17.611
At the top of the egg, there is a small pit
called the micropyle,

00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:21.185
through which air and water enter the egg.

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:26.926
This stage lasts for about 3-7days!

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:31.858
There is a developing larva inside the egg.

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.688
When it is time to hatch,

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.768
the larva tears open the egg shell
with its jaws.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.486
The larva is called the Caterpillar.

00:01:42.687 --> 00:01:48.277
After hatching, most caterpillars finish
eating their eggs as their first meal.

00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:54.605
Then, they feast on the plant
on which they were laid.

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:57.358
This is the main feeding stage.

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:59.756
Caterpillars eat all the time

00:01:59.757 --> 00:02:03.687
and grow very quickly for about 2-5 weeks!

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.821
When the caterpillar reaches its right size,

00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:13.721
it finds a suitable place and weaves
a silk pad around it.

00:02:13.922 --> 00:02:15.588
It's called a Pupa.

00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:20.553
If you open your eyes and
look around in your garden,

00:02:20.754 --> 00:02:27.965
you could be lucky to spot a Pupa
on a twig, a branch or a leaf.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.159
The protective shell of the Pupa 
is called Chrysalis.

00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:35.908
After a period of 1-2 weeks,

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.074
a very beautiful Butterfly spreads its wings

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.532
and tears the Chrysalis to come
out of the Pupa. 

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:49.891
And that is how you see such beautiful
 Butterflies flying all around you! 

00:02:50.392 --> 00:02:55.003
The avearge life span of a butterfly is 20-40days.

00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:01.789
Did you know that Butterflies
usually taste with their feet?

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.383
And have you ever noticed

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:08.956
that Butterflies generally sit
on flowers and not branches and leaves? 

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:13.100
That's because they drink the 
nectar from flowers!

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:17.370
So kids, you know what to do now! 

00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.805
Grow more flowers around you

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:24.895
to play with this beautiful insect 
called the Butterfly!

00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:27.506
This is me Zooming out.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:30.712
Tune in next time for more fun facts.
