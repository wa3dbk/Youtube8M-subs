00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.170
Adam and Eve had many sons and daughters,
but the Scriptures focus on the story of their

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.450
first two boys.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.340
Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. (Genesis 4:2)

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.580
Both Cain and Abel were good workers.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.300
Both knew about their Creator.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.560
Both wanted God to accept them and their worship.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.680
Both had the same problem: Sin.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.240
Not only were they born sinners, but they
lived like sinners.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.949
Each day they thought, spoke, and acted in ways that did not reflect God’s pure and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.740
loving nature.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.280
In His book, the King of the universe calls
this sin.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.440
Everyone has sinned; we all fall short of
God’s glorious standard. (Romans 3:23 NLT)

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.580
Was there a way for God to pardon Cain and Abel

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.540
and declare them righteous in His sight?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.140
Yes, but it would be very, very costly.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.540
Without the shedding of blood there is no
forgiveness. (Hebrews 9:22)

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.960
That unbreakable law of the universe—

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.100
the law of sin and death—must be carried out.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
Sin must be punished with death.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.480
That is why the King’s way of forgiveness
required a death payment.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.960
While the sinner deserved to die,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.700
God would accept the blood of certain kinds of animals, such as a lamb.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.400
The lamb could not be sick or scratched or dirty.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.920
It had to be healthy and clean.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.240
It had to be a perfect lamb.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.860
The lamb would be killed and burned.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.960
It would die in the place of the guilty sinner.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.840
The lamb would be the sinner’s substitute.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.120
One day both brothers brought offerings to God, but only one brought the right offering.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.060
In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.680
But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. (Genesis 4:3-4)

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.320
Which offering do you think God accepted?
