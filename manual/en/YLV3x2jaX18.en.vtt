Today on BRS TV's how to Tuesday we are going
set up the Reef Link and EcoSmart phone app

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.780
Hi I'm Ryan host of BRS TV where each week
we explore new topics related to reefing this

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.230
week we are going show you how to set up the
EcoSmart live phone app for IOS and talk a

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.259
bit about what's in the works for the future
of the ReefLink.

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.539
The app has been cable of controlling your
Radion Lights for a while through your ReefLink

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.569
but more recently they added controllability
for the VorTech pumps as well.

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.090
First step is to set up your ReefLink which
in most typical home networks is super easy.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.230
You will need an EcoSmart live account so
check out ecosmartlive.com, click on the "need

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.200
an account" link and fill out the form.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.609
Next Plug your ReefLink to your pc or mac
via USB, make sure to not have the power cable

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.000
plugged in at this point.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.890
Then go to tiny.cc/reeflink to download the
set up application.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.170
The set up process will offer you two options
one via Ethernet and one via Wi-Fi.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.269
In this case I am going to use Wi-Fi and enter
the relevant information.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.000
At this point we are done with the ReefLink
set up and you can disconnect the USB and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.970
power it up with the power cord.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.320
It should have a success message and you are
done.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.750
You can now log into EcoSmart live with your
new account, hit the device manager and add

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.750
items wirelessly.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.020
Once it finds your new equipment, add the
equipment to your desired tank.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.470
From here you can now set up and make changes
to your lights from basically device that

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.790
has an Internet browser like a PC, phone or
tablet.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.050
Doing this wirelessly from your phone is incredibly
easy and way better than haling a PC around

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.050
to connect directly.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.710
It is also really handy if you want to do
something cool with the lights on demand,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.480
like say you had company over and the lights
are off but you want to show off the tank.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.360
So controlling the tank via your phone is
about as convenient as it gets right so how

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.820
do we make it even more convenient?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.600
An app for your phone or tablet.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.310
Download the app, enter your username and
password and boom you are in.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.230
Select your tank or hit the plus sign to create
one.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.110
To add a new Radion LED light hit the gear
next to the tank name and the plus sign in

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.110
the lower right corner.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.810
It will search for EcoTech products near you
and display them as new devices and devices

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.390
already linked to various tanks.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.630
In this case I want to add a new Radion to
a tank, so I select it and hit next.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.990
Once the Radion is connected you can change
the color channels by kelvin, or to can switch

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.550
to RGB which has the ability to change to
a whole bunch of different colors and ultimate

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.241
control with the sliders.

00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:34.350
You also have access to all the presets from
5k to 20k and a variety of set color settings.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.020
Preview modes, schedules, and other settings.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.640
What's new in the app is the VorTech control
which makes it easy to change modes and flow

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.480
patterns as well as initiate feed mode which
is handy.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.810
Adding the pumps is as easy as opening a tank,
hitting the plus button in the lower corner

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.210
waiting for it to find available modules.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.990
It likely won't find your pumps yet.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.960
So click on missing devices and VorTech which
will walk you through the process.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.100
Start by unplugging every single VorTech in
the house and click next

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.120
Now hold set and mode down at the same time
while you plug in the VorTech.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.130
The lights will go from red to flashing red
and white.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.650
Then hit next

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.780
Now hold the set button till the knob flashes
green and blue.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.700
Let go and it will begin updating the firmware
on the VorTech to connect to the reef link.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.510
It is a good idea to have the reef link pretty
close to the VorTech for this process.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.140
Once the process is done add the pumps to
your tank and you are done.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.860
You can now access and control the pump.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.430
If you own a Radion already the ReefLink will
make it a lot easy to program and show off

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.430
your tank.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.709
If you own some VorTech's it just gets better.

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.870
The people at EcoTech have notoriously tight
lips on new products but they have hinted

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.230
to us that the ReefLink, EcoSmart live and
mobile apps are going to be the hub from which

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.970
all of their new products work.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.470
There are some things in the works there and
I think this is going to be something big.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.940
Even better they just launched a promotion
where if you buy a single Radion led module

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.620
or VorTech and ReefLink at the same time the
reef link is half off.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.640
At 50% off it is almost a no brainer.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.170

or advice for others checkout the comments
