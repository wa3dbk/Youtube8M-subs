The Let's floating jellyfish which I made with packing string!
(Failure version)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I open the packing string.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I split in half the packing string.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Twist the string that was split, fasten with cellophane tape.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I cut out the exposed end.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I rip packing string.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I rip earnestly.

Completion of jellyfish which I made with packing string.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I rubbed with tissue paper jellyfish.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I rub earnestly.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I also rub balloons.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000

&gt;&gt;You can readjust the feeling, again.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
