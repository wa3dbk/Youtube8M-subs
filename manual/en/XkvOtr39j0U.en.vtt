00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.020
how to fold a pop-up background in three
seconds ready

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.080
And in two - one - go

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.139
and that's it

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.600
simple as that now I'll show you a
little bit more slowly so you can

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.750
see what's really going on

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.050
How to fold up a pop up background

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.300
Now when I bought my first screen like
this I must have spent probably half an hour

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.890
or more trying to work out how to get
the thing

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.070
folded up again because once you have unfolded it you don't really remember how it goes

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.780
back together

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.880
so but there is really a simple way and now I've seen various ways on the internet but no

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.450
one as far as I know uses this
particular method

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.090
and the it is for me the easiest simplest and
it also for fastest way of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.180
folding up one of these pop up backdrops  and I'll also show
you how to fold up a reflector as well

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.830
a round reflector, very similar similar
technique. But this is it basically

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.920
All you need to do is stand it up straight like
this hang on to the top with one hand

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.960
put your foot on the bottom with the other

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.420
then all we do is literally just twist

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.440
the top round and as the top twists
round it will naturally

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.580
fall down and you come down, this tucks
in here

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.210
down there and up like that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.229
and that is it. Now literally

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.570
I can do this in a few seconds

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.770
in fact onto in probably about two
seconds

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.149
but I'll do it again slowly so we can
see again foot on the floor

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.310
hold it down hold the top like this

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.829
and twist round like so round

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.189
and in and any other one comes up like
that and that's it

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:55.189
the job is done how simple is that now
to show you on

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.109
a reflector this is a reflector about
just over a meter in size

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.409
again very similar method you can be
twisting it

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.070
All you do is grab to one side here, hand on
the other side

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.780
and you twist like so out and as you see

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.170
as it twists it will naturally come down
and fold together

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.570
and that's it simple as that.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.530
open it up again on the white side this
time, watch my hands

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.860
I'm twisting in opposite directions

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.860
like so and you see how the reflector just

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.290
naturally just rolls up itself, you
 literally have not got to do anything

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.310
and that's it put it back in its case

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.129
and you would do. and that a fold-up
reflector and also

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.060
a pop-up background. so this brings onto the
end about little video here

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.519
and I hope you've learned something
about how to fold up these pop-ups

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.400
backdrops which can be a little bit
intimidating

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.720
and also to be honest you end up spending and awful lot time trying this way and that

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.110
way

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.670
anyway and hope you enjoy the video if
you date they and don't forget to

like share and subscribe and obviously
if you know anybody you think

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.870
has a problem with their pop up background then share this video with them

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.360
there's a couple extra videos down the side
here if you want to watch a more

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.430
