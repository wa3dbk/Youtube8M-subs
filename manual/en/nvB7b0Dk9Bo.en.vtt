00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.390
Today I'm going to unbox the THL T100S.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.020
This is one of the first smartphones that has an octa core chip.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:17.230
More specifically, it has a MediaTek 6592 chip, that's 1.7GHz.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.160
It also has 2 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of onboard storage.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.100
It has a front, and rear, 13 MP camera.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.670
This is the phone itself.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.000
Here we have a 5 inch, 1080P display; that's full HD.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.730
And you get a soft touch back, along with THL's new logo.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.370
We'll open up the back cover,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:01:01.070
and we'll take out the battery to remove the cover.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.530
We'll get this powered on right away.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.360
Made sure that was snapped on all the way,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.100
and now we'll power it on and remove this.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.220
You can see THL's new logo there as well, along with their new boot animation.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.110
Let's see what else we have in the box.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.770
We also have a user manual, which is a quick start guide.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.400
It shows you how to get started with your THL T100S.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.160
THL has also bundled a screen protector.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.700
Although, the display does have Corning Gorilla Glass 3.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.120
We have headphones,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.370
a USB adapter,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.490
and then a wall adapter. With THL's new logo again.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.130
We'll set this to the side.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.620
Okay, now that I've powered up the phone,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.070
I'm just going to go over the software really quickly.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.130
First of all, THL has replaced some of the stock icons with their own icons.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:30.660
Also, this is running Android 4.2.2, Jelly Bean.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.190
Right here, you can see version 4.2.2.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.520
And we should get the Jelly Bean logo, there you go.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.260
Other than that, the software is mostly stock,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.170
and everything that you expect from android.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.390
The phone itself is quite tall and quite narrow,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.530
this may take some time to get used to,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.660
but I am liking the soft touch back.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.820
THL has also added invisible buttons, on the bottom.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.060
Which illuminate when you tap them.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.600
And also a nice chin.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.020
I'm going to be testing this phone over the next few days,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.070
and will give you my full review.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.400
You can watch the full review on my channel, or on Pandawill's channel.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.430
You can buy the phone from Pandawill, a link will be in the video description.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.430
