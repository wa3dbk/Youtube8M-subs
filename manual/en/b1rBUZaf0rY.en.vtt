Hi, I'm Raadhika. Let's talk about how alcohol suppresses the body's fat burning ability.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.870
Small amounts of alcohol on its own 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.119
won't cause you to gain weight.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.710
In fact a small glass of wine,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.900
 has around 100 calories only.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.300
It gets a bit more murky, when we drink while we are on a diet. 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.649
A couple of things happen. Firstly,

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:30.679
the body

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.290
 can't put alcohol in line

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.470
and process it slowly after metabolizing carbs, fats and proteins.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.260
Alcohol has to be dealt with first. 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.870
So the food in your body gets metabolized 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.500
only after the alcohol has been dealt with. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.460
That means 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.720
weight loss is put on hold.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.290
Once the alcohol has been metabolized, then the other metabolic processes start up again. 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.289
That's how alcohol suppresses the body's fat burning ability. 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.120
But if too much alcohol is consumed,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.450
then it can cause malnutrition.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.350
The body becomes so caught up

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.490
in getting rid of the alcohol, 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.179
that food is not processed 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.189
and nutrition is lost. 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.320
Plus there is the added worry of liver cirrhosis. 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.439
Alcohol cause carb cravings

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.280
and because it also undermines our will power,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.240
we cave in and eat.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.600
So on all counts, 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.280
too much is bad. 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.010
So watch how much you drink

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.380
and you will be fine.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.049
