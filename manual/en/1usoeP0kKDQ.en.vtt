00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.639
The seasons are just as important in our day-to-day
lives

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.599
as day and night.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.250
The four seasons winter, spring, summer, and
autumn help us determine

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.430
the kinds of clothes we wear,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.770
the activities we participate in,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.950
and the food we eat.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.879
But what causes the change in seasons?

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.110
The change in seasons is caused by the Earth's
tilt

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.219
and revolution around the sun.

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.680
Here is another model of Earth and the sun.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.020
As the Earth rotates on its axis, it revolves
around the sun.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.660
If we run an imaginary line straight through
the Earth

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.140
from the North Pole to the South Pole to represent
the axis,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.309
you can see that our planet is tilted.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.350
The Earth revolves around the sun once every
365 days.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.790
As it revolves,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.320
sometimes the Southern Hemisphere is tilted
toward the sun

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.250
and sometimes the Northern Hemisphere is tilted
toward the sun.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.539
Try this demonstration at home with a flashlight,

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.670
paper-towel tube, and a beach ball.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.310
Turn on the flashlight and hold it a couple
feet from the ball

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.770
and shine it through the paper-towel tube.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.869
Point the light directly at the center of
the ball.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.959
Notice that the light beam

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.429
makes a concentrated circle of light on the
side of the ball.

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.119
This is how sun rays hit the portions of the
Earth

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.439
that are tilted toward the sun.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.429
Then, without changing the angle of the flashlight,

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.909
move it up so the light shines closer to the
top of the ball.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.240
What happens?

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.619
Instead of a concentrated circle,

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.200
the light spreads out and covers a greater
area.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.299
This is what happens to the portion of the
Earth

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.689
that is tilted away from the sun.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.880
The sun's energy is spread out over a greater
area

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.989
and is less intense, which causes cooler weather.

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:10.560
Here is another way to demonstrate this principle.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.930
When we shine the flashlight

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.260
on the graph paper from directly overhead,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.030
how many squares are illuminated?

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.670
Now, notice what happens when we hold the
paper

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.240
the same distance from the flashlight,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.130
but we change the angle of the graph paper.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.280
How many squares are now illuminated?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.030
That's right.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.750
You can see that light is now hitting more
of the squares.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.140
Although the light and heat energy from the
flashlight are still the same,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.320
they are now distributed over a greater area.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.970
Each square will experience less of the heat
and energy

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.110
than it does when it is concentrated directly
overhead.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.830
More squares are "sharing" the heat and energy,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.460
so each one gets a less intense amount.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.900
When we have less intense heat to our region
of the globe,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.300
we experience winter.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.590
The sun's rays more directly hit the portion
of the Earth

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.310
that is tilted toward it than the portion
that is tilted away.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.970
For example, the green band in the Northern
Hemisphere and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.680
the blue band in the Southern Hemisphere

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.250
are both the same distance from the equator.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.720
However, the sun's rays hit the blue circle
directly

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.340
because of the tilt of the Earth.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.740
We call this direct light.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.120
The sun appears higher in the sky,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.940
temperatures are warmer, and the days are
longer.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.260
The blue region is experiencing summer.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.060
Meanwhile, in the green region,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.060
the sun's rays are more spread out and hit
the area indirectly.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.610
The sun appears closer to the horizon,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.150
days are shorter, and temperatures are cooler.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.260
The green region is having winter.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.650
What happens in our model

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.540
when the Earth continues its revolution around
the sun?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.260
In about six months,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.569
the Earth will revolve to the opposite side
of the sun,

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.600
but its tilt does not change.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.539
That means that now

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.180
the Northern Hemisphere begins

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.470
to receive more direct rays from the sun.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.349
The days get longer, temperatures get warmer,
and summer begins.

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.770
The Southern Hemisphere receives indirect
rays and falls into winter.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.930
The tilt of the planet

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.409
produces a wide range of temperatures across
the planet.

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.349
The regions along the equator

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.270
receive the most direct rays from the sun

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.949
and consistently have warmer temperatures

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.409
than other parts of the globe.

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.259
In contrast, the North and South Poles

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.960
get the least amount of energy from the sun

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.960
and tend to have cooler temperatures than
the rest of 
the planet.
