00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.673
&gt;&gt; Bruce: This place looks incredible.

00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:16.538
Where should we go first?

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:26.510
[MUSIC]

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.754
Ah, that was amazing.

00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:50.177
Let's visit
the Rainbow Treasure Pancake House next.

00:00:50.177 --> 00:00:51.328
Come on.
&gt;&gt; Dr. Strange: Yes.

00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:55.602
That does sound exciting,
but oh, look at this place.

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:56.906
Looks pretty neat.

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.285
Huh, guys?

00:00:58.285 --> 00:01:02.438
[SOUND] Thanks Marty.

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:03.869
You're the best.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:06.731
&gt;&gt; Bruce: If we hurry,
we might be able to make it to

00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:10.720
Professor Fantastical's Science
Palooza Expo before they close.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.901
&gt;&gt; Dr. Strange: Oh boy,
I sure am beat, you guys.

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.856
Let's say we head back home, huh?

00:01:15.856 --> 00:01:16.663
&gt;&gt; Bruce: What?

00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:17.681
&gt;&gt; The Punisher: No way pal.

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:21.254
We didn't come all this way to leave
before I can take one judo lesson from

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:23.969
this here multidimensional
magic fighting gorilla.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:24.584
&gt;&gt; Dr. Strange: No, wait.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.591
Punisher, don't.

00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:29.539
&gt;&gt; The Punisher: What the?
[SOUND]

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:30.053
&gt;&gt; Dr. Strange: No.

00:01:30.053 --> 00:01:30.843
No.

00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:31.418
No.

00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:32.160
&gt;&gt; Bruce: What is going on, Strange?

00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:34.956
Where did everything go?

00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:35.654
&gt;&gt; Dr. Strange: I-

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:38.773
&gt;&gt; The Punisher: It was all a fake.

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:42.486
He used his magic to trick
us into coming here so

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:45.439
he could get his stupid cloak clean.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.261
But Marty's the best, and I needed a ride.

00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:52.753
&gt;&gt; Bruce: You planned this
whole thing from the start?

00:01:52.753 --> 00:01:57.211
This was supposed to help
me keep my anger in check.

00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.642
Rawr!

00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:09.614
[MUSIC]

00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:18.463
You know what guys?

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:20.738
Even if our destination
wasn't what we thought,

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:22.699
I still had a great
time along the journey.

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.595
Look at us, we're healthy and happy.

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:27.367
&gt;&gt; The Punisher: I'm never happy.

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:29.062
&gt;&gt; Bruce: Look at that sunset.

00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:30.164
It's gorgeous.

00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:33.320
And look at this, it's a car.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.856
&gt;&gt; Dr. Strange: Well done, Banner.

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:37.538
It looks like you've learned
to control your temper and

00:02:37.538 --> 00:02:40.031
focus on the good things in life.

00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:42.624
So, you're not mad at me?

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:44.313
&gt;&gt; Bruce: Nah, you knucklehead.

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:49.480
&gt;&gt; The Punisher: [SOUND]
I'm still mad at you.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.686
&gt;&gt; Dr. Strange: I spilled syrup all
over my interdimensional shoes.

00:02:53.803 --> 00:02:56.785
Hey guys, how about we swing by Milwaukee.

00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:57.941
&gt;&gt; Bruce: What's in Milwaukee?

00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.285
&gt;&gt; Dr. Strange: What isn't in Milwaukee?

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:06.128
Free back massages, magic shoe cleaners, a
floating island with rootbeer waterfalls.

00:03:06.128 --> 00:03:08.811
Ice cream people that are very sociable.

00:03:08.811 --> 00:03:10.541
Centaurs running around.

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.843
