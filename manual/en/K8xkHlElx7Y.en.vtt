Hello and welcome to Coldmirror's Cooking Corner! 
 Which I only called that because

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.860
"Kaddi cooks" would've sounded like I stole "Tom cooks"

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.000
and today I'll show you how you can use old food, that you should've thrown away long ago,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.420
and barely any imagination

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.320
to cook really fucking sick bullshit!

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.300
Today: fried potatoes with Bifi

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.040
you need:

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.540
old potatoes! floury so they're actually not good for fried potatoes

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.640
salt and pepper: almost empty

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.000
"Rama" or any other kind of oil - almost empty

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.660
and, finally, the most important ingredient:

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.680
Bifi

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.420
yeah, and before we fry the potatoes we have to peel them

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.080
and for that we use a PROFESSIONAL potato-peeler

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.120
"Hate"

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.360
this is the potato-cut-simulator

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.520
it almost feels like you're cutting the potatoes yourself, right?

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.260
this is possible thanks to:

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.060
Tits!

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080
perfectly secured

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.980
the potato slices have to be so thin that you can look through them.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.860
I hate fried potatoes that are disgustingly fat and still taste like... potatoes.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.140
I only want leftover flavour

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.920
Here we have the pan

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.540
it's on the top right so let's turn this to 4 so it gets nice and hot

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.460
*flirting* oh yes pan! oh, are you already hot?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.480
Now old "Rama" or other frying oil that you have at home. OLD though.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.340
Come out!

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.740
So! Now fry it till it's nice and liquid!

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.740
...yes! That's enough, ok.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.060
Ha! So.. This is how it actually should look like

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.700
Good

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.000
I think I used too much...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.400
Oh who cares! Butter is good!

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.020
Do you also want to become sexy like I am? *wobbly*  BUTTER! *wink*

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.300
makes my skin nice and silky

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.680
Now we throw this small heap of cut potatoes that we did into the pan

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.080
old salt and old pepper

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.780
*potatoes alone taste really boring

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.960
*that's why you have to use a loooooooooot of salt and pepper

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.420
Now we leave this alone for 10min and hope it won't burn

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.500
see you in a second

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.960
Like you can see the potatoes are already slightly roasted

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.440
and full with pepper... And fat! YEAH!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.340
while the potatoes are being cooked - Let's get to our secret ingredient

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.540
Now we have to remove the "foreskin"

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.600
And now we cut cute little slices

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.520
We throw those mini-bifi slices into the rest

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.180
And mix it under...

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.640
And the Bifi gives the whole thing a slight... Yea... Bacon taste

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.780
You could've used Bacon but I wanted to get rid of old shit

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.260
That's why I just cut that into it

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.740
it tastes surprisingly good!

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.520
So! And when the whole thing turned into this undefinable, brown pile

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.760
the Bifi-fried-potatoes are done!

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.480
Now we will serve them knightly

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.340
Of course you can only truly enjoy a meal after you've took a picture for Instagram

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:50.340
Bifi fried potatoes #like a housewife

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.220
This is Bifi-fried-potatoes. Very easily made stupid cheap meal

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.020
made of ingredients that you actually wanted to throw away

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.020
Enjoy your meal!
