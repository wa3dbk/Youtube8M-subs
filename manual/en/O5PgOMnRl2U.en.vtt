00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.539
Hello. My name is Tomasz Piotrowski

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.279
I work for CarLabImmo

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.360
I would like to present you with our product
Bypass Gold Edition.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:34.540
Bypass Gold Edition is the only such device
in the world that removes immo from VAG group cars via the OBD.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.540
It is dedicated to gasoline and diesel - powered
cars equipped with EDC16, ME7, EDC15 electronic control modules.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.820
I am going to show you now how this device
works.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:00.260
Once you open the car door, you turn the ignition
key. While the key is in this position wait 20 seconds.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:11.159
Next, you plug the device into the OBD.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.380
Right from the moment when the device is connected,
it automatically identifies whether the car

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.170
you are connecting the device to is gasoline
or diesel and which ECU type it has built in.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:34.389
After successful identification, it establishes
communication with ECU and then removes immo.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.260
When immo is removed, the device also checks
if the procedure has been carried out correctly.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:50.200
The device has a three-step function. First,
it identifies a car and ECU type.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.760
Second, it establishes communication with
ECU and removes immo.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.200
Third, it ensures that immo has gone through
removal process correctly.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.420
The whole procedure lasts about 1 until 2
minutes.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.600
As soon as immo has been removed, diodes blink
this way.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:27.440
At this point, you can be absolutely sure
that immo has been removed from your car.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:40.790
Every Bypass Gold Edition device has its own
serial number, of which CarLabImmo keeps a record.
