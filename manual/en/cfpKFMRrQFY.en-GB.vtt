00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Encik Misral bin Komeng proofs that fish breeding can be done at a confined place.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.700
He succeeded in breeding and selling ornamental fish at the confined spaces of his small house.

00:00:22.415 --> 00:00:24.415
We will show how it was done.

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:41.700
By 2010, the Fishery Dept projected that the ornamental fish industry could reach 800 million fishes yearly.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.676
This can be translated into RM300 Million

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:58.600
Currently about 250 local species of exotic and ornamental fish can be breed in Malaysia. Buyers are locals and internationals.  

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.960
Within 3 months the short production period can produce approximately 40-50% profit margin.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:22.000
Encik Misral bin Komeng works hard to acheive success via ornamental fish breeding.

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:28.831
It started in 1997.

00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:30.214
In the beginning

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.139
I have no land

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.003
nor big areas

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.640
I started with undeveloped bush areas

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.380
Streams and also river areas.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.520
We have demands to supply ornamental fish

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.360
Some are big and some small orders.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.120
I marketed these fish in 3 ways

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:19.400
Firstly, for the locals, from this village especially the anglers, aquarium lovers and some small fish for fish feed too.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.100
Next, I supply direct to aquarium shops

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.180
Encik Misral is at the breeding place near his house.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.540
Ornamental fish are treated by some as living jewels.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:45.740
This is due to the variety species, colors, shapes, nature and it's habitat which attracts fish lovers globally.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.840
To keep up with stock, artificial breeding is done.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.700
Chosen fish will be injected with hormones to encourage spawning to the hatching of new eggs.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.560
The fish industry will be bright in the future

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:19.723
Small business need lots of support from certain agencies

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.200
Normally the problem came when feed and transportation cost inflates.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.160
To grow, he also needed support in infrastructure, marketing and distribution

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:46.160
The government agencies are trying to help these small industries with some planning.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.960
Malaysia is the 2nd biggest world ornamental fish producer.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.400
We provide about 10% world supply.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.440
The prospect for this industry is good because the global demand is increasing at the rate of 10-15% yearly.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:22.700
It was a target that Malaysia will be the No.1 global supply for high quality ornamental fish like Gold Fish, Koi, Guppy and Kelisa that will worth 7.7billion.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:32.900
Ornamental fish are very valuable. The ratio if compared with edible fish is (1:100) ornamental fish is 100 times more valuable.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.020
Or approximately worth at RM5.94Million per ton

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:49.440
Small business like this must be helped so as the overall income for the nation improves.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:05.600
That's all for this time. Hopefully this video helps.
