00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.200
- Great, man!
- Our first cross!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.440
Welcome to Red Dead Redemption: 
Seth’s Gold Production Journal.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.200
Today, we’d like to explain what we 
have been doing for the last few months…

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.200
…but also why do we need 
a 15.000 euros budget.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.760
Tabernas Desert, Almería.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.520
Seth’s Gold will be a non profit fan film 
based on the original video game by Rockstar.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.080
Every Youtube project we work on, takes 
months to prepare, and this is no exception.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.880
Just like we did on Max Payne: 
Valhalla and Modern Warfare: Sunrise…

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.120
…we will film it in English but 
you’ll find Spanish subtitles available.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.920
However, this time, we’ll work with 
english actors for the main roles.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.600
You can find the script on the 
crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.840
There isn’t a single line 
on it that can’t be shoot.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.320
However, that means 
building a cemetery in Toledo…

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.480
…filming a stagecoach 
crossing the desert in Almería…

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.160
…or using the Western studios in Tabernas.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.000
The places we’ve chosen are 
authentic icons in film history.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.000
That’s why you won’t find it 
difficult to recognize film locations…

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.120
…from movies such us The Good, the Bad and 
the Ugly, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade…

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.240
…or Conan the Barbarian.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.960
On the musical side, we’ll count 
again with Hary Haja’s talent…

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.640
…who has already composed music for the 
film, such as the one your listening to.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.820
However, this time we have 
taken it into a whole new level.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.400
Do you remeber that part of the game...

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.960
...when you arrive to Mexico for the first time...

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200
...you cross the river...

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.320
...and a song by José González called “Far away” starts to play?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.440
Well, we have recorded our own cover...

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.680
...but don't worry, because we didn’t sing it ourselves.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.360
We’ve got guitars, choirs, drums, a viola...

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.920
...and the outstanding voice of María Katt.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.000
You are currently listening to a teaser, but you will have 
to wait for the final shortfilm to listen to the full version.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.040
As you can see, the project we’ve 
got on our hands can be memorable.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.600
No one paints oneself into a corner just 
for the love of arts, films, movies and videogames.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.760
And right now, the only thing that tears us apart...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.080
...is a “Fistful of Dollars”

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.960
Starting from 10€ your name 
will appear on the short film credits.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.240
In addition, there are several perks that 
include a 70x100 cm poster like this one...

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640
...exclusively designed by Francisco Iglesias Periañez.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.640
A customized video which includes the original actors...  

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.920
...a t-shirt...

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.080
...or put your name into one of 
the cemetery crosses and much more.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.000
