&gt;&gt;Wade: Hi, I'm Wade Winger with the INDATA
Project at Easter Seals Crossroads in Indiana.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.510
You know,
we are kinda crazy about the Apple Products-the

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.990
iPad, the iPod and those kind of devices.
We are going

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.570
to spend a few minutes here with Carol Girt,
one of our Equipment Specialists, talking

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.099
about some
really neat stuff who have visual impairments

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.359
using those Apple devices.
&gt;&gt;Carol: Hello, my name is Carol Girt and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.529
I'm the Equipment Loan Specialist at INDATA.
One of the

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:37.950
things we do is lend various pieces of equipment
to see if it will work for you. One of the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.181
most
popular items at the moment is the iPad and

00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:50.330
the iPad2. It has many, many uses. It has
uses for the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.740
hearing, or I should say, non-hearing population,
and for the low-vision population, as well

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.260
as
for communication for people who have difficulty

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.590
speaking. Today, I'm going to show you some
apps that

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:21.240
are really cool for the low-vision population.
You can see on here that I have a lot of applications.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:32.990
They are for various people. This one I like
really well. It's called Magnifier. It is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:41.649
free. You can
see my niece. If I pull it out enough, you

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.789
can see her. You can see all kinds of things.
You can

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:57.799
read the newspaper with it. You can see various
things. It goes from 1x all the way up to

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:06.149
9x. It can
take a picture and allow you to bring it up

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.119
to your eyes to see it much easier. It can
be used in the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.880
grocery store as well. Another one, is a fun
one...

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:26.400
&gt;&gt;ipad VoiceOver" 9 minus 3 equals 6.
&gt;&gt;Carol: ... So it's a talking calculator.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.250
The thing that is really nice about this is
that it does

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:45.860
have very large numbers. (Pause) Map Quest.
It's going to try to find me, but I can, with

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.230
my voice,
tell it where I want to go, which is always

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.120
a good thing to have happen. It actually does
have me on

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.450
Keystone Avenue on Kingsway Drive. Let me
blow it up a little bit. So, if I wanted to,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.320
I could go
down to some of these other placesand put

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.970
my places and make it give me directions,
verbally.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:31.320
The Money Reader. This is a cool one. It's
going to use the camera and I'm going to slip

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.810
this back here
behind.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.720
&gt;&gt;ipad VoiceOver: 50 dollars.
&gt;&gt;Carol: There you go! And it told me how

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.470
much it actually was. It doesn't have to see
the numbers to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.780
actually tell you what the bill is. It can
somehow reads things along the bill and tells

00:03:50.780 --> 00:04:02.530
you what it is.
Another one that I found very neat, cool is

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.840
My Quick Recordings. I can make a note to
myself. I can

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.630
tell it, "Today I'm going to do this Tech
Tip."

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:20.769
&gt;&gt;Quick Voice VoiceOver: "I can tell it today
that, I'm going to do this Tech Tip."

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:33.240
&gt;&gt;Carol: Now, there's another one in here.
They are hard to find upside down. This is

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.210
a calendar and
it will give you reminders. (For example)

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.219
I can say that I've got to see the man about
a new car. I can

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:55.020
stop it and it will give me a time. It's approximately
1:35pm and it will give me this reminder in

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:06.610
5 minutes. In 5 minutes it will speak up and
remind me of my own message. So, it's pretty

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:15.710
cool. That's
just a few of the applications that are one

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.789
itunes. I can continually looking for new
ones everyday.

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.960
So, thank you and bye!
&gt;&gt;Wade: So, that's your Tech Tip for this

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.690
week. I'm Wade Wingler with the INDATA Project
in Indiana.
