00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.849
Well it's officially midsummer July 4th
has passed us and the water temps are up

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.080
into the 70s and that's got the fish
really really aggressive hey I came back

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.470
out here to Devil's Lake this week I was
out here earlier this year for the pike

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.590
bite but I'll tell you I couldn't pass
up coming back out here for the bite

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.350
that's going on right now stay right
where you're at there's some great

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.910
walleye action coming up on Fish Ed!

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.710
With all these boats go into these two
broad systems these Lindy Rod socks are

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.260
so important and what's really cool
about them is they come in three

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.680
different sizes, you can slide these things
in and out of your tubes without having

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.580
to worry about breaking an eye

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Got em!

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.500
Oh yeah! That one's got a little juice in
him that's one thing about the bait I'm

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.729
using today is it for some reason has
just proven to be one of those baits

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.630
that just flat-out
makes fish attack it and that is a great

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.930
walleye to start my day right there look
at that one let me show you what I'm

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.660
doing today because the odds are you
have not seen a bait like what I'm using

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.820
unless you've seen it in some magazines
are purchased one here just recently

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.700
this is all new Lindy Lil'Guy. Look
at that it's a great way to start our

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.100
day right there I'm gonna throw this guy
in the live well, and then I'll show you that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.750
bait because I'll tell you what this
thing is something special I'm always

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.860
excited when I get the chance to fish
these because the bites these things

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.140
create are just unbelievable I mean that
fish came up and just drilled it but

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.340
this is what it is it's called the
Lil'Guy and what it is is it's a 36

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.840
inch Snell, now this is 14 pound
fluorocarbon all right so this thing can

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.290
stand up to the teeth that these fish
are going to going to put on this thing

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.010
so whether it's Pike or walleye or
whatever it may be but then what we have

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.510
is we have a crawler harness and this
thing is tied in such a way that we have

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.690
a lot of distance in between the hooks
that's going to make sure that we can

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.769
get that hook in the back of the crawler
then the other thing that we have is

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.660
beads that all kind of match the color
of the bodies but this body is is a

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.790
plastic and what this thing does is it
runs like a crankbait in the water but

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.680
it also floats so this little body will
attract them from a distance and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.220
actually look like a crankbait in the
water but I'm running it down at crawler

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.000
harness speed and that just makes them
attack it now one other thing that's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.049
really cool about how you can fish this
thing is because this little body floats

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.040
when I'm pulling this thing back behind
that bottom bouncer a lot of times I'll

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.150
just set it down where a spinner would
drop into the bottom at that point and

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.040
be ineffective what happens is this
Lil'Guy actually floats up and when

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.400
this thing floats up if there's a fish
following it they just attack it and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.489
that's exactly what happened on that
fish right there. I'm going to get back in

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.280
the water because I'll tell you
what I guarantee you we're going to

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.430
catch a lot of fish on these things
today and because we're out here at

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.790
Devils Lake we get to fish two lines so
I got one out over here trying some

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:45.080
different colors - that is a neat thing
about the gloves just pick that fish up

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.790
and then break me in my hooks now just
come up smacked it when I stopped it

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:01.510
let's hope this is an eye, it is a oh yeah
it's a good walleye! Look at that one

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.359
all right well that was a great example
of what I was talking about earlier

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.609
though I stopped that bait set that
bottom bouncer on the bottom and as

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.599
soon as I lifted this wall I was there
and he just drilled it and that's what

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.669
the official do with this bait you know
it's it's a hybrid, it's kind of

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.940
between a crankbait and a spinner and
it's it's everything that a walleye or a

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.550
pike attacks you know they when they hit
a crankbait they come a long ways and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.919
they slash and they nail it they do the
same thing on a spinner to a certain

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.509
point and that's a dynamite eye right
there but you put the two of them

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.810
together and you slow this thing down
because I can go a little slower than

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.620
crankbait speed but yet I can go a
little bit faster than spinner speed

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.169
it's the perfect bait for that
neighborhood of you know maybe 1 to 1.5

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.210
1.6 miles an hour and it just catches
fish that's awesome throw him in there

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.740
we are set up on classic Midlake
structure now this is an old roadbed

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.550
here that I'm fishing today and the fish
are just stacked up on the windy side

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.389
the wind is actually going down and that
got me a little bit nervous so I'm

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.870
starting to do is work off the edges a
little bit earlier today when we first

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.930
pulled in here the wind was blowing a
little bit harder and those fish were

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.470
right up on top now I'm just working
that north edge of it and I'm going back

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.010
and forth on the windy side and I'm
catching them pretty good all said and

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.650
done though that's what you want to look
for now you're looking for that Midlake

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.820
stuff we're into the 70s we're in we're
in summertime patterns and these fish

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.090
are going to be out roaming stuff other
than the shoreline stuff they were on

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.050
last time we were out here

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:49.740
feels they hit it and they mean business
another great eye look at that oh I missed him

00:05:49.740 --> 00:06:17.300
them I was close pretty good one he's a
nice great eater boy that right there

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.199
is agreat way to wrap the day what let's do
this

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.039
let me give you a couple tips about how
to fish this bait because that he got

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.159
himself unhooked for us that's a great
walleye right there but because that

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.939
beats brand-new
I know mostly I'll be buying it and

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:35.219
trying it for the first time there's a
couple things I want to show you about

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:41.129
it and tell you number one is what I'm
doing a lot of the time here is I'm

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.879
pinching off my crawler right behind
that second hook the reason I'm doing

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.689
that is because we have so much space in
between these hooks and by the time you

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.499
put that body here if you left that full
crawler back here that's an awful big

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:56.159
meal and too often they'll come up and
grab the back end of it and you won't

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.369
get a hook in them so all I'm doing is
I'm pinching that thing off about an

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:03.509
inch behind the back hook the other
thing I'm doing is I'm putting constant

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.599
movement down there now when you're
working this thing you're actually even

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.019
on monofilament when you pull that thing
forward if you're at a 45 degree angle

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:14.099
you're going to feel the wobble just
like in a crank bait I'm doing a lot of

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.129
work in that bait then every now and
then I'll just put it in the rod holder

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:20.610
but if you notice I've got more fish
today on the handheld rod and that's

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.599
because I'm putting constant action on
the bait this is going to be a great

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:28.259
bait no matter where you fish so I don't
care if you're fishing Mille Lacs, Lake of

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:32.909
the woods, Winnebago or out here in the
Dakotas it doesn't matter this thing is

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:36.869
going to catch fish wherever you go and
we've done it for the last year so make

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:39.719
sure you pick a few of these Lindy
little guys up give them a shot because

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:42.689
they're going to catch ton of fish for
you and there are a lot of fun one last

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:46.559
thing when they hit it don't feed them
wine just drop the rod tip a hair and

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:50.249
set the hook and he'll be there every
time I'm John Thelen we'll catch you

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:52.639
next time
