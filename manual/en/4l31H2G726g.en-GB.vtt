00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.800
- (James) This is Simba, he’s 17 months old. He’s a cheeky chappy. 
We signed up for BorrowMyDoggy because

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.680
we were really worried about owning a dog 
and the responsibility it was and that he was getting enough love.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.440
- (Mindy) Being a photographer it means that I get lots of last minute jobs
come in and I have to travel out of the country very quickly

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.800
and it’s just not possible for me to have my own dog.
But it’s made me realise that also I don’t need my own dog right now

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.480
and I can look after other people’s dogs that need help.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.640
- (James) BorrowMyDoggy has helped us through 
a fairly difficult time. My wife’s needed regular hospital treatment

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.200
and it was something that we weren’t expecting when we got Simba.
And that’s really taken some of the pressure off

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.760
giving him the walks and the love that he needs.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.880
- (Mindy) Simba is so, so, so sweet 
and he’s got such kind eyes, and he loves to be cuddled

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.400
and he loves to be played with 
and he’s always so excited to see me.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.160
- (James) For us, it’s quite tough to own a dog 
and to be able to carry out all our commitments

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.280
and this kind of flexibility that BorrowMyDoggy offers us,
gives us that kind of opportunity to give him love when we are not there.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.360
It’s made a massive difference to my wife’s life having Simba there,
giving her unconditional love, fun and entertainment along the way.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.520
We got in contact with four people; three of those
they are now regular borrowers of Simba, so a very high success rate.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.040
- (Mindy) When I first saw Simba’s profile,
he looked perfect for me, there was a picture of him and James together

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.480
and he looked really, really sweet and he reminded me of my dog growing up.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.200
- (James) When I started looking at matches, I was surprised
how many people were on the website and how passionated people were

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.120
with regards to their stories of when they’ve owned dogs in the past 
or the fact that it would be a dream for them to do so,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.600
but practical implications mean that they can’t.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.040
- (Mindy) I thought the signing up fee was really, really cheap
and I thought ‘Perfect’, even if it didn’t work out it didn’t matter,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.520
so I was willing to give it a go.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.920
- (James) It’s definitely been a community thing;
I’ve met more people in the local neighbourhood than I ever had before.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.120
Every person who comes through the door,
he’s excited to see, he thinks they might be coming to walk him!
