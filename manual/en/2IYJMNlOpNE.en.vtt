Hey guys, it's Clarissa, and you're probably
wondering why I have a big American Flag behind

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.070
me, and stars on my face, and red lipstick,
which I never wear...

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.320
I just feel so patriotic right now! (4th of
july music) America - (crickets) Anyway, today

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.030
I'm going to be showing you guys 4th of july
makeup, outfits, hair, DIY, treats, and nail

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.500
ideas, so it's going to be 1 huge ultimate
girls guide to have an epic awesome 4th of

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.460
July this year, so I hope you guys enjoy this
video, and let's get started!

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.130
(patriotic American USA music)

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.630
So first I'm going to be showing you guys
a very quick and easy hairstyle and makeup

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.820
look that's super patriotic and fun to wear!

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.470
For my makeup, I'm starting off wearing a
waterproof bb cream that will last all day

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.950
no matter what I'm doing, and I decided to
go for a very blue and patriotic look for

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.590
my eye makeup, but before I do anything, I'm
priming my eyes using my covergirl shadowblast

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.500
primer so that my eyeshadow will last all
day.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.920
Now for a simple and super fast eyeshadow
look, I'm applying the golden color from my

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.700
almay neutral eyeshadow stick all over my
eyelids, and blending it in with my fingers,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.200
then I'm applying the darker side of the same
eyeshadow stick to my creases.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.610
Next I'm using the lightest color from my
Revlon photoready eyeshadow kit to highlight

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.440
my browbones and the inner corners of my eyes,
and once I'm done with that, I'm using a bright

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.580
blue eyeliner from Rimmel to line underneath
my eyes for a pop of color, then for my upper

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.640
lash line, I'm using a black liquid liner
from Rimmel to do a little winged eyeliner,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.520
and to finish off my eyes, I'm applying some
maybelline butterfly mascara to my top and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.520
bottom lashes.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.700
Now since it's fourth of July, of course we
need some bright red lipstick, but sadly,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.400
I don't have a bright enough red lipstick,
so I'm actually using my NYX red lipliner

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.560
pencil to outline AND fill in my lips, and
it worked pretty well!

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.810
To finish off, I'm adding a little more patriotic
flare by gluing on three red white and blue

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.599
star jems with some eyelash glue to my left
cheek just below my eye, and then I'm all

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.599
done with my makeup!

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.069
Now for my hair, I had already curled it using
the no-heat method I showed you guys in my

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.590
"no-heat summer hairstyles video" so I'm just
adding a little more volume with some hair

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.060
volumizing powder, and then I'm using my Toni
and Guy sea-salt texturizing spray to give

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.090
it some more texture.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.810
Now I'm doing a small braid at the front of
my head on one side, and using a bobby pin

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.129
to pin it back behind my ear, and that's it!
this hairstyle is seriously SO easy, and it's

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.920
a great way to keep some of your hair out
of your face, while still having the look

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.980
of wearing your hair down

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:01.290
Next I'm going to be showing you guys a VERY
easy patriotic manicure, and just so you guys

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.349
know, I'm not very good at doing my nails,
so if I can do this manicure, you guys probably

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.680
will be able to as well!

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.819
To start off, I'm painting my index, thumb,
and pinkie nails with a bright red nailpolish,

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.469
then for the other two nails, I'm using a
few coats of white nailpolish.

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:17.080
Next I'm painting my middle finger with a
glittery top coat, and then I'm using a toothpick

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.080
to draw a line of blue nailpolish across the
top of my nail, then adding a few bigger pieces

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.579
of glitter to make it sparkle a bit more.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.599
For my ring finger, I'm painting 4 red stripes,
and that's it!

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.359
If you want to have a super yummy, quick,
and patriotic snack, these fruit parfaits

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.620
are perfect to make and share with your friends
and family!

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.430
All you need to make them is some whipped
cream, blueberries, strawberries or raspberries,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.739
greek yogurt, some sprinkles, and some bowls
or parfait glasses.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.030
Start by washing the strawberries and blueberries,
then cut the strawberries into quarters, and

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.030
set them aside.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.060
Now take the blueberries, and use them to
fill the bottom third of your parfait glass,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.510
then add a layer of greek yogurt and smooth
it out.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.569
Now add a layer of strawberries, and then
top it off with as much whipped cream as you

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.569
want!

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.310
I also decided to add some sprinkles for some
extra color, but if you want to make it healthier,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.349
you can totally leave out the sprinkles, and
replace the whipped cream with yogurt, and

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.349
you're set to go!

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.670
This is seriously SO delicious, and it only
takes a few minutes to make!

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:19.760
Next I'm going to be showing you guys 4 super
cute outfit ideas perfect for the 4th of July,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.190
but first I'm gonna show you guys how to make
this super cute and easy DIY american flag

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.190
crop top!

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.889
All you need is a plain t-shirt, iron on paper,
scissors, and an iron.

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.810
Start by searching google images for an american
flag design you like, then drag it into a

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.440
pages document, adjust the size, and print
it out onto your iron on paper!

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.150
Now lay out your t-shirt on a flat surface,
and make a mark on both sides of the tshirt

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.630
where you want your crop top to stop.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.210
Now cut off the bottom of the shirt from mark
to mark, and stretch out the fabric to make

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.540
the edges curl.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.190
To give the t-shirt a more relaxed feel, cut
off the edges of the sleeves as well, and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.910
then set your iron to pre-heat to the highest
setting without steam.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.791
While your iron is pre-heating, cut away the
excess paper from around your flag, and decide

00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.230
where you want to place the design on your
shirt.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.630
Once your iron is heated, iron on the flag
following the instructions on your package

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.380
iron-on paper, and you're done!

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.700
For my outfit with this shirt, I'm wearing
a pair of high-waisted shorts from Forever

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:21.700
21, a pair of white converse from macy's,
and a pair of sunglass from Target!

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.120
This next outfit idea is perfect for a 4th
of July barbeque, and it's super comfy and

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.530
cute, so I'm just wearing a summery white
dress from Kohl's, a pair of sandals from

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:40.720
Target, and a patriotic headband from Forever
21!

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.570
Next up is another outfit that's awesome for
a pool party, or hanging out at the beach

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.090
or the pool with your friends, and again,
it's super patriotic and festive!

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.090
My shorts are from Forever 21, my bikini is
from Target, my flowy shirt is from Aeropostal,

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.790
and I'm wearing the same headband from Forever
21!

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:05.010
As you guys can see, this last outfit idea
is much fancier, so it's perfect for a fancy

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.890
party or date on the 4th of July!

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.330
So I'm just wearing a red dress from Forever
21, a Jean Jacket from Target, a pair of heels

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.730
from Macy's, and my ring and earrings are
from Kohl's.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:30.530
