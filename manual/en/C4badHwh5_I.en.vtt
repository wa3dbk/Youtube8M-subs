Alright. Now let's put the roofs away first.
Let's get the base. Now

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:24.160
I'm going to put on the front of the house
first. So let's check. Okay this liquid is

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:34.520
alright. So I turn it around but I try not
to touch these sticky things. And I put some

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:58.910
honey at the bottom of this bit. So let's
use it like you use the glue. Okay. Good.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:07.220
And then as this is our base let's use some
honey. I will put the backside of the front

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.810
bit to this side and that's how I'm going
to glue them together. Okay. So let's see.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:32.790
Okay. Now let's press it together as hard
as you can and hold it there for a while.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.470
Okay. You can even put an object in front
of it. Maybe you can put a mug there that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.150
should keep it together until you stick the
other sides. So I'm going to put this mug

00:01:49.150 --> 00:02:06.650
here. Okay. Just to hold it. Okay. Now let's
do the same with the backside of the house.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:15.489
Please be careful which way you are putting
it on because it goes like that because all

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:24.510
the Christmas decorations are all around.
Okay so let's put the honey at the bottom

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:45.819
of this side. Okay it doesn't need to be too
thick but it should be thick enough to hold

00:02:45.819 --> 00:03:21.909
these bits together. Okay after that you put
some on this side. Okay. And then again, just

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:49.339
press it together. Hold it there for a while.
So I'm going to put maybe this jar here. Okay.

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:58.049
And hold it here like that. Yeah that looks
good.
