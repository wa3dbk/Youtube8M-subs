under the Christmas tree and leave
brandy and the mince pie out for him on

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.310
Christmas Eve for adults it means
braving busy stores to find the perfect

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.390
presents for those they love but always
remember it's the thought that counts

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.470
christmas is a time for families to
gather together and central to this is

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.689
the Christmas dinner the whole family
sits down together to eat a heavy meal

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.430
of Turkey and all of the trimmings
followed by Christmas pudding for

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.250
dessert often we pull Christmas crackers
and inside these are terrible jokes

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.790
cheap presents and paper Christmas hats
after lunch while everyone is waiting

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.979

broadcast the most famous of these is

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.850

and ITV at 3:00 p.m. and the Queen

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.009

message that usually speaks of tolerance

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.939
and forgiveness

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.350
if you send the letter to Santa and
address it to the North Pole then it

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.210
will go to the North Pole if you address
it to Santa's grotto then instead it
