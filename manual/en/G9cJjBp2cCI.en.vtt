00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:07.190
Today on this 2011 Chevrolet HHR we are going
to install part number RM-154 from Roadmaster.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.800
This is their universal wiring kit.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.350
The first thing we need to do is go ahead
and run the wires from front to rear with

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.350
the 4-pole flat.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.830
And we are going to be using the big loop
for that purpose.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.320
It has two ends on there.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.350
And we are just going to chop off one end
and run that to the back.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.810
OK, we are going to start off by attaching
our wire to the base plate of the vehicle

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810
itself.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.962
And we will allow for some extra length there
in case we want to change over to a different

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:32.962
type of connector.

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:37.040
Go ahead and zip-tie that off and then work
it towards the back of the vehicle.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.030
When we run it to the back we want to make
sure that we stay away from anything moving

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.260
like the suspension or anything that gets
hot like the exhaust.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.760
Everybody will run there wire a different
way, but those are the guidelines you want

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.980
to go by.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.969
We need to run our wires to the inside of
the body to get to our wire harness.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.820
So basically what we are going to do is this
corner right here on the sheet metal is we

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.719
are going to go ahead and drill a hole out.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.129
And we will install a grommet and then run
our wires through the inside.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.090
1:03
OK, we will take our wire.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.950
We will push it on the inside and then we
will go ahead and secure it.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.880
And then we will go ahead and fill up the
remaining opening with some silicone.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.069
Let us go ahead and pull out our wire harness
that we just ran to the inside.

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.719
Now we will go ahead and disconnect the wire
harness to the turn signal and running light,

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.829
which is the one on top.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.850
And just pull on this tab a little bit and
it comes right apart.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.219
And you will also see that it has another
wire harness already added to it.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.240
This is from a previous install.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.279
This is going to be the spot where we are
going to install our diodes.

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:38.919
So what we are going to do is simply take
this and move it up the wire a little bit.

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:42.261
We already tested our wire harness and we
know that the green wire is going to be our

00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.289
turn signal and brake signal.

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.119
And the brown wire is going to be for the
running light circuit.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.439
And our wire harness that we ran from the
front basically is going to be color for color.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:02:37.349
Green is going to be our right turn and brake

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:53.019
signal and brown is going to be 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:04.409
our running light.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:33.129
We will start with the right turn signal and
brake.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:43.620
We will just cut the wire in half.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:04:01.859
We will stripe the wires 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:23.830
back 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:36.669
and add our terminals to each side.

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.999
