00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.279
The breadth of excellence here at Michigan is almost unmatched in the academy.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.630
And that's our advantage

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.730
it's the potential for synergy across so many units, and the ability to get them

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.109
to work together

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.200
in ways that no other institution can really do. 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.750
We have to forget what our label is, what our discipline is,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.039
and we have to say: "Who do we need in the room

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.740
 to make important advances

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.250
 on an important problem?" 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.079
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.680
 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.899
I think that imposes a special obligation on us 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.500
to reach out and attract the most talented students

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.120
regardless of their background, their economics status,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.380
their race, and help them grow to help drive us into the future.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.100
So I think at a core 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.730
what makes a public university special

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.500
 is its commitment to the public good – and what I mean by that is we take seriously our mission

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.530
 to transform the public through education and research.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.729
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.509
We want to do things with impact – we want to do things that make a difference to people,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.500
 to economies, to our children's futures. And at Michigan we do so every day – 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.670
we deliver high quality, cutting-edge health care;

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.090
 we provide artistic and cultural opportunities;

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.180
 we have wonderful athletic teams that give our student community a sense of excitement

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080
 and our alumni connectedness.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.520
But at our heart, we're a place that does research

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.980
and teaching for the benefit of society.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.720
To me, it's really the sum of the everyday

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.530
that's the University of Michigan's impact -

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.810
 and that's the sum of the impact across 43,000 total students here in Ann Arbor

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.150
 and many thousands more in Flint and Dearborn.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.860
They're learning or practicing lifelong skills

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.120
 that not only will help them, but will raise us up as a society.
