Hello, my name's Tara, and today I'm going
to be sharing with you some of my tips on

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.780
using [Google] AdWords for Ecommerce websites.
AdWords has got lots of functions which work

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.650
really well with Ecommerce sites as well as
a few which were designed specifically for

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.520
them. This makes a great platform to help
your Ecommerce business. I'm going to go over

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.770
a few of the functions I like using and then
give you a couple of tips on using each of

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.770
those functions well.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.279
So let's start with bid adjustments. Bid adjustments
have been kind of advertised by Google as

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.560
something to use if you've got a local business
or if you've got a business that's affected

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.320
by time of day, perhaps like a restaurant
or even location if you've got a physical

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.550
store. But, actually, bid adjustments work
really well on Ecommerce sites too.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.210
For example, if you look in the data that
you can find in the Dimensions tab, and you'll

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.079
see that actually there's probably quite a
bit of a trend and you can see certain locations

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.370
will convert better than others. You can then
look at adjusting your location bid adjustments

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.780
to suit where you get the most conversions.
So don't be afraid of using bid adjustments

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.240
even though they're not typically for Ecommerce
sites because they do work well with them.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.899
The same with bid adjustments, as I explained
with locations, is true with time of day.

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.170
So you'll definitely find a trend in the certain
times of day where people convert best or

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.529
when people are perhaps doing more research.
You can maybe capitalise by using your bid

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:31.740
adjustments to make sure your ads are really
prominent when people are more likely to convert.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.369
Dynamic remarketing is a fairly new functionality,
and it allows AdWords to kind of step up in

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.170
line with lots of other remarketing platforms.
It basically allows AdWords to pull in the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.709
products which your users have looked at dynamically
into ads and create them for you based on

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.310
the cookies that are left on that user's PC.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.990
So to use them, you need the AdWords remarketing
code, not the Google Analytics remarketing

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.950
code, but you can use both on your site. You
also need to customise another piece of code

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.000
which goes on every page of the site too.
You might need a developer to do that for

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.750
you if you're not too confident with code,
but once that stage is out of the way, the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.390
creation of the ads and everything else is
quite straightforward. So it's definitely

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.320
something I'd recommend doing if you've got
lots of products on your site because remarketing

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.810
is really good at generating a low cost for
conversions and also great for brand awareness.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.740
Product listing ads are another function specifically
for Ecommerce sites. If you've ever searched

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.280
for something online and your search has got
a kind of commercial intent behind it, for

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.220
example, if you searched for prices of shoes,
you might find the ads in the top right-hand

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.170
corner of the search results page have kind
of like a grid of square images and they then

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.620
have a price below them and a little line
of description. Those are product listing

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.640
ads.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.531
To get them, you need to have a Google Merchant
Center, and you need to have a really well

00:02:55.531 --> 00:03:01.460
optimised product feed. So it means filling
in every single row of detail that you can

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.220
for every single field for that product in
your Google Merchant Center. AdWords then

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.750
pulls in data from Google Merchant Center
and matches it to user's search queries.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.190
So it's kind of a form of dynamic marketing
really, and because of this you need to remember

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.320
to use lots of negative keywords. Google can
obviously then try to match your page content

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.950
to someone's search query. You don't have
as much control as when you bid on specific

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.430
keywords. So use lots of negative keywords.
Also use product targets, and the most important

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.960
thing is just to have a really well-optimised
Google Merchant Center product feed.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.680
Brand bidding is really important for Ecommerce
sites. If you're a boutique kind of outlet,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.100
where you've got several brands, make sure
you're bidding on all the different brands

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.360
that you stock and have them in separate campaigns,
because brand campaigns perform incredibly

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.250
well. If someone is searching for the brand,
the relevance of your ad to that brand is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.390
going to be really high. You're going to get
a good click-through rate, a low cost per

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.260
click, and it's going to overall help the
quality score of the entire account. So, because

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.480
of this, have lots of set product campaigns
for each of the brands you stock and make

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.510
sure that they are optimised well.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.030
YouTube advertising works well if you want
to increase brand awareness, but also if you've

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.889
got a product that's quite visual, it could
be really useful for actually selling the

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.710
product. For example, hair extension websites
tend to advertise using video tutorials on

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.740
how to apply them. Or if you've got something
more visual, for example, if you're selling

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.610
holidays, you might have reviews which are
videos. You can use them on YouTube and also

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.919
on your own site. With YouTube marketing,
it's got a really low cost per click, which

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.039
can make it cost effective if you're in an
industry which has got quite competitive cost

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.999
per click normally.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:56.349
Total conversion value is a metric which sometimes
gets overlooked in Ecommerce accounts. Often

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:04.020
we get caught up on kind of smaller metrics,
like cost per conversion or conversion rate.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.039
But, actually, if something has got a really
low cost per conversion, perhaps a good conversion

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.970
rate, we might think it's been really successful,
but if it's costing you as a total more than

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.729
it's making you in your total conversion value,
then it's obviously not cost effective to

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.029
be bidding on that keyword.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:26.020
So look at keyword level. Look at the total
spend for [each] keyword over a selected time

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.449
period and look at the total conversion value.
Just make sure that the conversion value justifies

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.009
that spend.

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.150
Site links, since they were upgraded with
enhanced campaigns, you can now have them

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.031
at ad group level, which is really handy for
Ecommerce sites. So say you've got an ad group

00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:47.150
which contains a certain product type and
that product type comes in different variations

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.580
like different colours or different sizes,
you could have the site link at ad group level

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.210
for each different product and variation,
so each size or each colour. Although your

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.840
ad groups are still going to be really split
out and targeted — so you'd have one ad

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.250
group for red shoes and one ad group for green
shoes — within those ad groups, having those

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.300
site links might actually attract someone
even more because they might be thinking "actually

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.479
I didn't realise they came in this colour"
and then have a look in addition to what they

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.319
were originally searching for.

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:23.129
So those are a few of my tips for using AdWords
for Ecommerce websites. If you've got any
