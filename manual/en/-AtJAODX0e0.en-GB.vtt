00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.509
Yo, yo, yo. How it's going game fans? It's
time for another Urban Gameplay video and

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.470
in this gaming video I'm going to be focused on my
Top 5 Resident Evil games of all time. If

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.190
you're a fan of the survival horror video
game genre whether you're new to gaming or

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.060
an old school gamer like myself, you should
be familiar with the Resident Evil series.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.880
I define Resident Evil as an epic strategic
adventure game. It provides spooky anticipation,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.980
plenty of gore and challenging gameplay. What
more can you ask for from a scary game? It's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.550
hard for anyone to ignore the fact that Resident
Evil has become one of the leading survival

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.829
horror video games from the genre and with
the series spanning back to 20 years, what

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.750
better way for me to pay homage to such a
fantastic franchise. I ain't going to lie,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.290
obviously as always all these lists are so
hard to put together because there's so much

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.399
titles in there. But I've tried my best to
cipher through the best Resident Evils that

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.930
I have personally played. If you feel you
know any better Resident Evil that should

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.239
be in this top 5. Certainly pop it in the
comments below. Anyway, I feel like I've rumbled

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.180
on way too much. Enough is enough, let's get
to showcase my favourite 5 Resident Evil games

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.400
of all time.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
Taking position number 5 is Resident
Evil Zero. Resident Evil Zero is a phenomenal

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.729
pre-sequel to the Resident Evil series and
as an Nintendo fan myself, I was really pleased

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.189
that this was an Nintendo exclusive. I was
supremely surprised how awesome the in game

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.950
sound was. It was so detailed that you could
hear the blades of the grass swing in the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.299
background as you move. The game contains
breathtaking cut scenes and character movement

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.799
was awesome. Which for a Resident Evil game
of it's time was miles ahead of anything you've

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.090
witnessed in a Resident Evil game beforehand.
I feel that the new features of the two characters

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.770
was such a great touch and all in all, this
was a nice foundation for all the Resident

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.200
Evils that followed this game. Great game.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.900
Taking the number 4 position is Resident Evil

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.270
2. I'm going to hold my hands up and admit
that this was actually the first Resident

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.780
Evil game that I have ever played. It introduced
me to such a fantastic franchise. Back when

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.080
Resident Evil 2 was released, I had to personally
take my hat of to capcom. As they made such

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.669
a fantastic survival horror video game. As
strategic as Resident Evil 2 was, it never lacked

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.509
any action. When you consider the available
weapons such as Machine Gun, Grenade Launcher

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:32.029
and C4 Explosives. You had to say that the
action was actually astonishing. I felt like

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:36.200
the character animation was really smooth
and really believable. The interactive backgrounds

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.590
was such a fantastic addition and also the
FMV sequences added so much intense feeling

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.829
around the game. It was such an amazing experience
playing this game for the first time. All

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.169
in all, Resident Evil 2 to me is one of the
games that I'll forever remember and I definitely

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.400
put this down as a PlayStation 1 classic.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.740
Claiming position number 3 is Resident Evil

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.620
5. Resident Evil 5 to me is a classic game
on the PS3 and Xbox 360. With the co-op addition

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.879
to the game. It brings the Resident Evil series
experience to a whole new level, having the

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.249
privilege of taking on scary adventure with
a friend, either locally or online. To me

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.969
that is just phenomenal. In saying that if
you ever get a chance to play this game with

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:25.159
the AI. The AI will definitely get on your
nerves, but I guess it's a work in progress

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.029
by having the companion with you. It seems
that every single Resident Evil game that's

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:33.609
released there is always an improvement, whether
it be weaponry, because Weaponry in this game

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.929
is fantastic. Whether it be graphics, the
graphics are astonishing in Resident Evil

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:42.559
5 or even if it's the story. The story is
another fantastic addition to this game. All

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:46.389
in all, Resident Evil 5 is a big, big game
and if you've never played this game before,

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.300
you have a PS3 or an Xbox 360, it's definitely
worth giving this game a shot.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.680
Holding up the number 2 position is Resident Evil Code:
Veronica. I ain't even gonna lie, Resident

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.700
Evil Code: Veronica nearly stole my number
1 position as I absolutely love this game.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.540
When I first played this game back on the
DreamCast demo disk, I couldn't wait for the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.799
game to be released. This game was such a
fantastic game even visually when you look

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.579
back on the DreamCast days, you had to really
respect what Capcom did with this game. Prior

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.990
to Resident Evil Code: Veronica's release
I wasn't really a fan of Resident Evil 3 Nemesis

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.370
and I felt that when Code: Veronica dropped
it got me back into the series. For me, Code:

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.680
Veronica boasts as one of the greatest stories
told in a Resident Evil game. The plot has

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:39.000
so many twists. It's so unreal. The gameplay
was definitely challenging, but also fun at

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.689
the same time. Some of the boss fights were
epic and even though I've had to replay this

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.879
game so many times because I saved at the
wrong position. The game was still phenomenal.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.509
I must say at the time of Code: Veronica's
release it was definitely one of the best

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.560
Resident Evil games that I have played and
certainly one of my favourite DreamCast games

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.300
of all time.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.300
Claiming my number 1 position
of Resident Evil games of all time is Resident

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.050
Evil 4. For me Resident Evil 4 was the first
in the Series to change the style of how the

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.330
Resident Evil plays game and took on a more
action approach and believe me when I say

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.430
I loved this change. Even though I loved this
change, I do still like the previous Resident

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.210
Evil style where you had to be a bit more
strategic by rationing your items such as

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.500
your herbs, bullets or save ribbons. But trust
me by making the game more action based made

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.169
you feel good putting bullets into a zombie
and not worrying about not being able to pick

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.750
up any more ammo during the level. The story
was as good as ever in Resident Evil 4 and

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.090
the boss battles were amazing. The selection
of weapons were satisfying and the game is

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.830
scary as ever. I had this game on the GameCube
and definitely was one of my favourite games

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.139
on the console. Thanks peeps for taking time
