00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.520
Alright, and in this step what we're going
to do is go ahead and fold our squash book.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.210
So we can get the affect of the folds. And
so when it opens and closes it gives the accordion

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.699
look. OK? I'll go ahead and just do that right
now. Now you're going to have, you have three

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.630
sections of squares. The two on the end are
going to go inward. So what we're going to

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:33.210
do is fold those this way. I'll go ahead and
I'll fold this one this way again. So that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:43.780
way when we fold it they go down. So in our
next step, go ahead and fold it right in half.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:55.940
OK, I got those. And I'm going to go ahead
and take the middle and I'm going to fold

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:10.500
it inward together. So it has a outward crease.
So it's going to look like that. OK. We got

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:29.310
those bends. Alright, go ahead and fold these
inward. OK, go ahead and fold that inward

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.570
again. Lot of creases and a lot of folding.
Almost like too that you're going to be folding

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.311
each one in half, each of the individual squares
in half. It's kind of basically what it's

00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:53.799
looking like right now. There we go. OK. Now
if we fold this right, we're going to have

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:02.189
these coming in. You're going to want a solid
square on the end. So pull that in, pull the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.770
two ends in and the backside down. So you
have your square base. And then let's go ahead

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:19.190
and do that with the opposite end. See how
these folds. So, there's those. And then these

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:29.080
are supposed to go outward. I can get them
to go. There we go. I'll pull that down. Alright,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.800
there is our squash book. Well the folds of
our squash book. We're not quite done yet.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.330
So, I'm going to go ahead and show you again.
You're going to take the, take right end or

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.640
the right side of the squash book facing you
by those together. Squash that down. Take

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.510
the left side of the book. Pinch the two ends
together. Flatten that. And then you're going

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.900
to want to kind of push those away from you.
And then you're going to have your squash

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.450
book. OK? So our next step, what we're going
to go ahead and do is apply, go ahead and

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.450
cut our inside papers and that will be our
next step.
