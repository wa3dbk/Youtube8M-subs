00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.550
How to Make a Christmas Tree Centerpiece.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.500
Use old baby food jars and a little holiday
magic to create an earth-friendly and beautiful

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.400
decoration for your Christmas table.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:22.039
You will need 15 baby food jars White glue
A hammer A screwdriver Tin foil Christmas

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.850
lights Ribbon A bow Metallic paint A piece
of cardboard Two blocks of wood (optional)

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.890
Small pinecones (optional) Dried leaves (optional)
and cinnamon sticks (optional).

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.890
Step 1.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.190
Clean and dry all of the baby food jars.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.129
Remove any labels, and set the lids aside.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.129
Step 2.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.780
Set the jars on their sides and glue them
into the shape of a tree, with a row of five

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.360
jars forming the bottom, followed by a row
of four, then three, then two, and finally

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.610
one jar.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.700
Allow each row to dry before adding the next
row.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.690
Use two blocks of wood or other heavy objects
to brace the rows as they dry.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.690
Step 3.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.100
Punch a hole in each jar lid.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.830
Use the hammer to tap the screwdriver until
it makes a small hole, and then move the screwdriver

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.220
back and forth until the hole is large enough
to house a Christmas light.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.370
Step 4.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.500
Cover each hole with a piece of tin foil to
protect your hands while making the tree.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.870
Step 5.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.410
Insert a Christmas light into each lid.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.750
Then put the lids back on the jars so that
the lights are inside.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.610
Leave the cord hanging from the bottom of
the tree.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.230
Choose a strand of lights that matches your
home decor.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.900
Clear or single-color strands give a unified
look, while multicolored strands will reflect

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.010
light in different ways.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.010
Step 6.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.170
Add ribbon and other decorations.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.490
Wrap a large ribbon around the outside of
the tree and tie a bow on top.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.790
Use glue to keep your decorations in place.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.050
Paint small pinecones or dried leaves brushed
with metallic paint or gather sprigs of holly

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.770
to add to the decorations.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.210
Use cinnamon sticks to give off a delicious
aroma.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.210
Step 7.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.560
Cut a piece of cardboard to the size of your
tree.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.780
Paint it metallic silver or gold to match
your color scheme, and glue it to the back

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.149
of the tree to hide the jar lids.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.190
Step 8.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.050
Place your tree on a table or in the window
and plug it in.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.460
Dim your house lights and enjoy your new homemade
source of Christmas cheer.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.650
Did you know On December 24, 1923, President
Coolidge pushed the button to officially light

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.310
the first National Christmas tree.
