00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.600
Church: Hi.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.200
I'm Private Leonard Church from the popular web series Red Vs. Blue.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.520
Grif: And I'm Private Dexter Grif from the same show.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.720
Church: Some of you may know that we got our start here at Red Vs. Blue,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.980
when Computer Gaming World asked us if they could put our Apple switch parody on their cover CD.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.860
We didn't really have anything else to show the people that were coming to the website,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.520
so we came up with a concept for Red Vs. Blue.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.500
Grif: But before we settled on Red Vs Blue,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.440
we had a couple of other ideas that, didn't quite make the cut.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.500
In fact,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.280
(voice fading out)
I remember it like it was yesterday.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.700
Sarge: You two knuckleheads crashed a blimp into the city center,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.140
and killed EIGHT FOREIGN AMBASSADORS,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.220
four Under Secretaries of the Interior,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.900
and a pair of elysian hot dog venders.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.820
Now I got the deputy city planner,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.460
crawlin' all up my butt!

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.140
Church: Now Sarge,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.020
If I could say just one thing here-

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.120
Sarge: Can it Church!

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.560
I need someone to control this kid.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.920
He's a rebel.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.640
He's a loose cannon.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.560
And you just volunteered to babysit him.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.660
As of right now,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.200
you're partners.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.200
Grif: Partners!?

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.820
I work alone Sarge!

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.620
The streets would eat this guy ALIVE!

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.660
Church: Sarge,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.940
Theres two kinds of cops in this department.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.760
There's cops that play by the rules,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.980
and there's cops that get other cops hurt.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.780
I'm more the former.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.820
This kid?

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.360
I think he's the latter.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.860
Grif: Sarge,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.120
do you want a few innocent bystanders to live,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.600
or do you want RESULTS?

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.000
Sarge: "I" DON'T WANT TO HERE IT!

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.740
I got a boat in the marina,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.920
and there days until retirement.

And you two chimpmonkeys aren't going to do anything,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.540
to mess that up.

Church: Rookie,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.280
That's the exact kinda thing that happens when you don't follow protocol.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.700

Here we see are prey.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.540

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.340
half-sasquatch,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.380
known as Grifamo Retardicus.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.020

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.260

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.340
OR mental cunning,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.100
the prey's only defense,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500
is a feckless cry.

got something to tell you.

Go ahead Tucker.

Church: That's impossible!

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.460
I don't even have a child!

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.060
Tucker: No,

Grif: Wait, we went with a comedy theme?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.540
Are you sure we didn't go with the soap opera?
