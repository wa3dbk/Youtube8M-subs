00:00:00.903 --> 00:00:04.129
(Drunk) Hello, I’m ROBwithaB

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:06.109
(Drunk) You can call me “Blob”

00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:09.735
(Drunk) It’s a lovely day here in the Lowveld...

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:14.343
(Drunk) There’s a breeze in the trees and the birds are singing

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.283
(Drunk) And I’m just relaxing...

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:22.989
(Drunk) And this is one hundred fires and one

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:30.736
Hello, I’m ROBwithaB and this is “101 Ways to Make Fire”.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.252
A lot of people have told me that they get an ember very easily...

00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:37.739
but they struggle to blow the ember into flames,

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.550
so today I’m going to show you a way of doing this

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.960
that requires no breath at all.

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:46.543
(Drunk) But first we’re going to go hunt some grass...!

00:00:56.338 --> 00:00:58.609
So, we have a little ball of grass cuttings.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.895
It’s not particularly dry, in fact it’s still quite damp to the touch

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.516
And it’s still green as you can see, hopefully.

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:07.692
But that is going to be our smould.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.639
(Might be a word I made up)

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:13.700
So normally when you see people trying to start a fire from 
an ember ....(blowing)

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.938
They’ll be doing that sort of thing, blowing onto it

00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:20.982
(Drunk) Is that what they call a blow-job?

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:26.183
Now the concentration of the earth’s atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen,

00:01:26.183 --> 00:01:32.563
21% oxygen and another 1% other gasses, argon mostly.

00:01:32.563 --> 00:01:38.544
But as far as combustion is concerned, we’re interested in that 21% oxygen.

00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:45.009
As we breathe...

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.203
gases are exchanged in our lungs.

00:01:47.203 --> 00:01:54.838
About 4 or 5 percent of the oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide

00:01:54.838 --> 00:01:59.031
which is produced as a result of the processes in our body.

00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:02.949
So the air we exhale only has about 16% oxygen.

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:06.842
Now when we’re trying to heat up our tinder bundle

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:09.221
to its ignition temperature

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:09.927
we’re relying on the chemical reaction of the smould, of that little 
smouldering heart of the tinder bundle.

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:23.020
And all other things being equal, the temperature of our smould,
is dependent on the amount of oxygen we can get to it.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.870
The other problem with breath is that it contains a significant amount
of water vapour.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.087
(Drunk) waahter vapourrr....

00:02:32.087 --> 00:02:38.121
In fact the processes of combustion and respiration are
chemically quite similar.

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:40.070
D’you know what’s the best diet in the world?  

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.945
The sleeping diet!

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:45.382
In 8 hours, you’re going to lose about half a kilogram.

00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:47.983
How does that work?

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:50.668
Sure, you might have sweated out a cup of water,

00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:56.811
But most of that mass is leaving your body as water vapour in the breath.

00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:01.713
And as most of you probably know, water is not the friend of fire.

00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:04.740
So in this episode of “Lazy Survivor”,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.748
I’m going to show you how to let nature work for you.

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:10.312
Now we need an ember.

00:03:10.312 --> 00:03:13.332
(Drunk) And for that, I’m going to use this.

00:03:20.014 --> 00:03:24.123
Actually,  what I’m going to use is that.

00:03:24.123 --> 00:03:26.671
If you know how to look, lenses are everywhere.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.896
But enough talking, let us make fire.

00:03:32.423 --> 00:03:33.458
Groovy hey?

00:03:35.342 --> 00:03:36.679
So we have our wine glass...

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:39.961
And there we have a little piece of tinder fungus

00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:47.276
And we have a lot of smoke...

00:03:49.832 --> 00:03:52.280
And that’s a mini oonga boonga moment. 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:00.105
... going to drop our little piece of tinder fungus into our ball of smould

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:05.325
and then here we have, some other grass. Longer, more fibrous.

00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:12.677
... going to put that ball into there, crunch it up into a little 
handle below us...

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.787
Waiting...waiting...on your marks, get set, and we have fire!
And my hand is getting warm.

00:04:23.787 --> 00:04:27.275
And that’s what the hairs on your knuckles look like.
