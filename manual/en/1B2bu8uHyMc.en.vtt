00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:09.500
Most modern road bikes have between 20
and 22 gears, and changing gear can be as

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.198
intuitive as pedaling, but are you doing
it right? Welcome to GCN's How To Change

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:16.586
Gear Like a Pro.

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:20.867
♪ [music] ♪

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.450
To a large extent, how fast you pedal, or
your cadence, is self-selected.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.810
There is an optimum range, however, of
between 70 to 100 revolutions per minute.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.070
Gear changes should be made to keep
yourself in this range, whilst maintaining

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.690
your desired effort level. There is no way
of telling what gear should be used in a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.660
given situation, as it depends on a
rider's personal ability, but if you can

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.020
keep your cadence in this region,
you know you are doing okay.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.420
For most riders, a compact chain set at
the front is a good idea,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.020
with a 50- and 34-tooth chain ring, and an
11-to-25 cassette. This gives you a nice

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.060
low gear for steep climbs, but a top gear
that is the equivalent of 53/12.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.530
Now, one of the things you shouldn't
do is change gear under load.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.310
Creates a lot of hassle. The ideal thing
to do is select the gear nice and early,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.320
especially on a steep climb, as we are
now. Now, Tom's going to get the gear

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.480
wrong, and I'm going to get the
gear right by selecting it early.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.447
Here's how to do it.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.960
I'm in the gear now, spinning quite
nicely. There's quite a steep hairpin

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.940
here. Now, I'm not going to change gear
under load, I've selected the gear

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.985
already, I can just cruise around this
corner nice and easy. When Tom changes

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:37.116
gear, already got a bit of a gear
crunch, and I've left him behind.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.387
Again, it's all about selecting the gear
nice and early and thinking ahead.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.020
Avoid extremes on the cassette.
Now, when choosing your gears,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.750
you should avoid using the smallest chain
ring and sprocket at the same time,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.580
and conversely, the big chain ring
and big sprocket. It can be done,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.890
but it puts the chain and the
derailleur under a lot of stress,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.400
so for the health and longevity
of you gears, avoid it.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.550
Another thing you need to get right,
especially in a race situation,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.740
is changing from the big ring onto the
little ring basically on a very, very

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.080
quick approach to a steep climb. A
good example would be in the Tour of

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.530
Flanders when they're riding at 50, 60
kilometers an hour before the Mur

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.720
de Grammont timing is essential. You don't
want to get caught out on the big ring on

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.080
the steepest part of the climb. So get it
early, in the middle of the block,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.230
from big ring to little ring efficiently,
and you're on the climb,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.297
full acceleration, and you're away.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.030
Keep your gears clean. Now, one of the
best things you can do for your gears,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.170
and probably the most pro, is to keep them
clean. Now, this doesn't mean you have to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.440
get a toothbrush out after every single
ride and scrub, but buy some degreaser and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.830
use it every time any black residue builds
up. It looks pro to have shiny gears,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.200
and best of all, it makes them work much
better and also last a lot longer.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.530
Big rings are cool up to a point. While
we're talking about being pro,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.260
yes, it's cool to be on your big ring, but
pros also use really small gears to save

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.670
their legs. If you're the kind of person
that likes to grind their big ring all

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.230
day, have a think about using your little
ring, and actually looking pro.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.560
The limit screws are normally there just
to stop the chain dropping off the end of

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.690
the cassette and getting wedged into the
frame or between the cassette and the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.150
spokes. But there's also sufficient
adjustment to force the mech up a couple

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.000
of sprockets.
