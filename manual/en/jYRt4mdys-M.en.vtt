00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.960
Ingredients

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.000
First heat oil or ghee in a wok

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.620
To this add the whole garam masala

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.940
Bayleaf, then the cloves, cinammon stick

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.660
Green cardamom and the black cardamom

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.720
Smash a bit with your fingers

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.600
Add the cumin seeds

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.440
Stir this and when they are fried enough, add onions to it

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.340
When onions starts to become little transparent, add in

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.040
ginger garlic paste to it

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.200
Saute it for a while

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.440
Next add in the green chillies

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.540
Again stir it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.240
Now put all the vegetables over here

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:31.640
Potatoes, some carrots, cauliflower, peas and beans

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.520
You can use any other vegetables of your choice

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.220
Saute the vegetables for around 2-3 mins on low to

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.200
medium high heat. To this, add in the salt

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.260
garam masala, mint leaves and the beaten yogurt

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.160
stir well. To this add the soaked rice

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.020
Saute it gently on low flame so that it's well coated

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.920
with all the mixture

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.840
Now I am going to pour in the stock

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.520
or the water whichever you are using

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.760
Along with the lime juice

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.480
Mix it well

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.800
You can check for salt over here

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.900
Keep it on high flame for 2 mins

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.720
Until all the moisture is taken up by the rice

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.440
When you see very little water bubbling up on the top

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.320
cover it with a lid and keep it on low flame

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.160
for around 10 mins or until you see the rice

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.080
is cooked through. You can press it with the help of your

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.400
fingers and check whether the rice is cooked or not

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.980
Now lastly I am going to sprinkle

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.480
a few teaspoons of saffron soaked milk all over

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.120
It's optional but I perfectly like the aroma of it

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.440
Again I am going to cover it for just 1 more min

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.900
On low flame. Now give it a gentle stir

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.100
You can also use a fork to puff it up

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.640
Now it is ready and I am going to serve it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400
hot with some fresh coriander

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.600
and fried cashews on top

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.520
My veg pulao is ready and full of aromatic flavours

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.480
and spices as we have used a lot of garam masala

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.860
It tastes best when it is served with some chilled yogurt

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.700
