00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:25.740
I don’t know about you guys, but when I
think “side-scrolling shoot ‘em ups,”

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.310
I think the SEGA Genesis.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.310
I think arcades.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.160
I think the 16-bit era.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.960
That’s when those games really seemed to
take off, they were all over the freaking

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.960
place.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.790
But they were in other places, too.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.330
I mean, the NES had Silkworm.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:57.100
A shooter where you are, yourself…all over
the freaking place.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.500
So this bad boy was released in 1990.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.370
Emphasis on “bad boy,” ‘cause this is
one bad boy.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.150
Silkworm came at the beginning of that wave
of early nineties shoot ‘em ups, and at

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.670
least as NES shoot ‘em ups go, this is definitely
one of the coolest.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.530
I mean, it certainly has its issues, and it’s
far from perfect.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.600
But the cool things about Silkworm, are just
too cool to ignore.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.770
First, the sticker.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.540
Explosions are always awesome, that’s a
rule.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.540
Second, the backgrounds.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.850
They’re super colorful, and color is always
awesome.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.850
Also a rule.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.880
And third, the design.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.450
The only thing cooler than a good video game,
is a good video game designed to be played

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.990
with a friend, and that actually delivers
by being better with friends.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.180
And explosions with friends are, like…the
best part of being alive.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.030
So let’s start with the game’s main gimmick.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.160
The thing that makes Silkworm Silkworm…is
its multiplayer.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.590
I mean, it is designed, from top to bottom…as
a multiplayer game.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.110
And actually, a really cool multiplayer game,
too.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.780
Because each player gets a different vehicle.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.229
One gets a helicopter, the other gets a Jeep.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.850
And each one is a totally different experience.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.380
This is one of those games where you and your
friends actually get good with one of the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.380
two, you know?

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.830
Like, “Oh, I’m better with the helicopter,
you take the Jeep,” that kind of thing…

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.729
And friends who get good with helicopters
together…

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.200
Those are the friends who slay together—I
mean, stay together.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:25.079
Those are the friends, who stay together.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:38.290
The great thing about this dual-vehicle design…isn’t
just that they’re different, it’s that

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.879
they complement each other, too.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.959
Like, the strengths of the helicopter?

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.299
They actually make up for the weaknesses of
the Jeep.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.299
And vice versa.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.510
I mean, there are helicopter might struggle
with, but the Jeep just annihilates.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.419
So it’s also one of those, “I’ll take
this guy, you take that guy” games, which

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.911
are always the most fun kind of games.

00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:01.650
And again, the fact that it’s on the NES,
which isn’t necessarily a system people

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.739
think of for shoot ‘em ups…I think that
might be the coolest thing of all.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.969
Well, except for the explosions with friends.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.279
Nothing’s cooler than that, you guys.

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:25.370
So the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:38.309
game has a cool design gimmick, it plays great,
it looks awesome…what are those issues we

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:39.309
talked about earlier?

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:45.139
Well, for starters, that focus on multiplayer
makes playing this alone a lot less fun.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.870
Still good, but…nowhere near as cool as
when both vehicles are on the screen.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.349
And it’s also crazy tough on your own, too.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.339
I mean, if it weren’t for the Game Genie,
I would’ve been f*cked.

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.130
Said every kid in 1989.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.610
And actually, the game doesn’t really evolve
that much.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.450
Like, the enemies stay basically the same
from level to level, there’s not much variation…and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.280
eventually, even those backgrounds start to
repeat, too.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.339
So yeah, without the multiplayer elements,
Silkworm isn’t quite as…

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.220
Well, it’s not quite as Silkworm.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.629
I’ll be honest, I never really though of
the NES as a great console for shoot ‘em

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:24.740
ups.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.590
Silkworm heard me say that and immediately
punched me in the face—twice.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.729
And with two, different, fists.

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:32.729
Somehow.

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.300
And you know what, I wasn’t even mad, I
had too much fun.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:51.229
Even by myself, which was definitely less
awesome…the game’s still pretty awesome.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.009
No one wanted to play with me today, though.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.009
Except the Game Genie.

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.980
Which will stay by your side forever, and
always.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.720
If you’re looking for shoot ‘em ups from
before blast processing took over the genre…well,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.000
call up a buddy, pick the vehicle of your
choice and prepare your eyeballs for the awesomeness

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.849
that is…

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.180
Silkworm, for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.419
Game’s so awesome.

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.800
Big thanks to our pal Greg, from across the
hall, for telling me I was a pussy for having

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.810
never played this.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.810
Thanks, Greg.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:52.649
Boy, I really like your stupid blue shoes.
