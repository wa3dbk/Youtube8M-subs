00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:09.320
Ok, now that we have our pork cut its flat
about a half inch thick, square piece we have

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.530
our stuffing what we are going to do, we want
to add no more than half inch of stuffing

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:25.290
on this. So we will make a square make sure
it is even all the way through and you want

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.140
to about an inch from the edges all the way
around. The reason for that when we roll it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.260
up the stuffing will expand and it will oooze
out the ends so you don't need to go to the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:01:01.140
ends right off the bat. Just like that. You
have our stuffing on the pork and we are ready

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:13.999
to roll the pork out. All you need to do is
gently fold the pork over you don't want it

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:22.979
too tight you want it firm. So just ease it
over if you tighten it too much you will loose

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.850
all the stuffing out of the ends, so we are
going ease it around just like so keeping

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.999
the stuffing in you want the open edge on
the very bottom when you roll it or when you

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:47.429
tie it up. The technique using the butcher's
string it looks difficult but it really isn't.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.899
If this is a route you would rather not go,
what you can do is get some bamboo skewers

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:01.179
and just go through the end and pierce it
so that the pork stays shut. Then what you

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.819
need to do when you bake it so it doesn't
open, have skewers on the bottom of the pan

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.079
that will hold the pork together as the pork
cooks it is going to tighten up it will tighten

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:16.579
around skewers and won't open up. Make sure
you have the open edge of the pork on the

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:27.150
bottom. I prefer to use the string. So using
the butcher, for a piece this size probably

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:39.650
about 1 1/2 arm length of string.
You can get butcher string at any fine restaurant

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:49.390
supply store or upscale grocery marts. So
we are going to bring the string like so and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:59.080
bring it right through the end. Bring it up
tie the first end make the first one pretty

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.920
firm but not too tight. Otherwise again you
will squeeze all the filling out. Once that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.500
is done the rest is pretty easy you are going
to take your thumb bring it down like so slide

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.290
it under, keep your thumb here you going bring
the string around and under like so pull up

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:42.269
pull it down just like so repeat that process,
up, down. From this point on what we will

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.910
do heat a saute pan with olive oil we are
going to sear the pork then we will go into

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.240
a 350 degree oven. Cooking time is roughly
an hour for the internal temperature you want

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.829
to be between 170-185 and I will show you
how to take the temperatures with a thermometer

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.649
or to check it without.
