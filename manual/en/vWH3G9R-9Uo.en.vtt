00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we're going to look at a profile eye.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.000
While you can do it yourself with at least 2 mirrors,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.060
it's probably easier to do someone else's eye.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What we're looking at here is still a sphere.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.000
So still put in your round circle.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And now we're going to look at how the eyelids sit on this circle.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is the area above the eye.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.000
And here we have the eyebrow coming towards us.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The eyelid will be cutting across on a shape like this.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The upper lid will be protruding beyond the lower lid.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
From this view you see the eyelashes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You see a much smaller portion of the eye.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.000
And what you are seeing of the coloured portion of the eye

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.000
is a convex shape. It's no longer circular.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.000
Do note that the front of the eye when seen in profile

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.000
is actually transparent.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.060
And the cornea; the coloured part of the eye,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
will be situated a little distance back from that thick, transparent layer.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.000
You'll still have your shading in the corner

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.060
depending on what your light source is doing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And there'll usually be some quite strong shadows in this section here.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.000
which will throw your eye into relief.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I can take the eye ball away now and we're left with the shape that we're looking at.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.060
You'll see a much smaller portion of the eye when you're looking at it in profile.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.060
Don't exaggerate it or make it look larger than it needs to be.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.000
In this section we're going to look at the 3/4 eyes

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.060
which is slightly more complicated than the front on eyes or profile.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It is also the one you're probably going to end up using the most.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.000
And with this, generally the head is tilted in one direction

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but the eyes will be looking at you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is going to give a pose that is more natural and relaxed.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.000
And have perhaps more sense of movement because you feel

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
at any point the person could be moving.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So the different things to notice about this is that 1 eye will be 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.060
closer towards you and will be slightly larger.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.060
The eye that's further away will be slightly smaller.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And the eye that is further away, the tear duct will be hidden

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.060
by the bridge of the nose.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.000
So in this case on Fiona's right eye I cant see her tear duct.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.060
That's going to make the eyes have a slightly different shape.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We need to pay attention carefully to communicate that sense of shape.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.060
I'm going to start with the edge of the nose

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.060
and the eyebrows.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.060
Look here now for what's happening.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.000
The edge of the eyelid is disappearing and the top of the eye is straight.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.000
But now I'm seeing that curved side on the eyeball.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.000
This curve is quite important.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.000
This is indicating to me the view.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So the rest of the eyelid is disappearing behind

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.060
but the curve of the eyeball is quite apparent.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
That curve in there.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
On the eye that's closer to me I can see the tear duct.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.000
It's going to be slightly larger.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And in this view it's easier to see that the lower lid is disappearing

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
up behind the upper lid.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And this is the sense in here I have that this is a round eye;

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.060
through the shadow.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Look for the shape of the white of the eye to get where the eyeball is.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Usually the eyeball will be partly hidden

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.000
at the top and bottom by the lid.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.000
It's not very often that you're going to see the whites of the eyes.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Slight reflection on this side.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.000
You can see the lashes in profile.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.060
Lower lashes. I'm not going to bother putting all of them in.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.000
I can see a bit more of the lid in this case here curving around

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.000
and down inside here.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.060
In this one I can make more definition in terms of the tear duct.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
This part here's quite crucial; this little shape just here.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.060
And that's the 3/4 eye.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.060
When it comes to drawing eyes you're going to want to do as many as possible.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.000
Take every opportunity.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.060
Here's a hint on how to make the eyes focus so they're actually looking at you.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.000
On the first example I've made the eyes too far over

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.000
at the bottom here, and too far to the right at the top.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.000
Then when I corrected it you can see what a difference it's made.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.000
Just by bringing the coloured part of the eye further over up there

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.060
and tucking it further in down here.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.060
There are various traps you can fall into

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.060
with making the eyes look unrealistic.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.060
Try and avoid making them too large.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.060
It's a habit everybody falls into. I still do it occasionally.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.000
Really try and assess the width and height of the eye

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.060
in relationship to the other features.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.060
Don't make the whites of the eyes too white.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It's only found on young children, the real white of the eyes.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.000
And particularly when you're painting them.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.060
Don't make the eyelashes too dark

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.060
and only draw the eyelashes that you can see.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.000
Don't over emphasise them.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.060
Think about the character of the eye you're expressing.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.060
When a person is smiling the shape of the eye is going to change.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.000
Have fun.
