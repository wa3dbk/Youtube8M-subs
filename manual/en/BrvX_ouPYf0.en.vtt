Hi, this is Linda Lewis on behalf of Expert
Village.com. Check out my website at www.keytime.com.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.730
What are ergonomics finger pads? The way the
fingers travel on the keyboard each finger

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.050
has its own path to get to the key from the
home position and the keyboards that are splittered

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.260
divided are working towards getting your hands
going to the center so that there is not a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.339
twist on your left wrist. So about 10 years
ago when they came out with the divided keyboards,

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.379
I was noticing that was the objective was
to getting the hands like this so doing a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.360
pilot program with business education of teachers
and various people seeing that if you just

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.489
move your hand in this direction you can still
use a conventional keyboard to use the proper

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.450
fingering. I will show you on this keyboard.
The way typing has been taught for over 100

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.560
years is to twists the let wrist and move
up to the left and down to the right but by

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.960
just changing 4 fingers or 4 letters on the
keys you are able to go in this direction

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.990
with your finger pads and it puts a natural
way on the keyboard. So there are only actually

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.270
4 letters that are done differently. I will
show you on the colored template. Here it

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.060
is graphically, that where your hands still
remain on the home position and all you have

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.340
done is taken your hands so that your pointer
finger is going to be going down to the c

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.929
and our middle finger is going to go down
to the x and up to the r. The ring finger

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.759
will be going down to the z so it just means
you are going to be using new fingers for

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.350
the x,z,c and r keys; this will allow your
hand to be in a new position and your way

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.280
of typing will be much better for you so that
you donâ€™t put a strain on your left wrist.
