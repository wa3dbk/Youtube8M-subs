00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.100
Released on July 3, 1985... this now iconic
sci-fi comedy film by director Robert Zemeckis

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.059
would slowly become the most successful picture
of that year, grossing $383 million from its

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.450
$19 million dollar budget.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.750
Family Ties heartthrob Michael J. Fox stars
as a somewhat delinquent teenager who is accidentally

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.090
sent back in time 30 years, where he inadvertently
jeopardizes his own existence.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.070
Alongside him, in an extremely fun and endearing
relationship is Christopher Lloyd as the eccentric

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.440
scientist responsible for converting a DMC
DeLorean into a time machine.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.460
To which Fox confusingly questions, " Ah...

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.620
Are you telling me that you built a time machine...
out of a DeLorean?".

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.730
The Oscar-nominated screenplay was largely
inspired from producer Bob Gale's curiosity

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.760
surrounding his own parents' life in high
school.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.980
Indeed, the plot finds Fox playing matchmaker
between his 17-year-old parents in the mid

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.500
1950's, while simultaneously working with
a younger version of Lloyd's character to

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.180
get himself back to the future.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.040
The plot smartly keeps things local and contained:
focusing on believable drama between the characters,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:41.700
rather than a bloated science fiction story.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.659
The wholesome but stunning Lea Thompson plays
Fox's rambunctious mother in a truly unique

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.369
and amusing role, while Crispin Glover brings
the nerdy father character to life with an

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.180
almost uncomfortable level of realism and
awkwardness.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.270
Meanwhile, the imposing Tom Wilson turns in
a brilliant performance as the school bully,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.650
expertly blending his foolish malapropisms
with a threatening demeanor.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.021
The subtle, expert-caliber performances by
all involved are an earnest embodiment of

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.409
an entire generation.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.689
Phrases like, "Hey McFly", and "Great Scott"
have entered our cultural lexicon.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.790
Without drawing attention to itself, Zemeckis'
trademark style, of impressively long, unbroken

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.230
shots reminds us how film can be both captivating
entertainment, and an artistic accomplishment.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.079
Delivering the film's intricate exposition
is an ingenious in-film scale-model, built

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.069
as much for the characters' benefit as the
audiences' - quickly and easily explaining

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.120
the consequences and goals of the movie's
final act: thus allowing the dramatic conclusion

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.170
to be so much more enjoyable, as it plays
out unimpeded by questions or confusion.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.989
Similarly, a Polaroid illustrating eventual
consequences of Fox's temporal escapades functions

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.419
perfectly as a ticking-clock for the audience.

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.230
Well paced, never once does the tension slack,
or the narrative hurry, especially during

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.409
the climatic finish, which keeps me on the
edge of my seat every time I watch.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.120
Contributing a grandiose sound usually reserved
for larger epics, the score from composer

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.010
Alan Silvestri is a thrilling tour de force:
lending the picture a hefty dose of its suspense.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.150
80's rocker Huey Lewis even contributes some
upbeat pop-ballads, as well as an ironic cameo.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.430
Themes of forgotten youth, friendship and
idealism are explored with an undeniable emotional

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.579
resonance; thanks largely to the steadfast
attention to detail, where even a shy-smile

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.709
or a glance says everything you need to know.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.060
The geniuses at Industrial Light At Magic
did a tremendous job with the numerous special

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.760
effects shots, with one lone exception.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.739
By all accounts, this film is a contemporary
classic, but given the lore surrounding the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.049
picture, it's amazing it was ever finished
at all.

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.230
Fox is nothing short of remarkable, and endlessly
relatable as the lead, but an entire month

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.170
of production was actually filmed with Eric
Stotlz in the famous role of Marty McFly.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.000
Similarly, early drafts of the script had
the recognizable gull-winged time vehicle

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.510
replaced by a refrigerator... we can only
imagine how much different this film might

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.090
have been without these changes.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.540
Aside from a few minor continuity errors and
tiny plot holes, this 116-minute picture is

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.909
a monument of cinema, and is ostensibly flawless
in doing so.

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.540
Although occasionally materialist with some
of its themes, it is masterfully successful

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.480
in conveying sweeping emotions, from tension,
embarrassment and guilt, to anxiety, love

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.480
and fear.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.999
More importantly though, the picture is downright
hilarious half the time, like when Fox scares

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.920
Glover into asking Thompson on a date by dressing
up in a radiation suit, with a "futuristic"

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.099
hair-dryer.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.969
A massive hit, and a top-50 mainstay on IMDb's
top-rated list, this time travel adventure

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:18.260
would spawn two sequels, an animated TV series,
a theme park ride, video games, and an Academy

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.440
Award for sound effects.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.540
It is extremely difficult for me to objectively
review this PG-rated adventure like I would

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.380
any other film... because, quite simply, it
isn't any other film... it is my favorite

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.380
film.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.900
One I have absolutely cherished and adored
since I visited Universal Studios as a kid.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.600
I've visited many of the picture's real-life
filming locations, I've sat inside several

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.560
replica time machines, and I own everything
from scale-models and original movie posters

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.820
to replica props signed by the cast.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.150
Suffice it to say, I really love this film,
and it is a chief reason I pursued a career

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.350
in media production.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.720
The extremely well-written characters, quotable
dialogue, seamless visuals, clever plot developments,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.980
amazing performances, and top-tier directing
make this movie an emotional, and technical

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.830
marvel: delivering a truly entertaining, almost
inspirational experience only strengthened

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.250
on many repeat viewings.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.820
"Back To The Future" is an "Extraordinarily
powerful and rewarding masterpiece."

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.350
Now that you've listened to the longest review
I've ever written, let's see what you had

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.220
to say about this wonderful film in the YouTube
comments.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:30.410
"Back To The Future" on the Rate-O-Matic...
the highest possible score, a TEN from each

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.410
of us.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.990
Not a single person said anything negative,
with more than two-thirds of those who voted

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.850
giving it a nine or higher, you thought it
was AMAZING.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.400
I've never done this before, but as the Factor
Facts show, I'm giving this a perfect score,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.480
a 100/100.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.280
A reflection of its timeless entertainment
value, technical accomplishments, and emotional

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280
impact.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.660
Without question, this is an AMAZING film.
