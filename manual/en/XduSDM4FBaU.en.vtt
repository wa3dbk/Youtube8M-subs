00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:10.678
I've arrived in Seattle!

00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:18.975
I'm in my hotel right now and this place is adorable 
 so I think I'll upload a hotel room tour video

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:25.475
I arrived around 5pm and took a little stroll around 

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:36.152
it's past nine now but I ordered dinner from 
 room service so I'm going to eat now!

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:43.301
Hi everyone! This is Asahi

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:47.787
Today is day 2 of Seattle 

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:57.589
and I'm going to meet up with Judy from itsjudytime and Benji and 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.621
explore the city of Seattle

00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:06.465
it's a taco store!

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.790
it looks really good too!

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.659
She seems to like cameras

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.619
souvenirs!!

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.400
Benji: She likes souvenirs!
Oh, she does!

00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:29.027
oh, she likes books!

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:34.938
You happy? 

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:48.968
I gifted her a Japanese book and Japanese CD

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:54.300
Hope you learn a lot of Japanese!

00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:02.960
I'm glad you like it!

00:02:29.424 --> 00:02:32.830
*I had my camera on the wrong setting so 
 It does get a little shakey. Sorry!!*

00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:36.180
So I'm currently at Judy and Benji's house! 

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:41.807
It feels really weird to be here because 
 I'm always seeing it through a screen!

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:48.200
and here's Julianna

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:53.840
I'm going to have a seat where Judy always records her videos 

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:03.540
her set up is amazing

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:06.990
I feel like I've become Judy 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.910
the focus is amazing

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.440
It's quick

00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:24.639
She's put up the purikura that we took a while back 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.390
We've come to the outlet mall!

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:38.080
because Seattle's close to Canada, a lot of Canadians 
 come here and apparently it's cheaper here

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:42.647
Judy's already been spotted by a fan!

00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:46.037
She's very popular!

00:03:46.037 --> 00:03:49.600
I'm going to scoot away to do some shopping

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.110
the wallets are sooooo cute!!

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.508
and Judy's popular here too!

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:04.710
you can take this off

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.330
We enjoyed shopping until it was time for the outlet to close

00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:19.020
Benji has a lot of bags

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.635
it's cheap!

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:27.330
we're going to have dinner now

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.110
This place is a bit off from downtown but it's a relatively known hotel

00:04:35.113 --> 00:04:40.690
Benji said that it's a hotel that was created by a Native American

00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:46.679
Crab and Avocado.. and something else. Apparently it's good! 

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:51.120
Everyone's vlogging

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.450
This is handmade bread and butter

00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:59.630
Judy likes this and I think it's got some alcohol in it? 

00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:05.430
Tasty!

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:10.640
Just a little something before the main dish 

00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:18.690
this cake is made from layers and layers of crepe

00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:26.640
 and they used juice from a fruit from the Philippines 

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:34.348
This was created by an artist from Seattle

00:05:34.348 --> 00:05:39.540
wow! it's amazing

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.916
i've never seen a chandelier like it

00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:46.800
Benji brought me over to the other side of the sea 

00:05:46.803 --> 00:05:48.800
the camera may not pick it up but it's extraordinary!
