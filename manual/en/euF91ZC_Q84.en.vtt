00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.968
-I've got you.

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.388
I've got you. {Back} {up.}

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:14.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.460
-Alfonso, you wrote
the screenplay together

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.260
with your son.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.980
How was it to work with him?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.600
-You know, when we're
writing, it's just

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.820
like working with
another writer,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.900
and a writer that
I admire, respect.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.189
So it's just a communication
with two collaborators

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.510
in which most of the time
you agree and work very fast,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.650
and sometimes you fight a lot.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.100
But it was not unlike
the relationship

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.010
with any other writer.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.530
Here the plus is that I
got to spend time with him.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.370
-Did you sometimes get
in your father role?

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.610
-Not when we're writing.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.170
-No?

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.680
-No.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.600
When we're writing, it's like
a complete different thing.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.890
You're just two writers
working together.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.040
-This movie, it has a
very difficult topic,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.099
and you had to face so
many challenges to do it.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.110
Why did you face all
those challenges?

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.590
Why did you do it?

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.085
-Well, when we
did the script, we

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:11.220
didn't know it was going
to be so difficult.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.220
And it was not until we
tried to put it together

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.920
that we realized it
was very difficult.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.940
And we have to invent our
own technology to do it.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.530
And so, in many ways, the
journey of making the film

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.930
was very similar to the journey
of our character in the film.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.120
Because it was a journey
full of adversities.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.130
When we face a new adversity,
we used to call it OK,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.210
there's a new shower of debris.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.080
-So it took you 4 and 1/2
years to do this movie, right?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.660
-Yeah.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.750
-And now that it's
done, how do you feel?

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.870
Do you feel relieved?

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.710
-Relieved is the word.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.260
That's exactly the word.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.080
You know, when the dogs
are chasing the fox

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.370
and the fox finally gets away,
is the fox happy or relieved?

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.420
I think it's relieved.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.170
The fox is happy when
he's just frolicking

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.760
in the river with the other
fox and the other puppies.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.420
But when he's just escaped from
the hounds, he's just relieved.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.040
Ryan, she's completely
lost in this movie,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.770
mentally and physically.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.250
Did you have a
moment in your life

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.370
where you felt that way, lost?

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.860
-Every single day.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.826
-You do?

00:02:21.826 --> 00:02:22.698
-No. [LAUGHS]

00:02:22.698 --> 00:02:24.010
-OK.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.530
Now, I'm relieved.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.630
-No.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:33.530
Of course, like everybody, we go
through some periods of despair

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.380
in which you feel not
unlike Ryan that you're

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.210
floating into the void.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.280
And you're losing completely
any sense of ground.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.090
And the problem
is also that we're

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.980
a victim of our own inertia.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.280
In space, it's the
physical inertia.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.170
But in Earth, it's
our tendencies.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.530
That we have an inertia
of how we do things,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.160
and we have to learn to
change that inertia if we

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.190
want any change.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.260
-So what is it that
keeps you going,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.726
that keeps you motivated?

00:03:08.726 --> 00:03:10.100
-I think it's the
same thing that

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.160
keeps going Ryan
Stone in the film.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.855
That even if she's
in complete despair,

00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:18.580
there's an impulse that
is even stronger-- that

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.050
is that impulse of life.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.810
And that impulse is what
I think keeps me going.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.850
But I think it's the impulse
that keeps everybody going.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.236
-Thank you so much, and
congratulations on the movie.

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:30.610
-Hey, Vanessa,
thank you so much.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.430
-Nice to meet you.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.280
-Thank you, Vanessa.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.212
Bye.
