00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.160
Today on our 2010 Nissan Titan we&amp;#39;ll be
installing the Hopkins Smart Hitch Backup

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.590
Camera and Hitch Aligner System, part number
HM50002.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.730
This backup camera makes driving in reverse
and hooking up a trailer simple by giving

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.420
you a full crystal-clear image of what&amp;#39;s
behind you.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.269
The color monitor gives you visual cues and
audible alerts to help you back up safely.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.550
The camera also switches from hitch mode to
everyday mode with the push of a button.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.259
Now we&amp;#39;ll show you how the camera works.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.450
We&amp;#39;ll go ahead and shift the vehicle into
reverse while our foot&amp;#39;s on the brake.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:02:56.439
As soon as the vehicle is put in reverse the
monitor comes on and you get a view behind

00:02:56.439 --> 00:06:00.710
the vehicle.
