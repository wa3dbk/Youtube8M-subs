00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.300
About 1200 years ago

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.680
Earth may have experienced one of the rarest and most powerful cosmic events a planet can be exposed to

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.880
A Gamma Ray burst

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.080
We're not sure yet if it actually happened, but if it did, well let's just say

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.100
that we as living things on Earth are lucky it wasn't worse.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
Gamma Rays are the most energetic form of light

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.240
and when explosions in space release them in sudden bursts

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.220
lasting anywhere from a few milliseconds to a minute, or more,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.180
they release radiation that's a million trillion times as intense as the sun.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.720
Astronomers think these enormous blasts of energy come from a coupe of different sources.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.520
Some bursts last, on average, for about 30 seconds

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.240
and occur when massive stars die in a violent supernova, creating a black hole in the process.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.900
But as gamma bursts go, 30 seconds can be a long time.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.780
Short bursts, like the one astronomers think may have hit the Earth

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.440
last for just a second or two and almost always occur when two neutron stars,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.220
or in some cases a neutron star and a black hole, collide.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.880
Neutron stars are almost inconceivably dense.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.160
Picture the entire mass of the sun

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.040
crammed into just a couple of kilometers.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.920
If a couple of these extremely dense stars collide,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.940
the result is so powerful that is releases some of its energy as gamma rays

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.680
which have the smallest wavelengths

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.440
and the most energy of any wave in the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.320
These gamma, or GRBs, aren't exactly rare on a universe-wide scale.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.040
Because they're so bright they are easy to spot with telescopes

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.960
even at the outer reaches of the universe.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.240
But within our galaxy astronomers believe

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.600
they only happen about once every million years

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.220
and GRBs only release a very narrow beam of powerful radiation

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.280
which means a planet has to be in just the right place

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.320
at the right time to be struck by one.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.920
So what makes scientists think a GRB hit Earth?

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.040
The answer lies in ancient trees and ancient ice

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.300
where in 2012 scientists discovered unusually high levels

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.280
of two particular isotopes:

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.620
Carbon-14 and Beryllium-10.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.960
These form when radiation from space collides with nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.980
causing them to decay.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.500
Because cosmic rays are constantly bombarding our atmosphere,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.600
we expect to find certain amounts of these two isotopes lying around

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.260
but they turned up at levels ten times higher than normal

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.000
at two distinct places:

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.900
in the tree rings of old Japanese Cedars

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.800
and in ancient layers of Antarctic Ice.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.360
Both of these sources have been dated to about the same time

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.380
around the year 775.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.640
Based on what they're seeing

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.320
scientists estimate that the energy that caused these anomalies

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.600
was roughly equivalent to thirteen Hiroshima bombs

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.840
spread out over half the planet's surface.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.260
Unlike the famous supernova 1054 which was recorded by cultures all over the world,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.640
there doesn't appear to be any historical record

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.860
of people noticing anything unusual in the sky around 775.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.800
But that doesn't actually tell us much

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.880
because the burst probably only lasted two seconds,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.760
and may not have emitted any visible light.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.900
But of course, there a couple other explanations.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.380
A historically large solar flare could have bombarded Earth

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.380
with enough radiation to create the clues we're seeing.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.960
But it also would have cause a truly, spectacularly, large display of Northern Lights.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.740
Which again, doesn't seem to have been noted by anyone.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.980
A nearby supernova is another possibility.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.900
But for such an event to send out comparable levels of radiation

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.580
the explosion would have been easily visible from Earth.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.560
And again, theres no record of such a thing happening.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.600
So we're left with the GRB scenario.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.180
Scientists believe the explosion that caused it must have occurred

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.740
between 3,000 and 12,000 light-years from Earth.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.680
Because if it were any closer the radiation would have caused the sudden extinction

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.960
of at least some life.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.760
Though highly unlikely, what would happen if

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.620
a comparable GRB struck Earth today?

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.920
Well, it depends how far it's source was from us.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.460
If it was more than a few thousand light-years away

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.520
Earth's atmosphere would absorb most of the dangerous radiation

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.900
so humanity would be okay.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.000
But, our satellites and power grids would all be fried

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.100
likely causing some post-technological scenario worthy of a cable/TV drama

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.280
...that you wouldn't be able to watch.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.220
If the burst occurred close than 3,000 light-years away

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.980
the radiation could destroy a fair amount of our atmosphere

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.100
particularly the Ozone Layer

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.620
which is made up of triple oxygen molecules and protects our planet

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.340
from the ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.600
With our shields basically down

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.560
Earth's surface could be exposed to potentially lethal levels of radiation.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.100
Which, while not killing everything,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.000
would certainly add to the list of mass extinction events

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.580
that our planet has endured so far.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.520
So on the bright side, if a gamma ray burst did happen to graze Earth 1,200 years ago

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.100
at least we don't have to worry about it for another 999,000 years or so.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.580
