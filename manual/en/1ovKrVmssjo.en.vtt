00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.760
You might have heard Aston Martin posted a
£24m loss last year, but things aren't as

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.570
bad as that sounds.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.880
For starters it received £150m of outside
investment recently, it's signed and agreement

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.079
with Mercedes to use AMG V8's and share platforms
and yet again it was voted the coolest brand

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.519
in the world, however that's judged.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.390
Oh, and it's about to introduce this stunning
thing at the very top of its range.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.150
The Vanquish Volante is the latest in a long
line of V12 Aston convertibles, known more

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.910
for their supernodel good looks and posing
prowess than pin sharp handling, but with

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.700
a chassis that's 14% stiffer than the DBS
Volante, the same 565bhp 6.0-litre V12 as

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.219
the Vanquish coupe, and an identical 0-62mph
time as the coupe of 4.2 seconds - this could

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:10.940
be the convertible to buck 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.940
the trend.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.730
You'll have to excuse the background noise
because I've got the roof down and it's not

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.520
coming up, we are in sunny Palm Springs in
California after all, and first things first

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.579
this has to be one of the best-looking Aston's
ever.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:40.950
The designers have kept the gorgeous carbon
fixed rear wing while the roof slots behind

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.140
these two humps behind my head in 14 seconds.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.610
Right now, cruising around, life feels pretty
damn good.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:02.320
But what happens when we find a road that's
a bit more fun?

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:13.230
Well, let's start with the bad news - it weighs
over 100kg more than the coupe and the two

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.670
stage dampers have been softened up ever so
slightly, so it flows on smooth roads like

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.560
this but will feel a bit brittle back in the
UK.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:41.319
Chassis is 14 percent stiffer, but you can
still feel it flexing here and there.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.900
Honestly though, unless your going to take
this on track it clings on just as well as

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.900
the coupe.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.370
And the engine?

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:02.310
We'll we 
all know how good it sounds, and there is

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.130
huge pace if you let it rev out.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.490
I know it sounds hyper critical, but the performance
is effortless rather than explosive.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.000
More like a Bentley GT than a ferrari F12.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.090
So, as expected, it's utterly gorgeous but
not the sharpest tool in Aston's box.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:30.930
If you want that though, then there's always
the V12 vantage S....

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.370
There are cried that Aston needs to do something
all-new, replace the Vantage, DB9 and Vanquish

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.510
and build an SUV, and those cars will come,
but for now it's still producing some exceptional

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.510
cars.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.860
It's hard not to be seduced by the glamour
of the Vanquish Volante, and for most of the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.490
time it now feels as rigid as the coupe.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.980
Is it worth £200,000?

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.659
Well I'll leave you take another look, and
you decide...
