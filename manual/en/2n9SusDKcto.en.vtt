00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:09.920
The last step for our little egg tea sandwiches,
I've got some very fresh white bread here.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.870
One side, we're going to just a little bit
of butter, because what the butter will do,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:35.680
it will keep the bread from getting soggy.
It acts as a sealant. OK. We're going to spoon

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:49.720
some of our egg mixture, of course, that's
got a little bit of dill in it. Spread that

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.520
until it's an appropriate thickness. Not too
thick, but of course we don't want just a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:09.890
mouthful of bread either. OK. It's about right.
Don't worry about getting the crusts all messy,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.420
because of course it's a tea party so we're
going to cut them right off. OK, put the top

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.570
right on there. Slice off the crust. I love
the shape this bread. Isn't it great? It's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:37.701
going to give us a really nice, long, this
is a very fancy little tea sandwich. OK, and

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:47.960
one other side. Wipe your knife off as you
need to. Turn it, and I?m going to make four

00:01:47.960 --> 00:02:01.330
little ones out of this. Ease it down. There
we go. And there we have it. Take that little

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.920
bit off the top. And we're going to put that
right on our little pedestal. That's our first

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:21.069
little sandwich. Now we're going to go to
the cucumber sandwiches.
