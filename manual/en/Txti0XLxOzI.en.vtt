00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hi I'm Ashwin Vasavada, project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory mission

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and this is your special edition, third anniversary Curiosity Rover Report.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's a summer of milestones for Mars Exploration.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Fifty years ago, Mariner 4 became the first spacecraft to take close-up pictures of Mars.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
39 years ago, the Viking 1 Lander became the first spacecraft to successfully land on the Red Planet.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And now Curiosity celebrates 3 years on Mars -- operating well over a thousand Martian days.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Since its arrival in August 2012, Curiosity has driven nearly eleven kilometers

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
from its landing site to the foot of Mount Sharp within Gale Crater.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The first year was spent traversing through ancient stream beds

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and exploring Yellowknife Bay, the site of an ancient lake.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That's where Curiosity drilled samples from the lake floor

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to reveal mineral evidence of long-lived, fresh water.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It also found carbon-containing organic molecules and nitrogen in a form usable to life.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So if life ever were present on Mars, a site like Yellowknife Bay could sustain it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Then Curiosity put the pedal to the medal to get to Mount Sharp.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That's when engineers noticed excessive wear on the rover's wheels.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A lot of work went into understanding the cause and how to avoid it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But now we're confident that the wheels can take us where we need to go.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's been quite a road trip. Curiosity drilled at the Kimberley, drove through long valleys

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and took pictures of roadside geology before finally reaching the bedrock at the base of Mount Sharp.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We spent several months studying these rocks at Pahrump Hills.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The science team has been fascinated by all the signs of ancient water at Mount Sharp.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's likely that Gale Crater once hosted many rivers and lakes,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
carrying sediment to the crater floor that now forms the bottom layer of Mount Sharp.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now that we're climbing through the foothills of the mountain, the driving is challenging.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The team relies on images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to find safe paths to interesting geologic targets.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Getting to the current rover location at Marias Pass required a steep climb up a 6-meter hill.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
As we climbed the hill, Curiosity's ChemCam laser spectrometer

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
noticed unusually high amounts of silica in nearby rocks.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
What might that mean? Were the environmental conditions friendly or hazardous to life?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Could the silica have preserved organic molecules in the rocks for us to study today?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We're hoping to find out.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
None of this would be possible without the dedicated team of rover engineers here at JPL.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Every day that we operate Curiosity, a downlink team studies the information

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
sent by the rover and makes sure it's healthy and ready to proceed with the next activities.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Then an uplink team turns the desires of the scientists into sequences

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
of commands that can be safely executed by the rover.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's an intense process that takes about nine hours every day.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So congratulations to the team and happy anniversary to Curiosity. Let's keep on going!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
This has been your Curiosity Rover Report, please check back for more updates.
