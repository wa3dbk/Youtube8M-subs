00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.400
And we are continuing with our second unboxing video.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.700
And this is a "Lord of the Rings" figure.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.600
I have no idea which figure it is!

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.400
He has no idea! It's just a piece of paper!

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800
It's just a piece of paper! That's all from us, bye!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Here is Balrog!

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.000
That is one awesome base, the rocks he's standing on. Probably the most awesome base I've ever seen.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:26.600
You know, I've seen pictures of this statue and I thought it looked OK, nothing special about it, but now when it's standing in front of me, I'm blown away by it.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.500
And this was our second unboxing video, two more to go and for the third video we're gonna switch positions.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.000
Thanks for watching!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.500
End of part 2!
Come back tomorrow for part 3!
Regards, Jim &amp; Andy.
