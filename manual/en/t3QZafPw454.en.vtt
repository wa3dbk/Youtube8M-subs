00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.690
&gt;&gt; The tourism programme here at Bournemouth
University is a four year programme.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.960
Students have two years at the university,
a year’s placement and a final year here

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.369
at the university.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.890
Basically it’s the study of tourism - and
that a very broad area to cover.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.800
While they’re here they study a range of
modules.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.090
They do business ones for instance: marketing,
consumer behaviour, finance and they also

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.530
do tourism related ones like development of
the industry and also environmental studies

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.940
and cultural studies.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.979
&gt;&gt; For me the academics and lecturers are
so knowledgeable it’s unbelievable, I mean

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:46.180
that is such a major attraction for me it
makes me realise what a good decision it was

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.559
to come to Bournemouth University.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.920
We have got a transport planner, we also have
doctorates which are extremely knowledgeable

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.640
in their subject areas, also nature tourism,
a variety of different expertise combined

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.199
in one for the unit it’s actually fantastic.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.400
&gt;&gt; All students undertake a placement year
- it’s a compulsory placement which really

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.180
makes a difference for them when they come
back.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.710
They have a range of placements that they
go for local and overseas and for instance

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.710
this year we have got over 100 placements
for about 60 students.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.570
We have good connections – we’ve done
it for over 25 years – so what’s good

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.189
is placement companies come to us to ask for
our students because they have done such a

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.229
good job in the past.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.490
&gt;&gt; So for my placement I went to New Zealand
and I worked in two different places and I

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.030
worked as a ticketing office in both.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.619
This involved a bit of everything.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.450
I got to see marketing as well as being in
a customer facing role.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.149
I really really enjoyed it and would definitely
recommend going abroad to do a placement.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.189
&gt;&gt; My placement year I was an air product
executive.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.039
It involved working with quite a few different
airlines, specifically for the long-hall sector.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.170
Loved it because really that was the main
attraction for me – the placement year.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.040
This opportunity came up, I look it and I
have no regrets what so ever, it was brilliant

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.270
and no doubt will help me for my future career
after university.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.100
&gt;&gt; Potential careers for students are quite
broad.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.630
It involves travel agents, tour operators,
hotels and also cruise lines, air lines, so

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.650
its three sectors: accommodation, transport
and also destination management.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.260
&gt;&gt; The best thing about this course I would
say is that there is a huge amount of focus

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.370
in Bournemouth on tourism so it’s not just
the university that are very good at tourism;

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.280
tourism is quite a huge part of Bournemouth
as well so I think that’s really helped

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.890
me with my studies.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.840
&gt;&gt; I would definitely recommend Bournemouth
University.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.620
Undoubtedly it’s been the best four years
I could have ever asked for.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.900
The opportunities at university are great:
socially, academically and for your future

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.980
career aspirations.
