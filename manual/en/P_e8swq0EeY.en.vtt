Hi everyone! Welcome to Keith's Toy Box.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.851
Today's surprise toy will take us to Adventure Bay with our favourite fire pup and his firefighting truck.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.340
Can you guess what it is?

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.700
It's the Paw Patrol Marshall's Fire Fightin' Truck from Nickelodeon.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.840
Marshall's Fire Fightin' Truck is available at Amazon and Toys R Us for about $20.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.280
And the ladder can be lifted up and rotated left and right.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.620
It also comes with one Marshall pup figure.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.440
It's a push along toy that doesn't require batteries.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.660
Now let's open the box and take a look.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.580
There's Marshall's fire truck.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.860
Now let's take out Marshall.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.760
There they are.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.980
Now let's take a closer look at Marshall.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.720
Marshall is the Paw Patrol's fire pup.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.640
He's a dalmatian who's all action and easily excited but sometimes a little clumsy.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.220
His pup house transforms into a firefighting truck.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.440
This toy is very well made with nice details just like in the show.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.940
You can move marshall's legs forwards and backwards.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.460
And his head from left to right.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.580
His pup pack doesn't open up though.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.860
This is not an action pup pack.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.380
Now let's look at Marshall's fire truck.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.340
It has very nice details just like in the show.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.720
It's all painted with no stickers.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.980
We can see his firehose rolled up right there.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.760
And that's where Marshall sits down.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.960
And here's the ladder that can be lifted up and down and turned all around.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.840
Now let's take Marshall for a spin.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.280
Marshall, this is Ryder. Cali is stuck on top of a tree.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.620
I need you and your firetruck to rescue her and bring her to safety.

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:52.326
Ready for action, Ryder Sir.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.580
Hang on, Cali. I'm coming.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.260
Don't worry. I'm fired up.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.800
Okay i got you.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.580
Don't worry you're safe now.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.140
Woah woah wooaah

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.720
I'm okay.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.160
Fore more fun, let's join Marshall with his other Paw Patrol friends.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.360
Here's Rubble with his Diggin Bulldozer.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.440
Hey Marshall! Nice to see you!

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.480
Hey Rubble! I'm glad to have you here.

00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:38.988
Hey guys! Don't forget me.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.740
Hey Chase! Let's go!

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.320
Paw Patrol! We're on a roll!

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.240
So that's the Paw Patrol Marshall's Fire Fightin' Truck from Nickelodeon.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.900
