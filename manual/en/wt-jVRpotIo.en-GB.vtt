00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.100
We decided to draw on Goya

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.820
We got someone from the Gallery to go and buy them for us

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.880
We suggested that we were going to have a slush fund

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.580
so that the money that was, hopefully, recuperated by selling the first work

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.440
would go into buying the second set

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.800
So that, again, we would turn it from a conceptual or gestural act

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.120
into something which was much more malevolent

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.640
which is to say that if we get our hands on every Goya set, we will draw on them

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.920
The idea of drawing on the work was a way of amplifying some of the more monstrous

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.780
or abject elements of the work

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.640
which maybe perhaps tease them out

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.720
I mean, the point about Goya making the Disasters of War was that it was about wide dissemination

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.000
you know, the etching press was about distribution rather than scarcity

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.180
But what we’re doing is, we’re rarifying the works by drawing on them

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.280
so that, in effect what we can do is that we can deplete the numbers that are available

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.580
so that perhaps they do become rarer than rocking-horse shit

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.080
I think the question of it being vandalism
is actually, technically, incorrect

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.060
because vandalism is normally schematically destructive

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.220
when what we did with the Goya pictures was to draw on them very delicately

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.280
So they are more over-drawings than they are acts of vandalism

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.900
It’s an act of erasure of sorts

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.280
so it’s a way of making a point

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.740
but making a point quite firmly

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.300
But I think that’s part of our argument about the Goyas

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.160
part of the institutional framework that somehow suppresses the work

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.580
by this absurd ethical dynamic which is to say that these images are almost journalistic depictions of atrocity

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.140
You actually look at the Goya prints

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.320
and, you know, the degree of the artist’s interest gravitates towards

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.640
the areas of laceration and castration and cutting

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.469
and so, in a way, they undermine the moral framework that it seems framed by

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.149
and I think this is a matter of actually looking at the work

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:19.229
and so I think by drawing on the work, I think we were trying to get people to look at the work
