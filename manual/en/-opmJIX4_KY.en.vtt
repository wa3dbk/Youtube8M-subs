“What’s for breakfast?” That’s a question
everyone seems to ask me. And, you know there

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.090
does seem to be some pushback when I say,
well you might want to have a 3-egg omelets

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.589
with some kale and olive oil. And people often
say, “Well, you know what I’m gonna just

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:25.579
have some oats, oatmeal. It’s really wonderful,
it’s seal cut and it’s obviously gluten-free.”

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.519
Is it really? Let’s have a look. This is
a study from the well-respected New England

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.020
Journal of Medicine that looked at gluten
contamination in oat products here in America.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.140
They looked at 3 brands of oats and to be
considered “gluten-free” a product must

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.140
contain less than 20 ppm of gluten. They looked
at three brands of oats. First was milled

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.200
in an oats only facility. Meaning they didn’t
mill potential gluten containing things like

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.150
wheat. The next brand County Choice is organic.
And the third brand, Quaker Oats is obviously

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.259
one of the most popular brands here in America.
And here’s what they found. In the brand

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.700
that you would expect to be gluten free, well,
2 of the 4 specimens actually did contain

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.700
gluten. In the organic variety, 3 of the 4
specimens actually contained gluten, and significant

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.799
amounts of gluten. And in Quaker Oats according
to the New England journal of medicine, significant

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.799
contamination with gluten really, really,
high values of gluten 75% of the samples,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.560
in this study, were not gluten-free. So the
notion that eating oatmeal is a good idea

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.590
because it’s a gluten-free choice for breakfast
really doesn’t make a lot of sense because,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.479
chances are you’re going to be getting gluten
in your breakfast. Beyond that please understand

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.649
that oatmeal, especially instant oatmeal,
has a very high glycemic index, meaning it’s

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.539
going to significantly raise your blood sugar
values and that’s not good for your brain.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.700
