00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.390
You know how much I love tactical RPGs.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.950
It’s like chess with more interesting pieces,
free from the disdain of people who think

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.360
chess is the one game to rule them all.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.290
So what would happen if you took what is effectively
a tactical RPG, strip away the levels and

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.900
grinding while leaving the HP and stats like
magical resistance and special abilities intact,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.410
then put it all on a platform smaller than
a chessboard for quick, fast, and hectic action?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.570
It’d probably look… well, a whole lot
like Hero Academy, because I just described

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.570
Hero Academy.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.860
Funny how these things work out!

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.530
So.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.660
You’ve got six clans, each made up of a
number of different units, from knights and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.860
wizards to orcs and goblins to… wait.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.180
The cast of Team Fortress 2?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.489
Um, sure, why not.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.960
If I’m willing to accept them appearing
in a Sega racing title alongside Ulala and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.020
Knuckles, I’ll allow ‘em here.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.020
Anyway.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.760
You’ve got your team, and your opponent
has their team, and you’ve each got a couple

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.940
crystal pylons that must be protected at all
costs.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.470
Knock out your opponent’s crystals, or completely
rout their side, and you win!

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.430
You get five actions to a turn, which can
include deploying a unit, buffing a unit,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.620
moving a unit, attacking, or using a special
item available in your quote-unquote “hand,”

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.870
which refills to six things at the end of
each turn.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.670
You take your actions, redoing things as many
times as you need to get it just right (which

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.110
appeals to the obsessive Disgaea addict in
me), and then submit it, not unlike Words

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.560
with Friends or other push-notification games.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.670
Words with Friends doesn’t have fireballs
or ninja though.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.440
I’m just pointing that out.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.362
If you don’t feel like playing online with
actual people, you can instead engage in a

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:04.990
number of local puzzle challenges that seriously
bent my brain, as they likely will yours as

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.990
well.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.130
There’s a set of puzzles for each of the
factions, which also function as an excellent

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.640
tutorial as to just how each of these strange
units functions.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.230
Of course, this is an online game, which means
that if you want to use anyone who isn’t

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.280
the generic-fantasy Council Team or the obvious
product placement Team Fortress 2 Team, you’ll

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.470
be shelling out for some DLC.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.000
Which is only a couple bucks per faction,
or approximately one eleven-billionth what

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.380
you’d spend playing Warhammer.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:37.730
And you don’t even get paint all over the
place.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.030
Normally I wouldn’t be a fan of freemium
gaming such as this… but man.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.791
I like the passive, momentary engagement offered
by this style of turn-based action, I like

00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.709
the lighthearted style and character art,
I like the happy medium between “vanilla

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.240
chess” and “Shining Force” that lets
me scurry around the battlefield, finding

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.170
the happy medium between offense and defense.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.240
And since there’s no immediate reactions
to worry about, you don’t need complicated

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.460
timing rules!

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.430
It… it scratches so many itches, I can’t
help but endorse it, even if I know I’m

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.959
gonna get needled for several bucks in the
very near future.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.810
I am powerless in the face of just-casual-enough
tactical engagements.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.810
There.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.810
I’ve said it.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:31.090
Now I just have to watch out for trains and
low-flying axes.
