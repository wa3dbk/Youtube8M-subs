00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.130

institutional of forces and corporate

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.299
forces take over the government how they
do it weather stories exam great example

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:13.379
of how they do it

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.499
in river

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.899
revolves around senator shelby's
republic from alabama

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:21.580
and what he's been doing is he's been
putting holds on uh... not

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.790
it's not an issue that both the senate

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.810
to get confirmed for federal jobs

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.599
the president

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.519
uh... as

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.739
you know put forward

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.170
and he put behold on seventy different
nominations

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.270
stopping all business basically in the
senate as far as

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.400
confirming those at people with the
president put forward to the senate

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.480
why is he doing this and that seems like
an extremely well mean he's a republican

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.180
i get the infidelity you know my next
removes

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.940
he wants something you want something in
return he once uh... a tanker contract

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.360
were thirty five billion dollars

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.440
to goto northrop grumman

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.160
heeds the eighty s uh... and boeing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.009
in his

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.440
home state of album

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.840
now so he's on the szabo lab business to
make sure he gets his way and he gets

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.939
his pay off i mean what he's looking for

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.929
now why does he care so much for

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.159
and northrop grumman in boeing etcetera

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.730
to get these contracts well

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.340
three differences the presents for
alleged he wants more jobs in his home

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.299
state and local politics here you bring
home the bacon and

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.290
you know all local business guys will
give you more money 'cause yaa

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.210
they benefit from that

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.680
you create those jobs to make that
tanker and then they of course those

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.970
people in the bulova restaurants
etcetera etcetera

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.400
politics one oh one in understand that
and he's suppose the fibers home state

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.360
to some degree right as long as it
doesn't come through the great expense

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.700
of the rest of us

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.369
so now that's a legitimate now was
second reason is not solution that of

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.260
course for campaign money

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.159
and have these corporations given him at
campaign money

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.670
of callers

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.500
fill these political action committee
received seventy five million dollars

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260
notation from deeds

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.410
pack died during the past two election
cycles eventual twenty one thousand five

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.839
hundred dollars from north of strike
since two thousand

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:15.789
furthermore employees of those companies
airbus chairman which is under eats

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:16.840
mca order

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.529
uh... donated fifty hundred ulcer shelby
in two thousand and nine

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.720
similac cut he'd senior vice president
of government relations

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.209
donate a thousand dollars a shall be no
three

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.809
at all of these and topics they were the
company ralph crosby donate the sale of

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:31.800
that year

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.050
one other employees bacon douglasville a
fifteen hundred dollars

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.819
in two thousand recess time doing
reporting here for our being imposed

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.309
and it's great reporting that you had
all that out there's a lot of campaign

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.409
donations from

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.889
but overall

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.009
that's still a pittance i mean if you
have all that up its under fifty

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.099
thousand dollars buy that my math right

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.340
so for fifty thousand dollars your spent
thirty five

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.410
billion dollars of taxpayer money

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.730
on something we might

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.340
or might not meet

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.999
so this is that's the problem sometimes
defense department will set but we don't

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.459
need that don't make that

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.199
powerful senators like richard shelby
will push it through

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.400
and spend that taxpayer money

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.659
and increase the deficit greatly so they
get this contribution but i've always

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.609
thought

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.569
it's not enough

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.859
it's not often enough of approx

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.849
so what's the third part of

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.969
and that's that implied

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.309
hate you know you take care of us

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.689
shelby in everybody that works in
shelby's office and believe me when you

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.729
get out we take care of you

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:36.059
perfect example here shelby's former
legislative director is a guy named

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:37.309
stuart hall

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:38.969
i guess what he is that

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.079
shockingly enough is a major lobbyist
for defense contractor in fact

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.870
at when he switched from the federalist
group

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.119
to oval v

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:50.309
in order to be able to bring

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:54.909
uh... these at koch is influence over in
getting these defense contracts

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.680
from senator shelby's office he got paid
an additional one hundred and sixty

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.019
thousand dollars

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.319
see now we're talking real money

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.980
now if you get so we can senator shelby
is going to get

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.799
when he retires

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.769
from those same defense contractors at
cana money how do we know it happens all

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.099
the time billy tauzin

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.319
does a great deal for the pharmaceutical
companies

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.049
what he's in congress he retires and
they give 'em several million dollars

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.249
every year

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:22.310
as their payoff

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.389
use of the implied payoffs hey shelby
you play ball

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.909
you take care of us

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.280
and believe me will take care you will
take care

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.509
your legislative directors your staff
annually you all get which

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.419
that's how we get through

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.199
shall be meanwhile will complain
complain about overspending pork barrel

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.629
spending is a republican although that
was that i can't believe that we read

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:44.569
the spending

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.159
number two

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.720
didn't get your marks

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.640
for his home state the whole country
earmarks are also knows pork-barrel

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.580
spending

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.210
you know how much he brought home in pet
projects alabama

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.529
a total of one

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.999
hundred and fourteen

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.819
million dollars four hundred eighty-four
thousand two hundred fifty thousand

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.319
according taxpayers for common sense
that's just in two thousand nine

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.490
before the thirty five billion dollar
contract

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.530
ed and those of the smaller projects

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.939
it does on an on and on

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.350
and it's not just before philby

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.610
john mccain

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.479

exact groups trent lott now retired is

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.199
on their board

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.969
that's how this thing works

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:28.759
and how we get through

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.019
youngster
