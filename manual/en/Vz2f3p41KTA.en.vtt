00:00:01.529 --> 00:00:04.120
Driving through...

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.339
Queensbay

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.199
Today is

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.549
Third of May 2013

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.839
We can see the lights

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.939
going around for the Queensbay thing

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.269
and

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.789
coming to a traffic stop

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.589
It's not even a traffic jam... So...

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.290
coming up to the concert

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.140
This is not a traffic jam somebody is just slowing down

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.670
I'm going to cut to the right

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.560
There's a FRU there taking care

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.490
As you can see

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.170
There's almost nobody. Parking is a lot.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.070
Mr. FRU is over here

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.290
Some music is playing with some violin

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.570
Empty empty empty

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.060
nobody is there

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.060
The artist is just performing to the air. Try to get a close up shot

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.729
The police is taking care, so I'm putting this down for a while

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.120
Maybe about one or two thousand people around but not more than that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.520
Fireworks

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.979
Nobody answers

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.769
Hao pu hao and nobody answers anything

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.139
Dennis Lau is playing but

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.040
Nobody! Nobody!

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.989
You got a bunch of ministers coming through

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.139
and that's about it

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:32.899
nobody
