00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.370
Hi.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.900
I'm Titli Nihaan and this is Busy Garden.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:13.230
I'm Titli Nihaan and this is Busy Garden.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.570
I'm Titli Nihaan and this is Busy Garden.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.740
I know what you're thinking...

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.800
"Titli-who-what?"

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
Titli Nihaan...

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.990
It's a long story, anyway.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.610
You'll soon get used to the name.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.120
I live in a small town called Prestigne which
is on the border between England and Wales.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.429
I've been here since October 2010 but since
the beginning of 2012,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.160
I've been doing a weekly video log.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.450
Not that I'm a particularly good gardener.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.450
I just...

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.450
...happen to like gardening.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.500
It's not a particularly big garden but it's
quite varied.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.500
For example,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.510
there's a fruit patch,...

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.510
"Coo-ee"

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.100
...a vegetable patch,...

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.660
"I'm here in the vegetable patch

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.460
where there had been some amazing developments
over the last week."

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.600
...a lawn,...

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.359
"You talkin' to me?"

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.210
...a wild flower bed,...

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.600
"Well, as usual, my tall plants have decided
to fall over so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.860
it's bamboo time."

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.170
...and even a greenhouse.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.780
"I've got a bit of a problem in this greenhouse,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.740
apart from the fact it's kind of full of green."

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.390
I blog about all the gardening kind of things
that people do like

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.580
prune...

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.580
"Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho"

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.580
"Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho"

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.580
"Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho"

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.580
...weed...

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.580
...weed...

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.580
"Grumble.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.580
Grumble.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.580
Grumble.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.580
Grumble."

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.580
"Grumble.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.580
Grumble.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.580
Grumble.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.580
Grumble."

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.580
...and I have a number of pests to deal with
like

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.580
slugs and snails...

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.580
"WMD:

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.580
"WMD: Weapons

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.580
"WMD: Weapons of Mollusc

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.580
"WMD: Weapons of Mollusc Destruction"

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.580
...earwigs...

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.580
"Oh my goodness me!"

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.580
...and even terrorists.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.580
In particular, a small black furry one...

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.790
"Yes you can consider taking your very last
dump in this patch for a while, my friend.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.750
Oh, thank you very much."

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.230
I get lots of birds coming in.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.810
I get lots of birds coming in.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.650
And some of them are not so bright.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.680
"Oh he's gonna fall off.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.140
He's gonna fall off.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.840
Oh he fell off."

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.480
Occassionally, you'll even hear me sing a
song or two.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.170
(Titli singing)

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.860
(Titli singing)

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.989
So, get yourself a cup of coffee,

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.099
find yourself a nice, comfy chair

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.709
and join me, each week,

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.159
in Titli's Busy Gardenï¿½
