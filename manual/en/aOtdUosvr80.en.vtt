00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.040
Whoa, this is a nice board, I was giving it
some snapping but it's not too stiff. This

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.170
is the Burton Hero, saving one butterer at
a time.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.730
This is going to be the board for that jibberer,
that guy who likes to jump a lot, and who

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.859
already basically knows what he or she is
doing. It has a flex rating of a 3, so it's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.050
going to be a little bit softer, and it does
have the V-Rocker continuous shape. There's

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.300
V-Rocker on the nose, V-Rocker on the tail
- excuse me, V-Rocker in the middle, rocker

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.000
on the nose, rocker on the tail, and Frostbite
Edges underneath the bindings, which is great.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.750
It has a twin-like shape, not completely twin,
but a twin-like shape. It does have a twin

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.221
flex and it has a Super Fly Core with Dualzone
EGD. There's hard and soft wood laminates

00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:03.870
that run tip to tail, except for the Dualzone,
which is right on the rail of your board.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.290
Burton has taken the wood and actually made
it perpendicular to the laminate wood, making

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.979
it a little bit more responsive, a little
bit stiffer on its edge, actually good for

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.640
rail riding as well. And it does have a negative
profile. The negative profile is a little

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.700
bit thicker underneath the bindings, thinner
in the core, thinner on the tip and the tail

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.149
giving a nice, smooth, even flex. Great for
jib boards.

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.850
It has Triax fiberglass. The fiberglass runs
in three different directions: 45 degrees,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.210
-45 degrees and at 0 degrees. It also has
a sintered base. This base you're going to

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.210
want to maintain and stay moist.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.289
The edges, like I said, have Frostbite underneath
the bindings. Other than that it has the Grip

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:56.200
and Rip edges. So they just 360 wrap around,
which is phenomenal, and it has the 10:45

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.299
sidewalls. They're going to be indestructible,
so if you like boosting big on jumps, if you

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.459
like thrashing hard on rails or boxes or ledges
or stumps or whatever they have now, these

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.260
are going to hold up.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.470
It does have quite a bit of extras as well.
It does have the Scoop. All the contact points

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.310
on the nose and the tail have been lifted
up for a nice scoop. So when you're buttering

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.150
around, if you're doing, you know, set up
tricks and you don't want to catch before

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.970
you even do the trick, the Scoop's going to
help you not fall.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.069
It also has Hi-Voltage jumper cables. So,
instead of just having regular carbon stringers,

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:46.349
it has carbonated rods that run from underneath
the bindings towards the tip and to the tail.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.079
It has the Infinite Ride, which means that
this board has already been broken in by Burton.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.170
You won't have to break this thing in when
you get on the hill.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.330
And it does have Pro-Tip as well. Pro-Tip
is a process in which Burton minimizes the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.120
amount of material on the nose and the tail,
causing for a thinner nose and a thinner tail,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.730
reducing the amount of weight and swing weight.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.700
This is wide options in the Burton Hero. If
you are a park slayer and you want to continue

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.370
to slay the park, this is a fantastic option.
