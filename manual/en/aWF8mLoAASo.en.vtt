00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:01.138
- [Skyy] Go ahead.

00:00:01.138 --> 00:00:03.762
- [Nikki] This drink is
called Chocolate Sin.

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:05.468
It is very sinful.

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:06.457
(Skyy laughs)

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:09.961
- [Skyy] Okay, Nikki, I can
give you two at a time, okay?

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.911
- Okay, that's how I like them.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.232
(Skyy laughs loudly)

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:13.751
- What?

00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:14.830
- [Skyy] Have you ever done that?

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.415
- No.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:16.665
- [Skyy] Would you?

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.086
- The circumstances would have to line up.

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.103
- [Skyy] Sure, sure, okay,
well that's good to know.

00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:22.164
A lot of guys are like, you know what,

00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:23.595
I want to date her now.

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:25.227
(Skyy and Nikki laugh)
- [Skyy] Alright.

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:28.595
Chocolate vodka, vanilla vodka, pour!

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.925
- Chocolate and vanilla, they like to mix.

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:32.305
- [Skyy] Okay, stop.

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:35.990
Baileys! Creme de Cacao! Cacao!

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.935
- Cacao! Cacao! Cacao!

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:40.112
- [Skyy] Okay, stop.
- [Nikki] Okay.

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:42.116
- [Skyy] Godiva white
chocolate, Godiva chocolate.

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:44.963
That's from my Godiva
collection, I love to say that.

00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:46.763
- [Nikki] This is very...
- [Skyy] Hold on.

00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:50.766
- [Nikki] That's what he said.
- (Skyy laughs)

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.404
- [Nikki] Both of them.
- [Skyy] Both of them.

00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:55.645
- [Skyy] The two guys you've been with?

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:59.628
Okay, that's good, Godiva caramel!

00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:02.343
- Godiva caramel! I like it upside-down.

00:01:02.343 --> 00:01:03.585
- [Skyy] A particular girl I was dating

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.861
gave me this as a gift.

00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:06.830
- Yeah, that's nice of her.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.485
- [Skyy] I don't know if
she bought that though.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.453
Because I believe, knowing
her, another dude gave her this

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.326
and then she re-gifted the shit.

00:01:12.326 --> 00:01:13.626
Because she's that kind of girl.

00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:15.438
- Oh, well, you still benefit.

00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:17.225
- [Skyy] I thank you anyway, darling.

00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:18.944
Last, but not least, milk!

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:21.139
To break up all that
alcohol, oh, that's fresh.

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:22.868
- [Nikki] Okay, okay, okay.
- [Skyy] That one's fresh.

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:24.226
- [Skyy] I have a lot of
spoiled stuff in my...

00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:27.222
- Just threw out a very
spoiled half-and-half.

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:31.320
- [Skyy] Right there, that's good.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.767
Let us garnish this with
a strawberry, right there.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.285
Okay, and we can just hit this with

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.323
a little bit of Hershey's.

00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:47.480
And there you have it: Chocolate Sin!

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.624
And this drink was
created by Daniel Stein.

00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:54.667
Oh, if you credit me just
call me Daniel S., please.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.825
By Daniel S.!
(Nikki laughs)

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.024
Don't mention the Stein part, he doesn't

00:01:58.024 --> 00:02:00.576
want you to know that, okay!
- [Nikki] Okay!

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:01.923
- [Skyy] There we go.
- [Nikki] Thank you!

00:02:01.923 --> 00:02:03.744
- [Skyy] Mix it up because
all the booze at the bottom.

00:02:03.744 --> 00:02:07.817
- Okay, booze at the
bottom, that's what I want.

00:02:07.817 --> 00:02:09.062
I guess if I didn't mix it, I could

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.816
just suck from the bottom.

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.588
- Whenever girls use
those words like, suck,

00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:17.907
it just sounds sexual.
- [Nikki] I know, I hesitated,

00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:22.195
- [Nikki] but then I was
like, fuck it. (Skyy laughs)

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:26.535
- [Nikki] Damn.
- [Skyy] Potent, right?

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:30.216
- [Nikki] Yes, potent and
chocolaty, this is sinful.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.701
- You can taste a lot
of chocolate, really?

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:32.487
- If drinking this is wrong,

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:34.464
I don't want to be right.

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:36.077
- That's the second time
you've used that joke.

00:02:36.077 --> 00:02:36.856
- Good, good, good.

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.457
- I'm just sayin', okay?

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:39.699
You got to come with new material.

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.742
You got to go home and you
got to write your shit, okay?

00:02:42.742 --> 00:02:45.678
This new year, it's all
about humility, alright?

00:02:45.678 --> 00:02:49.796
It's all about, hey,
appreciate your lessers,

00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:52.481
appreciate other people.

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:53.561
- How about you construct a sentence?

00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:55.900
How about that's your
new year's resolution?

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:57.789
- [Skyy] Let me just clear some stuff up.

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.472
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:00.079
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.781
if you watch me speak, you
will notice that I tend

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.356
to stutter from time-to-time,
stumble over words.

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:08.978
It's because my speech pattern
is a two process thing.

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:10.476
I have to think about
what I want to say and

00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:13.622
then I have to enunciate
in a way that will be

00:03:13.622 --> 00:03:16.201
comprehended by the majority
of people watching this show.

00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:19.219
The way I'm speaking now, is
not the way I speak naturally!

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.542
- How do you speak naturally?

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:22.236
- More from the Caribbean,
that's where I'm from!

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:23.595
(Nikki laughs)

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:25.718
- [Skyy] If I'm on the phone, (mumbles).

00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:26.925
Yeah man, how you all doing?

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.286
Okay, I can format it real smooth,

00:03:28.286 --> 00:03:29.447
but I can't do that on a show,

00:03:29.447 --> 00:03:30.687
because you all wouldn't
understand jack-shit.

00:03:30.687 --> 00:03:32.560
You all barely understand shit now.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.694
Then you'd understand less, okay?

00:03:34.694 --> 00:03:36.516
So when you see me
stuttering and stumbling and

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.233
spitting on people and
stuff like that, understand,

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:42.577
this motherfucker's trying to
be understood, happy new year!

00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:47.418
- (laughs) Wow. (clapping)

00:03:47.418 --> 00:03:48.665
I got it easy.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:50.112
(Skyy laughs)

00:03:50.112 --> 00:03:50.831
- And there you have it,

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.250
Chocolate Sin, properly garnished.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.303
I couldn't let you all go
without seeing the drink

00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:55.658
the way it's supposed to look,

00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:58.060
with a strawberry and
chocolate flakes on it.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.433
Keepin' it sexy.

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:00.696
In the recipe that he sent us,

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:01.744
he didn't say I need garnishes,

00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:04.240
but I looked at this and be,
you know, the drink's cool,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.339
but it's too plain, we
had to add something,

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.890
so I sexified it and I showed it to you,

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.118
you will make it this way.

00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:12.210
Tipsy Bartender, I'm out!

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.825
We have a lot of melting going on,

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:15.870
just because we've been
doing so much back and forth,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.239
so please, audience, excuse that.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.538
And there you have it: Sirens Song!

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:25.678
Under the sea.
^- [Woman] Under the...No!

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.074
(Skyy mumbles)
