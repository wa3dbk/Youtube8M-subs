00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:05.905
&gt;&gt; The facilities behind
me were set up specifically

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.540 line:92%
for the mountain pygmy possums.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.908 line:92%
They're an Alpine species.

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:13.612
So they need temperatures that
drop-down to about 2 degrees

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:16.415
in the winter, and we need to
be able to keep it fairly cool

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:19.752
in summer, because up on
Mount Buller and Mount Hotham

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.654
and Kosciuszko, as
well, it doesn't get

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.390 line:92%
to really hot temperatures.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.461
They are Australia's only
hibernating marsupials.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:32.264
So we're simulating the
conditions inside these rooms

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:36.402
so that they can
hibernate in winter.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.672
Today we took up two of our
little 12 week old litters

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:42.775
of mountain pygmy possums,
took them up to the hospital,

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.578
up to the AWHC for essentially
their first vet check.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:50.082
So we got the vets to have
a look at their teeth,

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.051 line:92%
their eyes, their ears.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.587
They all had a microchip
inserted into them,

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.056
so that we can identify
them in the future,

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.425
because they all pretty
much look the same,

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:03.229
and we also took a little hair
sample so that we can send

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.498 line:92%
that off for genetic analysis.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:13.205
Unfortunately, there's been
a lot of change happening

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.207 line:92%
to their natural habitats.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.276
So we've got ski
villages up sort

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.712
of where the possums
used to live.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.781
We've put roads through
the Boulder Fields,

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:26.652
where these little guys
actually love to move and feed.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:31.323
So it has caused
fragmentation change and damage

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:35.294
to the natural sort of structure
and vegetation up there.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:39.265
Climate change is
potentially also a big issue

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.399 line:92%
for these fellows.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.804
They do need good snow
cover in winter in order

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.373 line:92%
to hibernate property.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:51.877
If the climate is changing and
where having warmer winters

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.879
and we're not getting
a good snow cover,

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.649
the mountain pygmy possums
won't hibernate so well,

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.585
which means that they
may be waking up,

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:00.619 line:92%
arousing during a period

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.255
when they would normally
be hibernating,

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.691
and every time they wake
up from hibernation,

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.059 line:92%
they do lose body weight.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.828
So there's generally not a
lot of food around in winter,

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:13.265
and so hibernation is a
way that they can skip

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:17.102
through that period where
there's not so many resources.

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:21.941
Mountain pygmy possums rely on
a huge migration of Bogong moths

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.811
that make their way up to
the Alpine areas every spring

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.379 line:92%
when the snow melts.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.049
One of the simplest things
you can do if you're staying

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.252
up on the mountain during
that period is to make sure

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.921
that at night time, you
turn all lights off.

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.390
You don't leave any sort of
unnecessary lights going,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.526
because that will actually
attract the moths away

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:41.894 line:92%
from the boulder fields.

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.530
We want the moths to actually
do their normal migration,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.865
which is out onto the boulder
fields and down into the rocks,

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:48.767
which is where the
pygmy possums live.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:51.537
Then they can have their
normal food source.
