00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.440
The Caged Lion

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.220
Once a cruel Lion, was caught in a hunter's cage in a forest.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.700
He tried his best to free himself from the cage.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.560
But in vain !

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.240
Because of his cruel nature,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.600
none of the forest animals came forward to rescue him.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.640
Time passed by.....

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.380
And after a while, a poor Brahmin came upon the caged Lion.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.340
The Lion requested the Brahmin to rescue him.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.100
Sir, Please stop for a moment.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.120
I was caught inside the hunter's cage by a mistake.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.700
Please, help me to come out of this gate, Sir....

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.700
I will be grateful to you !

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.960
Do you think, I'm a fool to do such a stupid act?

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.540
Don't I know, that if I release you from this cage,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.440
you will eat me up the next moment .

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.860
No Sir !

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.320
I promise, that I won't kill you.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.800
If you help me out,I will give you a precious GEM.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.720
It has powers to make your wishes come true.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.720
The Brahmin's heart filled with greed.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.320
So he released the lion from the cage.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.780
The lion came very near to the Brahmin and said

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.820
Dear Brahmin, won't you now come with me?

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.200
And then take your reward !

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.440
Go home soon to your family.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.320
Your family members are worried about you.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.060
I don't want any rewards.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.020
Dear Brahmin, STOP for a moment and listen to me.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020
I have not eaten for last two days.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.020
Do you think, I'm a fool !

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.680
To let a ,ready meal like you to get away from me ?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.360
Hey Lion! you are being unjust.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.040
It is not fair to kill your saviour.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.040
Ask anyone, they will say I am CORRECT.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.740
You cannot do this .

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.980
Just GO AWAY from me.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.240
Ha! Ha! Ha!

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.760
Justice, injustice, killing and eating are part of my nature.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.800
Everyone knows this.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.900
And I am correct to act naturally.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.440
Ask anybody, I will give you an hour to prove yourself.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.820
Otherwise, Brahmin! I think you will be my lunch this afternoon.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.980
Ha! Ha!

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.260
I think, the Lion is correct.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.480
Humans are selfish like the Lion.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.100
Look at me!

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.900
I give shade and shelter to the tired travellers.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.880
Yet they don't stop cutting my branches for firewood and

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.920
my leaves for their animal feeds.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.600
They also take the fruits and flowers from me.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.880
If all people do this,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.900
then the Lion also has a right to behave in such a way.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.040
I see nothing wrong in Lion's behavior !

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.140
He is not being unfair .

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.400
Look At Me!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.920
I lead lost and tired travellers to their safe and warm homes.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.000
In return they spit on me and litter me.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.600
I get nothing in return,for the service I provide.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.560
If all you do is right, the lion also is right.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.920
In spite, of all the details, that you have provided me now,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.820
I still cannot make out a thing.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.980
Can you, lead me to the spot, where all this happened?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.780
If we go there, it will be really helpful,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.220
for me to solve this problem for you.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.800
What Brahmin, shall we go ?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.380
Come with me.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.920
I will take you.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.260
The Hare, went near the cage and stared at it for a while.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.800
And then he said,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.640
Hmm, I don't understand.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.640
How a large lion like you,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.860
Could go into a narrow barred cage like this?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.140
Will you show me?

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.360
So that I can get a clear picture.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.960
You silly Creature. You don't understand.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.580
WATCH ME NOW!

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.780
The Lion promptly got into the cage to SHOW OFF!

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.380
But, the clever Hare had a plan up in sleeve.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.820
He quickly went and bolted the cage door.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.380
The Lion was caged Once again.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.720
The Hare, then asked....

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.860
What Brahmin, is this how the Lion was when you saw him ?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.740
Yes!

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.160
Come Brahmin, let's go.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.020
We will leave this Lion in the cage.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.300
You did a mistake, releasing him.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.020
Come. Let's go.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.400
THANK YOU! Friend. Thanks a lot !

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.320
I cannot forget you, for saving me from this cruel animal.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.700
Thanks Once Again !

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.500
The Brahmin and the Hare went to their way.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.380
And for the unjust Lion, the cage became his home.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.380
The moral of the story is...

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.800
Children, did you see what happened to the Lion?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.900
If it had kept his word, it would have been free now.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.080
Since it was unjust, the cage became his home.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.380
So, if you promise something always keep it up.
