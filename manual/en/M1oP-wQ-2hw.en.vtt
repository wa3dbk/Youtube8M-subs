00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.080
Hi Groovers, Chris here from www.mtbtips.com.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.200
Rather than teach you every little micro technique that makes up really

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.500
good switchback skill,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.900
here are the most important techniques that
make the biggest difference,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.400
and give the biggest gains, to the riders I coach.  Make sure you do these steps

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.600
really well, and then everything else will just fall into place.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.530
UP - On approach: Look ahead to a wide and grippy entry.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.300
Save a burst, and set your gear and speed.   Look ahead

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.500
to a wide and grippy entry.  For most switchbacks the wide path around the turn is faster

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.300
and less steep.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.360
Save a burst: Don't approach the switchback flat-out.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.500
Save some energy for a mid-turn power surge.  Set your gear and speed:

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.600
Pedal in a gear and at a speed that gives you
the momentum and control to overcome

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.100
any obstacles on the turn.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.100
And stay off the brakes!  At entry:  Find mid-turn,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.400
stay seated, and get ready to shift.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.200
Find mid-turn: Your eyes should be scanning through mid-turn by now.  Remember, your eyes

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.900
lead the bike,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.200
not your hands!  Stay seated.  Only rise
off the saddle

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.289
if you have the traction and power to do
so.  Use the chest and nose technique for

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:13.530
steep switchbacks.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.300
Get ready to shift:  If you really have to
gear shift,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.100
do it in advance then instantly
increase pedal speed to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.700
maintain momentum.

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.030
Mid-turn: Boost your Eyes,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.700
Power Surge, and Lower your Chest.  Boost your Eyes:

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.290
Quickly boost your eyes with purpose along your line to that wide, grippy exit path.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.700
You'll exit smoother and straighter without the
wiggles.  Power Surge:

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.000
At the same time, or before the climb
steals your speed,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.900
apply that strong surge of pedal power
to maintain your momentum.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.680
Without this, you'll lose momentum and
struggle for balance.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.159
Lower your Chest:  As the turn steepens, lower your chest to the bar to maintain

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.600
your center of gravity

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.100
to keep that front wheel tracking.  At Exit:

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.100
Look ahead to whatever is coming next.  If
it's another switchback

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.400
then you should be searching for its
wide and grippy entry line.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.940
Your legs might be tired, but your eyes aren't, so use them!

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.489
DOWN - Approach: Look ahead to a wide, grippy entry.

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.670
Set your gear and speed, and Get low off the saddle.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.049
Look ahead to a wide, grippy entry.   A wide entry path,

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.200
then cutting closer for a late apex, out to a wide exit

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.810
usually provides more speed and control.  Set your gear and speed.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.690
Shift to the gear you'll need on exit and
adjust your speed so that you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.860
enter the switchback in control, without
skidding.  Get low off the saddle:

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.000
Low is Key.  Use your dropper post, or get one fast!

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.500
At entry: Find mid-turn,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.100
Off the front brake, and Get low and lean.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.530
Find mid-turn: Your eyes should be scanning through mid-turn by now.  Off the Front,

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.600
feather the rear. If you can't release the front brake, you didn't get control

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.400
on approach.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.500
Front braking on a tight turn spells disaster!

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.430
Get low and lean:

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.800
Lean the bike inward and get low with most of your weight on the outside pedal,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.170
light on the bar.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.420
Mid-turn: Find the grippy exit, Feather the rear,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.300
and Keep low and lean.  Find the grippy exit.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.450
Look through to a wide and straight exit path.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.310
Feather the rear: Feather the rear brake smoothly,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.900
and let it go at about two-thirds to
three-quarters around the turn.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.330
Keep low and lean.  Weight your

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.900
outside pedal with your center of
gravity vertically above the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.400
bottom bracket.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.409
You should be light and relaxed on the
handlebar.  At Exit:

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.459
Look ahead to whatever is coming next.  If
it's another switchback

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.500
then you should be searching for its
wide and grippy entry line.
