Hi my name is Jared North and today we are
going to be talking about some slides bends

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.080
vibratos pull offs and hammer on’s. Lots
of the fun stuff you can do now that you’ve

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.360
got a little bit of an education on some scales.
So lets first start of with a slide. Slide

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.970
is relatively easy and it’s just as it’s
name implies. We are going to start of with

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.920
a slide on the fourth string fifth fret and
all we are going to do is slide our finger

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:36.980
from the fifth to the seventh, relatively
easy. That’s how you slide a string. Our

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:45.070
hammer on what re are going to do is first
attack the same string same some note but

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.721
instead of sliding, we’re going to just
go ahead and press down with our fourth finger.

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:59.190
Just like you’re hammering with your finger
hence the name hammer on. A pull off is the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.970
same thing, only doing the opposite. Now bending
the string, that’s a totally different technique

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.040
and there are just a little bit more patience
and time. Good bending and good bend players

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.940
like David Gilmore and any of your great blues
players like Buddy Guy put a lot of time into

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.610
this craft. First off, you want to make sure
we have good support with our fingers. We

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.680
go ahead and we take both of our fingers,
our middle finger and our ring finger and

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.110
place our middle finger on the sixth fret
of the third string and ring finger is going

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:45.540
to be placed on the seventh fret and what
we are going to do is bend up.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.210
Notice how this finger gives this finger support.
How do we know that are bending to the right

00:01:50.210 --> 00:02:00.210
note? A full bend, should be in unison with
the string right directly underneath it. That’s

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.260
how you know you are bending correctly. There’s
full bends, half bends and quarter bends depending

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.700
on how much of the note you want to bend up
but the basics are keep this finger and this

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:21.660
finger close together for support and bend
up. Our last technique is going to be called

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.950
the vibrato. Vibrato is another one of those
techniques takes a while to get down and finesse

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.990
but once you’ve got it you’ve got your
own signature sound. Everybody’s a little

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.890
bit different but they do sound cool when
you are soloing. So let’s go ahead, make

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.600
sure we have plenty of support with our fingers,
and wiggle the string back and forth. Gives

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:50.520
it a sense of vibrato. For the beginner I
highly recommend using three fingers or at

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.680
least two fingers to get plenty of support
and that’s some of the tricks we can do

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.930
when playing around with our scales or soloing.
