Once upon a time in the castle dungeons...

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.610
...all of the death sentence prisoners were
pardoned by the king!

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.480
Hello everyone! You're uh you're all uh...

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.940
...pardoned!

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.460
It's always uh nice to make people uh...

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.340
...happy!

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.670
even if it's with uh something small like
uhm their useless litlle lives

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.490
and now I'm gonna water my uh... flowers!

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.490
but the king was and ready for what he

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.940
was about to discover

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.740
I'm here! I'm here to defend the king!

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.740
Who is trying to assassin him?!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.380
no one is... and uh why are you holding uh

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.640
a sausage? -Huh?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760
If this is a sausage than what did I put in my sandwich?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.540
Sir Kevin! Look at my beautiful uhh
flowers! 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.540
I don't see any beautiful flowers...

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.690
...just some cut of one's lying around

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.630
That's what I uh... mean!

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.640
someone's cut them uh... off!!

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030
I will find out who did this outrageous
thing

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.690
I will not sleep until I find this
maniac

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.900
if that means I will be looking for the
rest of my life

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.240
then so be it!

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.040
Hm?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.240
Oh hi Axel!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.420
good morning sir Kevin

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.359
don't run with those hedge shears or you'll
poke your eyes out

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.180
Eh your majesty! I found the person who ruined your beautiful garden!

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.189
Well? Who uh.. was it?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.660
 I will let Axel cut
his head off!!

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.840
it was Axel the executioner!

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.899
But...eh...

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.040
Why?

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.200
I'm so sorry, your majesty...

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.849
but after you pardoned all the prisoners
I couldn't behead anyone anymore

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:48.069
I felt so useless! I just needed
to behead something

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.349
come come uh... Axel. I know just the thing to uh...

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:53.220
...do!

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.160
And once again, the King made someone
very happy!

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.500
about the uhm... pardoning... 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.300
that's uh... not happening uh....

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.060
