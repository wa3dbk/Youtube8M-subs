00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.320
I feel that long, long ago some great man once said,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.080
“When one dies, they become a butterfly, and can fly as far as they may.”

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.770
When you dance and turn round and round all night until morning, you can forget

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.540
Everything, like it were all such a fairytale as that from a faraway land

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.790
The landscapes I longed to see

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.920
The places I wanted to go

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.280
Ever since I was born

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.420
Were in such fairytales

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.920
Kill me

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.120
Only when I have died could I know

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.650
How I never needed

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.810
Such beautiful wings

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.470
Kill me

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.730
Only when I have died could I know

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.100
That such a beautiful world

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.380
Was right here before me

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.960
Since when I heard your voice

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.820
You took my hand

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.410
When I open my eyes, first I’ll say “Good Morning”

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:47.300
With a smile, and then I’ll tell you all of this
