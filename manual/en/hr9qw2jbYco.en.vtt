00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.600
G'day and welcome back to Buildsum and in today's video what I want to show you is how we calculate

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.269
the drop off

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.500
on our roof

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.110
But basically what the drop off i,s if I zoom in here it

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.219
is the distance down from the top plate to

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.020
Where it would be level with the end of our rafters so it's this distance

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.750
here formed by this yellow triangle

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.589
So from the top of the plate down to a point that's level with the bottom of our rafter

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.540
Okay, so that's the drop off, now the common uses for the drop off

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.389
1. is to give us a point for our brick layer to lay their bricks to

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.030
Now that would generally have to be

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.519
10, 15mm lower than our drop off because you have to keep a distance or a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.769
Clearance between our eave and our brickwork if you had level eaves and the other reason that we'd use it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.490
It's so that we could locate

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.189
where the top of the windows would have to finish if you're going to run our eave in

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
flush out of the top of the windows, so

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.829
You need to work out how to calculate our drop off

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.259
So it's a reasonably easy we need to know couple of things the formula is

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.459
TAN times the Roof pitch and then we times that by the eaves width

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.969
Okay, so in this case our

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.740
Roof pitch is 30 degrees the angle here and

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.799
Our eaves width is

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:43.859
300mm from the Brickwork

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.369
to the outside of the rafter however

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.939
because this is a brick veneer example. We need to add 110mm for our brick and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.030
40mm for our cavity

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.619
so that will give us a total of450mm for our eaves widths

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
Okay

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.030
So there's a formula there

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.849
TAN 30 x 450mm

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.479
and as I said before 300 + 110 + 40 gives us the 450

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.180
so the answer to that is

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.239
0.259807 so let's say

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.799
260mm is our drop off now. This is a truss roof and we don't have any birds mouth however if

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.590
We were to have a bird's mouth

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.719
Then you can see that. There's a distance here

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.739
from

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.959
Where our triangle finishes to the top the top of the plate and we need to?

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.890
accommodate all we need to add that distance into it if we have I traditionally cut roof with a bird's mouth

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.629
So the first step is exactly the same we've worked out that

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.489
It's 260mm from here to here all we have to do is add

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.929
that remaining Birdsmouth in now quite easily to measure that distance or it could be given to you

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.919
However, I have some cruel sadistic people

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.249
use a method called horizontal bearing and what they do is. They give you this distance here

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.169
Now I don't know why they would but it happens in some examples

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.950
So I'm going to show it to you

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.259
So basically all that is if you have a look at that if we take that little triangle [here

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.669
that's just a smaller version of this triangle here, so the same formula applies, so if we go down

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.279
TAN 30 x 24mm

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.730
actually gives us 13856mm so let's say 14mm

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.700
40mm height the door distance here 14mm so all we have to add is so all we have to do is add

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.488
260mm and 14

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.220
that gives us

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.049
274mm as our drop-off in this example

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.979
So there you go. There's how we work out the drop-off for both the truss and a conventually cut roof with a bird's mouth
