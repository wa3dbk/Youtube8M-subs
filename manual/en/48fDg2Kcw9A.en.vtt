Hello, and welcome to our Easy Origami Bat video

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.000
This is a bat that is very easy to make, and would be fun on Halloween or anytime

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:14.994
Start with a square of origami paper with the color side up 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.520
Then make a mountain fold along the diagonal as we're showing here

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.080
Then crease that fold well

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.040
Next you're going to fold the paper in half, like this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.520
And then unfold that last fold

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.300
Now you'll take the bottom edge and fold it up to the top

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.880
Leave about 1 cm or so of the top point visible

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.320
Fold down that top point

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.486
just like we're showing here

00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:27.334
don't fold it all the way over

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:34.235
just like that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.660
Next we're going to make a mountain fold in the piece

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.580
like this

00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:54.575
Next make a valley fold along the line I'm showing here

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.760
So from the base of the head of the bat to the bottom of the body

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.994
Flip the piece over and do that on the other side

00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:23.840
Again that same line

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.400
Now what we're going to do is fold this edge here onto this front edge

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.340
like this

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.860
And repeat that on the backside

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.780
Now we're going to make a valley fold along this line

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.907
and repeat that on the backside

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.520
Now all we need to do is hold the two wingtips like this

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.740
and unfold the piece gently like this

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.380
And there you have it.  Your Origami Bat is complete.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.820
Enjoy!
