00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:06.230
A great key framing exercise for Avid Media
Composer is the moving filmstrip.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.990
Start by marking in-out points for a series
of six clips

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.359
Whatever value you choose, make sure you use
the same duration for all of your other clips.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:25.199
In this example, I'm going to make the clips
3:00 seconds each.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.429
Drag all the clips from the bin window directly
to the timeline.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.970
This will create a new sequence, so make sure
you give your sequence a name.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.840
Place the position indicator at the first
frame of your sequence.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.750
I recommend turning on the clip durations
feature from the timeline menu to make sure

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.760
all your clips are exactly the same duration.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.460
Delete any audio tracks that you may have.
You can do this by de-activating the tracks

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.980
you want to keep and then press the delete
key.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.040
Move over to the effects palette located within
the project window.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.310
Click on the blend category and find the picture
in picture effect.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.250
Drag the picture in picture effect to the
first clip in the timeline.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.720
Click on the effects editor button.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.080
On the record side of the composer window
zoom out a bit so you can see the edge of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.630
the visible picture area.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.750
Drag the clip so it's at the extreme right
edge of the visible picture area.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.030
Click on the first keyframe within the composer
window.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.640
Drag the clip to the other side of the visible
picture area.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.521
Go ahead and press play in the record side
of the composer window. Notice how the clip

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:51.000
moves through the frame.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.740
Drag this effect icon from the effect editor
and drop it onto the other clips. Now all

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.310
the clip segments have the same exact effect.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.820
Close the effects editor and play the sequence.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.760
Notice how each clip plays across the screen
one clip at a time.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.080
The last step is to layer these segments so
we have a continuous filmstrip.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:28.590
Add two additional video tracks by right clicking
in this grey area.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.480
Move this video monitor icon up to V3.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.410
Move playhead indicator to the front of the
timeline.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.870
Move forward until the first clip is completely
on-screen within the visible picture area.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.340
In this case, this distance is exactly one
second.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.959
This distance is important, because it's going
to be the same value over and over again for

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.620
each incoming clip.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.959
Click on the red segment arrow at the bottom
of the timeline to enter into segment mode.

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.660
Hold down the command key, and drag the second
clip up and over of the blue indicator on

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.140
V2.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.280
The command key will help you snap your clip
directly to the blue position indicator.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.239
Move forward another second within the timeline.

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.120
Before placing the next clip, make sure you
click on the red segment arrow again.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.370
Drag the next clip up and over to the blue
indicator on V3.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.620
The rest of the clips follow the same pattern
as the first three. Go ahead and move them

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.620
into position.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.450
This it! Now you have a moving filmstrip.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.230
Go ahead and play your sequence to see how
it plays out.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.910
