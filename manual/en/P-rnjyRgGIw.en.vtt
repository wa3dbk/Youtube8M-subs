00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:06.270
          Shawn and Angela      
          are so cute together. 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.806
            Maybe next weekend, 
            the four of us      
            could go out...     

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.440
 (CHUCKLES)                     
 "The four of us."              

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.742
                     What?      

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:12.243
 Shawn's two-week rule.         

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.479
                   So I guess   
                   that's it.   
                   It's over.   

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.714
 Two weeks.                     
 You knew that                  
 going in.                      

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:17.949
                    I did.      

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.953
 Wait. Where                    
 are you going?                 

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.454
              (SCOFFS)          
              Oh, I'm sorry.    

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.723
        I thought you were done 
        letting me down easy.   

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:26.857
                  Go ahead.     

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:29.828
     Never mind.                

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:31.596
                Are you okay?   

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.467
  You're just                   
  taking this so well.          

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:38.102
                 It was a great 
                 two weeks.     
                 We had fun.    

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.238
     Yeah. We did.              

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.741
                    So?         

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.009
          So...                 

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:46.410
      See ya?                   

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:03.361
       That Angela's all right. 
       I'm gonna miss her.      

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.064
           Well, then why       
           did you break up     
           with her?            

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.968
           As they say          
           south of the border, 
           &lt;i&gt; dos semanas.&lt;/i&gt;        

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.003
          Shawn, you guys were  
          really getting along! 

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.437
               You know,        
               your two-week    
               rule is dumb.    

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.974
 No, no, no.                    
 His one-week                   
 rule was dumb.                 

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.876
 His two-week rule              
 shows growth.                  

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:19.744
           Shawn, just face it. 
           You're afraid to     
           make a commitment.   

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.279
                 I'm not afraid 
                 to make a...   

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.614
             I've been with     
             Cory for 15 years. 

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.984
 Ah, they've been               
 good years.                    

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:27.385
               You worked       
               very hard at it. 

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:29.320
 Hey, it takes two.             

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.856
                Stop!           

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.190
          You're afraid to      
          get to know someone.  

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.926
            You're afraid of    
            letting someone     
            get to know you.    

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.260
             And unless         
             you get over this, 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.029
            you're going to     
            go through life     
            all alone.          

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.365
         Except for Cory,       
         who will bring you     
         magazines and pudding. 

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.001
          There. I think        
          I got through to him. 

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.437
                      (SIGHS)   

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.973
 Sure, you did,                 
 honey, and now                 
 he wants to hear               

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.407
 what she has to say.           

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.980
 What did Topanga mean          
 about me being                 
 afraid to commit?              

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.715
    You know,                   
    most relationships          
    don't work out,             

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.218
 and I just want                
 to get out before              
 anyone gets hurt, okay?        

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.020
            Shawn, we just want 
            you to be happy.    

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:04.622
      Mmm-hmm.                  

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.591
 Hey, look.                     
 Somebody left their purse.     

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:08.592
                           Hmm. 

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.863
           Hey, Mr. Feeny,      
           we found this purse. 

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.264
            Who runs            
            the lost and found? 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.869
           I do, Mr. Matthews.  

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.907
          I teach English,      
          history and film,     

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.376
        and I run               
        the lost and found.     

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.044
 We'll put up a notice.         

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.179
             Would you?         

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.549
 Maybe you should               
 go through it and see          
 if there's any ID.             

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:32.817
            No. Not gonna.      

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.586
            I once went through 
            my mom's purse.     

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.455
           Yeah. I can't        
           look at her anymore. 

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:41.426
  Okay. Stand back.             
  I'm going in.                 

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.329
 (CLEARS THROAT)                
 Okay. No wallet. No ID.        

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:45.630
     Well, there's got to       
     be something in there      

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.866
          that lets us know     
          who she is, right?    

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:50.635
     Lip gloss.                 
     She cares                  
     about her lips.            

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.937
                  (SNIFFS) Hmm. 

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.306
                   Kiwi mango.  

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:55.440
         No way!                

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.276
     (SNIFFS) Kiwi...           
     That is so sexy!           

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.611
   Do you know that             
   the Ted Koppel show          

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.447
    called that                 
    "the lip gloss              
    of forbidden love"?         

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.418
             And look at this,  
             a book of sonnets. 

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:09.387
  (LAUGHS) Shakespeare,         
  I hear he's good.             

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.624
    Notice the bookmark.        

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.559
      A ticket stub to          
      a Van Damme movie.        

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:16.761
    Only the greatest           
    actor ever made.            

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.264
      Okay, so what we got here 
      is a purse-losing,        
      lips-protecting,          

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.400
          poetry-reading,       
          Van Damme-loving gal. 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.470
    Wow. I'd give               
    her two weeks.              

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.007
            Mr. Feeny!          

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.307
      Hey.                      

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.809
   Anyone call about            
   that purse yet?              

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.411
              "Love is not love 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.581
            "Which alters when  
            it alteration finds 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.083
         "Or bends with         
         the remover to remove" 

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.385
 No one called, huh? Bummer.    

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:42.854
      Anyway, listen.           

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.689
     Topanga and I              
     were talking               
     about your problem.        

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:46.223
                   I don't have 
                   a problem.   

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.225
 We feel that if you            
 met the right girl...          

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.560
              Wait, wait, wait. 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.829
               Is this you or   
               Topanga talking? 

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:55.433
   She decided we're            
   one person. Anyway,          

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:57.301
 Topanga's got this friend.     

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.437
        Debra.                  
                No. No, no, no. 

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:00.838
                I don't want    
                to be fixed up. 

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.507
        Hey, you know what else 
        I found in this purse?  

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.009
           A guitar pick,       
           a Greenpeace sticker 

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.244
         and a box of Sno-Caps, 

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:09.146
         only the greatest      
         movie snack ever made. 

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.616
     Wait a minute.             
     Shawn. Listen.             

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.051
     Don't you want             
     that feeling?              

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.653
                 What feeling?  

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.022
 You know, that feeling         
 you get when you meet          
 someone special.               

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.258
   It's the feeling             
   I get every day              
   when I'm with Topanga.       

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:25.630
  You know, it's warm           
  and happy and fuzzy.          

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:29.266
 I can't describe it,           
 but there are bunnies.         

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.936
  Lots of bunnies.              

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:35.973
   You know, we just            
   want you to have             
   that feeling. Okay?          

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.443
    So meet Debbie.             

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.378
        Fine. I'll meet Debbie. 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.080
        Good.
