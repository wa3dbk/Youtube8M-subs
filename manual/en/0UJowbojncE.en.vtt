00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.760
 The only thing I had to take along..

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.293
were  my drum sticks ...

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.160
my in-ears...

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.440
and we had a flight case with us 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.920
which contained for instance the guitars,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.160
my double-bass pedal ...

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.300
and the 'Armin Only' kick drum front skin...

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.860
and some percussion I use...

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.740
And what I personally always took along

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.780
in my hand-luggage... very practical

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.880
because check-in luggage can get lost...

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.800
is the Roland TM-2...

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.680
which I use during some of my performances.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.820
Here he is...

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.040
the TM-2.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.220
Within a hybrid set you can...

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.628
put a trigger on your snare

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.880
and when you hit your acoustic snare

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.440
you can layer it with a fat snare

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.280
or a high pitched or aggressive snare.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.900
And when playing 'metal' it becomes very handy to get more 'attack' in your kick drum

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.087
by using a trigger...

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.000
to get that typical attack sound

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.468
and all this is possible by using the TM-2.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.460
And what I also love is playing along with loops.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.680
So you can trigger a bass-loop or whatever loop

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.800
to jam along with and switch it of whenever you like.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.880
And...

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.540
next year I want to do more with these features.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.820
I always have the TM-2 with me...

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.180
and the bar triggers...

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.300
And in other setups I use the kick- and snare trigger...

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.120
and I also have the Roland SPD-SX.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.900
And from now on, for my other projects...

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.160
I am experimenting with the SPD-SX in my studio...

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.220
And I know I can get much more out this instrument compared with how I use it today.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.840
So I am really looking forward to discover more.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.880
And I am also thinking about getting that external kick trigger pedal.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.080
Because that enables me to very easily play an electronic kick for example...

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.980
so changing sounds again you know... so eh...

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.060
yeah...
