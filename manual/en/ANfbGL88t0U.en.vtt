Hi this Megan with Beadaholique.com and I want to show
you

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.289
how to use round cord end caps

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.779
like these which are usually popularly
used for thick cord for Kumihimo

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.340
braiding

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.750
I want to show you how to use them

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.019
to make a faux wrap bracelet

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.320
so instead of having one cord in there

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.070
you will have, I put five, you can use

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.320
whatever number that you want

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.770
and the end result ends up

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.860
looking like a wrap bracelet except it's
really easy and quick to take on and off

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.709
so

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:49.170
all you need to do it is decide what cord you want to use and how many strands

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.550
I'm using this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.790
really pretty

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.600
waxed cotton cord

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.540
I decided I wanted to use five strands

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.930
so I'll go ahead and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.590
bundle up my cords

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770
and thenI just measured

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.380
using a caliper

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.670
how wide

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.979
that was gonna be to fit nicely into

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.590
a cord end and so I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.620
looked at this and decided it
would fit pretty well into a cord end

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.600
that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.270
is meant to accommodate a four millimeter
cord because together

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.510
they're about four millimeters

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.389
so I have

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:26.420
these cord end caps here

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.310
that are meant for 4mm cord

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.250
and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.600
you want to make sure that you grab

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.280
your cords

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.490
not flat but go ahead and you know put
them in a little bundle so they fit in

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.560
the round end

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.830
and if you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.250
feel like it would be easier you can
definitely

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.230
tie some thread around this like you do
when you're ending a Kumihimo braid

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.710
we do have a video on how to do that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.400
you can definitely do that but I found
that it's not too hard to just

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.520
hold on to them

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.450
so all you do is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.450
take some E6000 glue

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.899
and I used flush cutters to cut the
end of the cord

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:19.060
to give it a nice

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.459
flat end

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.059
go ahead and get all of your hands

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.019
together

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.969
make sure all of the ends are even

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.949
and just

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.639
put a decent amount of glue on the end. Don't
overdo it. You don't want it to seep out a

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:42.519
lot but make sure that there is glue on the end of each cord

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.719
and then

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.799
the reason you don't want to over do it

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.139
is because then you're gonna get
fingers right up to the very end

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.089
and

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.419
push them into the end cap

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.419
and you will get a little bit a glue on
the end cap and on your finger

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.109
but you can clean off before it dries

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.399
once you get it

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:04.729
in here

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.139
really push it in

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.819
you can wipe off any access glue and you can
also make sure that

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.469
it's nice and round that there's not
a cord sitting flat in, that they're

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.149
all

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.829
evenly distributed around

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.149
the sides

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.089
then you just let that dry

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.909
and as you can see the nice

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.279
finished look on that

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:33.259
is fantastic and it's going to give a really
slick way to have that

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:34.799
faux wrap bracelet look

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.459
without it getting really bulky or big
