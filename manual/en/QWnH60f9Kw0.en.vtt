00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Now let's talk about NAM

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.071
Why do you have such a deep voice?

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.800
Whick kind of song do you like? low-pitched song or Soprano?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.627
My teacher says that my singing voice totally different from speaking voice

00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:15.731
But you're speaking with such a deep voice.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.462
I don't.. really know. I was born with this.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.100
I think it's sexy.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.870
really!?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.000
very sexual voice!!!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.900
With everything that you devoted to me

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.000
That you gave to me, they’re worthless

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.873
There’s no way they’ll make me love you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.300
Please move on from me

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:56.400
Discard your dreams, don’t persevere after this person

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.400
Please don’t look back, don’t keep me buried in your heart

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.900
And before long, you’ll meet someone great

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.900
Now Let's Talk About AIM. She has a thick but sexy voice      kinda cool for a girl

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.300
You may think I'm heartless.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.300
But I'm trying my best

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.800
No matter what I do, I can't hide it all the way through

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.000
It's beyond my control.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.522
It's like stopping kids crying?

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:47.200
It's like holding your bladder?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.700
Hiding my sexiness is the hardest thing ever

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.900
It's my bad that I'm so charming

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.800
It's my bad that I'm so tempting

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.311
I know I made you crazy

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.300
I'm sorry, don't know what to do, baby

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:07.800
Forbidden Forest is........

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.300
..................

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.329
For fu-k sake

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.000
Shame on you!  AIM

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.300
Windy Night?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.800

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.900
