Stencil application is sometimes not even
necessary. A lot of the work that we do here,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.250
is just drawn on with markers first. Stencils
are kind of an old school thing where when

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.990
you pick one off the wall, you'll be like
you know back when shops had a million images

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.360
all over their walls. And you would just take
a tracing of that and apply it to the skin

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:36.380
with some kind of moist, either green soap
or there's a chemical called Detol. There's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.730
a wide variety of ways to apply stencils.
However, stencils are becoming obsolete. We

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.050
still use them and a lot of times we will
like stencil part of an image and then draw

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.890
in the rest because the natural flow and rhythm
of the body is far more important. As in looking

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.309
at it from a distance. If I see a tattoo from
across the room, I still want it to be easily

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.520
readable, I want it to conform to the body
and move with it, the client as possible so.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.740
When I see it, I'm seeing movement, I'm seeing
rhythm, I'm seeing art happen. Stencils are

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.619
very limiting because stencils it's just like
taking a tracing of something and stamping

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:31.930
it on there. In the case of something symmetrical
like if something has to be perfectly even

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.030
on both sides, there are things like that
again we are limiting the art but we do use

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.450
stencils all the time. There's a machine called
the thermal fax machine. The stencil is run

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.210
through the machine, it comes out on a piece
of paper, cut that out, shave and lube the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.450
skin. Stick it on there, peel it off, let
it dry and what you've got is just a purple

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.119
little like rough draft of your tattoo sitting
there. Nothing wrong with stencils we use

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.540
them everyday. However we do try and lean
our clients more towards letting us draw it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.129
for them on their body so that it fits and
moves with whatever body part it is.
