[Leonardo Drew: Finding Piet Mondrian]

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.860
[Leonardo Drew Studio; Cypress Hills, Brooklyn]

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.440
And what can I say about Mondrian?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.850
He's just the man.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.090
So, like, as far as the grid and composition,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.290
I mean obviously I'm working off of him,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.510
and standing on the shoulders of giants.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.090
The grid system for me was...

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.230
I mean, not just a system, obviously.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.930
It's a way of, sort of, building a composition.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.969
Mondrian was definitely one of the innovators
of how you, sort of,

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.730
like bring all elements together.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.610
Color, and how we see things.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.990
The grid is just a formal structure for realizing
that.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.800
Looking close enough, you realize that there
has to be some under-structure.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.700
The grid allows you to, sort of, like, expand--

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.440
and continue to expand systematically.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.060
As different as my work looks, Mondrian actually
is right in there.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.220
So it's undeniable.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.860
But the fact that heâ€™s right here in my
neighborhood, it's one of those blessings.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.810
People bring paint tubes and things like that,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.460
and we can't go there empty handed.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.960
[sound of car alarm being disarmed]

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.100
--Oh no, this is the real deal here!

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.050
A friend of mine, Paul Pagk, and I, on a lark,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.690
sort of came out looking and looking and looking,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.980
and finally, you know, made a break, and...

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.940
Like, we found the area that...which is the
paupers' section,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.480
which is, surprising enough, there's all these...
grid of all these small stones.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.080
There was an article written on us finding
him--

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.159
that no one knew he was buried here, and it
seemed like no one really cared.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.670
I mean, they focus on the art, but not on
the actual man so much.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.990
And, like, here he is buried here in Brooklyn,
you know.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.840
That says something.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.160
"MoMA," [LAUGHS]

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.280
it says.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.060
"Piet Mondrian, notable."

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.390
You know when we came, there was no plaque.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.850
So it's interesting to see that, you know,
they've taken notice, for one.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.480
And, like, I would have liked to have been
a fly on the wall

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.900
when they realized who he was--who was here.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.370
We were under the impression that Mondrian
was a famous artist and died well-off;

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.270
but, in fact, he died poor.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.980
But it would have been great if they could've
actually impressed it in gold,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.200
because he deserves it.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840
Another grid.
