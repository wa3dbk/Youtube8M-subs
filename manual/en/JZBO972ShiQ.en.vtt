Hi, this is Yolanda from vanveenbulbs.com.
And in this segment, we're going to talk about

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.970
how to care for a lilac tree. Now, lilacs,
or syringa, are one of the favorite plants

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.180
in my garden. They have big, beautiful flowers
that bloom every spring, and they're just

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.470
smell so good. They look almost like little
grapes hanging down, and they come in beautiful

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.029
purples and whites. And they're just a beautiful,
beautiful plant, and they're really easy to

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.100
care for. So they're almost like a fruit tree
or any other type of tree. When you're taking

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.960
care of a lilac tree, make sure and plant
it in full, hot sun. It likes full sun. If

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.460
it gets any shade at all, it's going to reach
for the sun and not do so well. And make sure

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.420
that it has good drainage. They don't want
to sit in a real boggy area. They like to

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.810
be on a hill or somewhere that's a little
bit raised up, or somewhere that has good

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.540
drainage because they don't want to sit in
water year-round, although they do drink a

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.810
lot of water. And that's another thing. Make
sure that you do water them sometimes in the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.460
summer because I've had a lot of them survive
without any water at all, but when you water

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.530
them in the summer, especially if you've planted
a new plant, it'll survive much better and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.740
it'll be much more lush and green. So make
sure that you never let it dry out too much.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.630
And it will get lanky over the years, too,
so every fall, I like to prune it back. I've

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.260
already pruned this one back, and the trick,
when you prune lilacs: never prune them more

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.909
than one-third of the plant down. So even
if it's over a couple years, if it's really

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.420
lanky, make sure and only cut one-third down
at a time, then the next year, another third.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.050
And that way, it'll grow very even and you
can even take older plants and make new plants

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.480
out of them. So they're very easy, and they
will grow little suckers. So these are little

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.240
starts that come off of the bottom, and these
will make new plants. So an easy way to divide

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.940
them is to just cut down as far as you can,
and get as much root off of that sucker as

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.409
you can and dig it up. And you can start another
plant very easily that way. So lilacs don't

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.551
ask a lot from you. They just want you to
give them a nice, sunny spot with good drainage,

00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:13.569
and maybe a little bit of water in the summertime.
And I never add any fertilizers or anything

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.400
to them, except maybe a little bit of compost
on top every couple years to give them some

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.980
fresh nutrition.
