00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.879
00:00
MAN: SET.

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.859
00:03
CHARLES: Anybody that tells me they're too

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.610
old to exercise I would say make an appointment
at the crematorium.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:22.460
00:19
COMM: Most pensioners spend their time living

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.220
al life of leisure.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.170
00:26
COMM: But then Charles Eugster isn't like

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.780
most pensioners. The spritely 96-year-old
is spending his twilight years breaking records

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.829
on the running track.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.020
00:35
COMM: In July 2015, Charles ran a time of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.290
23.78 seconds, in the 100 metres of the British
Masters at Alexander Stadium, Birmingham.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.989
Making him the fastest sprinter over 95 in
the UK.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.230
00:54
CHARLES: I didn't do too badly, I was quite

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.059
surprised actually at the finish because I
wasn't so knackered as I usually am. Why that

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.390
was I haven't got the slightest idea.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.390
01:07
CHARLES: Old age is something to look forward

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:19.990
to. And it can be the most enjoyable, wondrous,
stupendous, amazing, exciting period of anybody's

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.990
life.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.270
01:21
COMM: Charles, a retired dentist, says the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.939
secret to his success is his diet and exercise
regime.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.440
01:28
CHARLES: It's important to stay fit in old

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:39.009
age. In fact to build muscle because from
the age of about fifty we all lose muscle

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.729
mass at a rate of about one to two percent
per year.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.870
01:45
COMM: And he takes his inspiration from the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.870
highest authority.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.329
01:47
CHARLES: The Queen does not retire, she is

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:59.369
nearly ninety and she has a punishing schedule.
And I am, as a result a royalist, I think

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:08.729
that she sets a wonderful example and I think
all her subjects should do the same. Retirement

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.629
kills physically and mentally.

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.430
02:13
COMM: Charles trains in both sprinting and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.159
body conditioning twice a week. And he's been
backed buy his coach Sylvia Gattika for the

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.170
past five years.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.349
02:21
SYLVIA: It's always really funny and a challenge

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:31.329
to train with Charles, yes he trains hard.
I think Charles is a big inspiration to people

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.719
in his age. He is the Superman.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.859
02:36
COMM: Although normally adhering to a strict

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.040
diet, Charles does allow himself the occasional
lapse.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.519
02:42
CHARLES: I do not agree with the present theories

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:55.549
of low fat and little meat and a lot of carbohydrates.
On the contrary I am one of those people that

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.090
believe in a little bit of what you fancy,
it does you good.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.529
03:01
COMM: Now Charles travels around the world

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.170
to preach the benefits of staying active through
old age.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.730
03:06
WOMAN: When I first talked to him I thought

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.200
he was seventy six, and then he told me he
was going to be ninety six tomorrow, I couldn't

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200
believe it.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.120
03:14
WOMAN: Honestly if I could be like him when

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.623
I'm his age I will be well pleased.

00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:21.519
03:19
CHARLES: My ambitions for the future would

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:31.010
be to show that one can start a sport at any
age. Anybody that tells me that they're too

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.060
told to exercise, I would say to them that
the first thing they have to do is make an

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.649
appointment at the crematorium because they
won't live long.
