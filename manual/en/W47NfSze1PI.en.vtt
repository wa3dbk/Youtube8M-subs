-Hey!
-Oh, God!

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.480
[drum beat]

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.320
[drum beat]

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.700
-(chuckling) It's so weird. I don't usually go to kids' movies,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.760
but you know, Amy Poehler's in this and I love her!
-Whatever.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.560
-Yep, I'm just here with my cousin. He's in the bathroom.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560
-We're not friends.
-Kids, right?

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.840
[drum beat]

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.080
(discount Randy Newman music)

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.280
That was amazing! They should do the whole movie about this!

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.460
I don't even want to watch the real movie anymore.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.120
I-- I mean, not that I wanted in the first place.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.240
Boring kid stuff!

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.410
Boring,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.560
Boring, amazing,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.040
Boring, amazing, Oscar-winning

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220
Boring, amazing, Oscar-winning kid stuff.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.320
Hey, the Pixar lamp!

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.400
[drum beat]

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.360
-(crying) Oh my God, that was the saddest movie ever.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.340
-Ugh, it's only been the first 10 minutes.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.680
-Hello? Dad? I miss you so much!

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.980
-Keep it down, will ya?!
-I'm having a moment here!

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.300
[drum beat]

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.100
(end credits fanfare)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.960
Wow! I never thought about inanimate objects like that before.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.780
I mean, who knew feelings had feelings, too?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.560
I'm sorry I sat on you, chair. I'm sorry I ate you, popcorn. I'm sorry I stared at you, movie screen.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.480
(going crazy) Everything is alive!

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.780
[drum beat]

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.120
(peaceful music; birds chirping)

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.000
I love how our original Pixar can be--
the story, the emotional depth.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.960
It's so good to see such genuine art that just... makes you think.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.040
I can't wait to see what they'll think up next!

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.480
Oh, they're making another "Cars".

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.680
[drum beat]

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.780
(discount Randy Newman music)
