00:01:29.990 --> 00:02:03.299
a few minutes.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.470

scars. It penetrates into the skin and helps

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:38.560

10 to 15 minutes. Wipe the lotion off with
a soft cotton cloth.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.660
A natural source of Vitamin E is the sun but
in case you are someone who stays indoors

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:10.660
very often, you need to take other forms of
supplements.

and blossom lotion on the face and massage

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.160
intensively for 5 to 10 minutes. This shall
ensure that the Vitamin E is absorbed into

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:40.870

the oil.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:05:12.440

the eye and leave it on.

using Vitamin E powder, Blossom lotion and

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.300
some water. Apply this on the skin covering
the whole face and leave it on for drying.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.550
But make sure that it is applied on the face
as soon as it is prepared as this pack has

00:05:47.550 --> 00:06:57.600
the tendency to dry up within seconds.
8. Wipe it off with a damp cotton cloth and

00:06:57.600 --> 00:08:00.650
spray a bit of rose water to the skin.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.210
