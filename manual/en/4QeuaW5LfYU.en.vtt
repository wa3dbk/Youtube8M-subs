Hi.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:13.610
My name is Trudi Tapscott, and fashion modeling
has some very specific physical requirements.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.939
And I say that, that you do have to be a certain
height, and you do have to be, I would not

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.019
necessarily say weight, but I would say a
certain measurement shape.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:34.320
You need to fit clothes that are designed
by a designer, and modeling is a job, so there

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.590
are specifics.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.980
Just like sports, just like anything else,
there is a physical form that you need in

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.480
order to sell designer clothes.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.140
The requirements are preferably 5'9" and taller.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.650
Measurements, 34 or 35 hip, sample size, which
is changing.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.630
Sometimes it's a little smaller than it should
be, depending upon the brand and the designer.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.350
So, you need to have measurements that are
pretty much 34-24-34.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.430
That varies.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.600
A girl who is 5'9" is going to have a different
sizing, different shape, different proportions

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.729
than a girl who is 5'11".

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.090
But, the range is between 5'9" up to 6 feet.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.429
There are girls who are taller than 6 feet.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.350
It does make it more difficult.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.590
Sleeves are shorter, pants are shorter, but
that's pretty much it.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.219
There are exceptions to every single rule,
and those kinds of requirements are for New

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.810
York, Paris, Milan, London, big markets were
modeling is a career.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.990
Sometimes in smaller markets, there is a generosity
and a little bit of leeway in terms of what

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.500
clients are looking for, because it's a different
kind of modeling.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.259
And when I say there are exceptions to every
rule, there are models who have modeled and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:08.229
have had great careers who are 5'7", 5'8",
but your best chances are 5'9" and taller.
