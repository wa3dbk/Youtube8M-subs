00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.080
Spyro the Dragon was a huge hit on the Playstation
when it first came out in the late 90’s.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.670
I didn’t have a Playstation back then, but
I’d go over to my friend’s house all the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.420
time to play Spyro.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.370
The game’s universe was charming, yet humorous,
and the controls were excellent.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.690
Now, after a number of games that weren’t
received quite as well, developer Krome of

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.800
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger fame was tasked with
giving the dragon a fresh start, and that’s

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
exactly what they did.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:13.260
This is The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning
for 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.260
the GameCube.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.330
A New Beginning is basically an origin story
for Spyro.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.610
The purple dragon is living with his dragonfly
family and his friend Sparx when he gets into

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.830
a battle and breathes fire, thus learning
that he isn’t actually a dragonfly.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.970
After discovering another dragon who saved
Spyro when he was still in an egg, Spyro sets

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:47.420
off on an adventure with Sparx.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:59.780
While 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.780
the story actually seems to rip off the story
of Moses a little bit, the game also has a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.020
nice sense of humor.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.611
Elijah Wood plays the straight guy, while
David Spade has goofier lines and more of

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:11.890
a slapstick style.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.670
Gary Oldman is also in it, and that makes
everything better.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.470
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning still
plays like the older games in the series.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.750
Spyro has access to a wide variety of attacks
and abilities, he glides instead of flying

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.170
from place to place, and combat is a mix of
melee and special moves.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.450
It’s actually a good thing that it hasn’t
been changed that much, because the original

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.780
controls in the earlier games didn’t really
have any issues.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.610
Combat can feel a little bit repetitive, and
it can come down to button mashing at times,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.810
but when there’s more than one enemy at
a time, things start to get interesting.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.090
When enemies get killed, they explode and
drop a variety of crystals that can be used

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.840
to fill Spyro’s health and special ability
meters, so he can keep breathing fire and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.870
using other moves.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:03.540
In addition, there’s also some puzzles that
add a Zelda-like element to the game.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.630
My biggest issue with A New Beginning is the
camera, which is one of the worst I’ve experienced

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.790
on the GameCube.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.760
The camera seems hell-bent on not being anywhere
but right behind Spyro, and this is an issue,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.040
as enemies can come from all directions.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.350
Getting hit by an enemy you didn’t even
know was next to you is a common occurrence,

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.389
and using the right stick to adjust the camera
doesn’t really help.

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.160
You can strafe to circle around enemies, but
this only really works if the enemies are

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.390
all really close together, and that’s pretty
rare.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.330
As this is a late GameCube game, I expected
the graphics to be pretty good, and I was

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.550
not disappointed.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.139
Environments and characters all look really
nice, and although there are some recycled

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.040
areas, they’re usually presented far enough
apart that you won’t really notice.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:55.480
The fire effects are also impressive; lighting
those guys ablaze is a lot of fun.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.389
The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning was actually
a lot better than I expected it to be.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.500
It’s funny, the gameplay all works well,
except for the camera, and the story gives

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.350
a nice twist on the series.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.790
There’s a wide variety of Spyro games to
choose from, including the recent Skylanders

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:28.600
game, but this is worth at least 
a rent.
