00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.579
This next technique is for groin strain
or an adductor strain which is

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.649
actually a muscle pull

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.009
of the muscles on the inside of the thigh

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.590
and for this technique, we're going to place
that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.099
muscle group on a bit of a
stretch, so we're going to let the leg fall out to the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.220
side to the point where it's at least

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.349
stretching but not too uncomfortable.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.310
I'm giong to have you tear off one piece of tape

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.310
and we're going to create an anchor point
on this end

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.210
and we're going to place that anchor point

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.210
as high up on that inside tendon as you
can

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.629
very good

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.629
and so with the leg still on a stretch
we'll just peel that paper off.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.540
and from here we can actually

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.540
split the tape if you would like

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.140
and we can go around the  point of pain

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.140
with no tension on the tape just
laying that tape down.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.390
okay, same with the other piece.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.439
that piece alone may suffice, if not

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.910
we can try a second piece

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.910
and same thing, we're goin to create an anchor
point

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.290
and this time we're going to place the anchor point on skin

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.690
just on the back of your thigh, again as
close to

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.710
that tendon or point of pain as you can

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.680
and peeling the paper off in this direction

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.460
going over the point of pain

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.960
now we can split one

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.260
piece at a time, so well
go ahead and split this piece

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.770
we're going to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.729
pull the skin towards the anchor as you
put medium tension on that piece and

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.979
go ahead and lay that piece down

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.389
same thing on the other piece

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.239
and leaving no tension

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.139
on the tails, the last one to two inches of
the tape

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.579
and you can use this technique in
conjunction with continued icing as well

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.090
as slow

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.969
progressive stretching for groin strain.
