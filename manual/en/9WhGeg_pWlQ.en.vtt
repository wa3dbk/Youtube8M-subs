How to Back Up Digital Photos.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.330
There was one advantage to storing photos
in a shoebox: you didn't have to worry about

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.080
a computer crash wiping them out!

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.330
You will need A collection of digital photos
and blank cds or dvds.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.330
Step 1.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.960
If you have Windows XP, open the folder where
photos are stored.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.130
If the Picture Task area is not showing on
the left side, click Tools, then Folder Options.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.300
Set up a monthly reminder for yourself so
you get in the habit of backing up new photos.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.550
Step 2.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.440
On the General tab, choose "Show common tasks
in folders," then click "Apply" followed by

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.160
"OK."

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.640
Step 3.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.079
Highlight the pictures you would like to back
up, then click on "Copy all items to CD,"

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.790
which is in the Picture Tasks area on the
left.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.970
Step 4.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.690
When the balloon stating "You have files waiting
to be written to the CD" appears, click on

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.020
it to open the window and view your files.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.850
Step 5.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.869
Choose "Write these files to CD."

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:06.869
Step 6.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.180
When prompted, insert a CD, then click "Next."

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.970
Enter a name, then click "Next" again.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.930
Eject the disc when a message appears indicating
that burning is complete.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.100
Step 7.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.270
For Mac iPhoto, double click on your hard
drive.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.710
When the window opens, click on "Pictures"
in the left hand column, then choose the "iPhoto

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.150
Library" folder.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.110
Did you know Only 13% of digital photos actually
get printed.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.140
Step 8.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.330
Drag the iPhoto Library folder onto the blank
disc icon on your desktop.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.780
As an alternative, highlight the iPhoto Library
folder, then click on the black and yellow

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.580
circular symbol on the right hand corner of
the window.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.580
Step 9.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.580
Insert either a blank CD or DVD.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.580
When asked to initialize it, give the inserted
disc a name.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.580
Step 10.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.330
When a message appears that burning is complete,
eject the disc.
