Thanks for tuning in to the latest video on 5mods.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.660
Brought to you by 5mods.com.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.400
My name’s Harry and today we gonna discuss the differences of OpenIV and Alexander Blade’s Script Hook V

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.420
Okay, first let’s talk about Script Hook V.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.940
Script Hook V comes with these files:

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.340
o ScriptHookV.dll
o dinput8.dll
o NativeTrainer.asi

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.220
The .dll files enable the game to load .asi files which can contain any type of script.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.780
the dll files have to be copied to the folder of the game

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.440
Script Hook V also comes with a simple trainer called “Native Trainer”.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.020
Yes, that’s the .asi files.
But what are .asi files?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360
.asi files are simply libraries that contain gta v scripts.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.720
You can write your own .asi files with the source of ScriptHook V.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.540
The source is written in C++, but there are mods available on our site that make writing in other .NET lanuages and LUA possible.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.192
All you need is Visual Studio that can be downloaded from below

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:37.492
Once you installed it, download the source of ScriptHook V and extract it to your Visual Studio folder into Documents\Visual Studio \Projects

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.080
This is NativeTrainer: An example of what can be done with ScriptHook V
