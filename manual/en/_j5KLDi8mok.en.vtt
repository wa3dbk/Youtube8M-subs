Today were talking about how to measure your
bra size. We have already discussed how your

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.040
band should fit and we have already discussed
how your strap should fit. Lets talk about

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.580
the cup. Theres two kinds of cups theres a
molded cup and a non molded cup. A molded

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.590
cup is like this one it has a shape on its
own without relying on you to fill it. A non

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.350
molded cup is more like this one its just
the thin material against your skin. Theres

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.430
nothing extra in the bra a molded does not
necessarily mean padded its mostly there for

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.819
nipple concealing and making a rounder shape.
When your looking for your bra to fit you

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:42.429
want to make sure that its clearing all of
your breast tissue and the wire so your not

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.609
popping out anywhere. If your bigger you want
to make sure that the wire is tacking you

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.239
in the middle and your breast tissue is not
lifting the wire away from you like this.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.679
If you want the cleavage look go for a bra
that sits lower and still tacks you down here

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.829
but brings you together in the front. You
want to make sure that your bra does not fit

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.530
you like this mannequin she has some gapping
going on down here. So its not fitting. How

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.190
you want it to go is you want the wire to
come all the way to the bottom of the breast

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.570
tissue and the you tighten the strap accordingly
to hold it in to place. For a bra like this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.750
it has seams in it and its going to give a
different shape. So each seam is part of panel

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.580
that pushes the breast tissue in a certain
direction. For bustier women I recommend the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.070
seams because it will make you look narrower
on the sides and not so spread out and wide.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.790
This type of bra is a non molded bra and it
has seams I recommend this style for bigger

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.540
women it does not add any extra shape and
it pushes you in on the sides with the panels

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.390
that the seams are creating making you narrower.
It might be slightly more pointed but is a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.620
much more flattering look for women with a
bigger cop size. The purpose of wearing a

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.280
bra is to lift you up and make sure that your
breast tissue stays intact and it also lifts

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.679
you off your waist and makes everything else
look smaller and narrower and more contained.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.950
Its a much more flattering look when your
bra fits. Then when it doesn't.
