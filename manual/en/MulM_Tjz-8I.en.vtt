00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.759
I'm Julia Szabo, also known as a Pet Reporter,
and I am the ""Living with Dogs"" columnist

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.420
for dogster.com.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.070
I've actually written 6 books and I'm hard
at work on my next one.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.740
It will be about about dogs -- that's as much
as I can say right now.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.890
I love dogs and I think nobody's life is complete
without one.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.449
So I'm here to tell you about a variety of
different dogs breeds that might suit your

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.449
lifestyle.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.790
I hope you'll adopt one soon.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.079
The Bernese Mountain Dog; is really a symbol
of Switzerland.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.980
There, was a movie recently called, ""North
Face"".

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.170
Um, and it was about a famous couple of climbers
out in the Alps.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:52.100
And, um when the camera sort of panned in
the cross, we knew it was Switzerland because

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.010
we saw a farmer with his Bernese Mountain
dog.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.440
It's a really iconic dog, beautiful dog, ah,
gorgeous coat, like tri-color, black, brown,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.440
and white, marking.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.960
Switzerland, obviously the Alpine region,
it's cold; and the dog thrives in a cold environment.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.500
But, you see these dogs, in Texas; you see
them in the hot summer in New York, and, you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.070
know, this isn't really their environment,
but people want to have them.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.320
So, they will actually, super refrigerator
air-conditioning the air, so, for the dogs

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.380
comfort.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.670
Because it is such a special dog, and it's
a sweet dog, but these dogs can, can, if not

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.540
properly trained and managed, can also be
destructive and do things.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.900
You know, they need a job to do, because that's,
what they were breed to do, is work with farmers.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.700
So, the most popular job, you can give to
any dog, is, doing therapy work.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.480
It's an incredible rewarding thing for the
dog but also for the person, the therapy partner

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.509
human, that goes with the dog.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.360
You, basically, go through a training period,
where you learn how to behave when you visit,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.439
hospitals or nursing homes and more and more
people are finding out just how rewarding

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.439
this work is.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.439
And, NOW!

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.240
We have a new book, that's just about to come
out in April of the author Martin Kind has

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.379
written about his own Bernese Mountain Dog,
as a different kind of species of life savor,

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.519
because he talks about how, she helped him
overcome his addiction to alcohol.

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.489
It's a very funny book.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.459
It's a darkly funny book.

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.409
It's kind like ""The Lost Weekend"" meets
the shaggy dog.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.549
And, I really think that it's going to raise
the Bernese's profile.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.590
Even more.
