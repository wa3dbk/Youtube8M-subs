[Jordan] Hi this is Jordan from OneCall and
I’m here to talk to you about the LG Infinia

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.830
series LX9500. This is a 55-inch class TV
with full LED LCD local dimming capabilities

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.240
that means it’s going to give you darker
darks and brighter whites for better overall

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.460
contrast. Now the 9500 is a 3D capable TV,
so with some content and a pair of LG active

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.300
sync glasses you can enjoy 3D at your own
home. This TV features an ultra slim bezel

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.280
which allows you to see more picture and less
overall boarder. Another feature is its slim

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.399
design, it’s just over one inch thick without
the pedestal base. The LG 55LX9500 is wireless

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.579
1080p ready with the optional LG wireless
media hub, it also features NetCast Entertainment

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.679
Access which allows you to stream wirelessly
from things like Yahoo!, Netflix, Vudu, YouTube,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.600
Picasa and many others. To take full advantage
of these services you will also need a broadband

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.360
internet connection. This TV also features
4 HDMI 1.4a inputs for easy connection to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.550
all of your HD components. The LG 9500 is
THX certified ensuring an uncompromised HD

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.880
sound experience. It also has TruMotion 480Hz
which virtually eliminates motion blur, in

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.329
fast action scenes and sports. Another feature
I really like about this television is the

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.869
Picture Wizard 2; it allows for easy picture
calibration and optimum picture in your home,

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.259
it also features Clear Voice 2 for enhanced
dialogue audio. This is Jordan from OneCall,
