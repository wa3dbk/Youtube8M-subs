00:00:00.526 --> 00:00:05.895
In the room of the Rubik's Cube National Champion, even the armchair is a cube

00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:09.605
The agility of just moving the cube already impresses

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.476
The number of trophies impresses even more...

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:18.777
He is the winner of the Sesc Santos Championship 2010, 2011 and 2012

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:25.803
That was the name of the National Championship until last year, when it receibe the name of Brazilian Nationals

00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:29.721
And was divided in two phases: Summer and Winter

00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:34.939
The Summer one Gabriel already won, with the average of 9.31 seconds

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:39.875
And on the Winter the championship goes again, but to take the title from Gabriel

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:43.055
one has to, at least, beat his average of the Summer phase

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:51.322
Yeah... but it wasn't always like that. Like everybody, Gabriel had difficulties in solving the Rubik's Cube

00:00:51.892 --> 00:00:57.448
[Gabriel] When I first got a Rubik's Cube I was a little kid, and like everyone I didn't manage to solve it...

00:00:57.448 --> 00:01:00.528
I gave up, and them, when I was 15 I tried again...

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:06.934
It was also hard but... it's only a matter of effort. You have to have the will to solve it

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:12.940
and with effort you'll definally be able to solve it for the first time, no doubt...

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.932
[Interviewer] That of course is in the past...

00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:22.957
With two hand he is the South America recordist with the time of 7.16 seconds

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:28.958
And with only one hand, he solves the cube in 9.50 seconds, a South America record

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:34.077
that gave Gabriel the 3rd place on the Word Ranking

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.866
And blindfolded, he has the National Record, with the time of 36.19 seconds!

00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:46.745
[Interviewer] Of course that we're putting Gabriel in test here on the show...

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:51.669
But to start let's go simple, let's see how long he takes to just solve one Rubik's Cube

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:56.739
It's already scrambled, I'll scramble a bit more...

00:01:58.148 --> 00:02:00.281
It's too hard...

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.915
Ok, it's scrambled... I'll time the solve...

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:14.555
3... 2... 1... go!

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:24.727
Look at that!

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:31.622
I even delayed on stopping the timer, it show 10 seconds but was even less!

00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:37.886
Now, actually Gabriel don't see the cube only as an sport...

00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:45.022
He also gives motivational lectures and courses on schools and universities! Tell us more about that Gabriel...

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:49.431
[Gabriel] Yeah, it started in schools, than I brought it to some local Universities...

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:52.147
And now I'm being able to take it to companys and events

00:02:52.147 --> 00:02:55.626
They are motivational lectures but more, they show some of the logic of the Rubik's Cube

00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:59.475
and show how you can apply that in business, study strategies, and so on...

00:02:59.475 --> 00:03:05.222
I give also courses about memorization techniques. That teach people how to achieve their mind potential

00:03:05.222 --> 00:03:09.646
It's something that is working really well, it's something that I really love, besides competing...

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.908
And, well... let's see where will this go...

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:16.603
[Interviewer] Awesome! I have a invitation for you than... not for a lecture, but for a challenge

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:25.407
I want to take you to a school, bring the students together and see what we can do. How that's sound?

00:03:26.775 --> 00:03:29.053
[Gabriel] Great... perfect! Let's go.

00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:44.169
[Interviewer] Gabriel's performances cheered the high school students

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:49.154
How is it going? What is your strategy?

00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:52.684
[Student] None, I have no idea right now...

00:03:52.684 --> 00:03:55.895
[Interviewer] Did you manage one side? How did you do it?

00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:03.006
[Student] I just keep moving and try to put the pieces together...

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.221
[Interviewer] Did you also managed? This girl did one side, what was the technique?

00:04:08.552 --> 00:04:13.679
[Student] It was finding the white stickers and trying to put them together...

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.512
[Interviewer] Did anyone solved it?

00:04:17.635 --> 00:04:19.149
Didn't solved it?

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.993
[Student] No...

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.022
[Interviewer] But did you know that there is a logic behind it?

00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:24.439
[Student] Yeah, but I don't know what is....

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.613
[Student] Aaaah that's too easy... the students want more!

00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:52.813
Blindfolded! Blindfolded! Blindfolded!

00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:57.390
Gabriel asks for silence to memorize the pieces of the Cube...

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.937
And wathed by everybody, the challenges beggins!

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:06.369
Do you think he can solve the Rubik's Cube blindfolded?

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:08.151
[Student] Don't know, I'll have to wait and see...

00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:09.667
[Interviewer] What do you think?

00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:11.720
[Student] I think he won't do it...

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.029
[Interviewer] In how much time do you think he can solve it?

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.497
[Student] 9 seconds... (WTF??)

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.543
[Interviewer] Uau... do you think he can do it?

00:05:19.543 --> 00:05:22.088
[Student] Yes... in aroung 10... 15 seconds...

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:24.058
[Interviewer] So fast?

00:05:24.058 --> 00:05:26.097
[Student] He is solving the cube in that speed, I think he can...

00:05:26.097 --> 00:05:27.709
[Interviewer] But blindfolded?

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.168
[Student] I think he can...

00:05:58.802 --> 00:06:06.336
[Interviewer] It wasn't 9 seconds, but in less than a minute all the faces of the cube were solved!

00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:15.149
Oh my god, and under so much pressure! How are you feeling?

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:20.345
[Gabriel] I have to say... everytime I worry if the cube will really be solved at the end!

00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:32.235
[Interviewer] Gabriel, that isn't chance, it has a logic, right? Tell us more about it...

00:06:33.138 --> 00:06:42.934
[Gabriel] Every Rubik's Cube has three kinds of pieces. If you look, evey face has a center piece

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:49.520
And this pieces never move, no matter how much you move the cube, take a look

00:06:50.718 --> 00:06:58.488
So the center pieces tell us the face colour... it it's blue, than it's the blue face, if it's red, than it's the red face... and so on

00:06:58.488 --> 00:07:04.668
By knowing that, you'll always trying to bring the pieces to their matting centers

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:14.293
For example, this piece, it is blue and orange. So I'll try to take it next to the blue and orange centers... like this

00:07:15.774 --> 00:07:20.578
Of course we'd need some more time to see how it's done. But that's the idea

00:07:20.578 --> 00:07:24.691
It's not chance, it's not magic, it's just focus and effort to get it done!

00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:26.376
[Interviewer] Let's see one last solve before we finish

00:07:26.376 --> 00:07:27.375
[Gabriel] Let's go one-handed?

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:28.312
[Interviewer] Sure...

00:07:28.312 --> 00:07:31.403
[Gabriel] The students ask me to do it without any hands, but I think I can't...

00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:34.150
I'm only able with one... let's go!

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:49.995
[Interviewer] Awesome! With that solve we finish our program

00:07:57.748 --> 00:07:57.860
And let's get the motivation people, let's try harder... I'll try, I'll see if I can do it... Who knows!
