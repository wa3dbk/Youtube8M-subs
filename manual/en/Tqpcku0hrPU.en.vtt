00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.450
I have been asked for some
intuition as to why, let's say,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.030
a to the minus b is equal
to 1 over a to the b.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.120
And before I give you the
intuition, I want you to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.420
just realize that this
really is a definition.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.920
I don't know.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.950
The inventor of mathematics
wasn't one person.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.120
It was, you know, a
convention that arose.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.580
But they defined this, and they
defined this for the reasons

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.680
that I'm going to show you.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.760
Well, what I'm going to show
you is one of the reasons, and

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.670
then we'll see that this is a
good definition, because once

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.290
you learned exponent rules, all
of the other exponent rules

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.440
stay consistent for negative
exponents and when you raise

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.590
something to the zero power.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.740
So let's take the
positive exponents.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.180
Those are pretty
intuitive, I think.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.200
So the positive exponents, so
you have a to the 1, a squared,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.140
a cubed, a to the fourth.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.940
What's a to the 1? a to the 1,
we said, is a, and then to get

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.060
to a squared, what did we do?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.200
We multiplied by a, right?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.650
a squared is just a times a.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.040
And then to get to a
cubed, what did we do?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.160
We multiplied by a again.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.420
And then to get to a to the
fourth, what did we do?

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.920
We multiplied by a again.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.020
Or the other way, you could
imagine, is when you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.480
decrease the exponent,
what are we doing?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.560
We are multiplying by
1/a, or dividing by a.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.140
And similarly, you decrease
again, you're dividing by a.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.480
And to go from a squared
to a to the first,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.510
you're dividing by a.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.700
So let's use this progression
to figure out what

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.720
a to the 0 is.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.900
So this is the first hard one.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.010
So a to the 0.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.990
So you're the inventor, the
founding mother of mathematics,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.170
and you need to define
what a to the 0 is.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.420
And, you know, maybe
it's 17, maybe it's pi.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.100
I don't know.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.860
It's up to you to decide
what a to the 0 is.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.140
But wouldn't it be nice if a to
the 0 retained this pattern?

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.520
That every time you decrease
the exponent, you're

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.270
dividing by a, right?

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.700
So if you're going from a to
the first to a to the zero,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.160
wouldn't it be nice if
we just divided by a?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.220
So let's do that.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.520
So if we go from a to the
first, which is just a, and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.770
divide by a, right, so we're
just going to go-- we're just

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.140
going to divide it by a,
what is a divided by a?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.730
Well, it's just 1.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.060
So that's where the
definition-- or that's one of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.220
the intuitions behind why
something to the 0-th

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.420
power is equal to 1.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.210
Because when you take that
number and you divide it by

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.190
itself one more time,
you just get 1.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.100
So that's pretty reasonable,
but now let's go into

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.890
the negative domain.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.660
So what should a to
the negative 1 equal?

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.400
Well, once again, it's nice if
we can retain this pattern,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.190
where every time we decrease
the exponent we're

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.690
dividing by a.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.500
So let's divide by
a again, so 1/a.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.140
So we're going to take a to
the 0 and divide it by a.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.610
a to the 0 is one, so
what's 1 divided by a?

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.090
It's 1/a.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.540
Now, let's do it one more
time, and then I think you're

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.330
going to get the pattern.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.880
Well, I think you probably
already got the pattern.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.350
What's a to the minus 2?

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.070
Well, we want-- you know,
it'd be silly now to

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.990
change this pattern.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.130
Every time we decrease the
exponent, we're dividing by a,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.055
so to go from a to the minus 1
to a to the minus 2, let's

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:30.470
just divide by a again.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.550
And what do we get?

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.040
If you take 1/2 and divide by
a, you get 1 over a squared.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.700
And you could just keep doing
this pattern all the way to

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.330
the left, and you would get a
to the minus b is equal

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.790
to 1 over a to the b.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.790
Hopefully, that gave you a
little intuition as to why--

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.090
well, first of all, you know,
the big mystery is, you know,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.590
something to the 0-th power,
why does that equal 1?

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.970
First, keep in mind that
that's just a definition.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.000
Someone decided it should
be equal to 1, but they

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.080
had a good reason.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.340
And their good reason
was they wanted to keep

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.620
this pattern going.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.730
And that's the same reason
why they defined negative

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.440
exponents in this way.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.300
And what's extra cool about it
is not only does it retain this

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.150
pattern of when you decrease
exponents, you're dividing by

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.430
a, or when you're increasing
exponents, you're multiplying

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.580
by a, but as you'll see in the
exponent rules videos, all

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.460
of the exponent rules hold.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.820
All of the exponent rules are
consistent with this definition

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.610
of something to the 0-th power
and this definition of

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.470
something to the
negative power.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.090
Hopefully, that didn't confuse
you and gave you a little bit

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.010
of intuition and demystified
something that, frankly,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.130
is quite mystifying the
first time you learn it.
