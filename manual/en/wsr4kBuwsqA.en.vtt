&gt;&gt; DR.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.010
WEBB: Hi, I'm Dr. Webb, a veterinarian at
Banfield Pet Hospital.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.189
As your partner in pet care, it's our goal
to help keep your pet healthy and happy.

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.540
Here are some helpful tips for adjusting to
life with a puppy.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.590
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's important to make sure that
your pet's environment is safe

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.860
and taking a look at things from a puppy's
perspective can help.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.840
Electrical wires, cords for the window, blinds,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.150
stairs, chemicals like antifreeze,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.800
and standing water such as swimming pools
or the toilet bowl can mean trouble.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.480
Puppies put anything and everything into their
mouths, just as young children do.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.980
It's a good idea to keep small items and objects
with removable pieces

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.989
plus liquids, medications, plants, and even
string rubber bands, socks, and undergarments

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.040
our of their reach.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.720
These can all create a choking hazard or even
serious intestinal blockages.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:16.790
Providing lots of pet toys is a safe way to
help satisfy their need to play and chew.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.200
Speaking of chewing, dental care is essential
throughout your dog's life,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.280
and it's never too early to establish good
dental habits

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.930
like tooth brushing at home.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.930
Dental chew treats are also a fun way to help
prevent dental disease.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.930
When your puppy gets older, regular dental
exams and professional cleanings as prescribed

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.100
will be an important step in preventive care.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.170
While your puppy is learning not to soil in
the house,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.880
crate training them at the same time is a
great idea.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.200
Dogs instinctively want a safe den and usually
learn not to soil in it.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.420
Your puppy will eventually accept the crate
as a safe secure area.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.770
Many crate trained dogs will be less anxious
when kenneled.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.979
Training your puppy to behave well will take
a lot of patience

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.650
and consistent repetitive commands

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.920
but the end result will be worth it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.060
you'll have a well-adjusted and polite four-legged
family member.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.620
Puppy obedience classes are a great starting
point.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.760
If you need some support along the way we're
here to help.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.180
Thanks for listening.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.400

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.340
