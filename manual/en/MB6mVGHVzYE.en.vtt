00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.130
For studying rough weather, the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma is at the center of the action. 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.980
Inside, researchers are working on what’s called the Hazardous Weather Testbed. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.130
Participants work with the latest computer models and cutting edge forecasting techniques.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.700
It’s about bringing practitioners, or operational forecasters together with researchers and computer modelers

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.970
a very broad community in bringing them all together to focus on

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.160
the next generation of weather prediction."

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.140
Typical work days start after noon.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.980
It’s taken all morning for the Sun to heat the atmosphere. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.980
Warm air rises, and rising air mixes it up. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.280
That churning air is what provokes severe weather…and that’s what these experts are studying.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.080
They’re also getting ready for the future. 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.680
A brand new NOAA weather satellite is on the horizon.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.380
Once launched it will take its place in space and offer a wealth of major new capabilities.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.080
“GOES-R is going to be unbelievably helpful. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.030
Whether it be lightning data or clouds, we’re going to have so many more different channels 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.930
in terms of visible or infrared that will help us in terms of forecasting and figuring out where that severe weather is going to happen.”

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.280
GOES-R may be the latest in a long line satellites, but its new capabilities will be more than just a tune-up.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.080
“So it’s going to be like putting on glasses compared to what we have today.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.780
So this is going to be a great improvement compared to what we have now.”

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.280
Rough weather used to be a great unknown, something always over the horizon and capable of arrival without warning.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.680
But times are changing,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.480
and with hands-on training like that of the Hazardous Weather Testbed,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.180
and new technology like GOES-R, 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.380
forecasters will continue to develop into one of the only disciplines that can actually foretell the future. 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.250
Southwest Oklahoma City, there’s gonna be big hail and lightning is going to be my biggest concern…”

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:13.747
After all, knowing tomorrow’s weather tomorrow profoundly affects decisions today.
