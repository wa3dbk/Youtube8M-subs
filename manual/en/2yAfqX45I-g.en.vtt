00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.270
Bumble and Bumble editorial
stylist Sabrina Michals

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.180
is going to show us how to
create a tousled look on Julia

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.660
using Thickening Full Form
Mousse and Creme Contour.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.610
Julia has fine,
color-treated hair.

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:22.230
For this look, Sabrina
begins by applying Prep

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.597
throughout wet hair.

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:27.930
This will help prepare the
hair for the styling products

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.940
to follow.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.310
Sabrina uses Thickening
Full Form Mousse.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.000
She applies Full Form
Mousse at the roots

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.100
and follows it with
a second application,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.520
concentrating on
the middle to ends.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.400
Full Form Mousse provides
the kind of grip and traction

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.820
that's great for a
round brush blow dry.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.520
Sabrina brushes the
product through the hair

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.155
and begins to blow
dry with her hands.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.040
Hand drying helps remove
moisture and build volume.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.430
Once dry, she creates three
sections, one on each side,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.310
and one in the back.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.900
Sabrina begins to blow
dry the back section

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.680
with a round brush, working
from the nape to the crown.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.300
Blow drying in an upward motion
helps create more volume.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.030
She continues to work
around each side, leaving

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.250
the top section for last.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.740
When releasing,
Sabrina twists the hair

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.940
to encourage the shape.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.975
Then she blow dries the top
section away from the face.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.340
Maintaining tension at the
root is key for creating lift.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.735
Sabrina tousles the hair with
a blow dryer and her hands.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.830
To add definition
to Julia's fine hair

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.960
without deflating
her look, Sabrina

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.720
works the Thickening Creme
Contour into her hands

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.755
and shapes the style, detailing
a few pieces around the face.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.500
The products we used to
create this tousled look are--

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.020
Prep, a nutrient-rich
detangler that

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.260
helps enhance the performance
of styling products;

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.950
Thickening Full Form Mousse,
a cream mouse that lifts,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.620
sculpts, and holds full shapes;
Thickening Creme Contour,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.660
a shaping cream
that adds definition

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.140
without weighing hair down.
