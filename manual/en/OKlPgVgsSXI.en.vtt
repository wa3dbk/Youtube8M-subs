00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.710
Nokia C6-01.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.870
Expected Q4 2010.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.670
The Nokia C6-01 is a tablet-style smartphone
running the new Symbian^3 operating system,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.740
due to be available to customers before the
end of 2010.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.980
We have said before that Nokia have painted
themselves into a corner with their new naming

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.230
convention.. the Nokia C6-01 sort of follows
on from the original Nokia C6, but the newer

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.909
handset lacks the slide-out QWERTY keyboard,
although the C6-01 does have an improved operating

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:45.980
system and camera. The C6-01 is also a more
expensive proposition than the C6, pitched

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.780
at €260 before tax and subsidy. The existence
of two similarly named and similarly specified

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.930
devices could lead to confusion among customers.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.799
The most prominent feature on the C6-01 is
the 3.2" 360 x 640 pixel AMOLED capacitive

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.400
touchscreen. On the back is an 8 megapixel
camera with dual-LED flash and 720p HD video

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:21.110
capture, and inside the C6-01 supports 3.5G
data and 802.11b/g and n WiFi.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.470
Multimedia support is what you'd expect from
a relatively high-end Symbian device, with

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.310
support for a wide variety of media formats
and also an FM radio. Output is via the familiar

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.000
3.5mm AV connector that is common on these
type of Nokia phones.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
GPS is included, and the Nokia C6-01 also
supports Ovi Maps Navigation. Other software

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.900
includes social networking and webmail support,
plus a web browser and a wide range of applications

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.800
that can be downloaded.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.690
The C6-01 has a microSD slot with a 2GB card
included in the standard sales package, it

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.730
also supports Bluetooth 3.0 and USB 2.0 connectivity.
A stereo wired headset is included in the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.670
box.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.020
The 1050 mAh battery is quoted as giving up
to 4.5 hours talktime on 3G and 15.5 days

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:23.190
standby time. The Nokia C6-01 weighs 131 grams
and measures 104 x 53 x 14mm. It's quite a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.510
bit smaller, thinner and lighter than the
original C6, and one easy way to tell the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.440
handsets apart is that the C6-01 and C6 have
a slightly different button arrangement on

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.020
the front.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.750
This looks like a very capable touchscreen
phone, and the improved Symbian^3 operating

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.310
system and relatively high resolution display
should make it an attractive proposition.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.380
Nokia say that the C6-01 should be available
during Q4 2010 at an estimated price of €260

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.260
before tax and subsidy in Black and Silver
Grey colour combinations.
