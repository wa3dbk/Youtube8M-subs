00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.430
Superintendent: I'm Virgil Hammonds, RSU 2
Superintendent, and what you're witnessing

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.840
today is all of our senior graduates are presenting
what we call their Capstone project, and this

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.980
is a project that they select themselves.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.189
It's basically a project that they are passionate
about, that they want to see through, that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.509
they want to see to completion.

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.400
Really, it's an opportunity for them to the
prove all of the knowledge and skills that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.860
they've acquired while at Hall-Dale High School,
and ultimately culminating in something that,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.550
potentially, they can pursue in the future.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.300
A big part of the process starts, as you're
seeing today, with our middle school kids

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.860
who are already starting to gather some ideas,
what are things that engage them now they

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.579
may want to pursue, to thoroughly research
and study in the future.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:57.390
Student: I knew I would have to do Capstone
in Middle School, probably 6th or 7th grade,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.629
coming to this exhibition and seeing all of
the possibilities I could do.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.240
So I've known for a while and I've tried to
prepare myself with thinking, ahead of time,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.860
about topics I'd want to do.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.480
Superintendant: In the learner-centered model,
we want kids to apply the content to a subject

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.250
matter that is meaningful to them every single
day, not just in their senior year.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.910
Student: For my Capstone project, I did animal
adoption and, for my fieldwork, I organized

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.250
a dog speed-dating event for the Kennebec
Valley Humane Society.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.830
Superintendent: Well, we're feeling is that
it's not just about doing school anymore.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.700
It's about really engaging kids in projects
that are meaningful to them, not necessarily

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840
to the school district, or the teacher that
sits before them.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.790
Really the kids, initially, they struggle
with it.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.170
"What do I want to do?

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.630
What do I want to tackle?

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.120
What goals do I have for myself?"

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.701
And so they struggle through the planning
process, much like we, as adults, do as we

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:50.820
struggle through a project.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.250
The whole idea around student-centered learning
is to engage kids in something that is meaningful

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.250
to them.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.450
And so, when they step into the Capstone class,
it's really about asking them, "What are you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.500
passionate about?" and "How can you apply
all the content that you've learned over the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.060
last 4 years in a project that's meaningful
to you?"

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.260
Student: I realized how much I needed to be
self reliant, and it was really up to me to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.060
make my own deadlines, and to be assertive
in finding my expert mentor, and getting what

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.099
I wanted done, and getting the results I wanted.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.099
And I learned I actually really enjoyed organizing
events, so that was fun because, that made

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.300
it a lot more enjoyable.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.579
Superintendent: When it comes to this point
in the year when they're presenting their

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.730
culminating project, it's amazing to see the
pride and the confidence that they exude when

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.180
they're making their presentations.
