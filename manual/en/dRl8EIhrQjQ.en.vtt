00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.370
Did you know the average person spends four years of his life looking down at a cellphone

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.819
Kinda ironic ain't it how. These touchscreens can, make us lose touch

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.598
But it's, no wonder in a world filled with

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.999
Imax ipads and iphones so many eyes so many selfies not enough us is and we see?

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.060
What can we do about it?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.980
Technology, has made us more

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.980
Selfish and separate than ever

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.168
Because while it claims to connect this

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.140
Connection has gotten no better

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.229
And let me express first mr.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.730
Zuckerberg, not to be rude but you should reclassify facebook to what it is an anti social network

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.460
Cuz, while, we may have big friend lists so many of us are friendless all alone cuz

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.749
Friendships are more broken than the screens on our very phones, we sit at home on our computers measuring self-worth

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.819
By the numbers of followers and likes

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.319
Ignoring those, who actually love us it seems we'd rather write

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.419
An angry post and talk to someone who might actually hug us am i buggin

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.429
You, tell me cuz, i asked the friend the other, day let's meet up face-to-face

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.520
they, said i

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.560
what time you wanna, skype i

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.939
Responded with, omg and so rested in a bunch of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.970
Estimations and realized what, about me do i not have the patience to have the conversation without

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.159
Abbreviation this is the generation of media over stimulation chats have been reduced

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.890
so the news is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.500
140 characters videos at 6 seconds at high speed and you wonder why a dd is on the rise faster than 4g lte

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.280
but

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.960
Get a load of this

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.660
Steady show the attention span of the average adult. Today it's 1 second lower

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.479
Than that of a goldfish

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.530
So if you wanted a few people who are aquatic. Animals they, don't get to click off or close, this video congratulations

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.780
Let me finish by saying you, do have a choice yes but this one my friends, we cannot autocorrect. We must do it ourselves?

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.469
Take control of beat control make a decision me no longer do i wanna spoil a precious moment

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.700
By, recording it with a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.750
Phone i'm just gonna keep them i don't want to take a picture of all my

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.119
Meals anymore i'm just gonna eat them i don't want the new, add the new, software or the new

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.890
Update and if i want to post the old photo who says i have to wait until thursday

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.149
I'm so tired of performing in the pageantry of vanity and conforming to this accepted format digital insanity

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.849
Call me crazy but i imagine a world where we smile when, we have low, batteries

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.900
Because that'll mean it will be one bar closer

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.819
to, humanity
