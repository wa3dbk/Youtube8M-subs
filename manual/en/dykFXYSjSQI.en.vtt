00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.440
I had goosebumps when he was coming on.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.500
I am delighted for him, not only because 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.700
he is a great player but also because he is a super guy.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.400
I believe all of the players were delighted to see him on the pitch once again. 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.360
The supporters made sure he felt at home again from the start.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.880
It warms your heart when you get such a reaction from the supporters. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.340
It made all the hard work seem worthwhile.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.980
It’s not often that a goalkeeper in the final three. 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.335
The fact that I have done this is pleasing and I’m delighted with the recognition.

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:25.620
We now need to see what happens next.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.200
We obviously all hope that Manuel wins. 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.140
I think that he has a good chance and believe that over the past few years

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.475
he has shown that he is worthy of such an honour.

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:41.820
There’s not much more you can say about him

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.880
– he performs well and has reinvented the position,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.120
which is remarkable. We wish him all the best.
