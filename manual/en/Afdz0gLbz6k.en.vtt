00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.200
-Good day. I'm Thomas, and I'm 15.
-I'm Ruby, and I'm 15.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.840
And I'm Francesca, and I'm 15.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.560
And this is our SpaceLab entry.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.840
During space flights of long duration,
microgravity takes its toll on human body.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.120
Space flights of such nature
can cause adverse health effects...

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.560
...such as muscle wastage,
chronic fatigue...

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.960
...insomnia caused
by environmental stress, and neurosis.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.280
In Asia and American countries grows a
special mushroom known as the Reishi Mushroom.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.160
The chemical composition
of the Ganodermic acid...

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.280
...contained in this Mushroom is
 similar to that of steroid hormones.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.720
That may possibly positively influence
muscular toning of astronauts...

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.640
...in microgravity or Zero-G environments
on future long-duration missions.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.520
And so knowing the manner in which the 
fungi grows in such environments...

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.880
...could prove essential in solving
the problems faced on these trips.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.280
It can also provide a solution
on long journeys...

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.800
...where it could be impractical
to bring things aboard due to weight constraints...

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.680
...as a source of medication.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.880
In the 1g environment on Earth,
the positioning of the hymenium...

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.400
...or fruiting body of the Reishi
is said to be negatively geotropic...

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.400
...meaning hymenium will face opposite
to the origin of the gravity or right side up.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.200
We therefore pose the question...

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.360
...how does microgravity affect
the positioning of the hymenia...

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.480
...or fruiting body in the Ganoderma
Lucidium fungi or the Reishi?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.040
To give us the answer to this question,
we will be testing the hypothesis:

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.400
When in a microgravity environment,
the Ganoderma Lucidium hymenia...

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.120
...will position itself
in no predictable orientation...

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.880
...with the state of the stem growing
in unsystematic fashion...

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.480
...compared to that of the
Fungi on Earth...

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.320
To test this, we intend to grow
multiple spores on fixed pieces...

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.200
...in the same orientation of decaying
Eastern Hemlock Wood...

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.280
...or Tsuga Canadensis...

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.240
...which is a natural growth medium of this
specific fungi in a humid environment.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.360
To determine if the growth pattern of this
fungus are unsystematic in microgravity...

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.080
...still pictures can be sequentially
captured...

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.360
...to observe the development patterns
of the fungus.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.560
We came to the conclusion Habitat One,
or the butterfly habitat...

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.200
...will be the most suitable for the
experiment...

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.280
...due to the necessity of humidity
and environmental control and monitoring.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.640
We predict that the fungi will in fact grow
in unsystematic manner...

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
...with no predictable orientation
due to the absence of gravity.
