00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:11.996
Sally: This is Systems Sally.

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:12.706
Dude: Hey Sally.

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:13.456
It's Dude.

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:15.206
Sally: Dude, are you OK?

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:16.576
You sound out of breath.

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.276
Dude: Well I started growing some
bacterial cells with Izzy last night,

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:23.296
and today I had to get to practice but coach
kept us late and now I'm worried that the cells.

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:24.456
Sally: Dude?

00:00:24.456 --> 00:00:25.196
You still there?

00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.426
The cells what?

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:28.836
Dude Well I guess I don't really know.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:32.125
Izzy said dog phase but that seems wrong.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.786
Sally: Izzy probably said log phase which is

00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:37.436
when the cells are actively
growing and dividing.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:41.056
If you have some bacteria growing,
I'm happy to put the cultures on ice.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:44.716
That will slow down their growth, and you
can measure their density when you get here.

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:45.866
Dude: Thanks Sally!

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:50.126
Last night we put two flasks at room
temperature and two in the 37 degrees incubator.

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:51.876
I'll be there as fast as I can.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.796
Izzy: Hi Sally.

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:57.576
Have you seen Dude?

00:00:57.576 --> 00:00:59.346
Sally: He just called to say he's on his way.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:02.306
I'm putting these cultures on
ice, but look: the ones that were

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:04.436
at room temperature don't
seem to have grown much.

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:05.946
Izzy: I was a little afraid of that.

00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:09.166
They carry a high-copy protein
generator that Dude and I made,

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.606
but the growth of the cells takes a
real hit when they carry this plasmid.

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:17.456
We've seen them spend 12 hours in lag phase and
then take two days to reach stationary phase.

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:20.566
Without the plasmid, it's more
like 4 hours to go from lag

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.556
to log and they're saturated overnight.

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:24.086
Sally: When did you start these growing?

00:01:24.196 --> 00:01:27.366
Izzy: About 8:00 last night
we diluted the strain 1:1000.

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:31.156
And I don't think these have grown much since
then, but I'll measure their density anyway.

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:35.076
Sally: The cells that were growing at
37 degrees look a little more dense.

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:37.356
Maybe they're doubling at an almost normal rate.

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:38.276
Izzy: Yup.

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:42.646
Their density has definitely changed since
yesterday and if Dude gets here fast,

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:46.306
we might be able to catch them in log
phase and transform in a control device.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.566
Sally: You might also want
to count the cells since some

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:49.946
of the light scattering you're measuring

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:52.526
at the spectrophotometer could
be coming from cell debris.

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:54.926
Izzy: I hadn't thought about
that, but you're right.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:58.636
I'll teach Dude to count cells when he gets here
Sally: One other thing that I've seen happen is

00:01:58.636 --> 00:02:01.616
for the cells to lose a plasmid
if it's making them sick.

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:04.536
You and Dude might want to check
that the cells are still resistant

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:07.126
to whatever antibiotic marker
you have on the plasmid.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.076
Dude: Hi Sally!

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:09.955
Hi Izzy! Sorry to be late.

00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:11.506
I hope you've left me some things to do.

00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:13.646
Izzy: In lab there's always plenty to do.

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:18.586
Let's get started figuring out what's going on
Dude: Getting here, I saw the most amazing pack

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:20.666
of dogs getting walked over the bridge.
