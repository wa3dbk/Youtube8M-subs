What is narrative style in literature? It
is not to be confused with prose style which

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.200
is a choice of words but narrative style is
the choice of who is going to be the narrator,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.391
who is going to tell the story? We have three
basic modes, first person, second person,

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:22.320
third person, just like our favorite pronouns.
First person I tell the story, it is happening

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.779
about me. In the second person not used very
often, you read the story and you are the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.149
protagonist. The narrator will say you get
out of bed, you go to the bathroom and so

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.510
on. The most common is third person, he does
this, she does that, we look in effect, over

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.829
the shoulder of the character but we're not
actually inside the character's head. We don't

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.920
see it through his eyes but rather as I said
over the shoulder. Now sometimes that's a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.369
very intimate third person and it can also
be a very distant omniscient third person

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.480
and an omniscient third person narrative,
the narrator knows what's happening inside

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.900
everybody's heads. The narrator knows everything
that is going on and in an intimate third

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.580
person we are looking over one person's shoulder
and we know what that person knows but not

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.830
the other stuff so for example in a mystery
story you will commonly know what the detective

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.410
knows but nothing else. If you knew everything
already, it wouldn't be a mystery. The other

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.760
problem that we have to deal with is whether
we can trust the person who is telling the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.720
story. In most cases this is not much of an
issue but in a few, especially good stories

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.030
we can't believe what the narrator is telling
us. In "Lolita" for example the narrator,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.150
Humbard Humbard tells us at the beginning
he is a murderer and we know probably from

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.190
the start we can't trust what he says. He
is spinning everything to use a modern phrase

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.360
to make himself look good. In the classic
story "Rip Van Winkle" the first great American

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.889
short story we know the story Rip goes up
into the woods, into the hills, he sleeps

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:17.389
for 20 years and by the wildest coincidence
he comes back several days after the wife

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:24.879
whom he hated terribly dies but if we look
at the story carefully we realize he is lying.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.769
He is lying to us, specifically he is lying
to Dedrick Knickerbacker who writes down the

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.280
story and believes all of it and swears that
it is true whose papers are then found by

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.900
Washington Irving who is the actual author
of the story but we can't understand the story

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.719
completely until we understand that the narrator
is lying to us.
