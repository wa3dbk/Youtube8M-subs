00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Actors for Human Rights presents

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.000
My job was to certify
many soldiers to go to war. 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.900
I refused. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.000
Documentary theatre by Michael Ruf

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
during the course of the war,
the government had become even more brutal.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I would be sent immediately to the front and
either imprisoned or shot as a traitor. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.800
It is quite in the audience. Completely quite. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I got off in Frankfurt.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.700
Three very touching and upsetting stories

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900
about resistance, courage and hope. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
I am Felleke.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I’m 36 years old. I’m from Ethiopia. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.300
An embarrassing conclusion for Europe
and especially for Germany. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.000
First I had to explain
everything according to the Ethiopian calendar.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.000
So, I explained everything according to the Ethiopian calendar.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.400
Suddenly, I had to tell the story again
according to the European calendar.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
Political theatre that sensitizes and motivates for agitation.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.700
Impressively.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They try to mess up the refugees.
So that they fail.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.650
Michael Ruf wants to touch
and to activate. He succeeds.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
There were four men.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000
One pushed my head down,
another pulled my hands apart.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.000
That hurt.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I saw the feet of the stewardesses.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.500
We were on a plane.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.600
I shook the men off.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
They tripped me and I fell.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.700
They carried me.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Two at my feet,
two at my head.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.000
It was narrow in the plane.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.200
I´ve spread my feet apart.
They fell.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.800
I’m not going on this flight!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000
The Asylum Monologues

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I wanted to show that I would never submit.
