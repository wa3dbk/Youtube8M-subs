00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.359
Lovesexy is the tenth studio album by American
recording artist Prince. It was released on

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:14.930
May 10, 1988 by Paisley Park Records and Warner
Bros. Records. Lovesexy was issued as a substitute

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.210
record after the release of the infamous The
Black Album had been suddenly cancelled. The

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.440
Black Album and Lovesexy almost act as companion
pieces, sharing the song "When 2 R in Love",

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.829
but are nearly opposite in theme. The album
was recorded in just seven weeks, from mid-December

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.760
1987 to late January 1988, at Prince's new
Paisley Park Records, and most of the album

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.489
is a solo effort from Prince, with a few exceptions.
The opening track, "Eye No", was recorded

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.949
with the full band. Sheila E., in fact, plays
drums on several tracks and sings backup,

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.049
along with Boyer. Leeds and Bliss provide
horns on most tracks, and Ingrid Chavez provides

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:04.339
the intro to "Eye No". The album is designed
to be heard in the context of a continuous

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.920
sequence: LP pressings split the album in
two side-long tracks, without visual bands

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.049
to indicate individual songs. Similarly, early
CD copies of Lovesexy have the entire album

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.140
in sequence as a single track, though some
later editions have it as nine separate tracks.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.710
Music
The theme of the album is the struggle between

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.350
good and evil, or "Camille" and "Spooky Electric",
respectively. God and Satan, virtue and sin,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.659
the perennial themes of Prince's work, finally
truly mix as Prince climaxes to "Love is God,

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.399
God is Love, Girls and Boys love God above",
in the song, "Anna Stesia".

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:52.260
Prince refers to Lovesexy as a gospel album.
It opens with a sermon of sorts; "Eye No",

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.950
a positive energetic track advising people
to be free from their vices and to reject

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.149
Satan, and affirming his belief in God, while
using his bully pulpit to encourage the listener

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.049
to do the same. "Eye No" is a reworking of
a song called "The Ball" from the unreleased

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.360
Crystal Ball. The song ends with a scale of
horns and a segue of conversations leading

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.460
to the album's biggest-selling single, "Alphabet
St.", which mixes dance music, rock and rap

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.050
along with playful lyrics about sex, braggadocio,
and the heavenly state of feeling "lovesexy".

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.710
Next is "Glam Slam", a busy dance track which
features Prince's full band. It speaks to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.180
the uplifting interlude between Prince and
a woman, and how, when he was down, she lifted

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.320
him. It also praises the woman's love and
sense of humanity. The song ends with an almost

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.810
classical music string solo. Ending side one
of the vinyl release is "Anna Stesia", a heartfelt

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.700
confessional number divulging various sins
of the flesh, and ends with Prince promising

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.180
to dedicate his life and music to God.
Side two opens with the machine gun-like pace

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.710
of "Dance On", which lambastes negative aspects
of society, somewhat akin to "Sign "☮" the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.720
Times". The title track follows, described
by Prince as "The feeling you get when you

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.840
fall in love...not with a boy or girl but
with the heavens above," and it is another

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.460
energetic dance track; the "Good News" indeed
Prince extols its virtues graphically and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.790
then he and Cat Glover share an orgasm, both
using sped up Camille-like vocals, going from

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.700
Prince's voice to Cat's. This leads into the
surviving The Black Album track, "When 2 R

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.230
in Love", a sex-infused ballad. Next is the
almost sparse, but uplifting "I Wish U Heaven",

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.830
which says that no matter what controversy
or opposition one may bring, the end result

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.220
is still wishing your enemy the best. It follows
a Biblical proverb about "blessing those that

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.130
curse you, loving those that hate you, for
it heaps hot coals on their heads". The last

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.270
track is "Positivity", which echoes the theme
of "Dance On". It extols the virtues of staying

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.430
positive, while asking the listener to examine
examples of negativity and negative aspects

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.290
of the world; overlooking the quick thrill
and pushing toward being positive throughout

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.650
it. The song continuously asks the question
"Have you had your plus sign today?" The vocals

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.670
are sung, but the bridge and extended portions
are more of a spoken rap type style that Prince

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.840
had started to display as early as "All the
Critics Love U in New York", in 1982. The

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.460
song ends with sounds of water rushing and
a river over keyboard chords. This final song

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.850
was later given to Mavis Staples for her 1991
album, The Voice.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.380
Critical reception
The cover caused some controversy upon release

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.770
as it depicts Prince in the nude. Some record
stores refused to stock it or wrapped the

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.190
album in black, ironically, as Lovesexy was
issued as a replacement for the hastily withdrawn

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.750
The Black Album, which had an achromatic black
cover.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.340
Lovesexy was Prince's least successful album
since 1982, the album failed to break the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.341
top 10, only got certified Gold and spent
just 21 weeks on the US Billboard 200. While

00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:16.310
"Alphabet St." managed to crack the top 10,
it did not make a lasting impression and the

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.470
subsequent two single releases failed to chart
on the Hot 100 . The situation in the United

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.290
Kingdom was more positive, where the album
debuted at #1 and all the singles became top

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.030
40 hits.
The album was accompanied by the critically

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.550
acclaimed Lovesexy World Tour, of which the
Dortmund show in Germany was released on video

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.010
cassette and laser disc. It was also televised
on the British Channel 4, the broadcast contained

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.790
various camera shots than the ones used in
the officially released video, which was released

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.580
a year later in 1989.
