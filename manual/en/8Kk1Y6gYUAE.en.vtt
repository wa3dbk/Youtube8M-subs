00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:07.419
Clinical trials are the way that we learn
what works best in medicine. If we need to

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:13.410
find a treatment for a condition, the only
real way to know whether it's working is to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.270
do a clinical trial. We do participate in
a lot of clinical trials here at OSU, in cooperation

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.570
with other medical centers and also trials
that we start here at Ohio State. I always

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.570
encourage my patients, if there's a clinical
trial in their disease, I encourage my patients

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.010
to participate, because really that's how
we learn what works and what doesn't work

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.010
in medicine.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.960
ALS patients ask me, "What is this disease?"
and "what causes it?" And I don't think we have

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.510
had the breakthrough discovery yet, and the
basic science of that. We have a lot of clues,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.510
clues that come from looking at pathology,
specimens, and clues that come from learning

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.560
about the genetics that can be related to
ALS. But I don't think we've made the major

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:25.409
discovery that makes it all clear yet for
ALS. Patients keep asking us that, and we

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.600
keep asking that question as well of our scientific
studies, and I'm hopeful. I'm hopeful that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.799
we will make the breakthrough someday. Dr.
Kolb here is one of the basic science researchers

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:51.799
working on this question. And one of his studies
is taking skin samples from patients, skin

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.670
fibroblasts. He has the technology in his
lab to take those skin samples and to harvest

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.540
cells from them and to turn them into, sort
of like stem cells. These cells can be turned

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:16.520
into motor-neuron-like cells that can be studied
in his laboratory. Efforts like that, I think,

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:23.529
are going to help us in the future to understand
this disease in the way that we need to understand

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.379
it in order to design the therapies that are
going to work. And we're going to cure this

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.779
disease someday.
