Mark Hutton: Hi, my name is Mark Hutton. I'm
the vegetable extension specialist with the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.800
University of Maine Cooperative Extension.
What I'd like to talk to you about today are

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.090
onions, onion harvest, and onion storage.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.410
What we're looking for is when about seventy
percent or eighty percent of the tops have

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.310
started to fall over, that's the time where
we can go in and undercut, or lift the onions

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.280
up, to help speed that drying process. And
it's simply just pulling the onions up and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.440
letting them lay out in the field. If we're
having hot, sunny, dry weather like this,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.850
it's perfectly adequate.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.320
Once we've harvested the onions, we want to
give them the time to cure and dry down. If

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.980
we're having warm, sunny, hot, dry weather
we can allow that to happen in the field.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.540
But more often than not, here in Maine we
need to bring them in somewhere. So often

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.409
what home gardeners will do, will bring them
in and set them on their porch. Gets them

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:06.590
out of the weather, we've got good air movement,
and it'll allow these tops to dry down.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.330
The other option for drying down the onions,
if you have a greenhouse structure or a hoop

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.299
house structure, you can bring them in there.
You have good air movement, plenty hot, plenty

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.610
dry. Perfect conditions for drying these down.
The other thing is having some sort of wire

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.640
mesh table where you get a lot of air movement.
That's another thing that can help speed the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.789
drying time.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:39.969
Once the tops are dry and papery, we'll trim
off the ends with simple pruning shears or

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:48.170
kitchen shears. We want to leave about an
inch of tissue here. That way, this tissue

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.159
dries out and is dead tissue. It will help
prevent any diseases from working their way

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:01.649
down into the bulb. We'll trim off the roots,
and we'll rub any loose or dry scales and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.090
dirt off the bulb.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.190
Now it's ready to go into storage. We want
to store them cool, as close to thirty-two

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.959
degrees as you can get. And relatively dry,
sixty to seventy percent relative humidity.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.720
And they should store six to nine months,
depending on the variety you're growing.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.220
