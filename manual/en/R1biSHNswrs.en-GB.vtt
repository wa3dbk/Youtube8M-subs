Hello my name is Katy Fryd and I am an artist
and I'm making these videos to help other

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.030
artists to if you are starting out to give
you some hints and tips or even if you are

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.760
an artist who has been working for a while
some of these videos that I make may give

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.310
you an idea of something you haven't thought
of and I'm adding to them all the time as

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.970
I work through my own career and finding out
new things and different things I make a video

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.370
on them so there maybe something you haven't
come across that might be helpful in one of

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.530
my videos so do check out all the other videos
as well. So this video today is about the

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.600
arts council, I did a previous video about
funding from the arts council which you can

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.350
go and find it and watch it but whilst I was
on there I found a section for jobs and opportunities

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.429
now this isn't the vacancies within the arts
council this is jobs and opportunities for

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.340
artists and performers so if you are doing
a project and you want to find somebody to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.960
help you to work with you can list your job
there and so there is all sorts of different

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.220
artistic jobs going on all over the place
so there are quite a lot so you do maybe have

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.690
to use the search box and put in artist, visual
artist performance artist to find those jobs

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.810
but the arts council are keen on getting people
paid properly so many of the jobs, although

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.200
there are some voluntary and work placement
work experience ones there are quite a few

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.890
which I was quite surprised about because
I knew nothing about this page on the website

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.371
where you can actually get a job which is
paid to the arts council standard well they

00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:55.580
don't actually say what an artist should be
paid but there are other places that suggest

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.270
what an artist should be paid a bit like an
actor who when they actually work they charge

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.870
quite a lot for one day because they know
that in a year they are not going to be working

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.490
every single day so for an artist it's a similar
thing if you are that type of artist like

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.730
a performance artist or something like that
you so your getting £200 a day or more but

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.000
you are not going to expect the entire year
because you might not be able to find the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.340
work some of the work I saw on there was pro
rata so it may only be one or two hours in

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:42.340
London so you mainly get whatever 2 hours
is for pro rata £40 something like that but

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.980
you know it's a great resource I didn't know
about it I found out about it and I'm sharing

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.220
it with you in case you didn't know I think
it is really exciting and I hope to start

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.490
doing some jobs hopefully next year because
I just think that would be great a great way

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.840
to meet other artists to get involved with
other artists projects again the same way

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.209
as actors they get involved in each others
projects so that when they are trying to think

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.950
of somebody oh I want to do that thing oh
that person would be great for it so that

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.930
they contact that person so it is a great
way of networking as well even if the money

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.810
isn't so good but you know do value your time
as well eventually because if you always do

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.790
things for free you are never going to earn
and we can't live like that so so I hope that

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.280
is helpful it is just a quick video today

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.910

do take a job and you get paid and it's made

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.000
