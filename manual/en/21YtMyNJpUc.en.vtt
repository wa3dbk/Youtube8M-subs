Hi, I'm Mike Lais. And on behalf of Expert
Village, I bring you soloing tips and techniques.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:15.750
So now we're looking at it being about time
to showcase and showoff in front of all your

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.460
friends, and get all the girls' phone numbers,
or guys' phone numbers, that you want to do.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.909
Well, the important thing to remember is to
not throw out all your tricks at once. You

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:32.310
need something to work towards, and you can't
set the bar too high right away. I've fallen

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.260
into that trap many-a times, where I'll throw
it all out there. I'll just play really fast,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.649
really loud, really hard, and then I got nothing
after it because I sort of gave it all away.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.370
You want to try to think of this as like building
a house, where you start with your foundation,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.270
you start with your base, and like, the brick
line underneath. And then you want to sort

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.250
of build on top of that. And then when you're
all done, the whole thing looks like it is

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.929
a finished product. So, just remember, you
also want to make sure that you keep yourself

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.030
in rhythm when you play. It's easy to do that
when you have a band behind you, but when

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.310
you're by yourself, try and keep a pulse going
with what you're doing. So, for an example

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.172
here, we'll start off with just something
really simple. You know, we'll start it off

00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:32.950
with a little bit of rock. Get your whole
friends just kind of grooving along. Now we

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:49.472
can start throwing in our tricks, you know?
Don't be afraid to go back. Now we're going

00:01:49.472 --> 00:02:16.050
to try and build it up to where we can get
ourselves going. Like I said, never be afraid

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.971
to go back, because now, when you start playing
quiet like this, it's going to make when you

00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:24.739
start screaming on your guitar sound a lot
better and a lot like you tried to be there.

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.830
You know what I mean? So, you really want
to try and keep your quiets down, and be really

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:43.511
dynamic with your stuff. So, now when I stall
up and hit the high notes, you know, I can

00:02:43.511 --> 00:03:16.420
come right back down. It's a little bit more
effective. Something like that.
