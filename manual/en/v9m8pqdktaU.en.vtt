00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
I'm really excited! In fact I think I'll have to stand up, 
find the Danish flag and wrap it around me!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.400
Cause now it is our turn now!
Tim, Esben, Sebastian and Aske

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.100
 
 
Is the Danish boys who will make sure 
that Denmark gets to the Final in the next 3 minutes

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.200
They are called 'A Friend In London'.
The expectations this year are once again great

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.500
All the journalists from every country 
I talk to has only praised the Danish act! 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.500
The song is called 'New Tomorrow', 
written by Jakob GlÃ¦sner og Lise Cabble.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.600
And it is the 2nd time Lise Cabble
is in the Eurovision Song Contest

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.400
In 1995 she co-wrote the song: 
'Fra Mols til Skagen', that ended as no. 5

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.200
That placement is gonna change
now with 'A Friend In London'!

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.100
Good luck boys! Give us a spot in the final!

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.200
