00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.704
Howdy folks!

00:00:00.704 --> 00:00:02.653
Hey guys! Welcome to Inspire To Cook!

00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:05.131
One of my childhood best memories is

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:09.205
is eating that homemade jam that my mom used to make

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:11.606
She used to make this delicious apricot jam

00:00:11.606 --> 00:00:16.796
She would make this whole process, complicated process but it would come out to the best flavor you've ever tasted

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:22.908
Well today I am going to show you a very easy variation of jam you can do at home in just minutes

00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:25.189
The berries that I am going to use are strawberries

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.201
And blackberries, you can use any berries

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:28.944
And an equal proportion of sugar

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:32.761
I am going to use 250 grams of berries and 259 g of sugar

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:33.396
Let's do it

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:36.265
So we are going to chop up the berries first into small cubes

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:38.075
By cutting them in half first

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:40.024
Getting rid of the greenery

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:43.128
Then I am going to make 2 cuts this way

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:47.858
Long side and chop it up across just like you would an onion or anything else

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:51.096
And blackberries you can cut into about 4-6 pieces

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:52.184
Just like that in half

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.401
I'll cut it into 3 pieces out of each half

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:58.245
Look at those berries, don't they look beautiful. we are going to dump it up

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:00.224
They are all cut up and ready

00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:03.824
And we are going to cover it with 250 g of sugar

00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:05.182
Or the same proportion of sugar

00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:08.528
And we are going to pop it into a microwave for 5 minutes for the sugar to dissolve

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:10.537
This is how it's going to look after five minute

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:14.697
You see that the sugar is completely dissolved and the berries let the juice out

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.340
Looks beautiful and smells (SNIFFS) just amazing!

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.828
We are going to give it a good stir and pop it in the microwave for additional 13 minutes

00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:28.218
After about 10-13 minutes in the microwave, this is what it's going to look like

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:32.529
And a very important tip: you really want to make sure you are using an oversized bowl

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:34.233
Very tall, and very wide

00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:38.122
As the size of the jam will multiply into 5 times or so

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:40.484
As it bubble up when it's microwaving

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:48.233
If you are not sure about the consistency of the jam, you can put into a cold plate that's been in a freezer for about 13 minutes

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:52.781
I actually put the plat in the freezer right before I put my jam in the microwave the last time

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:57.263
And we are going to put it in the freezer  for about 2 minutes and we are going to check the consistency when we take it out

00:01:57.263 --> 00:02:00.129
2 minutes have passed and I am going to put my fork through it

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:02.959
And you see the consistency - it doesn't run back together

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.013
It's pretty thick

00:02:04.327 --> 00:02:04.827
Umm

00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:09.870
And since our consistency is good we are going to transfer the berry jam into our jar, mason jar

00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:11.906
Before it chills off

00:02:13.104 --> 00:02:13.904
There you go

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.919
So we'll put it in the fridge and it will be ready to serve whenever you need it

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:21.454
But the best part is trying it when it's nice, fresh and hot

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:22.923
Umm

00:02:22.923 --> 00:02:24.341
So delicious you guys

00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:25.785
You can put it on a white toast

00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:29.360
As my Babushka liked to do it - put a little layer of butter

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.891
And then put some jam on it

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.699
Umm

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:32.434
Beautiful

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:34.197
ANd you can eat it all with a cup of milk

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.849
Umm

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.121
It really exceeded my expectations you guys

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:39.443
This flavor really blows up my mind

00:02:39.443 --> 00:02:40.556
I can't get enough of it

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:42.321
Try it at home, share with your friends

00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:45.227
Let me know what flavor combination you'd like to see next

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:48.480
Do you want me to show you the apricot one that my mom used to make

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.425
Or do you want to see any other crazy combination

00:02:50.425 --> 00:02:51.616
let me know in comments below

00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:52.979
And we'll see you next time

00:02:53.197 --> 00:02:54.797
Howdy, howdy, howdy Ho!

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:55.654
hahaha

00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:58.161
