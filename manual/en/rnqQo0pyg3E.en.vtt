00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
What do I do when I revise a text?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.140
It's important to have a strong will to change the text

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.520
and an understanding that it needs to be changed many times before it's finished

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.480
Change happens on several levels

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.540
Some levels are related to the research question, some to structure, and some to language

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.380
When it comes to the research question or thesis statement, the question is whether it's clear

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.000
If the questions asked are consistent with the main research question,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.180
and if this is answered by the text

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:48.920
Is the structure reasonable in terms of developing the research question and in the end providing answers

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.500
And then there's the aspect of language

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.340
The over-arching question is if the text is easy to understand

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.880
Does the reader understand what I'm trying to say?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.960
The language used should not be more difficult than the ideas presented

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.760
The key is always to simplify and shorten

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.400
In many ways a text is like a slab of stone from which a statue is emerging

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.560
You have to chop and chisel and keep working for the statue to emerge clearly

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.780
This means getting rid of the slack

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.220
You work on the sentences one by one

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.940
You check if the concepts are consistently used and if there are unnecessary words

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.060
In general any text will have a large number of unnecessary words

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If it's possible to let a text rest for a day or two and then have a fresh look at it, then that will help

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.320
If you can let it rest even longer, you will become almost an outside reader of your own text,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.580
and will find even more ways to improve your text

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.160
The challenge is what's usually referred to as 'kill your darlings',

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
when there's something you'd really like to include, 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.160
but maybe it actually doesn't fit, and maybe the text is better if you simply delete that part

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:34.380
I also think it's important to realize that what you start out with is in the best case a mediocre text

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.940
But inside that mediocre text hides an excellent text

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.620
And the more you revise and modify, the more that excellent text shines through

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.760
So, it's also very important to be optimistic about your text in every revision process

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.640
