Hey, it’s Sean McCabe with seanwes tv. When
you land on a website, you make an immediate

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.480
judgment. Yes, you’re noticing a lot of
things, but what it really boils down to is,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.540
is this a giving page or is this a taking page? We're
quick to recognize it. We're tuned to recognizing

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.189
it almost immediately because it’s all in
the language. Is this providing value to me

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.679
or is it taking something from me?

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.230
Websites with a popup immediately asking for
your email address are taking pages. They

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.870
provide you zero value to you, yet they’re
asking something of you and we’re sensitive

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.460
to that. We immediately recognize that as
a taking page.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.809
We’re quick to tune out noise and we’re
quick to recognize spam. Robert Cialdini in

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.820
his book, Influence, talks about the Hare
Krishna technique of giving a flower to passersby

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.960
and saying it was a gift. Once the gift was accepted,
they would ask for a donation. 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.480
This is the Rule of Reciprocity in action.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.120
Reciprocity is simply a form of the word reciprocate—which is to respond in like gesture. 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.200
Do for someone else as they have done for you.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.140
Let me give you an example. If you buy someone
a coffee, the other person feels like they owe you.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.320
However what’s interesting here
is that they not only feel they owe you a

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.410
coffee, but this sense of indebtedness actually
transcends the value of the original gift.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.310
That means people are so opposed to
feeling this sense of obligation or debt to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.530
someone that they will go above and beyond
in reciprocating that favor just to wipe any

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.260
trace of indebtedness. How this can play out
in reality is you buy someone a coffee and

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.460
rather than them merely buying you a coffee
in return, they will be inclined to buy you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.980
lunch the next time the two of you go out.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.740
This same psychology applies to emails. Every
day I get emails from people asking me for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.540
things. Asking! Here I am giving, I'm giving
with this video, I'm giving with my podcast.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.980
I give with my newsletters—all centered
around helping you. You'd think people would

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.320
be giving back to me but I get these taking
emails. People using up my precious time to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.480
solicit something from me. Like I said earlier,
I can recognize it in under 1 second

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.600
because it’s all in the language. Here’s what they contain: "I want, we want, send me,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.820
take my, promote my, sign up for our." This is what I hear: 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.700
“Me me me, me me me me. Me me me. Me. Oh, P.S., me.”

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.660
This brings me to segment I call Reaching
Out To People—You're Doing It Wrong. 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.600
The biggest problem here is these people are not
providing value before they're asking for

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.120
something. That’s not how this works! You're
not going to reach anyone that matters this

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.740
way. I get emails like this every single day
and they get ignored. Even if these people

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.700
try to follow up with a second email, I'm
going to see what they sent in the first one

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.519
and I'm going to ignore them. 99% chance I'll
ignore them even if they do everything right

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.579
in the second email. You only have that one
chance to make a first impression. So let

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:09.799
that first impression be you offering to help,
you providing value, you giving and not just taking.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.560
If you mess this up the first time
you are automatically labeled as a taker.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.820
Takers get ignored. Nobody likes takers.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.940
Here’s the worst one: people replying to
my newsletter, where I just gave them value,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.840
asking for something. I gave them something
valuable and they want to take more. It doesn’t

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.129
work this way, this is working against the
Rule of Reciprocity. I just gave them something

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.849
of value, therefore the burden is on them
to give back—to reciprocate that favor.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.849
Not to take, not to ask for more. I want to
give you my 1-Step Formula to getting someone

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.280
with influence to A) Respond to you.
B) Maybe help you.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.140
C) Possibly even promote your stuff.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.860
And yes, I said 1-Step Formula.
Here it is: give them something of value,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.740
no strings attached.

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:02.939
Period. The end. Nothing else. This is the
only way you're even going get a chance at

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.299
getting a response from someone, at getting
help from someone, at getting someone to possibly

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.590
promote your stuff. You can’t just ask,
you have to give to them first. Even then,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.490
that’s just the cost of entry. Chances are
you still won’t get help, you still won't

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.020
get a response, because they probably deserve
whatever it is that you gave them because

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.930
they’ve been providing so much value to
you. That’s why you’ve even heard about them

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.410
in the place.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.340
You have to build the relationship first.
If you even want a fighting chance, you have

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.970
to establish yourself as a giver and not as
a taker. The only way to do that is to provide

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.140
value or give something with with no strings
attached. Do not ask for something in the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.440
first email. I repeat: do not ask for something
in the first email. Don't even ask for something

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.660
in your second email. I don’t even want
to see the words “my” or “me” in your

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.760
entire message. You, you, you, you.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.720
How can I help you? Do you need any help with
[x]? Which is my specialty. Hey, I noticed

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.620
this and I did this for you. Hey, thanks for
all that you do. Now I can tell a few of you

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.240
out there are saying, "1-Step Formula? I need
something more!" Ok, step 2 is repeat step 1!

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.000
Keep giving, keep giving more. You have
to get this through your head or you're going

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.030
to be ignored because there's millions out
there that all they want to do is take.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.190
They want to take my time, my money, my resources,
my attention, my advice, my audience, my exposure,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.850
and my endorsement and they are a dime a dozen—they’re cheaper than a dime a dozen!

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.630
You want to stand out? Be different. That means
giving. It’s Relationship Marketing 101.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.800
I’ve had people reach out to me and say,
“Hey, do you need help with [x], I’m your guy,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.350
that's my specialty, I want to help you.”
That was it! That was all they said: "Can

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.390
I help you with this?"

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.110
They provided value, we ended up talking,
I provided value. A relationship was formed.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.560
Eventually, they interviewed me on their show
and I created a post where I highlighted them

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.550
specifically. The entire post was dedicated
to them and I promoted that to my audience,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.450
I put them in the spotlight. I’ve done this
numerous times. Now compare the objective value:

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.320
They gave me advice for a few minutes
and I gave them exposure to tens of thousands.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.280
Those aren't even close to the same thing
but that's the beauty of the Rule of Reciprocity.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.880
Once I identify you as a giver, then I am
now motivated to out-give you.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.950
See, you’re so focused on getting whatever
you can, that you straight up ask for it without

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.570
providing value. In doing so, you blow any
chance of getting anything in return because

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.120
you’re immediately labeled as a taker. What
you should be doing is incentivizing someone’s

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:48.430
inherent generosity. Giving incentivizes giving.
By giving to someone with no strings attached,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:54.310
they’re now motivated to out-give you. Not
only does that make you feel good, but you make them 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.010
feel good for giving, and you get more than you
could have even hoped for in the first place.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.840
No out-takes.
