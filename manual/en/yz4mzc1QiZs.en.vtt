00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.841
Today we are biking out to Tra Que which is
a little village.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:24.800
We're going for a special organic meal at
a restaurant that grows its own vegetables

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.670
and herbs.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.540
Oh, wow!

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:48.650
Can you hear the sound of the water.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:01:01.090
This is Sam on the Waterwheel.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.570
You're a natural.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.010
If this isn't fun I don't know what is.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.310
You should move out here and take up farming.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.890
So this place is amazing.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.930
It's like a little organic oasis where they
just grow different herbs and vegetables.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.650
Everyone is farming and it is so peaceful
and quiet and it is beautiful.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.940
Look at all of the flowers around this.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.450
We have a very special drink here.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.150
It is called the water wheel drink.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.549
It's made with lemon basil seed and ginger.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:49.940
Let's take a sip 
of that.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.940
It tastes very healthy.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.160
In a good way or a bad way?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.210
In a pretty good way.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.840
Okay.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:18.270
Tra Que is a small farming community village
located two kilometers northeast of the Ancient

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.110
Hoi An town area.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.230
We just came here for dinner but if you decide
to visit this village you can also work with

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.319
the farmers for the day, you can take a rice
paper making class or you can take a cooking

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.630
class.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.590
If you've been following along with our recent
food videos you probably have noticed we've

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.790
been having these pancakes a lot and they
are delicious.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:53.070
I have to say that the presentation of these
ones down here looks the best.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.290
So these here are the best country pancakes
we've had.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.830
What I really like about them is that they
are not as oily or greasy as the other ones.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:21.440
They have a little bit of a fluffier texture.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.870
So this lovely presented dish is called three
friends and there are three friends right

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.959
in my hand.

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.870
We have shrimp, pork and vegetables wrapped
around.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.460
Pop that in your mouth.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.050
Friendly?

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.780
I've got some good pals in my mouth.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:58.000
These tres amigos are almost too pretty to
eat.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.640
Thank you.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.459
Easy.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:22.169
So here we have our colorful papaya salad
and I didn't realize it was going to be this

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.169
big.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.970
I started to think we ordered way too much
food.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.500
Are you kidding me?

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500
With me here?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.949
Too much food?

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.290
I'll take care of that.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.060
Well to sum up this meal I can honestly say
this is the best dinner I've had since I've

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.120
been in Vietnam.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.889
I absolutely loved the dishes.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.490
You could just taste the freshness in every
single dish we had.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.800
The prices were really affordable.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.139
The portions were generous and it was cooked
really healthy.

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.740
Nothing was greasy or too oily.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.810
It was just absolute delight to come here
and eat.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.950
I definitely agree.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.889
I think the long bike ride out here was definitely
worth it and it is nice eating in such a quiet

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.650
and peaceful setting just being surrounded
by the farm.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.090
So we highly recommend it if you're in Hoi
An.
