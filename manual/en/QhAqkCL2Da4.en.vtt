00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.679
Insulating Concrete Forms or ICF's as
they are known have become one of the

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.430
most efficient building materials
available today for both homes and

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.169
commercial buildings. ICFs come in many
different shapes and sizes depending on

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:29.169
the project. Today we will look at how
ICF's are made. But first what exactly

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.559
are ICFs? Insulating Concrete Forms, ICFs,
are hollow foam blocks that are stacked

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.739
and locked together in the shape of the
outside walls of a home or building.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.200
Reinforced with steel rebar and then
filled with concrete. The forms stay in

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.010
place and provide insulation and are
finished inside and out.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.390
This idea was invented in the 1940s and has evolved over the past 70

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.739
years using new materials to increase
both strength and energy efficiency.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.329
Modern ICFs use two types of materials
to create the forms which are left in

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.399
place to provide insulation and disaster
resistance. The first component of ICFs is

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:12.219
expanded polystyrene, EPS foam that make
up the insulating panels. The foam panels

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.820
hold in the concrete during the pour and
provide high insulation after the home

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.310
is built. Expanded polystyrene is a rigid
and tough closed cell foam that is used

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.760
for disposable trays, plates, bowls, cups,
and food packaging. The fact that EPS is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.720
so great at keeping your coffee warm and
soda cold as what makes it perfect for

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.250
doing the same to your home.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.270
The second component of BuildBlock
insulating concrete forms are

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.170
polypropylene plastic webs which bridge
the two panels together and provide

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.659
screw and attachment points for bracing and alignment

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.270
during construction. Attaching finishes
to the wall such as stucco, EIFS, brick, or

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.429
siding on the outside and sheetrock or
plaster on the inside. Expanded

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.119
polystyrene foams are produced using
blowing agents that form bubbles and

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.759
expand the foam. BuildBlock plastic webs
are made from high-density plastic.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.420
BuildBlock combines both new material and recycled material into the finished

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.299
product. Any scrap is recycled yet again
for future use. The BuildBlock webs have a

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.799
screw pullout strength of more than 150
pounds on the entire web and more than

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.760
450 pounds in the high-density
attachment points. Each of these is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.349
greater than wood. the BuildBlock ICF
webs are loaded into specially-designed

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.450
molds. The two pieces of this mold will lock together and the very light foam beads

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.769
will flow into the mold. Hot steam is
then pumped into the mold and the beads

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.079
rapidly expand and stick together. After just a few moments, the mold separates and the

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.810
finished block is pushed out. ICFs are one
of the cleanest materials to manufacture.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.609
The beads are expanded using only steam. Any extra beans can be recovered and

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.000
recycled. Most foam molding facilities
have very little waste. The ICF blocks

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.290
are closely inspected to ensure they
meet strict quality standards. They are

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.250
then interlocked together, stacked in
bundles, and packaged for storage and

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.959
transport. These ICF blocks will continue
to dry for the next few days and are

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.730
now ready to use in your next building
project. One of the greatest benefits of

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.400
ICF blocks is that they are very
lightweight. Each ICF weighs roughly 7 pounds.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.549
One ICF takes the place of six
concrete masonry units, CMUs, or cinder

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.780
blocks. And each cinder block weighs 35
pounds.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.700
ICS are easy to move around. Even the
youngest construction helpers can do it.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.580
There are different number of forms in
each bundle based on the type of form

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.680
and the size of the block. But most
BuildBlock ICFs are packaged in 4 foot

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.380
by 4 foot by 4 foot cubes.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.360
This makes it very easy to store them in
the warehouse, load and transport, as well

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.290
as unload and move around the job site.
Building with ICFs gives you one of the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.760
most energy efficient and safest
structures possible today. The increased

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.080
cost of ICFs in new home construction is
easily offset with thirty to seventy

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.049
percent monthly energy savings that add
up over the entire life of your home. And

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.419
with increased danger of wildfire,
earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes an

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.720
ICF home gives you the added peace of
mind you and your family deserve.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.760
Traditional wood frame structures are no
match for the awesome power of Mother

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.820
Nature. ICFs can be used to build
virtually any home plan, using any finish

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.790
brick, stucco, siding, and more. And when you complete your home it will look just

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.860
like any other on the block.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.169
Ultimately, you will be left with a much
more quiet, energy efficient, and safer

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.169
home for you and your family.
