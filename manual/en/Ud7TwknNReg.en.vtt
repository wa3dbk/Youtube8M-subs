00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.270
My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I will be making a quick and

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.210
easy Spanish Gazpacho. Alright so I have added
some more water to it to thin it out a little

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:19.100
bit and now what we are going to do is add
the bread so throw all of that in there at

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.040
once. The bread is going to act as a thickener.
We are going to treat the bread the same way

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:36.410
as we did the onions. Just put the bread right
on top of it and give it a whirl. Most modern

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.800
recipe versions of gazpacho you will not see
the bread added in there or you will see toast

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.130
or something on top. The most traditional
form actually has you take a mortaring pencil

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.290
to the garlic and the bread and oil to make
a paste out of the bread but we are not going

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:04.900
to be doing that today because we have a hand
mixer. What we are going to add in are the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.980
red and green peppers. We will do one at a
time though because you can add too much at

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:33.960
one time. We will do half at a time so I just
put half of the green ones in. With the green

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.274
peppers I usually try not to chop them down
too small because I want to see a little bit

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:53.290
of color in there and the same thing with
the red peppers. A little bit of color is

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:13.639
not so much a bad thing. Now let's throw those
red peppers in. With the

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:20.379
red peppers you will see that they will put
a little bit more of the red color into the

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:26.799
soup. A lot of times you will go somewhere
and see bright red gazpacho and that would

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.650
not be a traditional color for gazpacho. The
gazpacho should be a pinkish color due to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:51.930
the aeration of the oil with the tomato. Started
to splatter a little bit. We will move on

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.819
to our last step now.
