00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.689
In this clip, we'll be learning how to do
the beginning of the alphabet for the minuscule?s,

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:15.080
the small letters from A to F. Sometimes it's
helpful to me, when I'm doing my practice

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.980
work or even in a professional job, to write
on the side what the lines are so I don't

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.640
confuse them. So I have the body height here,
the ascender, the descender and this is the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.150
cap line. Everything's going to be written
with a forty-five degree angle. So, I always

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:43.160
look for that angle and make a little tic
mark with my nib edge to find it, because

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.870
you're always going to be holding your pen
at forty-five degrees. Here's an example of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.430
how you're going to be holding your nib and
your nib holder in the forty-five degree angle

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.710
to the paper and you're always going to be
keep your hand flowing nice and smoothly.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.140
And you're going to be very, very relaxed.
You uncross your legs, you loosen up your

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.831
arms and you relax. Then you'll start with
the letter A. You come down, you go up to

00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:19.080
the corner, down, up and then you finish the
letter for two. Once again, you can make your

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.940
forty-five degree angle, you come down, back
up, and down, and you use these lines that

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.740
I have on this grid to help you to determine
exactly where to go with the lettering. If

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.550
you're not in a place where you can be using
a dip pen, maybe you're traveling or you're

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.930
not some place where you can have access to
clean it up, I then recommend you use the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.060
calligraphy marker at the 5-O size, which
is about the same as the C-O nib. So you're

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.970
going to get relatively the same sizing for
your lettering. And it's convenient for practicing,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.640
but it's not something I would use in a final
project. So to make a letter with the marker,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.140
it's the same thing; you're still going to
find your forty-five degree angle. And, with

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.250
the letter B, you're going to be using your
ascender, so you're going to go all the way

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.270
to the top to find your forty-five degree
angle. So, working with the marker, you're

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.560
still going to find your forty-five degree
angle and on the letter B, you're going to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.370
be using the ascender and you always want
to complete your second stroke and not leave

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.790
that empty because this is a cursive hand.
You're going to have a cursive look to it.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.450
So, that's the B. For the C, again, you find
your tick mark, come down and up on your edge

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.770
and over. D is a little more complicated.
You come down, up, find your forty-five degree

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:11.810
angle at the ascender, down the body height,
finish and finish. E, just like C and F is

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:21.269
a long letter. Comes all the way down, crosses
at the body height.
