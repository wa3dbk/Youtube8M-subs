00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:44.510
Skimming through the corners alone
Searching for a light inside

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:54.809
Before my love runs out
Hoping I can see it through

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.379
I miss the man I used to be
Can't decide what's wrong with me

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:15.629
There's no connection with myself
Naked like a dead tree

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.350
Hey, when I close my eyes I can see the way
If the words don't come can you help me say

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.460
Give me what I need to be born again

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.649
Save me from this void I'm in
I've been bending over backwards just to raise

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.110
my chin
To be honest as the day is long,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.869
I don't know where this is coming from

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.869
Hey, when I close my eyes I can see the way
If the words don't come can you help me say

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.250
Give me what I need to be born again

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.250
Hey, when I close my eyes I can see the way
If the words don't come can you help me say

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.649
Give me what I need to be born again

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:41.649
Hey, when I close my eyes I can see the way
If the words don't come can you help me say

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.750
Give me what I need to be born again

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.750
Hey, when I close my eyes I can see the way
If the words don't come can you help me say

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:10.659
Give me what I need to be born again
