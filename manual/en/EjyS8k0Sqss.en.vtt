00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.750
Welcome to Wildstar.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.679
This is Dev Speak.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.000
This is the disclaimer.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.020
Go time!

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.550
In this episode we're going to talk about
what is hands down the most defining aspect

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.580
of WildStar's combat.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.580
Aiming.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.630
Now during development we experimented with
several different aiming methods.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.170
Traditional MMO tab targeting.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.360
Crosshair aiming.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.770
Crosshair soft targeting.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.790
And MOBA-style skill shots.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.970
Each of these methods has it's pros and cons.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.010
And attracts some us more than others.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.730
In the end we decided to put together a new
system we call free-form targeting.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.980
It takes the core of traditional MMO tab targeting
letting you easily locate your allies or enemies.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.510
But with almost all of our abilities you can
actually take manual control of your aiming

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.820
to launch projectiles or inflict pure area
of affect damage This system ends up giving

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.510
you moment to moment control and a real sense
of risk versus reward.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.570
It also works great with our existing creature
telegraphs.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.140
Telegraphs felt pretty awkward when combined
with traditional MMO targeting.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.440
All you had to do was use an ability to snap
back to the enemy.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.199
Mmmmmeh not much skill.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.459
Freeform targeting is the missing link.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:11.020
This means that while your enemies can miss,
so can you.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.170
Suddenly movement, positioning and aiming
make all the difference to an expert player.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.179
Because getting the most bang for your buck,
means nailing all four of these fools.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.119
This is also crucial to PvP.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.349
The best players know how to deliver their
damage while avoiding their enemies.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.549
This guy, he needs to get on my level.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.549
Now we do give you tools to help you aim.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.859
Mousing over an ability on your bar shows
a targeting decal.

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.659
Holding down the button lets you aim.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.520
When you're ready, just release.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.009
There we go.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.030
All classes in WildStar will have to master
aiming.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.549
Need a little crowd control?

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.169
Make sure your aim is on point.

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:51.899
And you'll unleash some crazy combos.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.329
Tanking?

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.380
Freeform targeting adds an element of skill
to all the basics.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.310
Pulling, holding threat, taunting, protecting
your group.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.759
Skilled tanks will stand out.

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.619
How about healing?

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.159
In WildStar healers will have to move constantly.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.269
Evading attacks and actually lining up their
heals.

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.170
You'll know a good healer when you see one.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.180
To keep things fresh, we have a smorgasbord
of different attack shapes.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.349
And when paired with different cast methods
we get a huge range of abilities.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.340
Keep in mind, moving and aiming are just the
meat and bread of the WildStar combat sandwich.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.129
We still got all the fixin's.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.769
Later we'll talk about how crowd control in
WildStar like Blind...oh $#!@! That's it for

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.980
now, but don't forget social media and all
that jazz.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:03:16.360
After all, the devs are listening.
