00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.069
Hi everyone. I'm Rincey and this is Rincey
Reads. Today I'm going to be doing a review

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.500
on EVERYTHING I NEVER TOLD YOU by Celeste
Ng. This story follows a Chinese American

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.720
family in the 1970s. One of the daughters,
Lydia, her body is found dead on the lake nearby

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.989
their house. And so the story basically just
follows the family as they try to figure out

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:27.279
what actually happened. Was it suicide or
was there was someone behind this murder?

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.809
And they basically just deal with the consequences
and just their own emotions and dealing with

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.720
Lydia's death. This is a book that I had kind
of been anticipating coming out because there

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.550
are a lot in the bookish community who read
this and were talking about how much they

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.690
enjoyed it. I have to say, I liked it, but
I didn't love it the way that I was kind of

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.650
hoping to. I think part of the reason why
is because this book was weirdly talked about.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.100
Or by "weirdly" I mean, the way people were
talking about this book, I feel like I read

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.760
a completely different book [laughs] than
the way they were talking about it. A lot

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.239
of people were talking about this book as
if it's a mystery. And while there is a mysterious

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.030
element to it because you don't know why Lydia
dies or how she dies or what happened to her

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.420
at the beginning of this story and you do
eventually find out what does happen, it's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.729
not like you're following people trying to
solve a crime. What you're really doing in

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.770
this book is you're following this family
and the story goes from present day and also

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.759
has a lot of flashback scenes. So you are
building up a history of this family and their

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.759
relationship with each other. And then all
of that leads to the death and then you find

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.840
out what actually happened. Some of the things
that I did like about this book is the fact

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.079
that this is a bi-racial family. The father,
James, is Chinese and the mother, Marilyn,

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.009
is a white woman. And so there is a lot discussed
in here about race and just race relations

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.609
and being in a bi-racial family. This book
is told from multiple perspectives. You follow

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.880
various people in the family, uh, throughout
various points. There's no real order, it's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.689
not like, chapter by chapter you're switching
perspectives. It kind of flows back and forth

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.969
between different characters. As many of you
know if you've been watching my reviews for

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.970
a while, I am getting kind of sick of the
multi-perspective tool being used in stories.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.690
I feel like every piece of literary fiction
I've been reading lately uses multiple perspectives

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.030
and I kind of just want a story that's told
from one perspective. And one of the reasons

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.490
why is because I feel like when stories are
told from multiple perspectives you don't

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.460
really get to know any of the characters.
That is 100% the case with this book. I feel

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.920
like you don't really get to know the characters
in this story very well. You see them doing

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.530
things and you see them reacting to things,
but you don't understand why they're reacting

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.150
the way that they're reacting. Or you don't
understand the choices that they're making

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.830
and it's really bothersome. This story is
pretty short, I believe it's less than 300

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.870
pages. Yeah it's just under 300 pages, like
290 pages. And so with a story this short

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.480
and you're following around multiple perspectives,
you get even less time than you might with

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.650
some of the other books I've read where the
books are like 500 pages and there's multiple

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.710
perspectives. At least then you get to dig
a little bit deeper. But I feel like outside

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.480
of say maybe the mom, you don't really know
much about any of these characters, which

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.150
is not something I enjoy. Because my favorite
part about any story is getting to know the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.650
characters. Like my biggest gripe with this
book is that I wish it was either longer or

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.980
I wish it was just told from one character's
perspective. Honestly, I wanted to just keep

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.770
reading about Lydia most of the time because
her life, while I wouldn't say it was good,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.540
I would say it was the most interesting to
me. I think Lydia and Marilyn probably had

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.970
the most developed stories in this book, which
just might be why I was the most drawn to

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.290
them. But if the story was told from either
of their perspectives, but preferably Lydia,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.430
I probably would have enjoyed this like a
million times more. I feel like this story

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.530
is like the start of something really good
and had potential to go even farther and it

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.250
just didn't go far enough for me and that's
why I was left a little bit disappointed.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.370
That being said, I didn't hate this book whatsoever.
I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars. I liked it,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.920
I didn't love it. And I think part of that
might have just had to do with like the hype

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.960
machine or just bad marketing for me. I feel
like if I had known a little bit better what

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.100
this story was about going into it, I could've
managed my expectations better. And I feel

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.040
bad faulting a book for my own expectations
but that's just the way I felt at the end

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.960
of it. So it's hard to give it a higher rating
if I didn't feel the way that I feel when

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.120
I normally give books a higher rating. There
are other aspects of this book that I could

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.180
easily talk about. The title comes from the
fact that the characters are really bad at

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.910
communicating with the other characters in
the book. So there's a lot of situations where

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.990
they could have just been solved by just communicating
better, by being open and honest and just

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.900
talking about their feelings. All of the characters
in this book seem to just internalize everything

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.420
and not really talk about their feelings,
which causes a lot of anxiety on the reader,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.810
but I think it's purposeful. But I do know
that that that might be frustrating for some

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.520
people, so some people might not like the
book for that. So yeah, those are my quick

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.700
thoughts on EVERYTHING I NEVER TOLD YOU by
Celeste Ng. If you've read this book, feel

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.400

me know what you've thought. I've seen a couple

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.630
of reviews on BookTube of other people who
have read this book and I've seen mostly positive

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.130
reviews. So I'd like to hear other people's
thoughts. So yeah, that's all I have for now and thanks for watching.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.970
and thanks for watching.
