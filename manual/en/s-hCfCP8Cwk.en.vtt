00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:13.519
 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.320
I didn't realize it at the time, how, the connection,
but when I was a little kid I actually liked

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.830
getting sick. Not for the fact of, you know,
feeling gross and all that, but I liked the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.689
idea of what's it like? Neither of my parents
went to college. I'm the first generation

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.960
of my family to go to college. And not only
go to college, but now go for a PHD. Within

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.780
the lab it's very unified and we all help
each other. \

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
\
\

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.240
\
\

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.870
taught me so much and I really appreciate
everything that he's done for me. \

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.870
\
\

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.389
a parasite infection weren't responding to
vaccines appropriately. These parasites, bias

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:22.209
the immune system to this very anti-inflammatory
state. So when you give a vaccine the vaccine

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.810
doesn't work because part of how vaccines
work is you need inflammation. You need the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.709
body to recognize that the vaccine is there
so that it can respond later. \

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:33.709
\
\

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:48.770
and the influenza vaccine as a model system
to study this anti-inflammatory effect. Initially

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.590
we were looking at it as a model system for
evaluating the HIV vaccine, but now we actually

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.139
see that there is a place for this not just
as a model system, that it could be very important

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:08.200
with regards to the possibility of the next
pandemic. \

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
\
\

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.620
year, so I'm at the point where I need to
start thinking about where I want to go and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.569
what do I want to do. And working on high
containment viruses, like Ebola, you know,

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.739
the nastiest of the nasties, it really, it
gets me excited. I love the idea of working

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.849
with something that is just\'e2\'80\'a6 some
people like roller coasters, that's where

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:46.079
they get their thrill from. I get mine from
working with things that could kill you. [Laugh]

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:55.639
And I don't like roller coasters, so there
you go.}
