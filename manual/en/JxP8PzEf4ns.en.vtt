00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.130
Welcome summoners to the introduction video of the leading Jungle Timer for League of Legends

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.670
first of all

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.759
I would like to show you where you can
get this tool

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.509
of course this program is free

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.759
to use

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.390
and if you wish you can have a look
on the source code because it's Open Source.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.699
so we gonna visit the official website
called ljtd.net

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.789
and we directly go

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.619
to the download section

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.590
here you choose your operation system

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.100
and if you like this tool you can of course

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.250
go to our facebook page.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.300
Done this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.520
you extract the package you've just

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.890
downloaded

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.510
with the program like WinZIP or WinRAR

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.910
make also sure

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.030
to read the faq section

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.540
on the website

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.410
before leaving the comment

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.570
you can't find the faq section here.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.079
So let's have a closer look

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.940
to what we just have downloaded.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.620
So opening the folder

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.230
you can see the several files and
directories, most important here of

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.969
course the 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.480
executable

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.350
that we move 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.000
to the taskbar now

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.930
I have already done this

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.930
and so now

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.880
let's start the program.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.080
After the program has finished
loading

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.039
An I just drag 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.600
it to another place because

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.479
my screen resolution is not fitting into
this screen capture here.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.770
But nevermind, 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.450
so now we rightclick the tray icon and we choose the Config GUI.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.070
This configuration window offers

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.750
every setting that is available for this tool.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.340
As I've written in the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.420
getting started section

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.920
you should configure you path to
the Riot Games folder at the first start.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.150
Do this by either directly editing it like this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.560
Or by clicking on the button

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.430
to search for the folder or the path.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.660
So when you have done this click on save to safe
the changed path.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.119
This was the only setting

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:16.279
that will need a restart of this tool so you restart the tool and

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.930
now I will 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.380
describe how use the save and reset buttons.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.730
The reset button is reseting alt the 
seven tabs

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.699
you can see on the top

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:32.569
to the preset settings, it's like you
click on and

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.089
if you change something like

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.569
this before

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.150
it's reseted to the preset

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.190
But notice 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.419
that nothing 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.659
is saved by doing this.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.290
So a reset is not enough,

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.169
you'll always have to click the save
button

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.359
to save settings you see on the actual
tab.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.170
So you really 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.519
have to go to the tab and
click on save,

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.399
that's wat is meant with this.

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:04.680
The reason for this is that

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.639
you shall have 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.829
the possibility too easily

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.930
reset everything without saving

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.069
anything.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.419
Okay enough right now for reseting and
saving

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.419
let's come to the tabs.

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.239
Every tab has an assignment

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.389
The main tab offers the possibility

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.159
to change really

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.430
important global settings for this tool.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.559
Having a closer look on other tabs

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:35.069
let us see that we are going deep
into detail,

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.169
like a tab for changing

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.449
colours and so on.

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.469
Let's have a

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.159
they look now on the overlay you see
in-game.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.319
I really just want to show you some
features

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.640
for more details have a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.909
closer look

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.519
on the other tutorials, so meanwhile
I've started a game

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.819
and let's

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.099
first of all

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.339
have a look on the initial timer.

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.109
You can see it on the bottom of the
overlay,

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.669
it will show you

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.039
if the timer is running or not.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.309
In this case

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:10.609
I 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.359
didn't have started the timer

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.129
so it's not running. It should have the
same timing like the in-game clock you see

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:18.090
of course

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.209
on the right top.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.439
Changing the path to the Riot Games folder we did

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.189
some seconds before

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:26.919
will automatically

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.770
letting it start when your game begins.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.639
But to show you

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.259
that you of course can

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.030
start the timer on your own.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.620
We simply click here

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.169
to letting it start.

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.719
You see the timer is now running

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:43.800
from 0:15

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.960
and now we are able

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.520
to time buffs.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.559
Dragons

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.250
and Barons.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.210
You can do this by simply clicking on
it.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.440
You can see

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.280
the timer is ticking down

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.560
and of course

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.080
you can use the hotkeys.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.600
For this clicking ALT and F key

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.280
will let start the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.430
enemy red.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.990
But of course you can

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.999
stop the timer if you missclicked it.

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:12.309
Like, ohh you see

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:14.199
their red wasn't started

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.580
or finished

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.500
so let's reset it.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.300
These are the basics for the timing off
the LJTD.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.099
Let's have a look

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.490
how to slide the timer out in-game.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.360
This pretty simple too,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.909
just click here on the slides to slide it
out

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:33.740
or in.

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.270
You can't change

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.539
the position of the timer in-game.

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.149
You have to set it

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:43.350
on the start

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.949
like this and

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.910
going in-game like this.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.959
Pretty simple and

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:49.889
finally we have a look

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:57.740
on the Advanced MiniMap which
is offering you the WardMap, too.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.939
Simply click here if you have

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.019
not done this before.

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:03.190
And you can see

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.249
two buttons. These two buttons are on this
position

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.439
because 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.750
I have edited it

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.060
to my own preferences.

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:15.699
So if you have

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.870
another size of the MiniMap

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.750
simply use the panel

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.739
to drag it to the place

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:24.700
and simply use this button to change

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.699
the size of the MiniMap.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:29.039
Very easy

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.469
and a smart way.

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.750
As I said just the basics.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.620
This tool also

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.819
afford a Write2Chat feature

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.910
and many other features.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.279
In favor

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:45.469
have a look on the website. Here you can
get more details about every feature

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:46.919
that is available.

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.110
So I hope that you like this tool and having a
great time

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.849
with the 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.249
LoL Jungle Timer Deluxe.

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:56.259
If you have any idea feel free to
post it

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.550
on the forum

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.179
or on the official

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:01.099
facebook website.

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:05.119
I'm looking forward to any request
you have

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:06.879
and now you're Ready to Jungle!
