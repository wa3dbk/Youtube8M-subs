00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.019
There are a few campuses in Carlisle

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.199
You've got Fusehill Street, which is 
a great blend of the old and the new

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.670
and then on the edge of town, you've got Brampton Road

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.450
which is one of the newer buildings.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.630
The facilities are really great in Carlisle

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.030
There's a great sports hall

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.539
for anyone who wants to use it.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.950
There's fantastic food in the canteen

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.300
and there's a chapel on campus as well.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.670
The university's great, I mean, you've got the benefit of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.000
having sort of smaller course numbers

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.880
so you get the kind of attention you deserve and you would want

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.500
and it gives the course a feeling of unity as well, you know, everyone kind of mucks in together.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.020
As opposed to other universities where you've got

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.760
massive amounts of students on the courses -  there's only about twelve or fifteen of us

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.720
so we all know our tutors really well

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.620
which is good for when we need advice for work and things like that.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.159
Living in Carlisle is really good. It's got all the shops that you need. It's got a shopping centre.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.500
Town's really close by, so you can just, you know - 
five minute walk up the road

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.550
The nightlife's good...

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.510
It's a small small city, but it's got all you need. 
There's all the shops you could need.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.830
A lot of people come from
surrounding areas for shopping here

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.270
And the nightlife's good. There's a few decent bars, with varied music as well

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.200
depending on your tastes.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.240
Carlisle's got everything that you could possibly want.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.300
As well as being a small city, so it's hard to get lost

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.790
it's got good shopping and everything, and you've got the benefit as well

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.000
of being practically in the countryside, and it's a beautiful location.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.900
We have quite a lot of nice parks in Carlisle,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.209
one of which is very close to Brampton Road campus.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.300
Just across the road, there's a lovely park with a river walk by it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.649
It's very green and, unlike some other cities,

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:21.100
we have a few rural areas and we're
very close to the countryside.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.459
I picked Carlisle pretty much just because of how it looks. 
It's a really nice looking place

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.900
There's some beautiful places to see in the local areas around Cumbria as well.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.349
It's got a great positive attitude.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.700
It's one of the, sort of, brightest places that I've been to

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.150
for friendly people and it's just got a great community spirit.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.010
The university wasn't actually my first choice, but I'm really glad I came

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.000
because I've met some really great friends that I'll have for life.
