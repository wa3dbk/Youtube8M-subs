00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.419
my decision to

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.859
come to Wisconsin was based on a strong
academic reputation for all of the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:08.929
Wisconsin School of Business

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.500
also the community when I visited for
the admitted students weekend I was just

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.299
blown away by the students, the faculty, the
staff, that I came in contact with

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.250
and knew this was the place that I was
meant to be since the very first day

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.970
I stepped into the program people have been
helping and I want the same

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.240
and thats the Wisconsin idea, that's the Wisconsin effect

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.809
when I learned about the Wisconsin School of

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.230
Business program in a focus on marketing
research it was really no brainer for me

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.309
I knew that this was exactly what was
going to lead me into 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.120
big CPG in America and corporate
America and it offered just exactly what

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.070
I was looking for

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.969
so ultimately it was the only program I
applied and I was very happy to get in

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.480
the Center for Brand and Product
Management really

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.390
helped me learn what it means to be a true
and successful brand manager

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.289
compared with just a general MBA
programs even with a specialty in marketing

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.549
I knew that the Nielsen Center was for
me because of ts focus on marketing

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.369
research for me is the perfect blend of a
full MBA

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.880
and a very specialized degree in
marketing research. It really just brings it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.630
all together

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.640
the the curriculum provides sort of an in-depth look at how

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.470
arts and nonprofit organizations work. I not
only have the opportunity to be a part

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.990
of a great curriculum and and have access
to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.280
excellent faculty and staff including my
 board members

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.320
but I've also had the opportunity to
really develop

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.229
my skills and leadership I think one of
the biggest benefits about coming to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.310
Wisconsin

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.869
and the MBA program here is that you
really do graduate with a strong

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:40.729
understanding

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.740
of all the foundational business topics marketing, finance, 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.189
to operations but each student also
graduates strong

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.479
and an expert in their field on their chosen
field of study

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.350
even if you have specialization here if
you really need something

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.700
from somebody else or some other
specialization it's there you just need

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.469
to go and ask

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.310
during the two years in the program had
access to all these people they're very

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.140
encouraging and helpful that good
mentors I just can't believe

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.160
the axis that we have to these people

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.280
they wanna understand what our career
goals are

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.520
and they wanna work to help us reach
those goals the Alumni Network

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.290
with this large group of people doing the
very best

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.330
work out there and now going out

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.280
I feel like I'm connected to that network
and that will be a very helpful resource

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.739
throughout the rest of my career I expect.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.050
they create this link that will
hopefully

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.769
last forever and I really value that

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.390
I really value that I really understood
what everybody meant by

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.430
fit. I felt that this was a place that I would fit in, that I would grow

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.709
and it was small enough that I would
feel like

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.840
it was home but it had many
opportunities

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.750
it's not only about what they have to
offer academically

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.480
you need to go and visit my recommendation is that 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.069
you really want to be a part of
community part of the school

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.450
you have to go and visit them. That's the only way

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.629
to know whether you're a good fit or not

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.760
