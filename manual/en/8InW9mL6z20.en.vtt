00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.450
When you're rehearsing a fight, it's really
important that once you've decided what your

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.441
choreography is, you rehearse correctly. So
you rehearse first slowly, but you also want

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:13.539
to have a certain amount of fluidity in your
work, so that you're not moving from one move

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.630
to the next trying to remember what comes
next. In one fight a parry would move really

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.060
naturally into an attack--in a real fight.
And it works that way in stage combat too.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.591
It sells better, and it helps develop your
muscle memory so that you remember the fight

00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:31.130
as you work it up to speed, and then it's
safer, it's more convincing, you look better.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.330
So, let's go through that slowly but fluidly,
and see how that looks. So we've already memorized

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.750
our choreography. And we're taking it deliberately
more slowly than we have to just to make sure

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.970
that you're getting your fight into your muscle
memory, so that it moves just as fluidly when

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:03.290
you build it up to speed.
So, once you've rehearsed like that many,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.700
many times, you can start to get faster. Remember
when you're adding speed not to add force.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.740
It's easy when you start getting a fight faster
and faster to want to hit harder, to want

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.779
to parry more ferociously, but that's going
to slow you down ultimately, and also make

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:24.679
your work less safe. It also might make your
opponent a little bit mad at you. So, keep

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.450
the force light as you build speed, and the
very last thing you add is the acting, is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.689
those reactions that really sell your move,
so that at the end you have a really satisfying

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.929
fight that looks good, that's safe, and that
was a lot of fun to put together. So, I hope

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.969
that you have enough tools to choreograph
your own fights should they be for a play,

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.859
for film, or just for a good workout. I like
to get together with friends now and then

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:55.829
and put together a fight, work it up to speed,
and it sure beats an aerobics glass at the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.779
gym. Thanks a lot, thanks Ken. Oh, you're
welcome. My name's Amy Boyle. I'm an actor

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:08.500
in LA. This is Ken Peterson. Actor in LA as
well. So, hopefully you have the tools you

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.610
need to get started or maybe we've just piqued
your interest. I would recommend if you want

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.880
to get started to look in your community for
a fencing center, a local fencing group. A

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.750
lot of fencing groups also have a stage combat
component. Or look for stage or film combat

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.630
classes there. I'd start checking online,
get started. It could be a lot of fun. Thanks

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.110
a lot. Have a good time.
