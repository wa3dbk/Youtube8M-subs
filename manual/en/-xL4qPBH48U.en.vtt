00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.480
Monica Matys [narrator]: Sunnybrook's 4 computerized tomography, or CT scans never stop running, performing

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.500
up to 40,000 scans every year. CT scans use

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.540
x-rays to make detailed pictures of the area inside your body

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.570
being imaged. It's a common test, so what do you need to know if you're having 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.590
one? In many cases, you shouldn't eat anything for 3 hours 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.600
before your scan, but are encouraged to drink plenty of clear fluid.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.630
This will help your kidneys filter out the iodine-dye or contrast

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.650
agent often used to make your inner structures and organs easier

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.680
to see. Arrive 15 minutes before your appointment time.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.720
After check in, you'll be asked a number of questions at the nursing station

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.750
including your medical history, and any allergies you may have. 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.780
At this point, you may need to have bloodwork done to determine how well

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
your kidneys are working, a process that will delay your scan by 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.830
90 minutes.  But it's for your own safety, and it advises the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.860
technologist about what form of contrast agent to give you. Next, you'll have

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.880
to change into a hospital gown and for some people an IV 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.900
is inserted. The technologist will explain the test and position you

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.950
properly on the table. The contrast agent is administered through your IV

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.970
with this power injector, which streams a consistent volume 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.000
into your body over a set period of time. During the test, you may

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.050
get a metallic taste in your mouth, or feel like you've just urinated--but don't

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.060
worry, that's normal, and will pass. While the preparation

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.070
takes some time, the CT scan itself is done in less than 5

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.080
minutes, and remember that family members will have to wait in the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.100
waiting room. When your scan is done, you'll be advised to stay on site

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.130
for about 15 minutes to make sure you're okay. Drink plenty of 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.170
clear fluids for the day following your test, to help clear the contrast agent

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.190
from your system. You can now have something to eat, and get back to your

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.220
normal activities. Remember: alot some extra time for 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.230
delays like needing blood work or even parking your car

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.250
If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, make sure to talk to your doctor first. 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.270
With Sunnyview, I'm Monica Matys.
