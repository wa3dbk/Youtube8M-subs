00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.340
&gt;&gt;&gt; DR.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.260
DAVID MARGILETH: Hair loss continues to be
one of the things that women rightfully fear

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380
the most.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.140
There are some chemotherapy drugs that don’t
cause hair loss but unfortunately, the drugs

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.390
that have the highest cure rate in the adjuvant
setting or neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.390
are ones that cause hair loss; those being
Adriamycin, or Cytoxan, or the Taxanes.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.030
I wish that we would have drugs that didn’t
cause hair loss, but obviously, one will put

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.140
up with hair loss to improve the cure rate.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.620
In general, the hair loss can occur fairly
rapidly, generally two to three weeks after

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.040
the initial chemotherapy.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.860
Most women at that point feel comfortable,
or feel most comfortable, shaving their head

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.460
and getting a wig, but we now have a number
of women who use a baseball cap, or a scarf,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.340
or in many instances, just to go bald.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.149
The hair loss is reversible.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:23.950
Once the chemotherapy is finished, the remaining
treatments that are often done at that point,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.869
do not influence re-growth of the hair.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.590
That is, if more surgery is needed or reconstruction
or breast radiation or one of the anti-estrogen

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.350
pills, none of those things will inhibit hair
growth.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:49.400
The hair will often come back either curly
or darker or gray and initially, some women

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.740
may love the curly hair or hate the curly
hair, but eventually, the hair would be exactly

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.119
like it was in the beginning.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.310
Patients often feel comfortable without a
wig by four to five months after chemotherapy.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.300
Their hair is short but acceptable, and then
ultimately, their hair will re-grow to the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.930
point where it was prior to the treatment.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:26.230
Hi, I am Dr. Jay Harness and I want to share
with you important information that I believe

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.140
that every newly diagnosed patient with breast
cancer needs to know.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.080
Susan Denver: And I want every woman to know…

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.540
Katherine Stockton: …about personalized
breast cancer treatment…

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.900
Susan Denver: …and the genomic test.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.329
Coree: A test that helps guide a woman and
her doctor…

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.530
Katherine Stockton: …to the best treatment
options for her.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.760
Susan Denver: Pass it on!
