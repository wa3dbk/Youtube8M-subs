to the NBA Draft, and that

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.182 line:92%
obviously opened up a spot for

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:51.117 line:92%
me which I thought was great. I

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:51.985 line:92%
feel like under Coach Cal, he

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.052 size:88% position:44% line:92%
sends so many players to the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.987 line:92%
league and overseas, and they

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:57.322 size:88% position:44% line:92%
have such successful season,

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:58.191 line:92%
and that's something I looked to

00:00:58.257 --> 00:00:59.191 size:88% position:44% line:92%
do here. That was important,

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:01.293 line:92%
part of my decision to come to

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.228 line:92%
Vincennes. I feel like that was

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.195 line:92%
a real underlying thing that I

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.231 line:92%
was looking for in college was

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.098 line:92%

pretty good scare, but that was
