00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:05.009
alabama state senator dash ad rake
nikhil i've never heard of it before but

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.240
he decided to recently at talk about

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.199
how much teachers are getting paid in
the state of alabama you know the

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.080
starting salary for a lot of teachers is
only thirty nine thousand dollars well

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.590
he released a statement and he basically
says increasing teacher pay is against a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.210
biblical principle dot is it might
attract people who otherwise wouldn't do

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.050
the job

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.580
teachers need to make the money they
need to make uh... if you don't want

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.250
teachers pay scale y'all attract people
who are called to teach and these

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.150
teachers that are called to teach
regardless of the payscale they want

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.820
each

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.870
it's just in them to do

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.230
it's the ability that god gave them

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.890
it's interesting that they never say
this about the bankers

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.670
they never say hey a banker if he just
loves being a banker news messes

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.840
god-given calling will just do it for a
new price we're going to give them more

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.599
money

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:53.120
so it's very sure we'd didn't know what
works

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.710
we hear uh... and they never say it
about for example state senators like

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.290
himself then why don't we cut your pay

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.530
and then interviews your god-given
calling them then you'll do it either

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.500
way

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.990
no it only applies to teachers no-no it
doesn't apply to anyone else but if your

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.600
teacher will of course it was a pleasure
because he's a republican brian doesn't

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.790
know how you teachers right an and his
logic is so flawed because luck i'll

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.709
tear about education a lot as side front
you know journalism and

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:23.969
and the media i think education is my
second passion and the only reason why i

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.399
didn't even consider becoming a teacher
is because i don't wanna be poor like

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.009
let's keep it real it's unintelligent
person i don't i would be a great

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.739
teacher i wouldn't even consider it for
thirty nine thousand dollars a year as a

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:39.269
starting salary and they hardly get
raises so you know his logic is five

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:42.519
saying that if you double the pay all
the sudden you're gonna try people who

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.399
don't want to be teachers know what
you're doing with this rediculous pay is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.499
you're making people who could be great
teachers decide not to be teachers at

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.389
all right it looked a logic is
rediculous because everybody functions

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:58.369
on financial incentives everybody knows
that it you know to say that

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.000
although the one category

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
abed should not respond appointed to a
set of that alters teachers for some

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.689
reason

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.610
if you're either god-given caller but he
said about trees then maybe makes a

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.319
little bit more sense cuz if there's a
really you're calling there are a lot of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.909
jesus or whatever it is

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.469
into that and any break

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.950
but even they don't believe that right
but you know apply to teachers and no

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.510
one else right under that logic you can
cut everybody's pay all the quote for

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.209
the current state or the former hospital
if your god-given calling to protect the

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.479
people then you should do it for five
bucks

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.180
but i have a car living and i gotta
decide whether i should make up a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.239
requirement our teacher whatever it
might be of course this road
