Hi there! This is WECare and I'm your host Mai. Now for the bad joke of the day!

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.800
What do you get when you cross a Tyrannosaurus Rex with fireworks?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.000
DINO-MITE!
Last week I showed how to take off a cellphone case

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.900
with a dime. BOO YAH!
This week I'll be answering the

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.500
age-old question: what phone do I have?
No, but seriously it can be super confusing about

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.000
what phone model you have.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400
Is it the AT&amp;T version? Is the
Verizon version?

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.800
It makes a huge difference, especially
when you wanna get a case; one could be thicker

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.600
thicker than the other

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.000
but we are here to clear all that up for you,
starting with the Apple iPhone.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.200
All iPhones can be identified by the Apple
logo located on the back of the device

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.500
that little guy right there. Dead giveaway.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.800
every iPhone has a model number
located in the back with device. This one

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.400
is located underneath the word

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.100
iPhone. Write it down, memorize it, say it to yourself 5 times fast, or

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.300
just pause the video.
There have been 8 different series of the iPhone since 2007

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.400
each iPhone series has a specific set a
model numbers

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.200
that are unique to that series.
Here are the model numbers for the iPhone 5s.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.100
and the corresponding models. 
The iPhone 5S is the latest iPhone model.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.700
The front is made of glass and the back is
made of aluminum. And it comes in three

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.000
colors: space grey, silver, and gold

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.900
Now let's take a look at the iPhone 5C 
Here are the model

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.500
numbers

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.200
The iPhone 5C is easy to identify by its glass front and plastic back

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.500
which comes in many different colors.
Now let's take a look at the iPhone 5.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.300
The iPhone 5 shares a similar appearance with the iPhone 5s.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.500
but it only comes in black or white
Moving on..

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.200
the iPhone 4s. NUMBERS!
The iPhone 4s features a glass front

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.000
and a glass back. It comes in black or
white and there are 4 black antenna

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.600
bands

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.610
located on stainless steel border.
Here are the iPhone 4 model numbers.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.400
The iPhone 4 looks very similar to the 4S except it only has 2 antenna bands.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.700
Now let's take a look at the iPhone 3GS
Here are the model numbers.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.800
The iPhone 3GS features a plastic back and rounded edges.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.700
The imprint on the back is the same bright and shiny silver color as the Apple logo

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.200
located above it.
Alright here are the iPhone 3G model numbers

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.000
the iPhone 3 is nearly identical to the 3GS.
It also features a plastic back

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.600
and rounded edges 
However the imprint on the back of the case is duller and less

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.400
shiny as a silver color of the Apple
logo located above it

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.200
and lastly here's the model number for
the original iPhone
The original iPhone..

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.300
features a black and silver back

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.200
made from aluminum.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.100
your iPhone.
