00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.750
So some of the things we see coming into the Emergency Department

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.380
from cold stretches include exposure

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.120
and exposure can range from anything from

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.980
Just being cold or chilled to the bone as they use to say to something we use

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.649
to call medically related coldness or hypothermia. Hypothermia is one

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:23.750
Of those things that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.300
when patients get exposed  to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.390
cold temperatures for a long period of time, it goes
to a certain levels of

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.649
injury patterns to your extremities. Usually your fingers and toes.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.879
And the first level of hypothermia would include

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.410
redness to your fingers or toes
very cold

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.109
painful, tingling, numbness, things like
that. It can progress pretty quickly

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.230
to the second degree which could include
blistering

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.949
and then the more severe episodes which include tissue death.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.649
What actually happens inside of there is
that the water from inside your body

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.559
freezes and it crystallizes and

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.680
causes cell damage. The best thing you
can do

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.790
with that or any other coldness is to get out of the cold and not expose yourself

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.399
So there are things that people can do to
prevent injury from cold temperatures.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.399
Simple things like covering up. You always want to wear a hat, wear gloves.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.570
You will see people run into this situation
when they don't expect to run into

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.860
this situation so their driving in their
car and they

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.950
run out of gas or they slide off the
road

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.219
and they can't get the car unstuck. And they didn't expect to be exposed because they are inside of their car

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.810
but they are not prepared. So, they don't have hats, they don't have gloves, they don't have multiple layers of clothing.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.860
They don't have good shoes to be able to walk in. And so,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.539
being prepared is nine tenths of the situation.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.210
So, if you have to go out, you want to keep yourself covered. Covered in layers are

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.049
best. So if it happens to warm you can take some of those layers off or if it

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.109
cools down, you can layer yourself back up again.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.439
That's one of the best things you can do to protect.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.700
if you happen to be in that situation
get yourself out of that situation.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000
It's really the best thing to do. I'm sure all the times we remember as kids

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.070
running around outside and being cold and your nose was a little bit

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.310
red and your fingers felt a little bit cold. You know that's a touch of hypothermia.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.460
And so what do you do for treatment? You don't have to go running to the doctor every time you have

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.170
just a little bit of that.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.790
So, we talked about first-degree, it's a
little bit red is a little bit

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.660
sore,  kind of tingly, get yourself out of that expose

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.730
take off that wet clothing. That is the best
thing you can do.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.260
Once you take off that wet clothing, dry yourself off

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.780
and get yourself re equilibrated to a normal

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.360
temperature. So, when you bring the kids in, bring them inside, take their wet clothing off, dry

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.080
off any areas that are cold and

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.220
you know, go ahead and expose them to the warm temperatures.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.390
You don't want to too rapidly rewarm. You are not going to dump in hot water or anything like that becasue

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.870
that would then cause injury from a higher temperatures

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.690
you know, let the temperature come back up. If you have to run a little cool water over top of it to make them

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.690
feel a little bit better, that's okay too but make sure you try

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.170
and keep your hands nice and warm, sit next to a fire

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.080
or, you know, just warm yourself up in a blanket can go a long way.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.800
So there's a couple things that people
who had more severe

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.530
hypothermia, whether it be second or third degree, you'll notice some

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.570
findings on, the pain will be sever. Something you really can't handle. And that's kind of a sign that

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.740
you may be having some tissue damage probably worth getting checked out

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.260
clearly blistering on the skin is
something there

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.180
if he had skin that's changing colors and it's not changing back, a little bit redness

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.170
is okay

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.680
dark color, black color is not okay. That would be significant injury related to it

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.090
If you're having pretty sever pain

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.120
up until that point, one thing that is
relatively unique

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.660
to lower temperatures is the exposure to carbon monoxide.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.810
You will see that in a couple different situations

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.640
people will be in their garage and they'll turn on their car because they will want

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.060
it up but there's no

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.130
ventilation. And you car produces carbon monoxide

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.570
is an oderless gas it's a tasteless gas

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.580
and it can very quickly overwhelm you.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.140
You'll get dizzy, you might get lightheaded, you may get confused

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.560
so very quickly, when you get dizzy
lightheaded and confused

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.759
you may fall down. You may have situations where you can't get yourself out of that carbon

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.430
monixide poisioning and bad things can happen from that. So, not only the car

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.870
but also from heaters and from fireplaces.
