There are books of all kinds: novels enclosing
fantasy in his words, notebooks

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.980
that teach you the behavior of an animal,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.780
notebooks impatient waiting injections of

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.280
ink, books that make you laugh at the 
buffoonery of his characters,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.940
and others who simply tell a story.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.260
I present My Adventure Book.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.090
Do you sometimes do not have this strange feeling that despite looking old photos and remember

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.470
those moments something tells you is this
It really happened? Is that day occurred

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.460
really? And you self convince you over and over
instead of yes, you were there, you were

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.920
with that person, and you turn to your memories
to confirm. Sometimes, at least to me

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.500
it happens, sometimes that is not enough.
I need something more, something that has been ripped

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.489
from the time past and dragged into
the present to convince my memory

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.169
is not mistaken. That's why I collect
objects.

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:56.020
Yes, objects.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.320
I save objects, things that remind me
an exact time, and I collect them. is my

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.579
adventure book. Those things that deserve
be remembered. No need to leave the country

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.829
to remember a good time. Good
moments can be daily,

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.710
in small trips you do with your friends
to the beach or anywhere. To do

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.069
those memories are not forgotten my more special way to make them immortal is these

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:24.679
sheets. It is my most personal book. Unlike
other books in this is not written yet

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.100
the final. There is no "the end" in the last
page. But there will come some day. While

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.389
I hope this book feeding and fattening
over time. Each year

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:39.329
pass it gets a little bit bigger. Not
has finally never, because that would mean

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.749
no longer do interesting things. It would not have shared moments, and I do not like it

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:47.740
nothing. There may be end, end a
stage, but also the beginning of new

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.509
chapters waiting to be told.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.270
This year an important stage of my life is closed.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.599
And most important is to know how to start
next. Have new goals, new

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.920
projects, and try to fulfill them. I still
I do not know how I'll start my next chapter,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.180
but either way I know it will be full of
New goals. And you need to look at the past

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.580
to know what you want in the future.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.380
After all
