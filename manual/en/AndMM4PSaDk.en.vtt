00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.470
This is Marc at the National Weather Service
in Norman, Oklahoma with a briefing regarding

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.320
potential for hazardous winter weather late
this week through the upcoming weekend.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.170
Headlines
We’re preparing for an active set of days

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.989
beginning tomorrow and lasting at least through
the first half of next week.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:22.860
A very strong arctic cold front will surge
southward into Oklahoma and north Texas beginning

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.660
tomorrow afternoon.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.700
This front will have pushed south of the Red
River by late tomorrow night.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.640
There will be a chance for strong thunderstorms
along and ahead of the front.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.820
The main hazard from stronger storms will
be hail, but severe storms appear unlikely.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.760
Of more concern will be the potential for
freezing rain from late tomorrow night through

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.170
Friday.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.300
Very cold air will surge in behind the front
and we do expect light rain or drizzle to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.650
develop within the freezing post-frontal airmass.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.800
Right now, it looks as though freezing rain
may begin late tomorrow night over far northwest

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.980
Oklahoma then slowly spread south and east
as temperatures fall to freezing.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.330
Freezing rain may affect parts of central
Oklahoma by early Friday morning.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.880
The area most likely to see accumulating ice
will be areas north and west of interstate

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.880
44.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.650
Here, ice accumulations of up to a tenth of
an inch are expected.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.920
Freezing rain/drizzle may occur elsewhere,
but accumulations should be limited to a glaze.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.120
Things will begin to dry out by Saturday morning,
but very cold temperatures will remain in

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120
place.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.229
Wind chills will be in the teens both Friday
and Saturday, so make sure to wear extra layers

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.040
if planning on being outdoors for any period
of time!

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.700
But we’re not done just yet, models indicate
another storm system may bring a chance of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.870
wintry weather early next week.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.870
Details are still fuzzy, so it will be important
to follow the forecasts closely over the coming

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.180
days.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.990
Northwest Oklahoma will feel the effects of
the Arctic front first, with temperatures

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.990
plunging during the afternoon.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.799
The cold air will then progress southward
as the front continues to move through.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.720
Gusty winds behind the front will make things
feel even colder and wind chills will fall

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.830
into the teens and 20s through Friday morning.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.290
North winds will continue during the day Friday
with widespread clouds, rain and freezing

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.290
rain.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.069
This will keep high temperatures at or below
freezing over much of northern and western

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.180
Oklahoma, and even south central Oklahoma
will struggle into the 40s.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.409
Lows Friday night should fall below freezing
most places and any accumulated ice will likely

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.299
stay put through Saturday morning.

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.030
So here are the areas we’re most concerned
about.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.980
The areas shaded in light green and light
blue – including northern, western, and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.739
central Oklahoma and western north Texas are
the areas we’re monitoring for ice.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.359
The weather models aren’t on the same page
with potential ice accumulations, but after

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.059
looking through most of the data, we feel
fairly confident that much of northern and

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:04.180
western Oklahoma will see at least some icing
on trees and elevated surfaces.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.379
Ground temperatures should remain at or just
above freezing, so sidewalks and roads should

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:16.480
mostly remain ice-free, though bridges and
overpasses may become slick.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.480
We still feel that ice accumulations will
be a tenth of an inch or less, though higher

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.859
amounts may occur in localized areas.

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.870
Still, given the gusty winds expected on Friday,
even a light coating of ice may result in

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.999
some downed tree limbs and possible power
outages.

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.860
We encourage you to monitor our forecasts
closely.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.459
Things are going to change quite a bit between
now and Friday and you don’t want to be

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.430
caught off guard in the event of a more significant
icing event.
