00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.180
hello

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.969
Today I will play my first game against the computer

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.689
I will be using this

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:17.269
electronic DGT chessboard

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.380
with very special

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.070
BCE

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.480
Stage 1

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.589
Pitch Black

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.339
DGT equipped

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:29.589
Eastern

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.420
chessmen.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.930
This is a king.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.140
he is The Man in the chess game.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.860
He is the one everybody is after.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.370
Look how beautifull they are!

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.370
Look how sleek and modern!

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.790
Look how stable

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.930
the pieces are.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.670
This

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.350
is the queen.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.390
The king and queen are lovers.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.460
They wear

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.930
similar clothes.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.190
They are a mighty pair.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.450
Without his queen

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.630
the king

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.630
is often lost.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.170
The software on the computer

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.520
already knows we are starting a new game.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.119
The bishop is a sneaky bastard.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.830
He can only move

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.710
on his color

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.880
of the fields. So, let's play

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.760
e4 - c5

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.030
This is a Sicilian!

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.700
The "boing"

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.100
is telling me

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.000
that the position

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.490
is correct.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.180
They like to operate in pairs,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.839
these sneaky little bastards.

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.299
(Pawn b6) - And their computer replies

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.259
with the move

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.749
ofpawn to d6.

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.719
The "bing"

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.779
tells me that the position

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.569
is synchronized.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.919
This is the knight.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.099
The knight

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.869
is a mighty beast.

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.709
It is mightier than the bishop

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.629
when the bishop is alone.

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.689
That is why

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.090
he is a little heftier,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.479
a little bigger, a little heavier than the bishop.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.129
Now I play

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.809
another pawn move!

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.559
(Pawn takes d4.)

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.509
he says,

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:06.899
so i have to match the position on the
board to the position on the screen.

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:08.639
"Bing,"

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.659
he says,

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.469
everything is fine.

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.509
A bishop on the other hand

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.690
is a kind

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.289
of a sneaky sharpshooter.

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.179
He can shoot

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.759
very precisely

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.480
over the whole chess diagonal.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.930
Now I take back this

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.909
black

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.119
dark pawn.

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:33.609
(Knight f6.)

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.029
What???

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:38.279
Knight to f6?

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:42.430
How very computerish move!

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.659
He is attacking my pawn.

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.449
But

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.679
I do not want to give this pawn

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.279
to this black dark

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:54.419
knight.

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.549
I defend my pawn! (Knight c6.)

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.129
What is this?

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.019
Another knight?

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.499
First from the right, now from the left?

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.559
M'kay!

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.139
He is attacking my knight.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.659
This is the rook.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.739
This is the heavy piece.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.000
Very powerful,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.079
but very

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.860
heavy.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.979
The rook

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.749
is like a tank.

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:29.039
It moves slowly,

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.699
but crushes everything

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.900
that is in it's way.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.889
Maybe

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.289
I can pin this knight

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.349
to the king.

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.360
But it is now wise to move

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.350
a piece twice

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.050
when opening.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.999
So

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.569
maybe a better idea is

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.479
to defend this knight

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.809
and at the same time develop a piece.

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:04.989
Now he's thinking!

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:06.300
Ha, ha, ha, 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.810
now he's

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.360
thinking!

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.840
Rooks

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.419
are very powerful

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.570
and very

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.020
valuable,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.520
like any

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.499
weapon in the Russian army.

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.569
A tank

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.059
is millions of dollars

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.169
and so

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.110
is the rook.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.169
Is it pondering

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.699
the meaning of life?

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.360
We will have

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.290
to wait

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.930
for the answer.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.459
This one

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.209
has a king's mark.

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:52.020
This is because

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.949
in the old American

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.519
notation

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:56.619
they used

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.330
too mark

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.599
the king's rook

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.240
and the king's

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.869
knight

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.299
with a small crown

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:09.539
so that you know

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.810
which rook

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.779
started the game

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:14.330
on the king's side

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.770
and which one on the queen's side.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.860
(b5)

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.399
Pawn to b5?

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:26.119
This is what you come up with?

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.870
This is ridiculous!

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.910
And this

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.249
is the most interesting piece of them all.

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.759
It is a simple pawn.

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.690
A simple peasant.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.650
But, ...

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.059
The peasant is small

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:51.419
and puny only when alone.

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.990
When the peasants gang up

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.159
and start marching towards the
king

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.710
and the royal family,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.580
they can start a revolution.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.330
Forward!

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.249
But I'm afraid this knight will be pushed away

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.779
by this tricky pawn.

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.749
... and they become very powerful

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:21.960
when they support each other,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.669
when they care for each other,

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.589
when they love each other,

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:31.759
and when they sacrifice

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.699
for each other.
