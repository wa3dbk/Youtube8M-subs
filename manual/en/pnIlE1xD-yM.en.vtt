Science Out Loud.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.710
So if I take this box and just
obliterate it in the corner

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.160
right here and then
put it in the water,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.250
the weight of the water rushing
in will cause the box to sink.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:29.390
If I take this box
and do the same thing,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.070
it tips over a little
bit, but it still floats.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.630
This box uses the
same kind of design

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.560
that naval architects use
to prevent ships 1,000

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.940
times bigger from sinking.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.660
What's so special
about this box that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.201
prevents it from sinking, even
with the big hole in its side?

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.794
Let's talk about why ships
sink in the first place.

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:53.210
You probably know
that things will

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.168
float in water if they're
less dense than water

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:56.705
and sink if they're more dense.

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:58.330
The metal that this
ship is made out of

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.562
is way more dense than water, so
you might think it would sink.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.020
But that metal is
shaped so that it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.660
traps a lot of air, which
is less dense than water,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.560
inside it.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.490
So the average density
of the hull of the ship

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.650
is actually much lower than that
of water, so the ship floats.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.180
But if the hull springs a
leak and fills up with water,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.780
there's no more air to lower
the average density of the hull,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.620
so the ship sinks.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.040
The design of this box basically
prevents too much water

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.520
from getting into it.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.430
This box's hull was divided up
into watertight compartments

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.340
with these walls
called bulkheads.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.290
So when I made a
hole right here,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.530
only this compartment
filled up with water.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.205
The rest stayed dry and were
able to keep the box afloat.

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:41.800
This box is subdivided,
and so is this ship.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.040
Say this ship is divided into
ten watertight compartments.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.830
If one area of this
ship got damaged,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.150
only that compartment
would flood, but not any

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.240
of the others.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.760
The added weight
of the water here

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.920
would cause the ship
to tip over a little,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.031
to be angled or
trimmed in the water,

00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:58.030
but it wouldn't completely
sink, and could still

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.100
be taken to a port for repairs.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.950
So even with subdivision,
why do ships still sink?

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.000
Well, it's impractical
and expensive

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.660
to design an unsinkable
ship, especially

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.560
because most of the
time, ships just

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.320
don't see that much damage.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.070
What naval architects
do now is try

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.530
to predict what kind of damage
is most likely to happen

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.040
when designing a ship.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.180
Now, ships are more
complicated than this box.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.090
Naval architects have
to think about where

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.860
to subdivide the ship,
the shape of the hull,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.780
and equipment that goes
into the compartments.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.530
We don't know when people
first start subdividing ships,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.180
but the caps of
Chinese trade ships

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.227
as far back as the
fifth century indicate

00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:40.060
that water would be
able to enter the vessel

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.650
without causing it to sink.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.310
It's pretty crazy that
technology that existed so long

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.480
ago is still being used today.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.090
Hello, I'm Paul.
