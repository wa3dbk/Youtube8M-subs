00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.950
Welcome.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.950
This is Jennifer McGuire.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.120
Today I have a product release close-up video
for you.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.580
I do this whenever I see a new release from
a company that I think is really dynamite.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.969
I share with you the products and some ideas
for using them.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.600
Today I'm focusing on the new Essentials by
Ellen release.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.960
These products are available at ellenhudson.com
and they were designed by my friend Julie

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.240
Ebersole and they are fantastic.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.880
My favorite of the whole collection is the
Bohemian Garden.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.870
I actually have a video using this set and
I'll link to that here.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.759
Now you could use this for so many things.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.860
I look forward to stamping it with a light
ink and tracing it so that it looks like I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.730
drew these myself, so you could trace it with
markers or you could trace it for watercolor.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.490
You could also white heat emboss this along
a background and add some watercolor over

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.740
it for fun resist.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.040
Or you could stamp these and clear heat emboss
them and then add foil over it and run it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.149
through a laminator, so you can get some beautiful,
they look like hand drawn foil images.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.450
This is one of those sets that could be used
for so many different things and so many different

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.540
occasions.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.450
Now there is a die set that coordinates with
this.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.049
So you can cut out all of these images.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.130
I'm going take that and store that in the
back of my stamp set so that they're always

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.469
together.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.240
This stamp set you'll be seeing me use a lot.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
They also have the Wild Garden die set.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.369
These have the same kind of design and feel
as the stamp set, so you could use them together

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.369
if you want.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.659
I think it would be beautiful to just watercolor
some card stock.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.189
Some water color card stock, just in a mix
of colors, and then die cut a bunch of these

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.819
flowers from the watercolor paper.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.249
So you would have soft colored die cuts that
you could add to a simple white card.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.249
I also think these would also look nice with
foiling.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.640
Next up we have Mondo Magnolia.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.289
This is a giant flower.

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:55.039
Now I love to take flowers that are this big
white heat emboss them on water color paper

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.130
add a ton of distress and make it really messy.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.290
Then spray it like crazy with water and just
let all the ink blend together.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.560
You could make the flower big as you see here,
or you could cut out the smaller flower that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.179
you see in the middle and have a smaller flower
too.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.349
Now the sentiments on this set are also fantastic.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.200
The hello is nice and basic.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.909
Have a beautiful day and you are my person
is just a playful sentiment.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.909
There is a coordinating die set and I like
that it cuts out all three layers of the flower,

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.930
so that you can layer this up on a card and
get some fun dimension.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.900
This large image, which isn't duper detailed
is perfect to practice any coloring techniques

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.090
you may want to try.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.310
I think it'd be great for water color.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.659
By the way all of these Ellen products come
in these durable sleeves that you see here.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.880
This is how they come when you order them.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.680
Next up we have the Amazing Women stamp set.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.720
There are sentiments for Mom, Friend, Daughter,
Grandmother and so on and so forth.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.379
But there are also sentiments that could be
used for just about anybody.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.500
Like I don't know what I would do without
you or You're in a class all by yourself.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.430
A lot of wonderful sentiments that go on the
inside of a card too.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.930
I love how these sentiments are so detailed
and so fine print.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.549
It really looks elegant when you stamp them.

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.590
Next we have the Twelve Days Companion Greetings
set, which you see on the left.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.510
Now back in December when Julie did her first
release she did this Twelve Days Stamp set

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.510
on the right.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.069
Which is meant for Christmas cards or Holiday
cards.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.959
Now these images though would work for other
occasions.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.659
So she was brilliant and came out with a companion
greeting set that works with these on non-holiday

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.030
cards.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.560
Like thereâ€™s You're a good egg and you could
stamp with the egg image.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.490
There's Miss Shoe with the shoes images or
Just Chicken In to go with the chicken image.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.349
Lots of clever things that you can use this
stamp set on the left with the stamp set on

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.349
the right.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.120
Getting more use out of the holiday set.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.590
These are great for those simple cards where
you just stamp the image, do some coloring

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.050
and then just stamp the simple sentiment under
it.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.560
I love clever little greetings like this and
Julie nailed it with this set.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.999
Now these sentiments you could probably use
with a lot of images that you may already

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.999
have.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.999
There are some basic greetings.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.580
Like Happy Mother's Day in there also.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.519
Now we have the Be You Tiful die.

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.850
This is very unique.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.100
I love how the word You is in the center.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.540
It's a very intricate die.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.500
This is a good one to maybe die cut from some
glitter paper and keep the focal point of

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.810
a card.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.810
So there you have it.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.470
