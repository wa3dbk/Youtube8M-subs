00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.440
PLAN IT
Good planning gets you the most
out of your kitchen.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.480
Here are a few simple things
to think about.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.040
You should be able to move easily
between cooking area-

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.960
-the fridge and the sink.
This is called the working triangle.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
The kitchen shape is usually dictated
by the shape of the room-

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.720
-but that doesn't mean that your new
kitchen has to be the same shape.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.760
A few layout options:

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.600
A line kitchen is good for small
kitchens, but not for bigger rooms.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.200
You can add an island,
which not only gives more storage-

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.600
-but can also be a serving area,
a hang-out and a room divider.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.040
An L-shaped kitchen
creates a good working triangle-

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.640
-and gives lots of storage space.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.520
A U-shaped kitchen gives loads
of storage and worktop space-

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.680
-but requires a big room.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.880
A parallel kitchen gives you
two workstations on opposite walls.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.280
It doesn't need much space, and
works well with a door at the end.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.480
Space on both sides of the hob gives
you somewhere to put hot pans.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.760
If you're short on space, prioritise
the space between sink and hob.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.520
In a parallel kitchen, make sure
there's room for two people to work.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.600
A distance of 120 cm lets you open
doors on both sides at the same time.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.480
Make sure cabinets won't block
the view over the counter tops.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.320
Follow the manufacturer's
recommendation-

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.040
-when it comes
to the height of the fan.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.960
Placing oven at eye-level means less
bending, and the kids can't reach it.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.960
Counter space beside the oven
gives you somewhere to put hot trays.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.760
Keep utensils, pots and pans close
to the hob, so they're within reach.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.000
Storing glasses, cutlery and
porcelain close to the dishwasher-

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.040
-will make loading
and unloading easier.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.640
Leave space for a filler piece
between cabinet and wall-

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.240
-so the door can be fully opened.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.080
Especially important
if you have pull-out wire baskets.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.520
Some things to avoid: Putting oven
or dishwasher in a corner-

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.440
-will block adjacent drawers
and cabinets.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.200
Placing a sink next to a wall
will disrupt your workflow.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.320
Placing the oven next to a wall
will expose the wall to heat.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.840
Drawers in a corner
will block the adjoining cabinet-

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400
-and may damage its doors or handle.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.760
Seem like a lot to think about?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.680
The on-line Kitchen planner will
help, and when you place your order-

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.240
-a consultant will go through
your design with you-

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.040
-so you not only get
a great looking kitchen-

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.560
-but one that works really well too.
