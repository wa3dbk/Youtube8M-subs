00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:03.347
Okay, what are we making today?

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:10.075
Assalamu Alaikum. Today, we are making Spicy Baked 
 Chicken and we'll you how it's done.

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:24.287
Now, I'm getting my spices out.
I have all the spices here in this tray.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:37.707
We have four tablespoon of Yogurt.
Whisk it!

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:43.236
Now I will add all these spices in the yogurt.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now I will add Chill in the yogurt. One teaspoon of Chill.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
One teaspoon of Curry Powder.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:14.133
Half-Teaspoon of Turmeric

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is Ginger Powder. Half-Teaspoon of Ginger Powder.

00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:26.863
Half-tsp of Garlic powder.

00:01:26.283 --> 00:01:33.283
And Half-tsp of black pepper.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:43.580
And 1 tsp of dried fenugreek leaves.

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:54.030
And half-tsp of gram masala-ground

00:01:54.707 --> 00:01:59.710
Half-tsp of Salt

00:02:00.784 --> 00:02:06.780
Green Coriander-cut

00:02:08.155 --> 00:02:14.160
I'm mixing it and will marinate the chicken afterwards.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.790
Now I will squeeze all the juice from half of a lemon.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:33.600
Mix well and will marinate the chicken.
And will 
 set aside the chicken for an hour.

00:02:33.892 --> 00:02:45.290
I have one pound of chicken. Chicken legs and thighs.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:55.900
I will add Vinegar. So the smell of the chicken is reduced.

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:11.920
I left some of the fat so when its 
 cooked, chicken will be cruspy and not dry.

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:29.120
Put the masala on the chicken and marinate.

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:56.550
Massage the chicken. The masala should go in the cuts.

00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:23.440
Set aside for an hour. After that I will put it in the oven.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:25.260
You can hear my AC.

00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:35.600
First I will add about one cup of water on the bottom tray.

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:53.600
That's because when the jucie goes down to the bottom tray from the grilling tray, 
 it will not burn the bottom tray and there will not be any smoke.

00:04:53.593 --> 00:05:05.590
Now I will place the chicken on the grilling tray.
