Warning: Hydrochloric acid is corrosive and copper salts are toxic in large doses. Wear gloves when handling it.

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:11.671
Greetings fellow nerds.

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:16.932
I’ve gotten a lot of requests for this so in this video we’re going to make copper chloride.

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:22.351
A useful chemical to etch copper clad printed circuit boards. And i’ll show three ways of doing it.

00:00:22.386 --> 00:00:28.337
The absolute simplest but slowest method is to get some copper metal and cover it with hydrochloric acid.

00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:29.820
Then bubble air through it.

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:36.689
What’s happening is the oxygen in the air is reacting with the copper and hydrochloric acid to produce copper chloride.

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:41.869
The problem with this method is that it’s very slow and takes a few days to start up.

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:47.213
It gets faster once there is a lot of copper in solution but even then you need to be patient.

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:51.177
A second way which is much faster is to get some copper.

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:59.795
I’m using about 30 grams. Add some hydrochloric acid to cover it and then add an equal volume of 3%-6% hydrogen peroxide.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.642
In this case i’m using 200 ml for both. Stirring also helps to react the copper.

00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:12.434
What’s happening is the hydrogen peroxide directly oxidizes the copper and reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce copper chloride.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.306
This is much faster and just takes a couple of hours to finish.

00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:21.714
The third way is for those of you that don’t mind some sulfate contamination in your copper chloride.

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:28.922
First start with copper sulfate and just keep adding hydrochloric acid with stirring until all the copper sulfate dissolves.

00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:35.154
Be sure to give it some time between hydrochloric acid additions as copper sulfate can dissolve very slowly.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:46.762
Anyway, while this solution of copper chloride also contains sulfate ions, it can still be used for PCB etching and gold recovery procedures as the sulfate ions do not interfere in those cases.

00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:53.347
So this can be a very convenient method to get the benefits of copper chloride if all you have is copper sulfate and hydrochloric acid.

00:01:53.382 --> 00:02:00.467
Now however you make your copper chloride, you can test its potency by dipping a piece of copper clad printed circuit board.

00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:04.963
If the board etches clean, then you’ve successfully made copper (II) chloride.

00:02:04.998 --> 00:02:10.362
If it doesn’t you might have large amounts of copper (I) chloride or simply not enough copper at all.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:13.706
Try reacting it with more air or hydrogen peroxide.

00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.617
Anyway, that’s how you make copper chloride.

00:02:17.652 --> 00:02:19.179
Thanks for watching.
