00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
As children, we dream of having super powers,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
like the ability to fly or to control things with our mind.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Soon, some of our fantasies will become a reality

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with new technology like Emotiv EPOC.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This wireless headset, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which uses Brain Computer Interface technology, 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
can interpret electric brain signals with sensors. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The headset can detect three levels of emotions, 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and allows the wearer to control video games 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
just by thinking about certain actions. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Moving objects and controlling computers 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with nothing more than a thought is finally possible. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The possibilities for this technology are endless. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
See for yourself. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm warning you,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
you're entering a big error.
17
0:00:45 --&gt; 0:00;47
I'm going to have to put you on the game grid.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
My name is David Freidman,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I wrote the cover story about Emotiv,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
for the December issue of Inc. Magazine.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Emotiv is a company that makes a 300 dollar mind-reading headset.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, a mind-reading headset, that sounds kind of silly,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
or at least it did to me when I first heard about it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It turns out that physically there's not a lot to the headset;

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
it's slightly more elaborate than a basic phone headset,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
it looks a little bit almost like a scaled down bicycle helmet.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And as I tried it, I sort of felt a little bit like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I was in a science fiction film.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And in fact, the co-founder of the company,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Tan Le, told me that when she was a little girl

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Star Wars made a huge impression on her,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and she went around trying to conjure up the force

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to try to move objects around her.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Use the force, Luke!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Looking back on science fiction movies and books,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
often even looking hundreds or even thousands of years into the future,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
a lot of stories don't even believe we'll have brain-reading devices.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I mean, if you think about Star Trek, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
they have teleportation, but for the most part,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
they don't have mind-reading technology,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
except for the Vulcan mind melt.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The way that Emotiv has created its detection suites

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
is based on the way in which humans interact with each other.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So we have three categories of detections, 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which we call detection suites,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and they are expressive, affective, and cognitive.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Expression is all about facial expressions,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
affective is about understanding your emotional experience,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and cognitive is really getting to one of human's longest and oldest fantasies,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which is all about being able to control objects,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
just by thinking about it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Well, I tried it out,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and it's kind of odd when you're trying to concentrate,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and have something happen on the screen.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You can see the rock going in the air,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and you can see the screen turning orange with  

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the more intense focus of my effort.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Getting yourself to think your way 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
into doing something is 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
not really a skill you naturally have.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You have to let it all go, Neo.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Fear, doubt,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and disbelief.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Free your mind.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But of course the device is pretty limited right now

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
in what it lets you control.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It starts off only by letting you control stuff in a video game,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and that's what the first version is aimed at.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But I'm kind of excited about what the headset is going 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to allow you to control in the future.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Have you tried this?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I've tried it!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Thanks, it's great.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
There are obviously tremendous possible applications 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
for disabled people, and people who can't move

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
some or all of their body,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
being able to control things just by thinking about them.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It's got a hell of a grip.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It's 400 foot pounds, 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
it could crush every bone in your hand.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
All right, attach it to his shoulder.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We hooked it up to our electric wheelchair,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and I'm controlling the wheelchair using my blinks and a smile.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now blink right to go right.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And it's already being used for market research;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
instead of asking people in a focus group or in a audience

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
what it is they're thinking or feeling,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you could just record their emotions.
89
0:04:28 --&gt; 0:03:31
And in fact, the idea of actually registering and recording emotions

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
is something that's really missing from high-tech.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We can communicate all kinds of things,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
but emotion tends to be cut out of most high-tech devices.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Even when we're online, 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
if you want someone to know how you're feeling,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
you generally have to type it out to them.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We've always had to give a command to a machine,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
or a series of commands, 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
for it to do anything for us,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but when we look at the communication between people,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
it's actually far more interesting 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
because we take into account far more than what is 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
explicitly expressed: we look at facial expressions,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
we read body language,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.733
and we intuit emotions and feelings into our dialogue with one aonther.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And so, our vision at Emotiv for the next generation of human-machine interface,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is that it will have evolved beyond the conscious interface that exists today,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and non-conscious inputs will play a really big part.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Research for brain-computer interface starting in 1970

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
at the University of California in Los Angeles.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Forty years later,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
scientists are using this technology to develop neuro-prosthetics 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
for people with poor eyesight or hearing

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
As it is applied here,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
software engineers are using brain-computer interface for video game headsets

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that allow you to control the game with your brain.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And soon, we will all be able to live the fantasies 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
of our favorite science-fiction movies.
