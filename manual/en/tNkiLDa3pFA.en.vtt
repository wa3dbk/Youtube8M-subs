Hi, I'm Holly Clegg

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.010
welcome to my trim and terrific kitchen.  Wow, do I have a recipe for y'all today

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.330
I would say this is probably the most

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.490
popular talked about recipe in all my
cookbooks

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.710
that have made.  It's a king cake but
it's so simple to make you know we in

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.490
louisiana love king cake

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.680
and you could by them but I have had people from all over say

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.539
this is the best can take that pat I
think it because it's the easiest king cake

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:28.910
 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.000
another one my recipes with less than 10 ingredients

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.590
you start with reduced fat crescent rolls

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.899
and just separate him and make the rolls
into triangles and you always want to put

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:38.250
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.960
your point inward and then spread the crescent rolls round.  

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.380
You can start to push it together in the middle

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.739
I have already done it to show you.  

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.920
This is just a mixture of powdered sugar and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.180
little milk and cream cheese to give it
that good rich

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.730
flavor.  Okay I'm just doing it quickly to
show you.  This is a mixture brown sugar

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.789
and cinnamon I like to glop it all around 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.449
It will spread when it bakes

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.960
and this is tricky to made if you haven't it seen it so that's why I wanted to show it to you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.280
So, now

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.860
do what you want to do is pull the ends together and it forms la king cake

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.890
 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.289
and you could do this on

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.759
for breakfast you could do it for
football games you could pretty much do

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.490
it any time a year but  

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.840
you know around Mardi Gras it becomes a
focal point now

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.000
you want to bake it at 350 just for
about 15-20 minutes until it gets brown

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.179
you have to let it cool completely and
here is our finished king cake

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.360
now you have to do your different colors
here we have yellow

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.640
purple and the purple is red and blue.  R

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.049
Remember, we went to school for a reason and I'm going to do a little extra green on top

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.209
but think about this appear during
football season do your favorite
