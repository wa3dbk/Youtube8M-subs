CHEESE PANCAKES WITH FRIED ONION

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:17.624
"On Shrovetide pancakes flew out of the oven!.."

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.900
Hello! I am was always glad to welcome you at my kitchen!

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.054
It's time for Shrovetide, and I decided to cook cheese pancakes with fried onion.

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:33.300
First fry the onions.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.815
Take the mill and grind the onions in it.

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:44.741
Cut and lay into the mill.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.900
The blade will not be needed.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.000
Mill at the first speed.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.500
The onions are milled.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.615
Shift it to the bowl.

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:29.900
Here it will have to wait its turn.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.014
The main thing is not to cry ;)

00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:39.000
In my opinion, I'm going to cry.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.593
Set aside the onions away from the eyes.

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:44.900
Will prepare the dough.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.796
Take whisking container and break here 5 eggs.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.674
Lots of eggs. This one is the last.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.300
Add a little salt.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.734
Enough.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.302
Add sugar.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.355
Put a blade on the mixer.

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:46.800
Stir.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.000
Add here a little milk.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.435
Stir.

00:03:07.435 --> 00:03:15.974
Add the flour and make dough density such as that of sour cream.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.900
Stir and add a little more flour.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.127
Pour batter into a bowl. It turned out such a density as sour cream.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.714
The batter can be kneaded in a deep saucepan.

00:03:56.714 --> 00:04:02.400
Can be prepared in one container, so you will not pour it into the bowl.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.194
Then you will not have to wash the extra dishes.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:17.300
Grate the cheese on a fine grater to the batter, as we have cheese pancakes.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.794
Add baking soda to the dough and mix.

00:04:27.794 --> 00:04:32.654
It turns out the cheese dough.

00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:37.334
It is still too thick for baking pancakes.

00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:43.314
It will be necessary to dilute with the milk to desired consistency.

00:04:43.314 --> 00:04:51.200
Add milk. Then you can add the flour for more number of pancakes.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.300
On a heated pan pour a little vegetable oil.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.300
Take a spoon of onions.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.494
Lightly fry about 10 seconds.

00:05:20.494 --> 00:05:25.308
Over medium heat.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:40.200
Take the batter and pour into the pan, how you do the usual pancakes.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.394
Our fried onions remain in the middle.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.300
Overturn the pancake to the other side.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.000
Fry its second side.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.274
Pancake is ready.

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:16.200
On the second side it also browned.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.000
Shift it on a plate and continue to cook the remaining pancakes.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.714
Also add a little oil to lightly fry the onion.

00:06:24.714 --> 00:06:29.000
Tablespoon of onions.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.163
Fry just a few seconds.

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:43.300
Pour the batter.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.100
"Great Pancake Week, We rejoice with you, ride on the snow slides and overeat pancakes!"

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.154
Bon Appetite!

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.000
