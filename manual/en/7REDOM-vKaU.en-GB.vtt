00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.269
This is the fourth-generation Honda CR-V and
as part of its 2015 mid-life refresh Honda

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.250
has made a host of tweaks. These include a
new front-grille, a better infotainment set-up

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.290
and – the main attraction, a new high-powered
1.6-litre diesel, unique to Europe, along

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.079
with a new nine-speed automatic transmission.
Now, Honda has said that it aims to challenge

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.530
models like the BMW X3, Audi Q3 and Volvo
XC60 with its latest CR-V incarnation, so

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.900
it will be interesting to see how its interior
luxury and practicality compare.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.820
Following the success of the 118bhp 1.6-litre
diesel in the last CR-V model, Honda decided

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.260
to introduce a higher output of the 1.6-litre
with 158bhp, and this replaces the previously

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.920
available 2.2-litre diesel.
This new 158bhp 1.6-litre, which is only available

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.760
in 4WD and is expected to be the most popular
derivative, sprints from 0-62mph in 10.6 seconds

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:21.960
and our model emits 139g/km and returns a
combined 55.3mpg. These figures aren’t massively

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.750
impressive, however Honda claims that they
make for an “unrivalled power to consumption

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.400
ratio”. The lower powered 2WD 118bhp 1.6-litre
diesel is still available however, emitting

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.030
just 115g/km. A 153bhp 2.0-litre petrol is
also available.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.570
Although a smooth shifting six-speed manual
gearbox is on offer, it’s the new nine-speed

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.340
automatic that is grabbing headlines. The
reason for this is because of its two-stage

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.640
turbo, which makes it more efficient and allows
steady acceleration throughout the gears,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.080
as opposed to a regular turbo that tends to
give you a single boost of acceleration. And

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.330
hats off to Honda, it really does work.
Honda has actively looked at cabin insulation

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.450
by adding the likes of thicker door seals,
but the diesel still sounds noisy. Comfort

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.700
and assurance is still good all-round, with
a suspension set-up that is not too stiff

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.840
or soggy and well-weighted and responsive
steering. But it doesn’t offer the same

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:27.340
engagement as a BMW.
In an attempt to offer that luxury feel of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.640
its competitors, Honda has added loads of
new soft touch materials about the place,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.730
but scratchy plastics are still quite prominent.
The seats on the other hand are top notch,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.860
with great back support, adjustment and head
rests that are more like pillows. These seats

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.620
also give you a great, superior, high-riding
position.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.420
Those who know the previous CR-V well will
quickly notice the improvements to the infotainment

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.700
system, as this new 7-inch Honda Connect display
gets rid of its numerous buttons. This touchscreen

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.190
also has a Garmin sat-nav with new smartphone-inspired
swipe and pinch feature. This goes hand-in-hand

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.790
with its MirrorLink functionality, allowing
for wi-fi tethering, again giving a more modern,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.080
user-friendly feel. This system is standard
on our flagship EX model but optional on all

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.370
others.
There are a host of safety enhancements as

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.129
well, the halo feature being a new Intelligent
Adaptive Cruise Control, which can predict

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.920
if someone is going to cut in front of you
in traffic.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.349
In terms of overall practicality in the cabin,
storage compartments are aplenty, with clever

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.800
things like these shelves on the doors. Visibility
wise, the large wing mirrors and windscreen

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.480
and relatively skinny A pillars mean it’s
very good, but the C pillars seem unnecessarily

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.750
chunky and as a result, obstruct rear visibility.
Rear practicality couldn’t really be any

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.819
better in the CR-V, with tons of head room
and leg room, even if your front passenger

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.099
over indulges with their own leg room. The
likes of no transmission tunnel and an arm

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:07.400
rest with cup holders are also nice features.
Now, on to the boot and Honda’s renowned

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.180
‘Magic seats’.
The boot offers a very handy 589 litres, which

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.299
is more than the Volvo XC60 and Audi Q3, and
also has a low loading level – but its party

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.330
trick is revealed when you pull this lever,
folding the seats down and the headrests away.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:33.130
And this allows for a flat loading surface
and up to 1,669 litres of space.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.310
The CR-V definitely has impressive family-friendly
credentials, but Honda may be aiming a little

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.060
high when it comes to competition. So instead
of BMW, Volvo or Audi, think Nissan, Kia and

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.260
Volkswagen.
