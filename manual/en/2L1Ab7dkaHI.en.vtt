Hey this is DJ Brady again on behalf of ExpertVillage.com.
In this clip, we’ll be connecting your system.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.000
For all intense and purposes, most of systems
will connect the same, but for this demonstration,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.760
I’m going to use a tabletop system because
the connections are on the back and easy to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.809
get to. We’ll start by connecting the cd
player to the mixer, as you can see on the

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.080
back of the mixer, you’ve got your RCA inputs
for the cd player and the XLR outputs to go

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:54.870
to the amplifier. Right for red, color coordinated,
make your connections from the outside of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.900
the cd player to the input of channel one.
I connected the cd player into the cd input

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:20.240
of channel one. Now we’re going to hook
up the second cd player

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:30.570
into channel two cd input.
Now that you have your cd players connected,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.880
let’s connect the amplifier. Since we’re
using the professional grade amplifier, we’re

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.000
going to use the balanced XLR output, I’m
only using one channel because we’re going

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.770
to be running in mile. If you’re using a
home stereo or consumer amplifier you may

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.260
want to use the RCA outputs. Now let’s connect
the mixer to amplifier, you want to make sure

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.870
that before you make your connections, that
your gains are down and your power switch

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.940
is off on the amplifier.
Since we used XLR output from the mixer, we’re

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.530
going to use XLR input on the amplifier. Now
we’re going to connect the speaker. This

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.700
amplifier uses a banana plug, as you can see
there’s a notch on one side of the plug,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.140
that denotes negative polarity. We’re going
to connect the negative to the black, make

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.310
sure it’s snug and also make sure that you’re
using output one from input one of the amplifier.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.480
Now we’re going to connect the speaker.
We’re using a speak on connector and since

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.480
this speaker has an internal crossover network
allowing output to a subwoofer, make sure

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.590
you put in to the input. Now that your system
is connected, make sure all your levels are

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.060
down and plug in your power.
