00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.110
Hi, I am Ed Kramarcik, PBA member and AMF
staff player since 1989, and I am going to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.980
go over proper delivery and follow through,
where people make a lot of mistakes, and I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
am going to show you how you could prevent
from making those mistakes. If you have any

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.460
questions after I go over this, you can visit
me at my pro shop in Longwood-Orlando at Rip

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.260
the Rack Pro Shop, or visit me online at www.riptherackbowling.com.
What I am going to explain today is a full

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
follow through. Follow through – if you
follow through correctly—you will not have

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.370
problems with pushing the ball or tugging
the ball; on a PBA tour, we call it chicken

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.129
winging, where people throw their shoulders
out, the elbows out, and the ball goes out

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.170
to the channel and never makes it back to
the pocket and never makes the corner. When

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.200
you are locking your elbow, to the waist side,
you can follow through properly, you will

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.160
be successful, and you will always have the
play area. So you want to make sure when you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.910
go out and bowl that you want to follow through.
And follow through means, just like shaking

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.270
hands, you reach out and shake hands. Your
hand is like a steering wheel, and whatever

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.570
you do with the ball that is where the ball
is going to go. So you want to make sure that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.210
you always have control of the ball; and wherever
you turn your hand, that is where the ball

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.461
is going to go. And let me demo it for you;
without the bowling ball, I am going to show

00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:26.649
you the correct way and the incorrect way
of follow through. The correct way of doing

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.270
it is, when you get on a lane and you get
set up to practice, and you want to follow

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.659
through correctly, you set up; and make sure—if
you are a right-hand bowler—make sure your

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.719
elbow is tucked in to the side, and if you
are a left-hand bowler the same thing: it

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.560
is just a mirror image. We are going to do
it with a right-hand bowler today. If you

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.260
hold the ball, lock your elbow in, and you
are going to reach out on the lane. So what

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.540
you are going to do is set up; when you hit
the lane, to follow through you, when you

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.750
plant your left foot, you are going to go
through the shot, elbows locked, shoulders

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.530
are square, go though the ball and stay straight.
And this is the correct way of following through

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.230
on a shot; a lot of people will come and they’ll
short on the ball. On “short on” what

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.720
I am saying is, they will get to the foul
line and they will short on it and stop right

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.840
here; when you stop right here the ball is
rolling off your hand immediately. If the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.410
lane is dry, the ball is going to be hooking
immediately, you are going to most likely

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.890
throw a gutter. So you want to follow through,
reach out like you are shaking hands and follow

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.620
through on a shot. Another problem that a
lot of beginners have is they come out and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.239
bowl, and they get fast to the line with their
feet, they get up there quick and they will

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.709
swing their arm away from their body. On a
PBA tour, we call that chicken winging the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.200
ball, you want to make sure that that elbow
is locked in and that you can have a firm

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.099
release on the ball and go straight through
it. So you want to make sure that you lock

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.440
the elbow and follow through with the shot;
do not chicken wing the ball, because if you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.690
have the ball in your hand, chicken wing it
here, the ball is out to the channel. Remember

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.239
that I told you that your hand is like a steering
wheel, so if you turn your hand out, the ball

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.260
is going to go out to the channel and not
come back. Most likely, it is going to be

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.580
in the gutter, which is called the channel.
So to follow through, just like shaking hands,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.000
reach out, follow through the lane, and be
square at the line and you will score a big

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.980
score. Good luck and good bowling.
