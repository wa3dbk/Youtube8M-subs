Hello. This is Martin Shervington, and in
this video we're going to look at a 3-step

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.689
process to using Google Hangouts and Google
Drive in order to collaborate.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:37.300
The first step is to go to your hangouts and
start a new hangout. If you click in the box,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.370
you can then for instance invite people who
you have in a circle that are members of your

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.890
team.
That will then bring up a box. And if you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.170
type messages to people within that hangout,
then they're all going to receive that message.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.640
And as you can see in this example, there
are 15 people within this particular hangout.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.820
If you come to the cog, and you click, you'll
see here notifications are switched on. If

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.340
you uncheck the box, it means when people
are chatting, you don't get notified. Also,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.920
you can name the project and that way you
know which hangout relates to which project.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.369
It's important not to leave the hangout if
you want to stay part of that particular collaborative

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.350
team, as you'll need to be invited back into
the hangout in order to join it.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.350
When you're ready, click save on the changes.
Next, let's look at Google Drive. If you take

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.469
the example of a presentation that I want
to work on together with that group, and you

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:48.469
click on the share button, which is the little
+ sign, and then you come across to who has

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.689
access, if you change that to anyone with
a link can edit, and then press save, you

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.630
can then copy the link and return to your
hangout and drop the link into the hangout

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.190
and press return, and everybody who's within
that hangout will be able to collaborate on

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.620
that document.
Also, if you click on the icon that looks

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.410
a little like a camera, that will initiate
a video call with everybody who's within that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.849
hangout, providing they've got their notifications
turned on. And from there, you'll be able

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.730
to take that document using the Google Drive
app, which you can see here in the video call

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.709
aspect of the Google hangout.
And if at any time you need to invite more

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.319
people into the room to collaborate, then
you'll be able to do so by clicking invite

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.659
people and then adding names, circles, or
email addresses.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.909
This is Martin Shervington, and now you know
how to set up a Google Hangout and keep it

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.819
alive so you can work together on projects
using Google Drive.
