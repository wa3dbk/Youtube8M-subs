00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:06.080
Last month, Motorola launched the Moto 360
in the USA. At the time, people complained

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.050
about poor battery life and stuttery performance.
One month and several software updates later,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.830
the 360 has finally launched in the UK. So,
is this the smartwatch that so many have been

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.189
waiting for, or do somewhat outdated internals
make for a disappointing product? My name

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.509
is Stephen Potter, and this is the Moto 360.
The first thing you’ll notice when you receive

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.300
this product is how beautifully designed the
packaging is. It comes in a high quality,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.550
cylindrical box, and is clearly designed to
make you feel like you’re receiving a premium

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.410
product before you even get hands on with
it. And when you finally do get through the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.469
box, you’re left with one of the most beautiful
pieces of technology that I’ve ever seen.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.070
Sure, the 360’s build quality may not be
able to meet up to the standards of high end

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.079
watch users, but it’s far better than the
likes of the LG G Watch and the Gear Live.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.359
The watch is encapsulated by a brushed piece
of stainless steel, with a chrome ringed button

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.161
to the side. Up top, there’s a piece of
chamfered Gorrilla glass 3, which while it

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:02.679
looks great while the device is off, can cause
an ugly aliasing effect, which is particularly

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.780
visible when the screen is displaying a white
image. Regarding the wristband, you’ll either

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.439
have a strap of genuine Horween leather, or
steel links. This is replaceable with a standard

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.180
22mm mount, but you’ll want to be careful
– there’s not much room between the mount

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.640
and the body of the device, meaning some bands
are incompatible. Overall, though, the 360

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.729
does not disappoint in the build department.
Moving on to the hardware. The 360 has a 320x290

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.030
LCD display, making for a slightly disappointing
205 pixels per inch. And yes, it’s not a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.220
complete circle – there’s a small black
bar at the bottom which houses the display

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.060
drivers and ambient light sensor. But, it’s
really not noticeable in general usage, and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.530
I’d rather have this than a thick bezel
running all the way around the device. It

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.799
also uses a slightly outdated Texas Instruments
OMAP 3 processor, with 512MB of RAM, which

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.040
can occasionally cause performance hiccups,
but it’s not as bad as some people would

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.299
have you think. Sure, it’s not always a
jutter free experience, but it didn’t cause

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.079
me that many issues. The battery’s a slightly
small 320mAh unit, which may disappoint some

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.730
compared to the 400mAh one found in the G
Watch, but at least it charges quickly. As

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.670
with all Android Wear devices we’ve seen
so far, the 360 is IP67 waterproof rated (although

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.950
I wouldn’t recommend taking it in the shower
if you choose the leather band). There’s

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.381
also an optical heart rate sensor up back,
which takes readings every five minutes to

00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:20.610
tell you how active you are, and while it’s
not the most accurate thing in the world,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.560
it seems to do its job fairly well. Chances
are its functionality will be built on further

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.070
when Android L and Google Fit properly launch.
Charging is an important part of any smartwatch,

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.380
as you’ll likely doing it every day or two,
and I have to commend Motorola on being the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.120
first people to truly get it right. Motorola’s
charging dock is simple to use, just drop

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.010
the device into it and you’re done, and
perhaps the most important part of it is that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.240
the 360 uses Qi wireless charging, meaning
that if you do loose the cradle it’s not

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.190
the end of the world – any 3rd party Qi
pad will do the job just as well.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.970
The software running on the 360 is the same
as you’ll find on any other Android Wear

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.850
watch. It’s incredibly glanceable, and designed
primarily around the concept of micro interactions.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.581
As a rule of thumb, you’ll have the best
experience with this device if you only use

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:05.610
it for actions that take less than 30 seconds.
Any more than that and you’re probably better

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.130
off just getting out your phone. But that’s
not necessarily a bad thing. Android Wear

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.100
is very good at what it does well, that is,
keeping you connected virtually, without taking

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.670
you out of the moment in the real world. While
there is decent application support out there,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.220
using these will both drain your battery,
and the applications themselves may not be

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.540
the best things in the world to use on such
a small screen.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.140
Speaking of battery life, I’ve found the
360 to be very variable over the time I’ve

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.070
been using it. The first day was pretty rough,
with me being left with about 10% by five

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.400
O’clock, but bear in mind that I was using
it much more than I probably would on a regular

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.030
day due to the “newness” factor. The next
two days I got to 5 O’clock after taking

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.350
it off the charger at 7 in the morning with
around 40% remaining, which is not bad, but

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.652
not that impressive. More recently the battery
life has improved dramatically, with me being

00:03:46.652 --> 00:03:50.370
able to last to around 11 in the evening with
around 50% remaining. All I can really say

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.210
is that your battery life will be heavily
influenced by how much you’re using the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.060
watch. I’d say that I get more notifications
than the average person, but the number I

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.530
receive isn’t the main factor in how quickly
it drains – it’s more down to the amount

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.290
of time you actually spend interacting with
the device.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.960
Finally, Motorola have bundled some of their
own customisations onto the 360. By using

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.220
the “Moto Connect” app on your phone,
you can customise all of the faces which Motorola

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.341
have added to the device. Options include
different coloured accents, backgrounds, and

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:21.789
even custom lettering on select faces. It’s
a nice little feature which can help to make

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.639
the watch feel a little more personal, without
having to go through the hassle of creating

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.099
your own face from scratch, through an app
such as facer.

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.669
The Moto 360 is a tough device to justify
for most people. If it boiled down to pure

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.590
functionality, you’d probably be better
off buying a device like the LG G Watch, which

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.020
costs £50 less. But, in the end wearable
technology is as much about fashion as it

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.629
is about cold, hard specifications, and in
this regard the Moto 360 blows all the competition

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.130
out of the water. It’s a device people will
be happy coming up to you to ask if it’s

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.750
the iWatch (this may have happened a little
more than I’d like), as opposed to being

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.319
something which would cause them to keep a
long distance. Plus, if you’re not using

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.740
it, many people will mistake it for a regular
wristwatch. And I suppose that’s the highest

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.419
praise a smartwatch can gain these days – you
can get all of the benefits of having a device

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.130
that’s never more than a second away, without
being silently judged by all the people surrounding

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.249
you.
