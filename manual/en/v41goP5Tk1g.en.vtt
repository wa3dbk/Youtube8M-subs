00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.629
Great happiness

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.639
We've eliminated a great team like Monterrey

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.689
for being 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.739
superior

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.189
I am thankful to the players

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.060
in this moment of happiness 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.849
I think that 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.730
they deserve credit for 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.419
having a great season 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.800
they've done a great job

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.460
we have the inconvenience of the tie but 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.650
the best thing is that we are in the semifinals and we are enjoying it

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.480
now it's time to rest and get ready for what is to come

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.090
And I think that 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.700
I don't know this team's ceiling and if they've hit a ceiling, 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.730
I don't know that. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.470
I think it can give some more

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.890
That's my illusion that it can give more

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.690
and the net series for sure will 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.030
be different 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.840
and we'll see a different type of game

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.300
I can tell you that today, that's what the game required 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.820
the series asked for that, if we opened up and they beat us with counterattacks 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.240
surely

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.410
we'd regret it along with all the people 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.980
that follow us. 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.800
Yes, I think that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.850
is what we did all tournament with great offensive plays

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.650
while Monterrey came to play

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.320
it was do or die for them but I think our team 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.150
stood well and did good work

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.870
I am very motivated and we close at home

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.410
so, 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.410
we will try and demonstrate why we were the team that allowed the fewest goals this year

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.480
we were the best defense in both tournaments 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.930
we'll see how the game goes

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.360
today and tomorrow we celebrate but come Tuesday 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.120
we'll start talking about the next rival

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.860
a rival that played well all tournament 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.000
and one that deserves to be there

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.030
yes, another 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.790
tough rival and I think 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.990
it will be a complicated rival 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.500
that has a great offense 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.670
but the team is going to work like it has all tournament long 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.600
we are going to go over there and do a good job in Leon and come do a good job here

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.500
next Sunday. 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.140
It will be different to this one 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.870
not all the games are different 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.040
but I don't want to talk about the next game

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.639
it would keep me from enjoying what we have today

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.149
we are in the semifinal

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:17.579
no one bet on us to be a first place team

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.899
they didn't bet on us to reach the semifinals 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.059
I by luck bet something.
