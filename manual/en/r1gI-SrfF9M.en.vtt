00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.020
HTC Flyer.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.610
Expected Q2 2011.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.869
The HTC Flyer is HTC's first full tablet device,
and as you would expect from the company that

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.990
pioneered Android and Windows smartphones..
it isn't a "me too" device that is indistinguishable

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.820
from everyone else.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.329
This is a 7 inch tablet with a 1024 x 600
pixel TFT screen. Inside is a 1.5 GHz single

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.750
core processor coupled with 1GB of RAM. On
the back is a 5 megapixel camera, with a front-facing

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.309
1.3 megapixel camera for video calling. The
HTC Flyer supports both WiFi and cellular

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:54.969
3G and HSPA+ (near 4G) connections, and it
comes with GPS and Bluetooth.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.751
Unlike the recently announced crop of rival
tablets (such as the Motorola XOOM, Samsung

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:06.600
Galaxy Tab 10.1 and LG Optimus Pad), the HTC
Flyer does not ship with Android 3.0 "Honeycomb"

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.020
 - reports suggest that the Flyer will ship
with "version 2.4", a revision of the current

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.030
2.3 "Gingerbread" OS. It might be considered
to be a big deal as Android 2 was not written

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.219
with tablets in mind - but don't worry, because
HTC have added their own software customisations

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.549
and a new "3D style" version of HTC Sense
on top of the operating system which will

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.920
make it easy to use. An upgrade to Android
3.0 is promised, although with the HTC add-ons

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.909
it's not going to be desperately important.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.789
Internal memory is quoted as being 32GB plus
a microSD slot that can take another 32GB

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.400
if you want. The battery is a 4000 mAh cell
which seems about right for a device of this

00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:00.329
size. The HTC Flyer measures 195 x 122 x 13mm
and weighs approximately 415 grams.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:08.570
One unusual feature about the display on the
Flyer is the inclusion of a stylus.. we haven't

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.080
seen those on most tablets for a while, but
HTC's active stylus allows for much greater

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.370
control when handwriting or doing other precise
tasks. Of course, most functions will work

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.310
just fine with your finger.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.530
Encased in an aluminium and plastic unibody
design, the HTC Flyer is certainly a good

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.610
looking tablet and it certainly manages to
look better than the big black slabs that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.800
most rivals come up with. In other words..
it looks great, and that's hardly going to

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.690
be a disadvantage.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.380
Because this is an Android device then it
does everything else that other Android devices

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.440
do, including having access to the massive
range of applications from the Android market.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.940
The multimedia player can cope with all major
formats including XviD, and there's a 3.5mm

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.960
audio socket in case you want to watch a movie
or YouTube without disturbing anyone.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.240
The HTC Flyer is slated to be available during
Q2 2011, although there's no word on pricing..

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.490
the indications are that the Flyer will be
a premium priced product, and the similarly

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.620
specified "original" Samsung Galaxy Tab had
an eye-watering launch price of about â‚¬800

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.100
for the full-fat version.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.020
With HTC now on board with a consumer tablet,
along with LG, Samsung, Motorola, RIM, HP

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.800
and of course Apple, it seems that the only
major manufacturers without a device in their

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.610
portfolio are Sony Ericsson and Nokia. We
suspect that Sony Ericsson might be working

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.730
on something clever with partners Sony, but
Nokia are now looking very much like they

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.580
are left out in the cold when it comes to
this increasingly popular type of device.
