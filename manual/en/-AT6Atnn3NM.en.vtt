00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.230
Rob: Living in an under-developed country
is difficult especially when there is little

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.920
hope to change things.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.389
However, that’s not the case with a graduate
student from Kenya who is taking steps to

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.710
make a difference in his home village by educating
himself abroad.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.989
With more on that, joining me now is Courtenay
Dehoff.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:22.560
Courtenay: Patrick Saisi is definitely on
a mission for change, and what he hopes to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.019
change is the way people think in Africa and
here in Oklahoma.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.940
Courtenay Dehoff: In this Keswaheli class
at OSU, the students are learning more than

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.260
just a new language.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.510
They’re also learning about African culture.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.510
But the information that Kenyan graduate student
and Professor Patrick Saisi is learning can

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.180
make the difference between life and death
for those depending on him back home.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.079
Patrick Saisi: I come from a village called
Cheptulu.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.809
It is from the western part of Kenya.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:04.430
We have around 1200 people in that village,
and it’s pretty moderate, as far as life

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.299
is concerned.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.060
We are fighting poverty there.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.810
We are fighting through education and making
sure that people understand that development

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.390
lies in education and in themselves.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.930
Courtenay: The advantage of having an American
education is what led Saisi to Oklahoma.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.590
And the demands from home are what keeps him
here in Oklahoma obtaining his graduate degree.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.829
Saisi: In Africa we need almost everything.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.430
So I thought, if I know something in business,
if I know something in economics, and then

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.130
international relations, then agriculture
because of hunger always in Africa, I think

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.070
I’ll be holistically approaching education.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.040
Courtenay: Responsible for so much more than
teaching and writing dissertations, Saisi

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.170
knows he is expected to succeed while he is
away from home.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.790
Saisi: The vision that I have for my village
is to be poverty free.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.420
Courtenay: Constantly mindful of the bigger
picture, Saisi knows exactly what he wants

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.610
for his community back home, and how it will
be attained.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.990
Saisi: We may not eradicate everything; but
the standard of living, I would like to see

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.470
all children going to school.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.470
I would like to see people involved in business.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.640
I would like to see poverty being reduced
to almost zero.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.460
That is the vision.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.960
And my mission to that is to look at, how
can we accomplish education?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.360
Courtenay: While Saisi’s village in Keyna
is making great progress in early childhood

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.590
education, Saisi is also interested in a career
in developmental politics, because he says

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.740
his village needs to be heard.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.370
Saisi: When you live in a village, you know
that village better, than when you just, when

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.010
somebody comes from somewhere and comes to
say, hey this is, you need to do this.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.880
I want to change the attitude that the villagers
even though they may be poor, even though

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.900
they may be illiterate; they know something
about that village.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.560
And, when you are doing development, please
listen to them.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.350
That is something that is lacking; big gap;
we are just told what to do.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.340
Courtenay: Upon returning home, Saisi has
lots of work to do, starting with helping

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.210
his village to raise the children.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.250
Saisi: A kid belongs to everybody, and it’s
very important for me to do well here.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.620
And that’s why within five years, I may
be getting my Master’s and PHD, finish quickly

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.550
and get out of here and go home.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.750
Courtenay: In the poorest parts of Africa,
almost half the population lives on less than

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.150
a dollar a day.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.840
So you could say that helping his fellow Africans
rise above poverty is Patrick’s biggest

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.120
motivation for coming to the United States.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.620
Rob: So Courtenay, how popular is the trend
of Africans coming to the states for a higher

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.620
ed degree?

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.210
Courtenay: Well Rob, the number of Africans
traveling to the United States to obtain college

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.760
degrees is growing.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.680
In fact, Africans average the highest educational
attainment of any other ethnic group.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.500
Rob: Courtenay, in my experience, many of
the Africans I’ve met have come from very

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.820
meager backgrounds, and it’s just a struggle
to get here.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.329
Courtenay: It is, but in Africa, life is very
communalistic.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.400
So often times, students have the moral and
financial support of their entire village,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.060
which Patrick will tell you just increases
the pressure to do well in his studies, then

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.129
hurry up and get back home to his loved ones
in Kenya.
