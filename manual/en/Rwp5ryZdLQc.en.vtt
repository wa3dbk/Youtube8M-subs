00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.250
What's up guys, it's Breanna AKA Mini Marley
and today I want to show you guys how I got

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.870
these super cute heatless curls using of course
curlformers. I cannot believe that I waited

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.090
this long to try them. Why didn't you guys
tell me what was up with the curlformers because

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.760
seriously they are so quick and so easy and
my hair is so soft and shiny and just look

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.039
at the curls. So, if you guys want to see
how I did this or maybe just get some tips

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.789
and tricks because you already own curlformers
then make sure that you tune in for the rest

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:09.220
of the video and let's get started. So, my
hair is freshly washed and I used the Dove

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.850
Pure Care Dry Oil Shampoo and Conditioner
and these are great because they are infused

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.470
with African macadamia oil and they really
replenish my hair not to mention the fact

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.610
that they smell amazing. So, the next step
in this process is basically just to separate

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.660
your hair into two sections and I like to
do this because each curlformer goes in different

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.270
directions so I recommend putting the orange
ones on the right side of your head. So, the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.470
first thing that you're going to do is put
your giant hook through your curlformer.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.459
Now, I'm starting on this side so I'm using
the orange ones and as you can see here is

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.110
the hook. So, you're going to take your first
row of hair and then you're just going

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.110
to make sure that it's nice and damp. Mine
is dried out a little bit so I'm just using

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.200
my spray bottle to apply some extra water
and then I also applied my products and detangled

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.250
that section. So, now I have the section for
my first curlformer and I suggest twirling

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.480
your hair at the root so that it's really
easy to latch that hook on to the base of

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.040
your section. Now, once you have your hook
all latched on you're going to push your curlformer

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.220
up to the root of that section and then all you
have to do is pull your hook through the curlformer

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.970
so that all your hair goes smoothly through
it and then the curlformer will curl up and

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.940
basically give you that spiral curl. Okay,
so I know that can be really confusing so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.870
let's do it again with a close up.
So, the first that you're going to do is go

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.200
ahead and wet the section. I think that it's
better when the section is wet because it

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.750
just slides right through the curlformer and then
I applied my moisturizer and my oil and I'm

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.390
just going to detangle my section and then
I just got started by separating the first

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.260
piece that I want to work with. So, the next
thing that you're going to do is just push

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.730
that hook through your first curlformer and
making sure that the hook comes out on the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.319
other end then you're going to twirl your
hair at the root and then go ahead and attach

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.280
your hook to your first section. So, then
after you have your hook attacked just push

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.250
the curlformer up to the root like this and
then go ahead and pull the hook all the way

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.310
through the curlformer so that your hair gets
through. I know it can sound a little bit

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.890
tricky, but trust me it's super easy once
you get the hang of it and you're in the swing

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.040
of things.
So, I'm just going to move on and show you

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.360
a couple more times so that you got it. So,
you're just going to twirl your hair at the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.240
root. This makes it so much easier to get
all your hair into that hook because trust

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.890
me that can be the trickiest part and then
you're going to pull the curlformer all the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.390
way up to your root and then hold onto it
right there. You want to make sure that you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.240
hold it at your root because if you donï¿½t
it will kind of slide down and then your root

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.819
will be super loose. So, just pull the hair
through the curlformer once you have it

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:21.099
all set and then you have your curlformer
set. So, I'm pretty much done with my entire

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:26.199
head and it really honestly was quick i'm just doing my last one. I'm going to go

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.940
ahead and twirl it at the root making it super
easy to attach my hook and then I'm just going

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:47.190
to pull that through.
So, my entire curlformer set is finally done

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.470
and ready to go and this is what the entire
thing looks like. I know there's a huge part

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.250
in the back, but you can go ahead and get
rid of that when we fluff it out. So, Naptural85

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.470
recommends tying your hair up like this if
you plan to sleep on it over night, but I decided

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.660
to just wait a couple of hours and let it
dry and now I'm ready to take them down and

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.750
yes they are pretty annoying to have in your
hair, but I think the results are worth it.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.310
So, I'm just going to go ahead and take these
out and all you have to do to do that is stretch

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.930
out the curlformer and then pinch at the root
making a little hole so it's easy to slide

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.810
your hair out. So, I'm just going to show
you that a couple more times just stretch

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.810
out the curlformer and then pinch at the root
making it easier to open so that your hair

00:05:33.810 --> 00:06:06.639
can slide out. So, now that I have all my
curlformers out this is what the whole set

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.520
looks like.
Now, some people might like to wear it like

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.370
this, but I do not like this look on its own
so I went ahead and separated half of my hair

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.180
and this is what it looks like. The curls
are so nice and of course as the days go on

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.889
it's going to fluff out and elongate, but
let me just show you quickly how I separated

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.110
them. All you have to do is take the section
and basically just pull it apart where it

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.060
naturally separates and then you can wind
it around your finger to help it curl back

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.040
up in case you have any frizz. This is similar
to the way that I take down my flat twist.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.650
All you're going to do is just keep separating
it and curl it around your finger to get rid

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:51.479
of any frizz that comes up when you separate
the pieces. So, the last step is just to use

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:56.620
this motions radiating gloss which is perfect
for adding some extra shine and helping me

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.270
control my frizz.
So, I'm just going to apply that all over

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.729
my hair with a couple of pumps that's all
you need because it's really great and it

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:09.340
gives you a ton of shine and then I'm just
going to apply all over my hair and making

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:30.080
sure that I get it on my edges and everything
so nothing looks dry. Now that my hair is

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.570
super shiny and bouncy it's all separated
I am ready to go and I love these heatless

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.820
curls using flexi rods. I'm definitely going
to be doing it a lot more often and I hope
