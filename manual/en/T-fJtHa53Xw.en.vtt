♫ DOO-WOP INSPIRED
POP/R&amp;B ♫

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.841
Let’s go out today

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.640
We both deserve it babe

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.929
Or we could just stay in
and watch Hope Floats on DVDay

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.340
You know what’s not my goal?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.660
Those stuffy gender roles

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.109
How 'bout you and me

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.889
just go splitsies? (Hey!)

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:28.539
You know you got a job

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.739
I also have a job

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.019
Please don’t take issue with the both of
us having jobs

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.080
But if we share a home

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.510
I can’t do it alone

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.739
You cook up a dish

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.210
I’ll do something with this (hey!)

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.560
You gotta know how to treat me like a human

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.960
Anything less would be rude man

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.800
You know we gotta do this right

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.000
Dear future date friend

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.870
Here’s some realistic expectations if you
wanna

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.670
date or maybe hook up for a while

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.920
Dear future date friend

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.100
Let’s forget the 50's-style demands

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.440
We both know it’s give and take if it’s
like, lust, or for life

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.540
So babe let’s go for it

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.259
'Cause I think you’re the shit

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.299
We like each other and you
call yourself a feminist (ooh!)

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.060
Willing to compromise (ooh!)
Communicate, no lies

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.460
If we disagree

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.560
I’ll release the bees (just kidding!)

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.780
You gotta know how to treat me like a person

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.140
Yeah, relationships are work hun

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.740
But they’re worth it most of the time

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.160
Dear future date friend

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.930
Here’s some realistic expectations if you
wanna

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.850

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.160
Dear future date friend

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:56.240
Make time for me
I’ll do the same thing

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.940
You know I’m lukewarm on your friends but
I’ll still try

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.400
I like sleeping on the
right side of the bed (hey!)

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.460
And maybe on some nights
we’ll give each other [BEAT] head

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.000
Was that an oral joke?
(Hehe, yeah)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.360
Yeah that’s an oral joke

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.640
We’re both grown ups

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.420
You know what’s up (hey!)

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.080
You gotta know how to treat me like your equal

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.260
Or don’t expect a sequel

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.320
You gotta treat me right

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.560
Dear future date friend

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.469
Here’s some realistic expectations if you
wanna

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.209
Date or just straight up screw for a while

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.540
Dear future date friend

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.420
If you wanna catch that loving feeling

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.280
We’ve just gotta just make sure
that we treat each other right

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.319
Future date friend, respect for life

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:07.680
