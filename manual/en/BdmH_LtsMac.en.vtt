00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.140
Nachos for 10 minutes, quickly and easily irresistibly

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.380
For nachos with cheese are necessary following ingredients:

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.120
50g butter
25g flour

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.940
250ml cold milk

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
250g cheese

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:35.286
200g tortilla chips

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:37.115
Half a teaspoon of salt

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:38.680
Half a teaspoon of chili

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.200
slice with the larger sides

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.640
This is "IriÅ¡ki" cheese

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.380
Melt on low heat 50g butter

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.820
Do not use margarine instead of butter
Because it will not turn out nice.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.600
Butter, melted

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.520
I add 25g flour and stir minute

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.440
Here it looks like this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.200
And we get some cold milk

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.580
250ml

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.300
We will increase the fire until it boils

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.040
All time stir

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.380
It slowly becomes thick

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.480
Here began to boil

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.740
Reducing fire

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.580
And continue to stir for another minute

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.560
Now add salt

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.080
Stir

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.400
Then ground chili

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.020
Chile can add more
His taste

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.400
Now add the cheese

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.280
and stir until completely dissolved

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.400
Everything is done on a low flame

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.980
We pour immediately into the bowl

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900
And best serve immediately

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.200
Or you can put a saucepan over another pan

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.620
How screaming heats water to steam
To always warm.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.340
We put the dish on the plate

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.960
I put tortilla chips around

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.880
This is one way of serving

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.740
A second way of serving this
To serve any particular

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.582
You take a bowl

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.240
Pour chips

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.280
Through a bit of sauce

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.360
Then again chips

00:04:20.724 --> 00:04:22.724
Again sauce

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.540
and so several times

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.840
If you will want to put you through
Chopped tomatoes into cubes or small leek

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.560
