Hello, I'm Stevie Moore. Welcome to my studio
here at the Artists' Attic in Lexington, Kentucky.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.840
Now I'm going to explain to you how to prepare
your art surface where we can get started

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:20.009
to--go ahead and get started to paint. I'm
a right-handed person, so I like to position

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:28.069
my canvas to the right and my subject material,
my reference material, to the left. If you're

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.919
left-handed, you may want to do it the other
way. Just do whatever feels comfortable for

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.620
you. I'm using two easels here. It's always
best to use an easel when painting, but you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.120
don't absolutely have to. You can use a desk,
you could also tape this to the wall if you

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.210
need to, or tape it to some other object,
but I believe that it's good to have both

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:57.289
objects in the same plane--in the same angle--and
work with those in that position simultaneously.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:05.421
What I've got here is a pre-gesso'd canvas.
You can also use Masonite board, you can use

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:12.680
wood. It's always best to have a layer of
gesso or a primer coat on the bottom, that

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.680
way you can go ahead and move to your initial
blocking in of colors fairly rapidly, without

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.439
having to layer up too much paint. The third
important factor is going to be lighting,

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.649
in which you're going to want to use ample,
but diffused light. Reason being is oil paint

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.730
is very reflective and very lustrous, especially
when it's wet. If you have too much direct

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.189
light on wet oil paint, you're going to get
a lot of reflection off of that, and a lot

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.039
of shininess will come off the paint, and
it's not going to allow you to see the true

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.640
color of the paint, or more close proximity
of what that color is going to be once it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.369
dries. You can use tissue paper over lighting
to diffuse that light, Mylar works well and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.070
fluorescent lighting--high-power fluorescent
lighting tends to be your best type of bulb

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:19.200
to use, rather than incandescent or spot lights.
And also good to use a different mixture of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:28.410
color tints, blues as well as reds, in order
to enrich all your colors on an equal scale

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.800
while you're working on your painting.
