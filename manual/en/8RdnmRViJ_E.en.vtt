00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.850
ok

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.400
ok

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
hey mark here with another rd corner
today we're going to talk about cooling

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.710
or the lack thereof depending on what
your honor

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
you were all building these cars and
trucks to drive and have fun driving so

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.480
if you gotta plan your trips around
intersections traffic like stuff like

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.650
that's no fun

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.829
you're running a 220 that's not good
either

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.480
if you're still running an OE copper
brass unit and you run any kind of power

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.860
adders maybe aftermarket fuel injection
turbo blowers you're going to run into

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.510
these cooling issues real quick we got a
solution here for so stay tuned

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.510
let's talk about it

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.320
yeah

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.030
yeah

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.410
and this is our solution this is the new
max power try flow radiator what you got

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.320
here is aluminum universal Chevy style
units we have three different sizes to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.640
fit street rods all the way up to
full-size pickups you got here it's all

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.759
6061 aluminum full TIG welded tanks to
core we got universal mount tabs here on

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.380
the side you got your stainless-steel
bunk for your drain

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.310
we also have another one right up here
for guys running LSE's you can now run

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.280
your steam port right into that line
here we got the shroud fans training

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610
cause accessories there we'll talk about
a little bit let me show you the detail

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.990
how these things work

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.610
we gotta cut away here is the same unit
only smaller

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.009
so what we did was incorporated these
flow dividers you have one here and then

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.750
one in the other tank with these do
these create water movement in three

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.649
different passes the water comes in here
it's your first flow divider comes

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.979
across down into your tank to the second
flow divider across again down here

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.850
essentially three passes in front of the
fan the conventional right here like you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.320
have right now across flow going to be
from one tank to the other one pass in

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.760
front of the fan we got three what we
did we took equivalent units at max

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.079
power try flow unit an equivalent
aftermarket aluminum radiator we sent

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.130
them out to an independent test lab and
now outside Detroit they tested these on

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.290
an LS motor on tests and what they
recorded was a 22.4 degree difference

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.209
between inlet temperature and outlet in
the tri flow and only about 10 or 11 in

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.690
your standard so what we want to do here
at East was we wanted to validate the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.280
test results for ourselves so we took a
68 camaro with a small block in it we

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.870
ran against the OE copper brass we took
the top-of-the-line competitors aluminum

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.870
radiator and our try flow you're going
to be impressed with the results

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.140
installing trader in the 68 Camaro and
put a thermocouple into the inlet and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.500
outlet of each right here so we can
measure temperature coming in and going

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.400
out the engine was then run until then

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.799
sure hit 200 degrees Fahrenheit at which
point the fan was turned on the three

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.900
testing the combined graphic the tri
flow Raiders at the top the OE copper

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.680
brass is in the bottom left and the
standard aftermarket aluminum radiators

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.480
in the bottom right

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.200
just look at the way the tri flow
radiator cools if you're only seventeen

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.280
seconds temperature and the trial flow
has dropped 20 degrees all the way down

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.129
to 179 while the other routers are still
hanging out in the mid-19th that's 24

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.769
degrees hotter than the tri flow now
let's fast-forward to one minute to try

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.519
flows down to 1 74 degrees while the
others are still over a hundred

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.670
eighty-seven after two minutes to try
flows all the way down to 167 while the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.340
others are still struggling at 180 the
tri flow dropped more in 17 seconds then

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.959
the others didn't two minutes so you
just seem from that video there are

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.620
testing validate the results from the
independent lab now we've got a line of

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.700
accessories with these we got nice
aluminum shrouds nicely with the shrouds

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.139
it's no faster look actually hook one to
the top and bottom of the unit we have

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.750
high-quality the rally fans we have
training courses and fan controllers to

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.039
go with it all you need to do is measure
the height and width of your radiator or

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.389
