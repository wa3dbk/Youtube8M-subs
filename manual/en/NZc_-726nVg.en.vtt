Get away,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.150
get ahead

00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:04.997
and get out there!

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:08.664
It’s time to uncover adventures 
and discover yourself.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.410
It’s time to take off
on an international Road Trip with

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.895
EF Language Travel!

00:00:13.274 --> 00:00:14.514
Hey! I'm Mark.

00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:17.433
Come and join my crew
for fun times abroad,

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.064
You’ll get to know everyone 
right away and I guarantee

00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:21.577
you’ll have an awesome time!

00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:26.011
Plane, train or bus
It doesn’t matter how you get there

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:27.653
just don’t miss out!

00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:30.787
The EF Global Village – 
is where it’s happening

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:33.621
So here’s the deal,
We take over a city and

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:36.981
make it our own. Don’t believe me?
Check it out….

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.635
We’ll sort out your schedule
and tell you what’s going on

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:46.557
both in and out of the classroom,
so there is no hassle!

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:51.263
For your first taste of freedom
away from home, we want you

00:00:51.263 --> 00:00:52.326
to be comfortable.

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:55.120
You can stay in a few 
different places -

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.358
with a family, 
on a resort, 

00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:00.211
or in a residence.

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:05.905
Class - may be boring at home,
but with us it’s not.

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:07.366
The secret?

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.944
It’s all about 'doing it'
not just learning it.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.205
Along with learning essentials
like grammar and conversation,

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:16.391
We take you out and about.

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:19.136
Discover new situations 
and get involved

00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:20.639
with Action Learning.

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:24.111
You will get given tasks 
to do outside of the classroom,

00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:26.959
and keep track of them
in your EF Passport.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.810
Go crazy with creativity
during your group project.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.588
All of this, along with the 
EF Cambridge English Level Test

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:35.602
that assesses your language skills,

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:39.313
make for a learning adventure
with progress you can prove!

00:01:39.403 --> 00:01:43.863
Here you get to speak, get to know
people, get to know things that

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.719
you just can't learn from the books.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.110
And I think it's better!

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:55.303

explore your passion

00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:57.426

strut your stuff on stage.

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:04.485
or design new fashions.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.793
Come on, it's time to
head to the Beach Club.

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:12.674
Then later we’ll have an
international sports tournament

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:13.849
in our Arena.

00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:16.932
Then back to the lounge 
we can chill out, catch up

00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:19.999
with friends on-line, off-line
whatever…

00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:23.769

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:53.009
spend time abroad.

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.450
Leave the map at home
and let us lead the way.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.784
It’s all about making new friends,

00:02:57.784 --> 00:03:00.800
trying new things 
and capturing the moment.
