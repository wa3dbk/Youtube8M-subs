00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.750
Hello

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.649
welcome to my first video log
here in this channel

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:11.710
in Youtube

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.910
I wanted to talk about something

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.669
that

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:21.089
happened here… yesterday here in Chile,
where i live right now

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.220
there was a news article published in
a local newspaper

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.329
warning people about three huge
spaceships that

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.890
were headed towards Earth and

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.900
that will be here sometime in the first
trimester of 2012

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.440
what surprised me about this obvious
hoax / joke

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.280
was that the newspaper which ran the
news is not a tabloid… it's a serious

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.350
publication

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.850
or at least it was until they
printed this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.720
and also they said that this
information was provided by

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.240
wikileaks

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.570
and that the source

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.870
was the SETI Institute

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.079
so, those were big names to be throwing
around like it was nothing

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.259
but of course i did my research and
found nothing on Wikileaks

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.140
referring to an imminent alien invasion

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.140
and i even found a statement from SETI
denouncing this news as the hoax it was

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.730
All in all… the main reason this calls my
attention is… why now?

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.760
the original article was from 
December 2010

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.400
but this Chilean newspaper

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.880
and also many others i found online only
published this this past week

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.270
plus if you couple this with the recent
video by NASA director

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.979
warning its employees about an imminent
emergency

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.140
it's almost impossible not to think of
several conspiracy theories and possible

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.930
scenarios for the short future

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.070
It has been greatly speculated in many
alternative media that there is

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.539
something called "Project BlueBeam"

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.849
which would be used by some governments
to stage a second coming of christ

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.189
or a possible alien invasion using
holograms and other advanced technology

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.379
which is hidden to the general public

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.969
so i wonder

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:31.119
if this clear disinformation being
published in normal media maybe aims

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:32.769
towards that goal

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.300
to make people think that an eventual
alien attack on planet Earth is indeed

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.049
a possibility

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.439
and to have people in a state of fear
for some sinister reasons

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.109
well i guess

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.779
all we can do at this point is just
speculate

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.909
for the time being, at least officially,

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.829
there are no alien spaceships coming to
Earth in 2012

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:05.039
but the fact that this idea is already
being put in people's minds makes me be

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.280
wary about what might take place from now
until the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.519
popular

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.149
December 21, 2012 date

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:18.709
i mean, will there really be a huge
global change that takes place in a

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.969
single day?

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.810
I'll probably make another videolog

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.519
just to talk about that

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.019
but until then

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.029
my humble advice to the world is to
please be a skeptic

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:36.809
and don't accept any news presented to
you by the media as truth until you do

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.869
your own research about it

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:42.319
i think that's a healthy way
to live and

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.079
it may even

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.099
prove to be life-saving...

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.929
life-saving at some point in the future

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:54.819
or at least it will make it
harder for others to fool you

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.659
that by itself can be more useful to 
you than you could ever think

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.829
so… keep your eyes and ears open

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.709
So, this was my first videolog

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.739
i love to debate

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.769
if you think i'm wrong.. i
love to be wrong

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.900
i always learn a lot from being wrong

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.300
so please leave a comment about what do
you think about a possible alien invasion

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.279
if there could be a real alien invasion,
or a staged alien invasion

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:34.899
how do you feel about that? i would love
to exchange ideas, so please leave a comment

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.439
you can hit the LIKE or DISLIKE buttons

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.540
i welcome all of that

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.349
so thanks for listening

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.930
and i'll be talking to you in my
next videolog.. bye
