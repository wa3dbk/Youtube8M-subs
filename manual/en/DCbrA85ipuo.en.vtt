00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:11.496
&gt;&gt;Student: And in this case,
what we're saying is a section

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:14.146
of this federal wiretapping
act is not constitutional.

00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:18.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Urban Academy in New
York City, they don't use textbooks

00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:20.906
or standard tests to
teach constitutional law.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.486
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The law doesn't
prohibit them receiving

00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:24.796
that information, right?

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:29.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Instead, they research
contemporary cases and are graded

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:32.596
on their performance as litigants and
judges in mock trials like this one.

00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:34.726
&gt;&gt;Student: -- take it back
to the statute which says,

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:37.886
if you have reason to know that
this was intercepted illegally,

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:41.086
it is illegal to broadcast
or transmit it.

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:43.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Urban is itself
at the center of a court case.

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:47.486
At issue is the school's right to
use its own system of assessment,

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:50.566
instead of the state
mandated standardized tests,

00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:52.456
called the Regent's exam.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:55.646
&gt;&gt;Ann: There are thirty-seven schools
across New York state that are part

00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:57.686
of a consortium of schools,
public high schools,

00:00:57.816 --> 00:01:01.226
that use performance assessment,
instead of high stakes tests,

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:04.696
in order to organize our
curriculum and in order

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:07.026
to determine whether students
are ready for graduation.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:08.126
&gt;&gt;Teacher: His thesis isn't clear.

00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:09.456
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It seems as
though he jumps around.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.536
&gt;&gt;Ann: It's a system of
assessment, not a single instrument,

00:01:13.096 --> 00:01:16.706
and it's a system that's based on
a number of components that goes

00:01:16.706 --> 00:01:21.046
on all year long, and culminates
in certain kinds of tasks

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.246
which we ask students
to do, that demonstrate

00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:26.806
that they can actually do something,
they can write research papers,

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:28.936
they can apply mathematical concepts.

00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:30.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Basically I was just going

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:34.166
to discuss the current drug
policy in the United States.

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:36.486
&gt;&gt;Ann: So it's really a
good indicator, we believe,

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:38.596
that there's real predictive
validity in the way

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.226
in which we approach assessment,

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:44.646
rather than having a high stakes
test, which puts everything

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:49.496
on a single score, and which leads,
we think, to formulaic writing

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:52.566
and doesn't really invest the kids
in any way in what they're learning.

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:53.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: When I was reading it,

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.346
I thought that you have
really excellent ideas.

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:57.736
I just thought that maybe we
could do a little shifting

00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:58.866
around of certain things.

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:01.886
&gt;&gt;Ann: We want them to be able
to take text and talk about it,

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:04.686
be able to understand how
to compare different texts,

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:08.206
and to read whole books, not
just little snippets of books.

00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:11.346
And we've set them up
with an external assessor.

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:14.586
A lot of these people have got
advanced degrees in literature

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:18.026
or they teach in a university,
or they might write for a living.

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:23.276
Someone who's agreed to spend an hour
with that student, and who then sits

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.466
down with that student
and discusses that book

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:26.906
for forty-five minutes or an hour.

00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:29.966
&gt;&gt;Student: -- to see whether or
not he saw what she had done.

00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:33.226
&gt;&gt;Ann: What we're really trying
to see is, can that student take

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:36.216
that reading and go and talk to
somebody that they don't know,

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:39.716
a perfect stranger, about the book
and have a conversation about it.

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:44.686
That's one way that we can tell
whether a student is ready to go on

00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:45.856
and do college level work.

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:51.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For many, Urban
represents a second chance,

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:53.526
since most students
come here after dropping

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:55.126
out of other New York high schools.

00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:59.136
Yet ninety-seven percent of
Urban graduates go on to college.

00:02:59.216 --> 00:03:00.636
&gt;&gt;Teacher: -- a plan
for critical review.

00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:01.076
I'm not going to--

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:02.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Researchers
believe that the key

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:07.046
to Urban's remarkable success is
its project approach to learning.

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:09.386
&gt;&gt;Rachel: We're sort of
really looking at ways

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:12.706
to engage our students in,
you know, very rich material

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:15.526
that let them figure
things out for themselves,

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:18.356
not give them the pre-digested
textbook account,

00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:22.746
but let them read two primary sources
and tease out the complexities.

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:23.916
A lot of it has to do with, I think,

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:26.896
letting the kids encounter
real intellectual material

00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:27.856
in all its complexity.

00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:29.756
&gt;&gt;Student: But that's the
entire job of the press,

00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:30.936
is to print what they deem--

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.056
&gt;&gt;Student: What if the
press gets it wrong?

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, then
you should buy your news

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:37.806
from a different press agency.

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:39.956
It's not the job of the
government to decide what's--

00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:42.266
&gt;&gt;Mikka: The harm is still done,
whether or not people buy it

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:44.406
from a different press agency.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:48.376
&gt;&gt;I went to another high school
before I came to Urban Academy,

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:51.816
and we didn't learn anything.

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:55.426
We went through the American
Revolution for the whole term,

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:59.976
and we just sat there and took
notes and we read about it.

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:03.906
&gt;&gt;This is not public education,
it's not of the public interest.

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:09.796
&gt;&gt;But when I came here and
I took constitutional law,

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:14.816
I got to argue things, I got to
understand them more because I had

00:04:14.816 --> 00:04:16.166
to defend them and I
had to make my case.

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:18.876
And it really, really makes
you have to think logically.

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:20.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I think the solution

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:22.886
to your ending is actually
all on stage already.

00:04:22.886 --> 00:04:25.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Rather than spending
class time on rote memory drills,

00:04:25.596 --> 00:04:29.186
classes like this script writing
workshop foster creativity.

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:31.376
Students even get their
work performed

00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:32.976
and critiqued by Broadway actors.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.936
&gt;&gt;Student: And that Dodge
Dart, I see him riding around.

00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:37.286
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, maybe
it ain't much to look at,

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:39.126
but that car is my salvation.

00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:39.193
&gt;&gt;Student: So?

00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:41.576
&gt;&gt;Student: That's my
ticket out of here,

00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:44.706
that's my ticket to fame and fortune.

00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:45.686
&gt;&gt;Student: How so?

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:47.866
&gt;&gt;Student: I already told
you ten million times.

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.396
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, but you ain't
never gave me a real answer.

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:54.906
Just a bunch of fairytales
about you becoming a star.

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.646
&gt;&gt;Michelle: What happens in the
culture of performance based work is,

00:04:57.686 --> 00:05:00.056
young people begin to see their
own intellectual signatures.

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:02.696
They see themselves as the
authors of their own works.

00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:08.526
They don't see themselves filling
in other people's blanks, right?

00:05:08.526 --> 00:05:09.796
That's not what they do.

00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:12.106
They know how to collaborate,
they know how to use experts,

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:14.336
and they know how to
give birth to ideas,

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:18.026
and then find the resources
to develop those ideas.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.166
&gt;&gt;Student: I mean, I like the fact
that we're just paying attention

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.046
to the central character--

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:26.906
&gt;&gt;Michelle: To introduce into that
system a test, administered once,

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:32.036
with unbelievably high stakes, that
will feel like an intellectual x-ray,

00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:36.156
and will forever tattoo
the mind of young people,

00:05:36.776 --> 00:05:42.336
feels like a miseducation
and a kind of social sadism

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:46.736
that backs young people
into leaving schools.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.696
&gt;&gt;Crowd: &lt;chanting&gt; Hey,
no, we ain't no fools.

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:51.526
Take out tests out of our schools.

00:05:51.526 --> 00:05:53.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In November
of two thousand and one,

00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:55.526
the New York Supreme
Court ordered Urban

00:05:55.586 --> 00:05:57.806
and the other alternative
assessment schools

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:01.946
to reinstate the Regent's exams
as a requirement for graduation.

00:06:02.326 --> 00:06:05.096
But a coalition of students,
teachers, administrators

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:07.626
and parents are continuing
to fight for the right

00:06:07.676 --> 00:06:10.956
to set their own standards
of assessment.

00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:14.916
&gt;&gt;Jane: We will not allow you to be
reduced to a single test score ever.

00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:20.666
&gt;&gt;What's happened is that the
government has sold the people

00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:21.816
of this country a bill of goods

00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:24.576
that reforming education
means giving a test.

00:06:25.536 --> 00:06:27.656
A test was always a measurement,
a form of measurement.

00:06:27.656 --> 00:06:28.966
It wasn't a reform tool.

00:06:29.316 --> 00:06:32.956
If you want to reform education, you
have to break up these huge schools,

00:06:33.246 --> 00:06:37.546
have small settings and really think
about, you know, more money poured

00:06:37.546 --> 00:06:39.426
into the schools, more
teacher training,

00:06:39.646 --> 00:06:41.126
and come up with novel programs.

00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:43.376
Urban is a novel program that works.

00:06:43.626 --> 00:06:44.916
Why not look at it if it works?

00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:48.886
Why destroy it and try to superimpose
an old system that never worked

00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:50.326
for this population to begin with?

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:54.296
&gt;&gt;Ann: I think that what's
happening is, that the decisions

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:59.136
about education are being driven by
the policymakers and the test makers

00:06:59.136 --> 00:07:02.906
and the politicians, and not by
the teachers, the professionals.

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:03.876
&gt;&gt;Teacher: On the margins,
he can write a sentence.

00:07:03.876 --> 00:07:04.796
What the main idea of this thing?

00:07:04.796 --> 00:07:05.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's a good idea.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:07.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There is little
doubt that Urban's system

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:10.706
of performance assessment places
greater demands on its faculty

00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:14.706
than administering a standard test,
but there is equally little doubt

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:17.246
that the lessons learned
at Urban will last long

00:07:17.246 --> 00:07:19.656
after the Regent's exam
answers are forgotten.

00:07:19.656 --> 00:07:21.676
&gt;&gt;Student: I think the interests

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:24.796
of the common citizen here
outweigh the interests

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:26.936
of the corporate media
conglomerates that--

00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:28.836
&gt;&gt;Jane: They don't know every
war that's ever been fought

00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:32.676
and every river in the world,
but they have depth of knowledge,

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:37.516
and they know how to take an issue
and learn about it and research

00:07:37.516 --> 00:07:40.786
and write about it and think
about it and resolve it.

00:07:40.786 --> 00:07:43.186
&gt;&gt;I know they have this kind of
education in the private schools.

00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:47.836
Every public school
child deserves the same.

00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:51.256
