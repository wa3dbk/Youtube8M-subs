00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.159
For the longest time - well, the entirety
of its existence up through this point - I

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.380
avoided Minecraft.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.710
And that was difficult.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
It took the gaming world by storm, it brought
creative minds together into massive (if blocky)

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.149
worlds, my roommate wouldn’t stop going
on about it.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.360
It wasn’t out of disdain, or a personal
feeling of superiority… it’s because I

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.340
knew if I touched it, I would be obsessed.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.960
I was so excited by the prospect, I had to
abstain for the sake of what scraps of productivity

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.070
I had left.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.059
And… well, even those went by the wayside,
so I decided why the hell not?

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.559
Let’s get stuck in.

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.769
Let’s punch the bejeezus out of a tree.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.020
Let’s do this.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.231
And for an afternoon, I gave in.

00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:57.699
And it was pretty damn fun.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.989
Maybe I was just using the opportunity presented
by this PS3 version - a rental, thankfully

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.210
- to finally indulge in a relatively safe
fashion.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.680
My motives are not on trial here.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:18.429
If you need an explanation of Minecraft at
this point… honestly, where the hell have

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:19.429
you been?

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.390
You’re a blocky-lookin’ dude in a blocky-lookin’
world, beating the hell out of blocky-looking

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.739
animals and whatnot in an attempt to build…
well, anything.

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:30.780
Depending on what mode you’re working in,
you might just be putting things together

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.240
like this is a big freakin’ Lego set on
your PS3.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
You might be playing the survival mode, which
requires your attention to little details

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.450
like hunger, and health, and zombies, and
skeletons roaming with bows, and the infamous

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.450
creepers.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.860
You might even venture into Hardcore mode,
which includes all that stuff in the previous

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.310
sentence but with the added bonus of no respawning.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.530
Regardless of the mode, you’re gonna be
building stuff.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.160
That’s kind of the idea.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:04.080
It may be simplistic and open-ended… but
that’s why Minecraft has been, to steal

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.250
a phrase from the esteemed Dr. Venkman, “a
legitimate phenomenon.”

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.870
It might not feel much like a Game at times,
in that you’re largely in charge of your

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.640
own goals and direction… would it be more
fitting to call it a platform?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.370
A platform for exploration, expression, and
occasionally taking out a death wish on cows

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.390
because you’re sick of them.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.310
A place where you can come home, and in lieu
of doing something constructive, you can go

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.220
prospecting for more iron ore.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.560
It is escapism, and it’s really good escapism
at that.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.041
I only lost an afternoon of my life, because
I played it pretty carefully.

00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:38.180
Granted, it was an afternoon that saw me building
a small hut on the high ground, then digging

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.310
down and creating access points down by this
like, some more access points, a subsidiary

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.840
crafting station, an expedition into a nearby
cave system, getting very lost, building a

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.630
massive spire up into the skies, abusing the
rather questionable physics to create an airborne

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.560
beacon platform, getting very lost again,
and eventually just taking in the scenery.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.319
It’s an experience unlike anything else,
and for a JRPG nut like myself who expects

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.740
the whole experience to be scripted out and
well-written, it was a massive paradigm shift.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:13.440
I was writing the story, in real-time, for
an audience of one.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.661
The nuts and bolts of the experience don’t
really need much to survive, hence its being

00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.870
ported to everything with two circuits to
rub together.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.281
Being able to use a PS3 controller did feel
quite comfortable, and while most folks are

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:27.680
more familiar with it on the 360, this version
doesn’t change much of anything.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.230
Of course, there’s the requisite spate of
multiplayer functions, AKA a large part of

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.260
the appeal for a number of players, and DLC
in the form of texture packs and skins.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.310
It feels kinda stupid to talk about the graphics,
since… it’s freakin’ Minecraft, and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.690
chances are you’re playing for something
bigger than that, but since I’m obligated

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.540
to, we’ll just say that in the small scale,
things look rough, so that’s why you build

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.250
them out to much larger scales.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.480
Much, much larger scales.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.510
Likewise, the generally chill background music
isn’t the kind of thing that’s going to

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.750
get a symphonic concert tour, but in the moment,
a little bit of piano in the background is

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.750
all you really need.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.640
Besides, you don’t want too much distraction.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.110
You’re trying to figure out how best to
build your masterwork: A giant desert monument

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.840
in the shape of Pharaoh Man from Mega Man
4.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.430
And, yeah, I don’t actually have footage
of such a thing, but it would be awesome!

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.510
Because it’s Pharaoh Man.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.680
Right?
