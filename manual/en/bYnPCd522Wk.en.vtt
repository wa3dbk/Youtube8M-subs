Welcome to a new video...

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.660
...today we bake a plum crumble cake...

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.100
...therefore I have 1 kg plums...

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:50.440
...halve them first, remove seeds and cut into quarters...

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:53.357
...Take a large mixing bowl...

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.540
...add 125 grams of sugar...

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.220
...50 grams of melted butter...

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.140
...&amp; 2 eggs...

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.960
...beat until fluffy using a mixer/food processor for about 5 minutes....

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:46.540
...add 250 grams of flour and ½ packet of baking powder by pressing through a sieve...

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.700
...also add 125 milliliters of milk...

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:02.860
...mix together until the batter reaches a smooth consistency...

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:18.980
...line the bottom of a springform pan with baking/parchment paper....

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:33.720
...give the batter into the prepared springform pan...

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.200
...and smooth down with the help of a spatula...

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.700
...place the quartered plums on the batter...

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.940
...if you like arrange the plums like a fan...

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.120
...but you can also give them onto the batter like me, thats much quicker ;)...

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:10.640
...give them a litte press...

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:24.000
...sprinkle them with 2 – 3 tablespoons of brown sugar...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.020
...for the crumbles...

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.140
...add 100 grams of flour...

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:40.140
...75 grams of butter (at room temperature) and 75 grams of sugar into a large mixing bowl... 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:50.920
...and knead with your hands until a crumbly dough has formed...

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.580
...sprinkle the crumbles evenly over the sugared plums...

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:12.500
...give the cake for 50 – 60 minutes into the preheated oven at 180°C/356°F...

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.580
...so does the cake look after baking...

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.200

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:30.240
