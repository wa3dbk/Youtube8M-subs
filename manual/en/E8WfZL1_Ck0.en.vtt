00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:07.273
Folks are in awe of the rock, 
just that

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.275
something this massive 
and this large

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.343
is out in middle 
of the Hill Country.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.208
I think that’s why it became 
Enchanted Rock.

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:16.481
They thought that it was 
something different,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.651
that it wasn’t something 
that should just be out here.

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.918
It doesn’t matter how 
many times you come to the park,

00:00:22.986 --> 00:00:24.290
it’s never the same thing,

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:27.326
and that’s what I really 
enjoy about the rock.

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:31.296
The Native Americans 
were inspired by it.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.933
They felt that it was 
inhabited by spirits.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.536
[thunder claps]

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:40.803
Mystical, magical, enchanted...

00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:43.543
...it’s not like 
your normal park.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:46.545
[wind]

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.748
Enchanted Rock is 
an outcropping.

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:52.585
It is the inside of a volcano 
that didn’t erupt.

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:56.623
They say that it’s 
the heart of Texas.

00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:02.561
I think it’s enchanting because 
you can rock climb,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.431
you can fish, you can hike, 
you can camp,

00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:09.701
and to me that’s what’s 
enchanting about the area.

00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:12.273
The Hill Country’s
a beautiful place.

00:01:13.138 --> 00:01:17.576
Enchanted Rock is located 
17 miles north of Fredericksburg

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:21.113
and about 25 miles 
south of Llano.

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:23.850
People can still come in 
and still get that

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:27.026
one-on-one feeling with nature.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:30.656
There’s a good amount 
of wildlife and plant life

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:33.260
within the park 
for folks to study.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.166
[bird chirping]

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:42.566
The middle of the week is the 
best time to come out

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.766
and visit Enchanted Rock.

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:47.168
and virtually have 
the place all to yourself.

00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:48.841
You’ll see a little bit 
of everything-

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.280
over 60 species of birds, 
various reptiles, mammals.

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:55.615
The first time out,

00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:58.316
obviously you want to 
make it to the summit,

00:01:58.405 --> 00:02:00.186
and take in the view.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:04.956
It’s 425 feet. 
So, you can see forever.

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:06.760
It’s beautiful.

00:02:06.828 --> 00:02:08.160
But I think the 
view is beautiful

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.530
no matter where 
you are at the park.

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:12.348
It is a magical place.

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:15.800
They estimate it's 
one billion years old.

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:18.405
It’s going to be here 
long long after we’re gone,

00:02:18.473 --> 00:02:20.640
and of course 
that’s a good thing.

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.241
We want the generations 
of tomorrow

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.108
to be able to enjoy it 
for years and years.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.548
It’s definitely one of a kind.
