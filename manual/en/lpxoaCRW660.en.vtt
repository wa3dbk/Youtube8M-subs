Welcome to Denise's Easy Graph designer, your
source for knitting, crochet and counted cross

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.230
stitch pattern design. My name is Veronica
Balvanz, project team member and your guide

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.930
to all of the new and exciting improvements
to version 2.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.019
In the process of developing our latest version
we focused not only on what our product lacked,

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.810
but also on the challenges designers face
when writing up their patterns. One of those

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.489
challenges was moving from the chart design
software to the final text editor. This transition

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.629
can be difficult to understand and at times
doesn't always transfer as well as one would like.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.570
To make life as easy as possible we added
a text editor to our pattern designer,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.719
and to simplify things we broke down the page
in to four sections. The top section is your

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.449
header box, or cover page for those that prefer
to have the charts on page 2. Text and images

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.179
can be added to this box with the help of
our text editing function tucked away in the

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.740
control bar, and the file selection button
below the box. Multiple images can be added

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.439
and the box will continue to expand as you
do.

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.810
So if you do prefer to have your charts on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.490
page 2 just keep adding text or blank space
to this box until your charts fall on the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.909
next page when you look at the print preview.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.740
Moving on to the second section of the page
we have our pattern chart. I'm excited to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.899
say that our system now supports up to 26
charts per pattern. Additional charts can

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.229
be added via the settings button on the control bar, and rows can also be added or deleted

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.289
from the chart when needed. Each chart has
it's own title box where text can be added

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.079
to allow reference information to be included.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.610
Section 3 of the page is our new automatic
pattern key. This will update any time a new

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.689
symbol or color is added to any of your charts.
We included some standard definitions but

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.119
the key text can be edited just like any other
text on the page.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.640
The 4th section is the main body of the pattern.
Working just like the header before you've

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.680
got full font controls, multiple images and
the box will continue to expand to suit your needs.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.519
A few more of the great improvements to this
version are:

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.600
• Click and drag painting - Making for fast pattern design

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.590
• Copy and pasting rows by simply double

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.370
clicking on the row you want to copy, then
clicking the row you wish to paste

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.370
• And the ability to add a background image
to the main table for duplication

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.450
That does it for this video, feel free to
