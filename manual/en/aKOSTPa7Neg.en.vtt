00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:05.272
[pop rock music]

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:15.382
-I love every single thing

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.351
[chuckling] that
I have collected.

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.353
It's a part of me!

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:26.293
-The things you're looking at,
this is the story of my life.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:33.233
-What's in the boxes over there?
-Beanie Babies.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.569
I have close to probably 7,800.

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.907
Collecting is
really not collecting

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.909
unless you have everything.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:47.314
-I think that having stuff
kind of gets in the way of

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.249
living your life
and being happy.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.052
I think a lot of just this stuff
and the maintenance of

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.187
the stuff and cleaning
the stuff and putting it here

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:57.758
and putting it there and
creating room, it takes away

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.727
from time together,
which I'd rather be doing.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:05.832
-Clutter begins in the
brain and ends up on the floor.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:09.202
And part of the process of what
I do for a living is to help

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.371
people get
uncluttered from their lives.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:18.478
-Every single time a bag
left, I went through mourning.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.548
I went through have
to get the bag back.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.352
-When I'm feeling down,
sometimes I love to go

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.321
spend money and buy stuff too.

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.523
-I was in touch with
the shopping channels,

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.992
and they looked up
his record and said,

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:35.462
"Oh my god. Yes, he
is a compulsive shopper,

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.831
and he's been a
very good customer."

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.834
-You know why people clutter?
-No.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:45.038
I'd like to know
because, apparently, I do it.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:48.342
-One of the reasons: it's proof
of your existence on earth.

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.444
It's the way that you
document who you are.
