00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.600
Pioneer has announced a service that prints
the expressions of unborn babies as 3D holograms,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:30.340
using a compact full-color hologram printer
developed by the company last year.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:40.050
This device can record full color card-sized
Lippmann hologram in 120 minutes with one

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.580
color holograms taking 90 minutes.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:01:02.869
The 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:21.120
recording 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.210
medium is a high-performance film specifically
for holograms, called Bayfol HX, from Bayer

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.750
Material Science.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.280
The hologram is visible within a 23 degree
viewing angle, and is 200 components high

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:55.760
and 300 wide, with each component containing
60 points of view vertically 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:06.140
and horizontally.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.740
As these holograms can be used to commemorate
births, and Lippmann holograms can be viewed

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.370
clearly in white light, Pioneer is exhibiting
holograms in card-case holders and jewel-boxes

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.230
with white LEDs.
