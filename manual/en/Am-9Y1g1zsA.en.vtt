00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.429
You go back to 1970 when this

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.360
all first started Dr. Kaui had a vision
we were the pioneers in doing this.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.710
Since 1970, we have flown
140,000

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.139
medivac patients

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.320
and we continue to be pioneers we are
already on the forefront

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.740
of bring in this new aircraft out. We
anticipate

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.699
the transition to be complete by the
fall of 2014

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.519
there was a delay in receiving the
aircraft basically

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.219
they were modifications made to the
medical interior

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.780
and to the trakka, which is the
spotlight on the aircraft,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.040
and in order to get that approved

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.270
it had to go through two entities.
First being the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.320
what they call EASA  which is the
European Aviation Safety Agency

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.780
because the aircraft manufacturer is
out of Europe

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.730
and then once it was approved by EASA say
it had to come to the FAA

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.280
and we had to get approval from the FAA
once it was approved we did finally

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.430
receive the aircraft in the beginning of
2013.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.390
The FAA came out with what they call a
final rule on helicopter

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.300
operations throughout the United States.
Specifically as it's germane

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
to how we do it with
the air ambulances

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.520
basically they wanted to improve safety,
improve communications,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.979
training, and additional on board safety
equipment. Now

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.560
everyone operating helicopters in the
United States has to

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.110
abide by these roles. The good news is
that my Maryland state police is way ahead of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.810
the curve

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.640
how we had the wherewithal back in 2008
to procure an aircraft that the FAA is

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.930
now required to to have certain safety
features on board

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.860
that yet that you follow what they call
weather minimums,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.310
safety procedures, pre-flight checks, 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.579
and analysis were had a game and
we're we're really pleased with that.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.270
As we're transitioning, we'll have some
sections and offense and some

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.240
in the AW-139 until all the sections are
transitioned. We started the Frederick

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.460
section we went over to the easton

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.340
trooper six we then moved to Salisbury
trooper four

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.050
and we're currently at Southern
Maryland trooper seven.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.330
All seven sections will be operational
24/7 in the newly AW-139

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.610
in the military when they introduce a
new aircraft or airframe

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.290
they close complete squadron down, we
don't have that luxury we have to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.569
provide services to the citizens 24/7.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.959
So, we have to maintain the dual fleet we have
to keep

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.720
all sections available to the citizens
to have coverage throughout the state

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.330
and in doing so it requires maintenance
so some people way ask why are we

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.209
spending money

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.930
when we have these brain two helicopters
we need to be able to

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.300
have all sections operational and we
can't just put new helicopters in each

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.920
section

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.459
we have to transition it and it's
a process.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.640
Once the transition is completed we will
be turning over the Dauphins

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.290
to the Department of General Services
who will then

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.349
put the Dauphins up for sale. Now we
testified last year

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.319
at the General Assembly that we would
take up to 24 months to do this

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.519
transition, we're way ahead of schedule.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.500
Just to put that into perspective, the
last time we went through a transition

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.349
it took up to five years and that was
back in the late 80's early 90's to

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.099
transition from the bell

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.000
helicopter to the Dauphin. We can only
transition one section at a time

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.810
and during that time I mean you got
pilot training, you got medic training,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.170
you got

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.400
maintenance techs that required to
train a learning new aircraft so

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.640
each section has to go through that
process it's about safety safety is

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.230
priority in this command it should be
priority in

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.159
anybody's whose operating helicopters you gotta
go through a process to make sure

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.170
everyone is

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.439
at minimum competent to the minimum
standards

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.980
but we hope to exceed those standards.
The FAA does not mandate that we fly

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.500
this aircraft for two pilots we elected to
do that again because of safety concerns.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.500
This new aircraft has what they call
a glass cockpit.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.639
If we chose to fly this aircraft with
the one pilot we could have done it

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.060
just follow the guidance of the FAA but
instead we looked at it game the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.229
operational experience and realized that

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.050
you really should do this with two
pilots it's a safer way to operate the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.100
aircraft

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.949
it is something that everyone thats flying the AW-139s do

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.940
so we made a conscious decision that
it was best to fly with two pilots.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.850
There's been questions on whether we
should've refurbished the Dauphin fleet.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.009
To refurbish a Dauphin aircraft

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.500
it would cost us close to $150 million

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.270
to refurbish an aircraft to the standards
that we wanted

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.820
and it would've only had 80 percent
of the requirements that were

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.850
recommended

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.130
so if you look at it in that sense we
actually save money

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.180
by buying new and getting the latest

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.410
safety enhancements.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.289
We're always looking to keep safety in the
forefront a everything we do. 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.660
It's important to me, it's important to
the entire command, and it's important to the

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.870
citizen of Maryland to do this thing right

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.430
and then make sure that safety is
paramount.
