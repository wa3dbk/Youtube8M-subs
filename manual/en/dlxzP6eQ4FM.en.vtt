00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.350
&gt;&gt; JIM MARKEL: While the Air Boss has been a very successful product for us, as it grew we started getting
0:00:09.350,0:00:11.559
some of them returned and we found that women
0:00:11.559,0:00:16.910
were returning them. The reason for that was carrying the bag fully loaded on one
0:00:16.910,0:00:17.560
shoulder
0:00:17.560,0:00:20.190
was getting to be too much of a load. 
0:00:20.190,0:00:26.249
And so early attempts at bastardizing the Air Boss putting backstraps on it were an utter failure. 
0:00:26.249,0:00:28.300
So we went back to the drawing board. 
0:00:28.300,0:00:32.140
We consulted Doug Dyment from Onebag again. Out of that collaboration, 
0:00:32.140,0:00:33.740
the Sky Train was born. 
[pause]
0:00:33.740,0:00:37.360
The design of the Sky Train is actually a complete departure 
0:00:37.360,0:00:39.020
from the Air Boss. 
0:00:39.020,0:00:41.640
Whereas the Air Boss opens like a book, 
0:00:41.640,0:00:44.530
the Sky Train opens more like a backpack. 
0:00:44.530,0:00:49.350
And so that limited us from doing certain things. You end up with 2 compartments, 
0:00:49.350,0:00:50.390
instead of 3. 
[pause]
0:00:50.390,0:00:54.940
The main large compartment holds just as much as the Air Boss does, while the outter compartment 
0:00:54.940,0:00:57.280
is perfect for a rain slicker, 
0:00:57.280,0:01:00.660
and some lightweight gear. The Sky Train was developed for transitioning from the airplane
0:01:00.660,0:01:02.030
to the train, 
0:01:02.030,0:01:05.480
particularly in Europe. Due to the backpack nature design of the Sky Train, 
0:01:05.480,0:01:09.760
we had to limit it to 2 compartments. We have a main compartment and a secondary 
0:01:09.760,0:01:10.040
compartment 
0:01:10.040,0:01:14.670
that are cargo capacity. We also have another compartment here on the outside that's a flat 
0:01:14.670,0:01:16.110
storage. 
0:01:16.110,0:01:17.020
In the main compartment, 
0:01:17.020,0:01:21.520
which opens a bit differently than one might imagine. 
0:01:21.520,0:01:25.810
It actually pulls open and opens this way. 
0:01:25.810,0:01:30.280
You can still get nice clothes in here, a sport coat, dress shirts, I actually have enough 
0:01:30.280,0:01:32.030
stuff in here for a week. 
0:01:32.030,0:01:34.320
And then getting to the second compartment, 
0:01:34.320,0:01:36.410
is where I like to keep 
0:01:36.410,0:01:37.950
my weather gear 
0:01:37.950,0:01:39.250
whether it's 
0:01:39.250,0:01:41.640
a rain slicker or a light wool jacket, 
0:01:41.640,0:01:44.640
which is a good thing to have in the spring in Europe. 
0:01:44.640,0:01:48.800
You can still get quite a bit more stuff in this outer compartment as well. 
0:01:48.800,0:01:52.220
It has a foam stay here and another one in the bottom. 
0:01:52.220,0:01:55.070
Again lined with the 420 red nylon for 
0:01:55.070,0:01:57.040
keeping it bright on the inside.  
0:01:57.040,0:01:59.770
The outer compartment's good for undergarments
0:01:59.770,0:02:02.250
and socks, things like that. 
[pause]
0:02:02.250,0:02:06.510
The massive #10 YKK zippers require a bit of engagement to get them to open so we've 
0:02:06.510,0:02:09.659
added these Monkey Fists here so you can actually lift and 
0:02:09.659,0:02:11.240
pull the zippers open and 
0:02:11.240,0:02:12.540
pull them back closed. 
[pause]
0:02:12.540,0:02:13.889
There's a lock here 
0:02:13.889,0:02:16.439
that engages and disengages 
0:02:16.439,0:02:23.439
and will lock and will prevent zipper creep when it's engaged. You can actually get that thing in like that and not have it open. Pull it tight, let it sit. 
[pause]
0:02:25.909,0:02:29.579
The SKy Train has about 4 different ways you can carry it. 
0:02:29.579,0:02:31.379
Of course it has our claw shoulder strap, 
0:02:31.379,0:02:35.049
which is a proprietary product on all our Red Oxx bags. 
0:02:35.049,0:02:36.619
You can turn the bag this way and grab it 
0:02:36.619,0:02:40.709
by the top carry handle or you can carry it sideways as well. 
0:02:40.709,0:02:43.639
But what really makes this bag unique for the ladies, 
0:02:43.639,0:02:46.919
is the fact that you can pull out the 
0:02:46.919,0:02:51.339
shoulder strap system, clip it in here 
[pause]
0:02:51.339,0:02:52.859
and pull these tucked stowed away dog ears, clip it to the welded D-ring, 
0:02:52.859,0:02:59.859
like so. 
[pause]
0:03:02.349,0:03:03.609
Now you have a backpack.
[pause]
0:03:07.179,0:03:11.029
Throw that on your back, 
0:03:11.029,0:03:11.419
and you're off through customs.
