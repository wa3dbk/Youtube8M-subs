Hey, my name is Chelsea Bagozzi, with suburbanheresy.com,
and today, we're talking about beauty and

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.290
makeup tips, and right now, we've done all
of Nicole's makeup, and now, we're going to

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.860
talk about permanently taking it off, some
permanent makeup remover tricks. She has lashes

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.949
on, so we're going to take those off first,
and when you have on a lot of makeup, sometimes

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.410
it's hard to get it off, especially if you're
wearing like waterproof mascara, waterproof

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.500
eyeliner, stuff like that. It can be really
difficult to get off, so there's a few little

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.710
tips that can help you get it off. You've
got your makeup remover, but sometimes makeup

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.640
remover doesn't even take stuff off, and so
there's a few things that I like to use. I

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.239
like lotion. Lotion takes mascara off wonderfully.
You just rub it on underneath your eye, and

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.810
it will take off that black film, that tends
to fall right below the lash line, so when

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.239
you take off your lashes, you want to be careful,
because sometimes that lash glue, can stick

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.400
to your regular lashes, and you don't want
to pull any of your lashes out, so I'm just

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.319
going to softly pull this off, and then you
can always wash the makeup off, with your

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:20.410
favorite face wash, and you can try doing
that first. That's usually the best way to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.770
get off most of the makeup, but then to get
off the extra, the residue and all that other

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.990
stuff, you can use makeup remover wipes. That's
one of my favorite things to do, is I'll just

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:38.560
use some makeup remover wipes, and just rub
circular motions, to take it off, and when

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.330
you're taking off your eye makeup, you want
to make sure that you're taking it off from

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.100
the outside in, because if you're working
from the inside out, you're going to pull

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.000
that soft skin, that's very sensitive, and
you'll get wrinkles, and crow's feet, and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.590
stuff like that. It will really enhance the
aging of your skin, so you want to move from

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:13.450
the outside in, to remove that makeup. Close
your eyes, and same with the top, so we've

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.950
got half of that taken off. Then, you just
do the same thing on the other side, and then

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.120
when you've got that extra underneath, to
make sure your eyes, that sensitive skin under

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.780
your eyes doesn't get too irritated. Use a
little bit of lotion, and just rub that lotion

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.600
underneath, with a Qtip, and then just wipe
it off really softly with a tissue, and that

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.230
will take it right off.
