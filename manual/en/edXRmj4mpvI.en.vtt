00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:04.339
Hello everyone and welcome to this video
analysis of Gran Turismo 5 head tracking.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.860
Before showing you how it works, allow me to 
offer some advice about how to

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.890
set it up for the best results. The game
offers plenty of options to fiddle with

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.550
the most important factor is the
distance from the PS Eye

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.690
You need to sit fairly close to camera, the optimal distance being 
the camera they'll some of these

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.470
at about one meter or three feet.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.910
Also be sure to set the feel of utah
narrow by rotating them as far as on the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.390
psi department

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.370
now let's see what the second faced
angles and positions ranging options

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.949
touch-ups home obstacle come out with
her and for more on the respectively for

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.500
the purpose of these tvl i said they're
looking for max rock garden suggests

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
that they handled by due to around five
and leave the position one to ten

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.100
disgrace that immigration authorities
vertically some social the sensitivity

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.890
options that you would have to figure
we've yourself because he's affected by

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.429
it and i think we've come at a export of
insensitivity to volatile as perfectly

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.440
any variation directly from he is an
automatically conferences defacing of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.560
nations signed dr krummel's fuel to
change the size of the idea would be in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.680
that picture frame that their psi it was
stunned when fetching for struck

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.530
why you're not

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.650
techni small states position tracking
down the road to will become a point of

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.270
view freely the changing the prospective
also affects the new also will there be

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.630
a new york's which is quite beautiful as
beatles to keep the trees and cars and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.300
you when travelling to different
innovations as for angle trucking it's

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.750
pretty clear that he's a some sort of
that filming please which prevents come

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.920
adaptation effect on your head weeding
and angle of about fifteen degrees

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.170
species of course meant to prevent all
staff come a long winter when can

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.780
forward but it's probably too because of
its own seems so you are fostered

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.950
touristy they had much away from the
screen for even the smallest jeans with

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.960
the side interest in being able to be to
be cheese that sucking walk so if you

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.759
don't be fooled faces sorely needed by
date certain screen thanks with a high

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.330
sensitivity of the key aside

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.819
or and of course if walks also when we
come back

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.329
now the big question he's been tracking
dot three uses one fifty five hates this

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.780
cindy portable brown seemed determined
head

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.239
the sound out of the frontal peeled used
wiping out for a deep purple star or

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.930
that piece of information

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.870
to take it from problem

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.629
actually

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.439
small com appropriations bill clinton
had before

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.699
but they are prevented by the death of
and when you get past that

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:41.049
the camera reacts to abruptly and it's
one predictable

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.909
it's end of the day uses the position
tracking

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.119
habit than adaptation sucking the most
usable function following to rise that

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.989
you will at the moment or ahead of us at
www kicked off

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.049
actually i believe this is the most
interesting occasionally cindy's

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.079
specially modified some little places
with the low for a more complete

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.179
consulate after four deal that i didn't
just experiencing them instantly

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:08.719
distribution pleasing personal finance
four c would also be soulful safe on

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.959
four so silly silly stuff of sales

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.550
formality and he decides he doesn't need
to much of a defense

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.889
exactly does more harm than good

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.449
another thing to mention please that
obstructing is only available in the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.169
update mold of sixty-five with the
exception of the talk radio's screamo

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.919
i assume this is due to the system
resources required to make it work

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.169
instructor while ahead trucking is
possible at the beginning that leather

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:41.389
of their kid mold seem to raise it's
apparently eason at intermediate and

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.489
professional assert apparently because
it is a three possible to put on a head

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.589
trucking and electrical evans by these
have been deprived few with the patient

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:53.729
option which he stops and after being in
at eleven some have suggested that this

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:58.149
is so difficult for they don't want him
to be crowned beat stops its only

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:02.370
possible when their boat might help from
his own after that doesn't seem right

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.969
instant payment ground and the pixel
regardless using the left the field

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.830
someplace the first meeting so i a
confusing day at the forefront

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.520
using after fifteen

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.989
diseases as such is also seen the light
is not available as well and the more

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.570
sophisticated animals

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.480
finally fires making these people and
wanted to live by the effectiveness of

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.280
the psi is ahead tracking device

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.050
sulfite those fitted with a couple of pc
applications fifty-odd out about cong ty

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.129
successfully permit myself into welcomes
brian my head movements that this that's

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.719
perfectly even darkness

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:44.120
right

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.120
txt

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.930
sft before the reputation here alleles
for a new for more complex document

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.979
including iberostar and multitasking and
again this position i spoke to with the

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.620
extra sleep so if you were wondering
needs to be a size up to the task when

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.819
it comes to trucking plight unfilled
beds with a yes at least from an atlas

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.979
standpoint and assume u_s_ multiple far
from it

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.039
arising off with my funny face now
thanks for watching charles
