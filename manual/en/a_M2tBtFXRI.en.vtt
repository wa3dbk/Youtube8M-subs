00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.840
Today on BRStv we have episode twelve of our
Neptune apex series and we are going to go

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.870
over the control light option in apex fusion.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.270
Hi I'm Ryan host of BRStv where each week
we cover a new topic related to reefing.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.200
This week we are going to go over the light
option found in the control type drop when

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.630
programing an outlet on the apex fusion cloud
interface.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.560
Selecting light option will preload a bunch
of fields most people would commonly use for

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.500
controlling any type of light.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.640
For this video we will focus on your primary
lights for the aquarium.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.320
The first option is fallback and is asking
if the energy bar were to ever get disconnected

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.979
from the apex base unit would you want the
outlet to default to on or off?

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.780
In this case we would want the light to default
to off so we don't cook the corals if we were

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.199
away for a few days and this was to happen.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.639
Next option is the on time, select the time
you want the light to come on.

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:58.179
Depending on the type of tank and lighting
it is common for most people to maintain a

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.659
lighting period between eight and twelve hours.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.870
Most people who are closer to twelve have
lights that are capable of gradually increasing

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.470
throughout the day and dimming over the evening.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.360
They might also have multiple sets of lights
where the halides are on for eight hours and

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.840
some less intense lights like t5's are on
for dawn and dusk.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.430
The day light cycle also doesn't have to match
actual day time at your house either.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.960
I suggest figuring out a schedule that matches
your lifestyle so the lights are on when you

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.960
are home.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.970
For the sake of the video I am just going
to select nine o'clock.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.650
The time is displayed on a twenty four hour
clock so if I want to turn the lights off

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.760
at eight pm I would enter twenty here.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.719
The next option is shutdown probe.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.439
This is a feature that is capable of turning
off your lights based on the temperature of

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.520
your tank.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.390
Lights can be one of the biggest sources of
heat in the tank so if the tank were to overheat

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.149
because it was a hot day, your chiller failed
or someone turned off your homes AC this could

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.320
save the tank by turning off the lights, you
could of coarse also set up an email alarm

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.950
to notify you as well.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.540
Most of you will only have one option and
it will say temp.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.400
I have a second option showing here because
I have two temp probes on the system, the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.520
one labeled x5 is attached to my pm2 salinity
module and not the one we want to use in this

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.520
case.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.740
Select the one that says just temp.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.430
Shut down value is the temp where I want it
to turn off the lights.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.250
This is up to you but most people will likely
set it one to two degrees above where they

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.440
want their take to be.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.350
In this case I am going to set it to 80 degrees.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.360
If this is your first time programing a controller
hysteresis might be a somewhat foreign word

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.120
to you and certainly how it applies here.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.880
Basically this is just how long you want to
keep the light off once the controller triggers

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.930
a shutdown based on high temp.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.800
If there wasn't a hysteresis option the light
would just keep turning off and on as the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.280
tank goes from 79.9 to 80 and then falls again.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.090
This would be pretty bad for your lights as
well as be pretty annoying visually.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.760
By default it says 30 minutes which means
the lights will stay off for a minimum of

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.380
thirty minutes which makes much more sense.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.840
Hit send to Apex and your light outlet will
be programmed moments later.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.760
One thing you should note is this control
interface is really just writing command lines

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.760
for you.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.020
If you go back to the outlet you can see the
lines of code it wrote for you by hitting

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.020
the advanced tab.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.450
If you would like to do something a bit more
advanced like use the I/O switch box to turn

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.680
the on or off based on a hard button you could
add some additional command lines here, something

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.890
we will come back to in the future.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.390
