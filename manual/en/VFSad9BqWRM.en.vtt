00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.630
Hey guys, Dr. Josh Axe here, Doctor of Functional
Medicine and Nutritionist.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.740
One of the most common questions I get is
how much protein should I consume a day.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.849
Protein is essential for building muscle,
for burning fat, for supporting metabolism,

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.470
and even the health of certain organs like
your thyroid and adrenal glands.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.880
We need protein to heal and to be healthy.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.720
In this video, I'm going to share with you
exactly how much protein you need per day.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.890
And that answer is, if you're asking me that
question, how much protein should you have

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.330
per day is, it really depends on what your
health goals are.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.970
I'm going to break things down into three
categories.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.870
Number one, how much protein do you need on
a regular basis to generally heal and for

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.530
your body to regenerate?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.630
Number two, how much protein do you need to
burn fat?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.170
And number three, how much protein do you
need to build muscle per day?.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.290
In general, if you just want to have general
health and longevity, doing about 50% of your

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.670
body weight in grams of protein per day is
about what you want.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.009
Let's say you weigh 160 pounds.

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.930
If you weigh 160 pounds and you're looking
to be generally healthy, what I'd recommend

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.329
is having about 80 grams of protein a day
in your diet.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.540
So if you're eating, let's say, three meals
a day, you're going to be getting about 25

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.509
grams of protein per meal.

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.670
That's going to really get you to where you
need to be in terms of the amount of protein

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.959
you need in your diet.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.259
The second one is, let's say you're trying
to really burn fat fast and you want to get

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.689
that body fat off.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.240
In that case, about 0.7 grams to 0.75 grams
of protein a day is ideal for overall burning

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.240
fat.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.829
Because you're going to replace some of those
extra carbohydrates in your diet and get more

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.779
protein in during this period of time when
you're trying to burn more fat.

00:01:55.779 --> 00:02:02.729
In that case, again, if you weigh 160 pounds
times 0.75, you're going to do closer to 100

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.619
to maybe 120 grams of protein a day if you're
trying to really burn fat.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.820
If you're going to eat, let's say four meals
a day where you're trying to burn fat, 25

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.739
to 30 grams of protein three times a day is
the ideal amount that you're going to be getting

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.790
if you're looking to really burn fat.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.370
Let's say you're trying to build muscle.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.459
You're trying to build more muscle tone, or
you're trying to build muscle in general.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.829
You want to actually take your weight and
take that times one.

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.600
Eat that many grams of protein a day.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.790
Let's say you weigh 160 pounds and you're
wanting to pack on some muscle.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.129
Then, you should be trying to get 160 grams
of protein a day.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.599
What that might look like if you're eating
five meals a day or let's say, four meals

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.939
a day, you're going to be trying to get 40
grams of protein per meal.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.689
That's how much protein you need per day.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:53.820
Again, it really depends.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.530
Is your goal for general health?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.110
In that case, half your body weight in grams
of protein.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.739
If your goal is fat burning, 0.7 to 0.75 grams
of protein.

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.670
Then, if your goal is to build muscle, you
need an equal amount of grams of protein a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.200
day to your body weight if you're going to
actually build muscle.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.329
Again, remember these benefits of protein.

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.390
I mean, protein is so important for building
lean musculature tissue.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.420
It's also very important for organ function.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.060
In fact, a lot of your organs, cells, and
tissues require protein for proper regeneration.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.049
So, if you're really trying to heal...

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.069
There are actually studies out there that
if you have burns or cuts on your body that

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.019
you actually need more protein intake.

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.420
So if you ever have a severe burn or an injury,
your body actually needs more protein during

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.420
those times.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.719
Some of the best forms of protein to get are
things like grass fed beef, wild caught chicken

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.859
and turkey, and free range eggs.

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.760
High quality grass fed protein powder, like
a good quality whey protein, is also great

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.760
to get.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.299
One of my favorites is collagen protein which
are actually amino acids.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.340
Doing collagen is another great form of protein,
easily absorbable and digestible.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.420
Those are good sources of protein.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.749
Then really, also, you're going to get some
protein from high quality nuts and seeds like

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.340
chia seeds, flax seeds, and almonds.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.049
Also, in certain types of beans, you're going
to get some protein.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.810
Even certain grains like oats have lower to
moderate levels of protein as well.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.800
But really be conscious of that this week.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.740
Look at how much protein are you getting on
a regular basis, what are your health goals?

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.550
And based on your health goals, consume those
amounts of protein a day.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.010
I hope you guys have enjoyed this video on
how much protein you should consume per day.
