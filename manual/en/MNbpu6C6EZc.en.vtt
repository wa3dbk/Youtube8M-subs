00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.049
I'm Joe Weisenfelder with cars dot com
were enrolled we wrote a raceway in the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.640
savannah georgia check it out the twenty
thirteen Audi RS5

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.250
if the A5 group is a good
enough for you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.179
and the S five coupe isn't enough for
you

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.129
i recommend the RS 5

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.820
what about the war grasso

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.090
fraud and his partly due to the giant

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.480
all of which are functional

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.370
they are cooling

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.880
aids four point two leader v_-eight
engine which they managed to jam in here

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.510
that differs from the s five which has a
three liter v six supercharged this one

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.170
is naturally aspirated when you get here
is four hundred fifty horsepower as

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.480
opposed to three thirty three in the s
five

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.860
out he's asahara's vehicles used to have

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.649
actual inside mir's unfortunately those
days are over

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.949
of the pretty good

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.530
fake facsimile though

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.470
ourselves sits about point eight-inch
lower

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.180
then the eight five

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.280
tumbled nineteen inch wheels

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.860
uh... standard these are the optional
twenty answers

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.680
pearly he's url summer performance tires
really good stuff

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.710
on the brakes have fourteen point four
and rotors alone if they are cross

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.500
drilled vented

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.870
amber waves statement mostly about

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.040
didn't wait

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.080
uh... and also to norma brake calipers

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.980
eight pistons

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.170
for the front wheels the rear wheels

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.180
not as interesting to look at

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.520
not of interest and for the design

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.070
yeah respond haven't automated motorized
spoiler in the back that goes up for a

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.640
more downforce at high speeds

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.010
exclusive to the i_r_s_ by business

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.880
rather aggressive diffuser

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.470
and leasing global

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.509
help life

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.860
s five

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.030
on each side and this dark finishes
actually parts of the sport

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.160
it's not

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.400
option which is a thousand dollars

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.220
there's certain things in the interior
that are specific to the i_r_s_ five

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.489
like the carbon fiber and waiting for us

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.339
but really what this car is about is the
driving experience you can look at the

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:19.489
specifications and feature list and say
oh that must be a great performance car

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.419
and it's not necessarily so in this case
the car really works

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:30.479
sounds terrific has lots of coal even
though on the enough it as lust for at

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:35.069
low rpm then the s five does with its
supercharge the sex

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.249
uh... the transmission unlike yes five
which has a manual in this case is

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.769
eighty seven speed

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.319
unabated

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.799
so you can drive in an automatic mode

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.909
regular dr or bullet target sport note

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.199
form of raises the sharepoint

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.439
uh... makes the tolerated no more

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.269
sensitive

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.869
uh... and also gives it terrific

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:59.969
park stone when u decelerate even if
you're not touching the sticker shipping

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.529
manually it will balance should through
the gears and parking time of the ground

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:06.989
and if you want

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.169
shift manually either with the stick or
with petals on the steering wheel

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.239
my favorite aspect of this car uh... is
the all-wheel drive system which is more

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.579
advanced than any other version

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.809
uh... mainly

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.289
what it does is it gives you

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:22.520
forty percent of the court

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.330
for wilson sixty percent to the rear
even looking shift more foreign

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.089
investment starts out with that

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.010
but that gives you is

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.379
at all times you get much more control
over the rear end using the throttle

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.639
you get good dynamics and balance

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.769
really good stuff across the board

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.409
i settle up is a more powerful version

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.009
the s five coming tell the i_r_s_ five
i'm sure it'll be quicker and all that

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.589
stuff

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:54.049
but actually i was way more press for
the them back in the first few miles i'd

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.799
already fall in love with it

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.269
and it's partly because of however they
worked so well together

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.369
uh... the powertrain the brakes the
dynamic field will drive system at all

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.790
just feels so cohesive

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.719
uh... it knocked me out pretty quickly

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.529
and that's something for me to say about
a car that doesn't have a manual

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.179
transmission

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:14.129
happily texas one out
