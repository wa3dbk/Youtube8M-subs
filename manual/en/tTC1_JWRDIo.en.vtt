00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm gonna play ???. . . . again.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'll give it a try.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
[Ben Lee: Singing] I'm in surgery. It's an emergency.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It just occurred to me . . .

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Ironically I caught a disease.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
They take a piece of me. Enjoy the scenery.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.800
Counting back from ten, but I will never fall asleep.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.000
I refuse to go numb. I refuse to go numb. I refuse to go numb.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let the music come, let the music come, let the music come . . .

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.700
I'm writing pop songs. Done it for so long  . . .

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.000
Sometimes I dream about a chorus that's so clever, it's dumb.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And now they're telling me . . . the music industry.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You can stay if you behave . . . Be a good boy go to sleep.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But, I refuse to go numb, I refuse to go numb, I refuse to go numb, numb.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Let the music come, let the music come, let the music come . . .

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I refuse to go numb, I refuse to go numb, I refuse to go numb, numb.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Let the music come, let the music come, let the music come . . .

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:51.000
[Guitar]

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So if you're asking me, what you mean to me . . .

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This is a dream to me . . . a theme to me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I gotta believe in what you're telling me.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.500
In what you''re selling me.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.000
In what's compelling me to feel, the only reason I need.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Here comes the drum beat, I'm moving my feet . . .

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The only reason I need . . . the only reason I need, the only reason I need.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.800
And a guitar chord. I feel so sure.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.000
The only reason I need.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The only reason I need.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I refuse to go numb, I refuse to go numb, I refuse to go numb, numb . . .

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Let the music come, let the music come, let the music come . . .

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I refuse to go numb, I refuse to go numb, I refuse to go numb, numb . . .

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Let the music come, let the music come, let the music come.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Let the music come , let the music come, let the music come.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Let the music come, let the music come, let the music come.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.000
