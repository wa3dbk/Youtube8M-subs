00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.822
This is the second gen Seat Leon.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:21.845
Seat's styling varies
from gen to gen.

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:26.192
I think this car is OK.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:34.956
A bit sporty, strong engines, and
looks reflecting the Spanish temper.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.118
This gen Leon has a spacious,
light interior.

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:41.971
A nice car to sit in.

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:50.830
However, the finish (plastic interior)
got better after the facelift in 2009,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.714
but the Audi driver
won't get jealous.

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:58.931
The Spanish temper
got into the engines.

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:05.757
A lot of different types were available,
with a lot of horsepower as well.

00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:13.176
Going up 'til 306 hp,
but we'll get back to that later.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:20.481
Great diesels too, 'til 168 hp, so the
sporty driver can go to Seat as well.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.100
ENGINES
gasoline

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.650
ENGINES
diesel

00:01:36.182 --> 00:01:40.091
There's 800 of this gen
Seat Leon on AutoScout.

00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:43.554
About 60% has a gasoline engine.

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:49.560
The DSG, which was available on
the Leon as well, is a rare feature.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.342
Not a lot can be found.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
PRICES
minimum, average, maximum

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:07.144
Luxury is a rarity in a Leon. Leather
upholstery, Xenon, etc. are more exotic. 

00:02:07.495 --> 00:02:10.698
About 25% have satnav, though.

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:16.806
Powerful engines are available,
even as a second-hand car.

00:02:17.168 --> 00:02:23.325
Over 25% have more than 148 hp,
7% has more than 197 hp.

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:26.415
That's unusual in this class.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:36.539
The Spanish temper has disadvantages
as well. The Leon isn't problem-free.

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:40.647
Some things are minor,
other things are bigger.

00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:44.277
The door rubbers, for example,
leak frequently.

00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:51.295
The 1.4 naturally aspirated 84 hp
engine doesn't have enough power.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.571
The ignition coils in the gasoline
engines are fragile and break often.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.262
During the test-drive, check if
the ABS / ESP light is off.

00:03:02.912 --> 00:03:06.392
The control unit breaks down often,
making the light switch on.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.375
Make sure that when you switch it off
yourself with the button between the seats,

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.094
the light will switch on again.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.974
Then there's a number of issues
with certain engines.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.825
The 306 hp version, a limited edition
in black or white with chip-tuning,

00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:28.340
was made exclusively
for the Dutch market.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.042
There's been a lot of complaints.
It didn't have the power etc.

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:42.400
Ask yourself whether you want a
tuned engine, and not just in the Leon.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.422
Does it have the power
output they say it has?

00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:50.991
Products from the Volkswagen Group
have issues with timing chains.

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:54.424
It's a fragile part
with all TSI engines.

00:03:54.683 --> 00:03:59.024
When you hear a diesel-like
rattle on a cold start,

00:03:59.362 --> 00:04:02.553
something may be wrong
with the timing chain.

00:04:02.803 --> 00:04:08.605
The chain makes sure everything
in the engine is in sync.

00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:12.271
If this is't the case, there'll
be major engine damage.

00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:13.791
You'll want to prevent that.

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:18.022
A lot of cars have had adjustments,
but ask about this.

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:20.676
Another issue has to
do with the drivers.

00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:25.167
The strong, fast engines
draw a young crowd.

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:31.348
Check for worn tires, brakes,
and how the car is maintained.

00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:40.569
This car is fun. 2 liter TFSI with
197 hp, a pretty blue color.

00:04:41.354 --> 00:04:43.667
A car can be colorful.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.707
It's a nice edition, drives well,
and is certainly quick enough.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.400
THIS CAR

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.300
Thanks to
Auto Borchwerf B.V.
