this is an updated video about my how to
fix your screen recorder no one else

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.800
required your your sound recorder and
Windows XP this is only for XP users I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.110
do not have this so right here so I'm
recorder I'm going to teach you how to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.449
fix this so that you can hear sound out
of it this will only take about like

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.019
three minutes if your I'm problems
alright first you want to do you just

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.479
want to double click on your volume icon
in your notification area or you can go

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.659
into all programs accessories&gt;
entertainment&gt;volume control

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.200
yeah it's just gonna open it up again so
I'm just gonna close it okay what do you

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.100
want to do you don't have to worry about
any of this if you want to have some of

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.660
your sound seems like right now just
leave it stay here for a while so like

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.820
if you want to adjust it like mine you
can

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.600
okay pause the video if you need it
through so what you want to do now go to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.119
properties recording now be sure that
mono mix is checked

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:53.430
be sure the rest are checked okay now to
record it you turn your microphone is up

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.000
by the way if you have one this is what
how loud you want to be IF THIS

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.950
IS LIKE THIS it's to be crazily loud I would have
it right about in there for compatible

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.489
use if you want to have a powder if
you're trying to record a song but you

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.540
can't find it put it in there and just
amplify it that's all you got to do so

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.209
yeah pretty self-explanatory after you
do that then just record something like

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:30.989
a sound effect will somewhat and if it
works if it this still doesn't work then

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:40.720
I have a feeling that your own computer
might be a little messed up so alright

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.680
yeah so if you just wanted to record a
song that you were looking for

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.210
everywhere for just first record and it
should show like a little this green bar

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:58.540
of ieaving up and down like mess dust
like it bounced that means it recorded

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:08.440
so listen test that was my voice yes I
know it sounds silly but yeah if you

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.130
want to organize my desktop organize
your desktop I can and um it's just

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.420
asked me if I want to save it
no all right and that's all you got do

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.280
you guys it's pretty self-explanatory so
if you need help again I will upload

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.240

intro like like my video now and I hope
