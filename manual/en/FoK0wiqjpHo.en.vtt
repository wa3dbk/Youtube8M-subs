I'm in the kitchen at Colorado State
University and today I'm going to show

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.420
you how to prepare fresh ginger. Okay
when preparing fresh ginger you can do

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.340
it in one of two ways-- you can either cut
and dice the ginger, or you can use a

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.600
zester and zest it. First, I will show you
how to cut and dice. So. you take the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.050
section of ginger that you need, let's
say you need about an inch and you cut

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.800
that chunk off. When preparing fresh
ginger, you can peel it if you prefer, but

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.640
you don't have to. So if you want to peel
it, you could do the peel it with a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.200
paring knife and cut down nicely like
this. Or, you can use a spoon, and just go

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:53.879
ahead and pull the skin off, as such, like
that--but you do not need to peel it. Then

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:03.750
what you will want to do, is cut your
ginger in slices. You'll cut the entire

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.310
piece of your ginger. When complete you
stack the slices on top of each other,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:18.299
and you can cut in really tiny slices or
strips. Line the strip's up, and then you

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.229
can make a nice dice. So if you choose to
grate your ginger, you're going to take

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.299
your zester or microplane. And when doing this it's a lot easier if your ginger,

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.630
your piece of fresh ginger, is frozen
because it makes the fibers a lot harder.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.460
So then you're going to take your fresh
end of the ginger, and just gently grate

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.939
it along your microplane until you have
the desired amount that you need.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.329
It's as simple as that!
