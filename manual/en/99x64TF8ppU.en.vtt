Hello I'm Doctor Mike. This is Mandy, and
this is Cookie. And today, we want to teach

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.340
you how to clean your pet's ears properly.
And to do this, we need to get in the habit

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.070
of looking into our pets' ears. We need to
determine what is normal so that if we see

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.880
changes, such as wax, or debris, or inflammation,
or even an abnormal smell. These may be signs

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.730
of an infection. If your pet does have an
infection, your veterinarian will actually

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.210
prescribe a very specific treatment plan,
and maybe even a specific cleaner for you

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.220
to go home and use as a maintenance. If there
is no infection and you want to go ahead and

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.910
work with a routine cleaning, this is really
simple. So to get started, we're going to

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.390
need an ear cleaner. There are many types
of ear cleaners, both over the counter and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.100
there's also prescription ones. So once we
have our cleaner, we can go ahead and pick

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.480
something like a cotton ball, you can use
a soft tissue, whatever it is that's easy

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.000
and gentle on the ears. So we want to apply
our cleaner, and we'll go ahead and lift the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.070
earflap, also known as the ear pinna. And
we want to clean just in the top areas, the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.850
areas that we can see, and so just wiping
in here and cleaning. We don't want to do

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.729
routine cleaning down in the canal, you don't
ever want to stick an instrument, don't use

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.460
q-tips. Sometimes your pet may actually have
an infection, and it may require a deeper

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.170
cleaning. Now we need to be careful when we're
pouring a solution down into the canal, as

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.810
this could be damaging if there is a problem
with the eardrum, like if the eardrum is ruptured,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.080
and that can happen. So your only going to
do a deeper cleaning at the advice and direction

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.670
of your veterinarian. So to get started, again,
we want to lift up the earflap, and we're

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.570
going to go ahead and just flush a little
solution down there, and then we can go ahead

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.920
and massage the canal gently. And then, I'll
let them go ahead and shake their head, so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.930
it's a good idea to maybe do this outside,
and after, again I will grab the cotton ball,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.259
and this time I don't need to saturate it
because all the solution is here. Just going

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.459
to clean what's up here. Once again, don't
use a q-tip, no instruments down into the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.280
canal at any time. And this is pretty simple
and you can do this at home on a routine basis,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.150
whether it's weekly or twice a month, and
again at the advice of your veterinarian.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.400
So whether you're doing a routine ear cleaning
or a deeper ear flush, it's very simple as

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.870
long as you're following the necessary precautions.
I hope that this information was helpful to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.489
you today, and thank you for watching.
