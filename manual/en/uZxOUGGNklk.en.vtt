00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.820
This the front front brake rotor and axle
setup on my 82 one ton GMC.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.780
I just finished putting the new rotor and
rebuilt hub on here.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.740
The old rotors were worn very unevenly so
some speculation that either my caliper was

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.989
not sliding or the brake hose had collapsed
internally.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.449
These brake lines, who knows when they were
replaced last so I need to get them gone and

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.609
get something reliable on there.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.170
what I've already done is disconnected the
brake hose at the caliper and let that drain

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.640
into a bucket.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.109
Rather than, if you disconnect it up here
with fluid in the line, I think it would just

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.339
run down the frame rail.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.390
So this was a little bit cleaner.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.980
Disconnect the caliper and let that drain
first.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.680
On the outside of the frame in the wheel well,
you see the hose...

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.710
This clip comes from between the frame and
the fitting.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.640
This clip holds the hose so it doesn't slide
in.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.979
The hex fitting on the hose matches a hex
cutout in the frame so that the hose can't

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.140
turn.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.850
Here's what it looks like on the inside of
the frame rail.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.110
You can see the hard line here.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.829
Right here, the inside part is the hose end
coming through the frame,

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:44.750
and this is the nut, the brake line fitting
that is screwed into the hose.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.439
These connections can be extremely difficult
to get off on these old trucks.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.479
This one is giving me a little bit of trouble
but we're getting it out.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.490
Between the end of the brake line hose and
the frame is a metal clip that I've already

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.490
taken out.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.850
I'll show you that in a minute.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.210
That keeps the hose from going through the
frame.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.900
Here we are back on the outside of the frame
rail.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.590
The technique that I found that worked for
me, is to cut the hoses off as close as you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.310
can up here.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.150
I'm just using a pair of dikes/wire cutters.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.910
You're not goign to reuse the old hose anyway.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.400
They cut alarmingly easy.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.850
Then you can get a 6 point or a 12 point regular
wrench on there and get a realy good hold

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.600
of it.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.480
Since you've got the clip on this side and
the other side out, the fitting is loose so

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.580
you can move it around.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:02.620
What worked for me was use the wrench on the
outside and a vice-grip on the inside flare

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.100
nut.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.130
I used a line wrench on the inside and that
did not work for me since they were so tight.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.320
You can see I've go the hose end off finally.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.680
It faught me but finally broke free.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:23.330
This is the hex shaped hole in the frame and
it just grips the hex part of the hose.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.930
This is the end that the hard line screws
into through the frame like this.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.950
So I've got the brake hoses of the truck.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.970
Here's the old hose of course.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.040
It's really not in that great of shape.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.400
Who knows how old they are.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.760
Here's the end that came off and the clip
that goes on the outside of the frame rail

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.850
and here's the clip that goes ont he inside
of the frame rail.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.750
I didn't show that coming off but...

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.770
I decided to replace them with some extended
lines from ORD.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.190
Offroad Design.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.890
These are good for up to a 6 inch lift.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.560
I don't have a lift on the truck right now
but I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.560
future.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.680
These are teflon in the core, and then kevlar,
and then stainless steel and then a plastic

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.229
coating over that.

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.380
Real quality lines.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.210
The ORD kit comes with obviously the two front
but also comes with the extended rear.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.750
I'm not going to put that on right now but
sometime soon.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.710
Like I said before, these brake hoses on these
old trucks can be difficult to get off.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.810
I started off trying a line wrench which is
excellent for fuel lines or brake lines where

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.470
you can't get a closed ended wrench around
it.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.879
I could tell that this was going to start
rounding it off...

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.819
So I progressed on to some vice-grips.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.460
This model was recommended on the internet.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.580
It works pretty well for holding the brake
line nuts but in the end I did have to use

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.199
a bigger, regular vice-grip.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:16.229
Then on the outside I used a 12 point or a
6 point wrench.

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:26.689
Another thing is, you should definitely soak
these brake line fittings in a penetrant.

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.240
This is PB Blaster.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.990
WD40 is not really that great as a penetrant
but there are some other ones out there that

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.459
are good.
