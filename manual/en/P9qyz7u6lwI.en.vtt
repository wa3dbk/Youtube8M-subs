official cast members in Star Wars Episode 7 so this is gonna be a break down of who they are

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.120
I also included some other rumors
based on their characters but I'll have

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.929
a spoiler the fold in case you guys
don't wanna hear about that stuff

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.300
I can imagine how many people are
pounding the internet to find out at

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.089
Lucasfilm

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.539
end is near gonna sell these as actual
trading cards I wouldn't be surprised

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.380
that they did something to collectors
edition situation

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.829
expect a lot of fun anniversary stuff I
mean this is the first new Star Wars

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.720
film in a long time so get there prolly
gonna be doing a lot of special

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.720
merchandising

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.310
it would not be star wars have been
inside Sheila toys I will freely admit

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.440
to shouting shut up and take my money

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.560
okay so starting up for the cast John
Willie aka

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.750
playing the storm trooper fin mystery
person actor and confirm playing Kyler

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.120
rent the dark jet I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.340
part sit where everyone to think about
him we'll talk about in a sec during

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.860
rumors he could be an Inquisitor

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.460
when im Parkin top explanatory Oscar
Isaac

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.860
playing Pokemon who seems kinda like the
new wedge antilles Daisy really playing

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.570
rain

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.729
BB 88 is the name in the soccer droid
that everyone's been laughing about

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.819
it's been referred to as a gendered
female droid

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.840
just like c3po as beauties like a male
droid

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.840
and then there are also cards for the ex
wings in formation

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.579
in the new storm troopers those are
likely just to confirm that but we're

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.729
seeing our storm troopers and X-wing

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.719
I saw some people commenting at the
expense of the little bit like the 95

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.490
headhunters

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.499
soon as we get into the rumor mill so
just general

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.259
spoiler warning: these are just rumors
so I don't like it inspired but just in

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:32.729
case

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.709
starting with John Bowie is character so
he is the rumor protagonist the film I

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:38.079
mean

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.350
it's an ensemble cast so there's gonna
be alarming characters but

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.740
he's like what you would view Luke Scott
Walker as in the original trilogy

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.090
he is a stormtrooper so clearly he
starts out in the Empire

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.159
force awakens meaning he hears a call of
sorts

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.240
like they learned about the force or
something like the force

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.439
and seek out Luke Scott Walker to learn
more about it he joined by Ray who's

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.719
rumored to be a scavenger

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.859
heading out under a pseudonym on the
planet like tattooing is not confirmed

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:04.810
to be tied to wean

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.799
but that big looking modified pod racer
that she's driving looks like it's just

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.080
used for hauling cargo

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.280
because all the broken Padres reports in
the background to the trailer

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.710
I am thinking that this is data wean
she's rumor

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.770
to be the daughter upon a layer or 12
their children

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.710
the other one being Adam driver but
that's unconfirmed this trade your BB

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.830
88 is rumored to be hers I think that
idea stands out

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.560
just because all the broken Padres are
parts not a scrap metal in the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.230
background

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.670
she pry use it for a number things just
like Duke used r2d2 and c3po for

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.650
various tasks the scene with the packing
is rumored to be theirs Cape John Boy

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.120
again Daisy release escape

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.410
with Han Solo and chewy front add to
wean but when they're going off to find

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.930
Luke

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.970
very similar to episode four when
they're leaving amid blaster fire we

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.610
don't really know the time line the
movie is but I would guess this comes

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.790
early on because the movie is supposed
to involve the search for Luke Scott

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.450
Walker

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.540
code Amran obviously Republic fighter
he's also rumored to be four sensitive

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.220
but it's almost like they're setting up
a new trilogy have heroes like give John

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.890
Boyett

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.450
Daisy Ridley in now Oscar Isaac so they
give them is like the Luke on in layer

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.550
%uh this new trilogy so fingers crossed
into them die but

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.840
I had a feeling that the focus will
shift to their characters from the old

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.180
characters in this first movie

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.890
it'll be like a transition movie and I
think I said in my previous video but

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.860
these explains

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.530
are rumored to be flying over Mon column
re: it could be any planet

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.570
but thats rumored to be where Luke Scott
Walker is hiding out

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.520
response to see the plan in the movie
isn't confirmed as to how it's going to

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.720
Pier House gonna be featured

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.210
but it is a really exciting place that
we haven't seen on-screen

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.980
something good like James Cameron's
Avatar and the way they should the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.820
jungle like this

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.190
you know vastly different amazing new
place just forget about the prequel

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.060
underwater Duncan society it's not gonna
look like that there's also a lot more

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.090
rumors about India circuses character

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.330
as it applies to the villains in this
movie so it's rumored

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.960
that he is not connected to the set his
plan on human character

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.130
that's really really old like thousands
of years old predates albertine

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.430
and he was using powerful team for some
dark purpose that will learn about

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.010
supposedly he's not going to appear in
the first film at all like you'll be a

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.810
voice-over

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.880
will get was over but he won't appear to
the second film which

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.310
is very much like with the Ember did in
the original trilogy

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.720
with tom is a hologram in the first film
and then we saw I'm for real in the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.640
second film

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.140
so in the circus is not going to be the
Emperor is not gonna be pal between

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.470
to be something much more grand much
more alien much more mysterious

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.820
so I'm actually really excited about
that solid is rumored but you can let me

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.440
know he's my big question for you guys

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.250
what do you think about the idea any
circuses character

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.360
being something much more ancient in
this set

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.980
no napping as that character but working
some grand design with the force

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.280
I am says there's a huge fan too many
circles I cannot wait to see what he

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.620
looks like and what he does

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.660
he's the king a motion-capture the fact
that Saleh rent is a male sounding name

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.960
and explodes the res pic Brendan christy
is playing that dark jet I

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.390
she is rumored to be Inquisitor though
inquisitors dark tonight

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.430
said characters all very different we
don't really know what the role thus it

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.870
is going to be in his new movie D may
not be present at all

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.530
seeking his call this character building
the lightsaber whenever you want C Mikko

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.560
bear had some funny comment about the
Cross card lightsaber to

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.600
he decided that blade actually goes
through the hilt

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.360
so it really is like a three-way played
like it doesn't have to separate plate

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.240
sticking out

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.610
you just saying that in response to the
criticism that a separate lightsaber

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.460
we just slice right through when the
site hilts I someone's hand kind of

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.690
I really do like all the talk about the
lightsaber is funny how much people got

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.600
crazy about it

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.419
you can let me know your opinion is
about it I'm kinda along for the ride

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.880
some withholding judgment till I see is
more footage

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.450
I'm not expecting to see new trailers
until we get closer to celebration

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.580
I think those shots an exclusive footage
at convention and that is something for

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.400
Star Wars day

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.780
may be attached trailer to vendors to

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.660

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.979
