What'sup Guys

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.060
Today the new MacPro is available for purchase
in the on-line Apple Stores.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.240
Some people are going to have a really nice
Christmas i guess.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.369
If you were doubting to buy the MacPro or
put it on your wishlist for Santa.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.099
I'm going to compare the new MacPro to the
latest 27 inch iMac to help creative users

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.349
make a better decision.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.919
After three years Apple finally updated the
MacPro.

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.159
I'll have links for all the specs in the description
below.

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.039
Apple made a beautiful website and video to
explain it's power.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.620
You can attach up to three 4K displays or
6 Thunderbolt displays.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.969
But why would someone want to do that...?

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.270
Well, if you want 6 screens instead of a beamer
or a big tv to watch movies at home....

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.690
Noo.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.690
That's not it.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.809
The MacPro is made for professionals.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.960
Users like Software, Movie or Game developers.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.719
They use software and complex rendering for
simulations or editing.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.239
With the most advanced hardware available
it becomes easier and faster for them to work.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.080
But, if you're a creative user you would think.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.780
This MacPro is not for me.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.320
It doesn't have a screen and it costs 3000
dollars.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.670
and,
The iMac for example has a screen, is probably

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.210
fast enough, and the best one costs 2000 dollars.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.530
So you should go for the iMac right?

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.530
You can also say.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.520
Buying the MacPro makes you future proof for
the next 4 years or more.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.520
As for the iMac.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.950
It would probably take at least 4 years to
be where the MacPro is today.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.140
So it depends,
If you have plans for future or want to become

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.960
a heavy user and you're not feeling like you
want to upgrade your hardware every two years.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.659
I think the Mac Pro is a better investment.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.190
Buying the 2000 dollar iMac already tells
me you like to get creative and do some video

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.190
editing or designing.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.539
With an iMac you're good to go.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.310
But if you're planning to edit feature length
movies in future, You definitely want a MacPro.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.149
So I hope you now know a little bit better
what to choose.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.149
If you do.

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.149
Please give a thumbs up.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.640
If you have any more questions about you're
decision, please let me know in the comments

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.640
