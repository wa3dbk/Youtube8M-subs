00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.089
Hello Friends, today we will make an  ice cream.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.249
An ice cream with only 2 ingredients.

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.259
It did not take sugar, and it is a mango ice cream.

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.100
and the truth is that it was almost a finding.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.480
It was really rich, we all loved the ice cream.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.749
Because the truth is that we always have many people who test the 
 things done in the channel.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.360
and the truth is that it was an unanimous opinion:
Exquisite.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.170
So I invite you to see the ingredients
and then the  preparation.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.500
The ingredients for ice cream are:

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
1 cup frozen mango.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.700
This is a mango that  we cut it into small squares 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.500
We put in these storage bags.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.200
and leave for 12 hours in the freezer.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.090
This is a cup of frozen banana.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.000
we also did the same,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.810
we cut it into thin sheets.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.900
We put in these storage bags.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.160
and leave for 12 hours in the freezer.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.200
I suggest that half an hour before
to make ice cream.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.850
It removed from the freezer.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.900
so that the processor work faster.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.770
Friends, the preparation is as follows:

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.100
in a food processor, let placing
sheets frozen banana.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.400
and the mango

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.000
This is an important fact.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.050
This is a fresh mango, we cut it and freeze it.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.400
we cover the processor, and  process.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.400
and there I suggest that, from time to time,
You are opened processor.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.810
and go redistributing the fruit.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.810
to be wheel well all,
or go down.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.200
we cover
and continue processing.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.400
Until, is completely converted into a puree.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.709
which obviously has the appearance of an ice cream.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.519
You can see there.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.289
We put in this well,
especially for ice cream.

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:29.100
and I try it, because we really are going to love it.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.700
We decorate the end, with
a little slice of  mango

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.200
and is perfect.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.200
Good Friends, as you see,
the ice cream is very simple to do.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.500
Prepare it, you will love it.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.899
There are periods when the mango is at a very good price.

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.800
Well, for us, this is a product
Import.

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.519
and this is a Peruvian mango and, frankly,
is that we liked.

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.649
We had not tried the mango  of Peru and loved it.

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:07.800
So, I encourage you to do so, try it and enjoy it.
Especially in this period, it is very hot here.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.400
Friends of the northern hemisphere, no. But ice cream are always rich, in winter and summer. So I try it.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.600
and do not forget that we are in Facebook, we're at Twitter.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.659
