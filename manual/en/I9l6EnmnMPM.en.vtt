00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.830
Summer 2016 is super-sized - literally!

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.530
While Captain America The Winter Soldier and
Furious 7 expanded the summer movie season

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.590
into April, in 2016 the party kicks off with
one of - well - the most anticipated movies

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.060
of all time, Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice!

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.630
Sure, it had to chart new territory because
it played chicken with Marvel for the first

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.520
weekend of May and lost, but hey!

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.480
March is Snyder Country!

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.770
The director is three for four for the month,
and is obviously looking for another win here.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.710
Plus Disney has also found success in March
with Alice in Wonderland and Oz The Great

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.760
and Powerful, so now the month is fully in
play - and is where our coverage for 2016

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.960
begins.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.090
The month kicks off with Tim Burton going
up against his old employer, the Mouse House,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.690
as Peregrine’s Home for Peculiars and Zootopia
open opposite each other.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.310
Then Jesus gets the Anne Rice treatment as
her take on his younger years is adapted for

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.900
the big screen in Christ the Lord, which will
need a miracle to withstand Legendary and

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.750
Duncan Jones’ Warcraft!

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.610
The next weekend Divergent returns with the
first half of its final installment, Allegiant,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.870
opposite Kung Fu Panda 3 which will finally
be hitting theaters.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.080
Let’s hope Dreamworks Animation is still
in business by then!

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.979
Then of course the month closes with Batman
v Superman which is of course expected to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.760
dominate - unless Beverly Hills Cop 4, where
Axel Foley returns to his Detroit roots, turns

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.979
out to be stronger than expected competition.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.200
Hey Batman, better check the Batmobile’s
tailpipe for bananas!

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.040
Things cool down a bit in April, probably
because Hollywood expects March’s entries

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.850
to still be burning up the box office.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.780
The first half of the month sees Mean Girls
director Mark Waters try to repair his reputation

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.090
post Vampire Academy with Catfight, while
Melissa McCarthy hopes to create another memorable

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.550
character with Michelle Darnell.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.991
McCarthy plays a titan of industry who’s
sent off to prison for insider trading, then

00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.979
tries to repair her public image when released.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.799
Peter Dinklage and Kristen Bell co-star.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.020
Michelle Darnell will compete with the Jesse
Owens bio race, starring unknown Stephan James

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.770
as Owens and Jason Sudeikis in a rare dramatic
turn.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.470
Then the second half of the month gets a bit
more competitive, with Disney’s live action

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.440
Jungle Book taking on The Best Man Wedding.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.030
Both are part of very strong brands at this
point - live action fairy tales vs Malcolm

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.460
D Lee’s now trilogy.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.840
Finally April is set to close with another
live action fairy tale, this time from Universal,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.260
as The Huntsman hits theaters.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.520
This prequel drops Kristen Stewart’s Snow
White to focus on Chris Hemsworth’s Huntsman,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.069
Charlize Theron’s Ravenna, and new additions
Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.060
Hmm, there hasn’t been that kind of wattage
in a movie about witches since Eastwick...and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.550
maybe Hocus Pocus...

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.580
Ah, May, when the summer movie season USED
to kick-off.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.060
Is Marvel’s Captain America Civil War now
late to the party?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.459
We’ll see, as well as if Kevin Feige’s
deal with Sony was a spectacularly good idea

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.250
- or bad idea - as Spider-Man finally joins
the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.140
Next, Friday the 13th will try to rebrand
once again - while Neighbors gets a sequel!?

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.140
Whaat?!

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.540
There’s an unexpected yet welcome surprise,
kind of like Zac Efron’s comedic ability.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.379
But you know what’s not going to be a surprise?

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.950
The success of the Angry Birds movie, which
hits theaters the very next weekend.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.720
Then May closes out with a genuine clash of
the titans - Disney’s Alice in Wonderland

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.599
sequel, where Sacha Baron Cohen joins the
original cast, versus X-Men Apocalypse!

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.750
Will it be the end of one of these franchises,
or is there enough room at the box office

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.990
for both to prosper?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.220
If you’re hoping to catch your breath, or
save your money, in June - you’re out of

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.220
luck.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.159
While Michael Bay’s Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles reboot did solid business in August

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.340
2014, its sequel is being moved up to June
where it will kick off the month.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.560
But it better make its money fast as opening
the very next weekend are a trio of hotly

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.030
anticipated movies.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.420
There’s The Conjuring 2 where James Wan,
Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga all return.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.659
Now You See Me 2, which not only keeps its
original cast but adds Daniel Radcliffe to

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.059
the mix.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.949
And top video game Uncharted finally makes
it to the silver screen!

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.819
Who will play Nathan Drake...?

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.961
Then the very next weekend, Pixar delivers
yet another sequel with Finding Dory, which

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:35.340
should get a major boost from Ellen DeGeneres
ever growing star power.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.550
But it will have some interesting competition
from Shane Black, who looks to cash-in the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.919
blank check he got directing Iron Man 3.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.809
The 1990s staple is spending his Hollywood
capital on a 1970s murder mystery centered

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:53.750
around a fading porn star starring Ryan Gosling,
Matt Bomer and - reunited after LA Confidential

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.639
- Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.050
Finally Independence Day 2 opens a week ahead
of the Fourth of July, as the Will Smith-less

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.310
sequel can’t compete with the movies already
opening for the holiday.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.819
It’ll also find stiff competition in Universal’s
third reboot of The Mummy, this time re-imagined

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.869
as a genuine action horror film with Star
Trek’s Alex Kurtzman and Mama’s Andres

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:17.149
Muschietti teaming up to direct.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.539
That means it’ll either be scary good...or
scary bad...

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.020
So what scared off ID4 2?

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.749
That would be Steven Spielberg’s adaptation
of Roald Dahl’s The Big Friendly Giant,

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:35.740
Warner Bros Tarzan remake with Alexander Skarsgard,
Margot Robbie, Samuel L Jackson and Christoph

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.210
Waltz - plus, The Purge 3!

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.389
Will audience celebrate America by seeing
a film that has a sardonic view of that celebration?

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.669
Next up, Zac Efron has his second comedy of
the summer starring opposite Workaholics’

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.830
Adam DeVine in the adaptation of the book
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.969
Is Seth Rogen so easily replaceable?

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.889
The flick hopes to act as counter-programming
to Star Trek 3, although that might be pretty

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.349
fun itself with Simon Pegg scripting.

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.650
After that, Ice Age 5 has an entire weekend
to itself before three more movies crowd into

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.319
the same weekend!

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.629
The all-female Ghostbusters reboot squares
off against Guy Ritchie’s King Arthur and

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:20.289
the Power Rangers movie - which hopes that
by late June 2016 you’ll have forgotten

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.089
all about that fan film on the internets...

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.089
And speaking of forgetting, Matt Damon and
Paul Greengrass hope you haven’t forgotten

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:32.319
how awesome they are when it comes to Jason
Bourne movies, as the duo returns for another

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.899
entry at the end of the month.

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:37.710
Does Jeremy Renner at least get a free movie
ticket?

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.249
Finally we reach August, wild card month.

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:45.840
This is where Marvel’s gamble Guardians
of the Galaxy paid off handsomely, and obviously

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.229
Warner Bros is hoping the same will happen
with the surprisingly similar Suicide Squad.

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.499
But while Star-Lord and company will joke
about killing you, or at least kicking you

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:58.839
in the groin or giving you the finger, this
line-up will actually kill you - or worse.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:03.669
And in an interesting bit of counter-programming,
if you don’t want to see Suicide Squad,

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:06.680
then how about The Smurfs 3?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.569
After that, ANOTHER Zac Efron comedy, this
time opposite Robert DeNiro in Dirty Grandpa!

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.659
Has Seth Rogen created a monster, or a gift
to audiences?

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:21.900
Or maybe his own worst enemy, as Rogen debuts
his first animated film the same weekend,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.259
Sausage Party.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:28.349
Disney’s live action Pete’s Dragon also
opens, as does the 3D supernatural actioner

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:33.559
Spectral which stars James Badge Dale, Emily
Mortimer and Bruce Greenwood.

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:36.339
Expect Spectral to move to another release
date.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:40.229
Then Laika returns with their next stop motion
entry, Kubo and the Two Strings.

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:45.219
Set in Japan, it will feature the voices of
Matthew McConaughey, Charlize Theron, Rooney

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.709
Mara, Ralph Fiennes and Art Parkinson as Kubo.

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:50.469
In other words, nobody Japanese.

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:51.469
Or even Asian.

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:54.809
So, that’s the summer line-up for 2016!

00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:58.219
What are you must sees, your maybe sees and
your heck no-sees?!

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:00.860
Be sure to write your thoughts down below.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.739
I’m Grace Randolph and this has been a Movie
Byte!

00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:10.300
You can watch more, right now...
