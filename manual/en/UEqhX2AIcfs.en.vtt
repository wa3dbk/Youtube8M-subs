00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.240
It all starts with a seed packet.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.060
What do you do?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.060
Go ahead.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.290
Open it very carefully so that the seeds don't
fall out; and low and behold there's this

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.680
great insert from the US Department of Agriculture
people Garden Initiative has all kinds of

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.610
great information about your seeds.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:54.250
Next, find an egg carton or some paper cups
and these will be your containers for starting

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.250
you seedlings.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.340
If you have an egg carton just flip it over
and then poke some holes in it.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.330
You can you can use a Styrofoam one as well.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.410
The holes are for drainage.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.030
You’ll also want to find a tray to place
it on or a plastic bag, because when you water

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.570
there will be some seeping.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.170
As an alternative you can use a paper cup.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:38.560
You also want to poke a hole in that, for
good drainage.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.909
You'll want a good clean potting soil, You'll
want it to be new, because if its garden soil,

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.619
it might contain pathogens which might be
harmful for the emerging seedling.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.740
You can find this material in garden centers
or hardware stores.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.920
Wet the putting soil slightly, then fill up
your containers halfway.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:08.830
You'll want to keep it loose and not compacted
so that the roots can freely grow.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.700
Next we need to think about fertilizer.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.110
And, we are in luck because in this People
Garden Initiative seed packet, we have a special

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.610
fertilizer card - the instruction card.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.200
And, it says on the back - you should check
it out - take the card, tear it up, and plant

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.910
it to fertilize.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.630
Now add a light dusting of potting soil

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.910
We’re now ready to plant seeds.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.530
You take the seeds and gently ease them out
of your hand.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.210
I like to use the plant markers, which is
a repurposed Popsicle stick.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.160
And, one seed per cell will do.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.610
Each one of these will become a big beautiful
healthy tomato plant.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.930
I love planting seeds it's like making a wish
with every seed you plant

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:17.010
Now sprinkle about a half an inch of potting
mix on top of each seed and gently press.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.919
Not too hard, just enough to create a good
point of contact between the seed and the

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.230
potting mix.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.210
Then make your label with today's date and
the variety name.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.180
'Abraham Lincoln.'

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.030
Water well, making sure that you don't wash
out the seed.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.890
Place in a sunny windowsill and when the soil
dries out on top, water again.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:04:07.209
In about a month, your seedlings will look
like this.
