00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.960
This segment in the Soil Health, A Montana
Perspective video series will discuss one

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.219
of the tools that agricultural producers can
use to improve soil health. This tool is bale

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.130
grazing.
Bale grazing can be a useful tool to build

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.870
soil health while saving you money and time.
Let's take a look at why you would want to

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.690
use bale grazing, how bale grazing works,
and why bale grazing can improve your operation.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.079
We used to live 10 miles away from where we
would feed at. And so instead of having to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.079
drive out every day, 10 miles one way, save,
save some gas. And also it was a way to get

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.649
some nutrients back in the soils.
You need to set out hay bales for the number

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.899
of days you want to feed for. This could be
anywhere from 3 to 4 day intervals or longer.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.530
You know, if normally you feed five bales
a day, I'd go out on a Saturday and put out

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.520
35 bales for the week.
Depending on hay quality, you may need to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.969
mix high and low quality hay to provide adequate
nutrition. If you feed two different qualities

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.990
of hay make sure to put enough of the good
quality hay out so all the animals have a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.429
chance at it.
Be careful with the type of hay and where

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:21.380
you are feeding it, as you will probably get
plants growing from the type of hay you feed.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.249
Bales should be spaced so that manure and
urine are spread out evenly over the bale

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.829
grazing area.
You can also set all your bales out before

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.560
winter starts and move electric fence once
a week to limit the access to the bales. Or,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.899
you can leave the bales where they fall or
drop out of the baler and move electric fence

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.649
in between them.
Bale grazing can be used to repair degraded,

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.130
unproductive pastures, hard pan spots, or
eroded land. The added nutrients from the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.159
cows and leftover hay lead to improvements
in grass quality and quantity.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.490
Some of these pastures have been overgrazed
and overstocked, weed problems, things like

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.369
that. We've actually started bale grazing
and feeding our yearlings in small paddocks

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.190
on them in the wintertime. And we're finding
a huge turn-around. We're adding, basically,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.069
adding that manure. And we're adding organic
matter back to the soil, and cover to the

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.600
soil. And letting the, basically, the rangeland's
kind of healing itself that way then.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.750
Most of the stuff we're feeding on is old
CRP that, you know, is not real great as far

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.160
as productivity. Um, so we'll feed on those
areas. The first year I kind of spread it

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.090
out to see if there was going to be a difference
in those areas. And there was a huge difference

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.820
on them.
Some producers think that cows will waste

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.690
hay by laying on it, but cows will often come
back 2 to 3 weeks later and clean up some

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.440
of the uneaten hay.
Waste is not waste. Ah, the stuff that's left

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.220
over is, is nutrients and food for the soil.
Food for the organisms, all that, the little

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.840
herd that's underneath the soil.
Hay left on the soil is both food and cover

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.540
for the numerous microbes that make soil function,
allowing it to infiltrate and store water;

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.190
cycle nutrients; grow healthier, more productive
plants; and ultimately make you more money

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.590
by being able to run more cows on the same
number of acres.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.070
Ah, we run all the cows together in the wintertime,
the 2-year-old first-calf heifers, with, along

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.970
with the normal-age running cows, um, short-term
cows. We even threw the bulls back out there

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.320
during the wintertime just so we didn't have
to mess with them, feeding them separate.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.530
They all came through super. They did great.
They were probably the best condition after

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.670
winter that we've had.
Our bale grazing is primarily trying to build

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.370
soil health. And it doesn't hurt the cattle.
It doesn't, sometimes I think it helps the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.120
cattle because they're, they'll come in and
eat all their feed, but it seems like they're

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.020
not waiting every day at a gate, waiting for
feed to get there. When they're out of feed

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.610
after their few days or whatever it is, they'll
go out and forage.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.270
Bale grazing can offer significant benefits
if used correctly.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.209
Bale grazing can save you money through reduced
fuel use; and also provide you some flexibility

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.709
in winter feeding. It can save you time.
Cows seem healthier and more content. Also,

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.819
you don't have the water quality issue to
worry about from the runoff that occurs when

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:25.379
you feed in a lot. But most importantly, it
can build healthy soils through better utilization

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:30.499
of manure and urine. Whatever hay is left
behind will enhance the soil's productivity

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:35.939
the following season and for years after that.
