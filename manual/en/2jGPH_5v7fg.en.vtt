\f1\fs24 DARLEY NEWMAN: Colorado is a great

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.180
state for ranches that encompass the spirit
of the Old West. Whether you ride the plains

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.190
of the North or the Rockies of the South,
you\'92re in for off the beaten path Western

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.190
adventures.\

\f1\fs24 DARLEY: Northern ranches, like the

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.230
Colorado Cattle Company, rest amid
\f2 Colorado farm country. Working ranches

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.460
like this provide a rustic setting and cater
to those who want to take home new skills

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.870
and have a physically active vacation, and
you might take home more than skills. Potential

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.899
bumps and bruises help guests remember their
adventures on the range. \

\f1\fs24 DARLEY: Ranches in the South offer

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.800
totally different Colorado scenery. Longtime
ranchers Gene and Jan Roberts welcome families

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.560
from around the world to ride the Rockies
at Wilderness Trails Ranch. \

\f1\fs24 GENE ROBERTS

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.800
\f2 : The ranch is located not too far from
Durango, Colorado. An area that has generally

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.289
been referred to at times as the Switzerland
of the West, and we have lots of tall, tall

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:18.150
mountains. We have more 14,000-foot tall peaks
within three miles of here than any place

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.930
else in North America, grouped together. The
ranch is at 7800 hundred feet, but it rises

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:32.090
rapidly. A lot of our rides go quickly to
10,200 feet. Some to 11,000 feet. A variety

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.090
of terrain from low to high. \

\f1\fs24 DARLEY

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.409
\f2 : Staying at this ranch in Southern Colorado
allows one to explore the vast wilderness

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.560
by day and hunker down in a warm cabin at
night. This type of guest ranch caters to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.620
families, incorporating special programs for
kids.

\f1\fs24 JAN ROBERTS

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.659
\f2 : We knew we didn\'92t want to live in
a city for the rest of our lives, so we started

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.009
looking for a ranch and initially we actually
looked for a cattle ranch, but we found that

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.710
it\'92s difficult to make money in the cattle
business. Still is, and it evolved into looking

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.289
for a dude ranch. So we came upon Wilderness
Trails and we negotiated with the owner and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.049
we bought it in ah. We started negotiating
in 1969. We actually bought it the end of

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.379
\'9269 and moved here in the spring of \'9270.
This is my office. You can\'92t beat that.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.260
\f2 : Jan and Gene\'92s story of pursuing
their dream of buying and running a ranch

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.709
is not totally uncommon in today\'92s guest
ranching industry. The American West still

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.730
holds a kind of mystique associated with romanticism
and freedom
