00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.480
&gt;&gt;&gt;Brian D. Lawenda, M.D.: As an integrative
oncologist which is essentially a physician

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.410
that knows a lot about nutrition, exercise,
and stress reduction, these are complementary

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.539
therapies that are useful in conjunction with
conventional treatments like surgery, radiation

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.980
therapy, and chemotherapy.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.439
I often get asked by my patients whether certain
supplements may be beneficial for them during

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.329
their cancer treatment or after.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.530
One of the more common ones that people asked
me about is, is fish oil supplements or Omega

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.339
3 fatty acids.

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.710
Most of the patients want to know if these
treatments whether these types of supplements

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.360
can improve their survival or decrease the
risk of cancer coming back.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.229
Unfortunately, we do not have good data to
support the use of supplements in terms of

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.260
their benefit for improving survival or improving
local control of cancer.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.979
What we do know for Omega 3 fatty actually
is some very interesting data coming out that

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.080
shows that taking Omega 3 fatty acids or eating
diets even that are high in Omega 3 fatty

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.999
acids such as salmon, for example.

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:23.170
These can actually decrease your anxiety level,
which is interesting, decrease stress levels

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.579
and for the patients with breast cancer or
many cancers, for that matter, anything that

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.399
you can do to reduce stress and anxiety is
going to be beneficial.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.960
I am a big fan of Omega 3 fatty acids, but
you do need to talk to your physician about

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.869
them before starting it because there can
be some side effects of treatment and they

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.579
can also lead to certain rare complications,
particularly potentially bleeding complications.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:47.579

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:56.389
Hi, I am Dr. Jay Harness and I want to share
with you an important information that I believe

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.859
that every newly diagnosed patient with breast
cancer needs to know.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.389
Susan Denver: “I am a breast cancer survivor.”

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.009
Katherine Stockton: “I am a breast cancer
survivor.”

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.369
Coree: “I am a breast cancer survivor…”

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.670
Susan Denver: “…and I want every woman
to know…”

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.800
Katherine Stockton: “…about personalized
breast cancer treatment…”

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.060
Susan Denver: “…and the Genomic Test.”

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.540
Coree: “A test that helps guide a woman
and her doctor…”

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
Katherine Stockton: “…to the best treatment
options for her.”

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.180
Susan Denver: “Pass it on!”
