00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.110
Your doctor has recommended that you have
a lower GI endoscopy. But what does that actually

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.220
mean?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.230
A lower GI endoscopy is a diagnostic procedure
used by your doctor to inspect the inside

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.230
of your rectum and colon. While it's considered
a surgical procedure, endoscopy does not involve

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.780
an incision.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.970
Instead, your doctor will pass a flexible
tube, called an endoscope through your anus

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.620
and into your rectum and colon.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.949
This tube has a tiny video camera mounted
on its tip.

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.110
It also contains a small tool used for taking
tissue samples.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.570
Your doctor can use the endoscope to inspect
the entire lower half of your digestive system.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.920
Your doctor can use the endoscope to inspect
the entire lower half of your digestive system.

Movie

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.110
In some cases, the shape of the colon makes
it impossible to pass the endoscope as far

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.360
into the body as the doctor would like.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.600
Your doctor may decide to take a series of
x-rays - or even to perform surgery - in order

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.720
to inspect the hidden area.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.000
Reasons for undergoing a lower GI endoscopy
vary. You may have been suffering from one

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
or more of a number symptoms - including blood
in your stool, weight loss, chronic irregularity

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.220
or other problems associated with the digestive
system.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.780
Some gastrointestinal symptoms can be warning
signs of serious medical problems and you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.840
should take your doctor's recommendation to
have an endoscopy very seriously.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.840
Luckily, the vast majority of medical problems
diagnosed by endoscopy are treatable and you

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.450
should look forward to improved health and
comfort as a result of the information gathered

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.409
during the procedure.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.409
The doctor will then lubricate your rectum
and gently insert the endoscope, guiding it

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.730
into your colon.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.730
You may feel some pressure or tugging, but
you shouldn't feel pain.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.609
To better examine abnormal-looking tissues,
your doctor may choose to take one or more

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.430
biopsies.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.769
Small instruments sent through the interior
of the endoscope are able to painlessly remove

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.769
small samples of tissue with a small scissor
like tool by simply snipping them free.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.170
Finally, after a thorough exam, the endoscope
is carefully removed.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.659
Any tissue specimens removed during the procedure
will be sent immediately to a lab for microscopic

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:14.659
analysis. Your doctor will tell you when to
expect results from those tests.
