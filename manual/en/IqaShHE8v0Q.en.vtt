00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
(violin and mandolin; string- plucking in bright rhythm)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.060
 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.520
(Brienna Schutte) The moment that you set foot on this    fairgrounds

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.960
you see twinkling lights, you hear animals, sheep baaing

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.080
you hear rides, people screaming with joy,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.600
you smell manure and fried food and spun sugar.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.180
It really is sensory overload in every direction that you look.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.180
But I think that's why it's such a great showcase

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.180
for everything that's great about our state.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.180
Advertising art has been at the heart

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.180
of getting the word out about the Minnesota State Fair

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.180
since the very beginning.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.180
Twelve years ago, we embarked on a brand-new program

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
whereby we would commission a Minnesota artist,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.180
to actually create that art for the State Fair.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.180
The goal of the commemorative art piece is to have

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.180
an annual piece of artwork

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.180
that the Minnesota State Fair Foundation could use

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.180
to support their mission of improving

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.180
the State Fair's historic buildings and grounds.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.180
And I think that sort of exemplifies the Fair

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.180
from a specific artist's point of view.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.180
 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.220
Walk us through kind of what the additions might be

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.360
from what we're seeing at this point.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.880
(man) I think we're gonna move everything over a little bit

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880
in order to fill up the space a little better

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.880
and give the whole piece a better balance.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
We're gonna add in fireworks because that's something

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
that's really been special for the grandstand shows.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.880
(Brienna) This year, for 2015, we hand-selected artist Adam Turman

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.880
to be the official commemorative artist

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.880
for the Minnesota State Fair.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
He's a muralist and illustrator, a screen printer,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.880
he's very, very well-known and well-loved in the community.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.880
How will the Ferris wheel pop as far as color?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880
Oh, that's a good question.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.880
What I'm planning on doing is, add on those fun little lights

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880
that the Ferris wheel has.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.880
(woman) Oh, that'll make, that'll kind of add a lotta whimsy.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.880
The Ferris wheel at night has

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.880
these beautiful little light bulbs that light up

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
and then they kind of, they radiate out from the center,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.880
and it's just a lotta fun to watch it go around,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.880
And I think adding in those lights

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.880
will give the Ferris wheel that movement.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.880
(Brienna) The process is very collaborative.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.880
From the moment that the artist, in this case Adam,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.880
is sort of in that sketch phase, we're talking, talking about

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.880
what that sketch might look like, what the colors might be.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.880
Then we sort of let the artist go to work for a while, then

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.880
determine kind of what direction we want to take from there.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.880
What I'm proposing is doing, using my medium,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.100
the screen-printed prints, as the final product

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.100
that people could buy.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100
(Brienna) Fabulous, I think that would be wonderful,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.100
because I think that's what people expect from you,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.100
is the the screen, when they're buying a piece,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.100
they're buying a screen print from you.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.100
I think this is great.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.100
After we're through that initial sketch phase and we've talked

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.100
a little bit about color and concepting that way,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.100
the artist is really on their own to create the piece

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.960
once that sketch is approved.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.960
(bass &amp; drums play in bright rhythm)

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.420
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.420
(Brienna) Adam came to the table with a great love of the Fair

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.920
and some great ideas about

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.920
what he wanted to include in his piece.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.920
What we're doing in the 2015 artwork is, we're showcasing

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.920
the elements of the fair that everybody recognizes.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920
What was great was, I had the opportunity

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.920
to walk through the Fair with the State Fair representatives.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.920
When I'm looking around for landmarks that I think

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.920
are exciting, I'm looking for angles, I'm looking for shapes,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.920
basically elements of the Fair that everybody recognizes,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.920
such as the Grandstand, such as the Ferris Wheel,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.920
but also new things like the West Market space.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.920
It's a brand-new space and this area where this archway is

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.920
is now a new transit hub where many fairgoers enter the Fair.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.920
(Brienna) We were most excited to see the Streetcar Arch.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.920
It has been a part of the Minnesota State Fair

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.920
since the 1930s, so it's a new landmark at the State Fair

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.920
that's an old landmark.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.920
 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.920
(Adam) The process I call it is analog digital analog

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.920
and everything is really started as a hand-drawn piece.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.920
So everything is created by hand,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.920
it's brought into the computer,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.300
it's separated through the computer,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.300
and then we print it basically by hand.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.300
(electronic music plays)

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:48.300
 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.300
Today we're printing the final color

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.300
on a 5-color print for the Minnesota State Fair.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:02.300
 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.300
 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.300
(Brienna) Adam will actually be printing the limited edition

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
of a hundred prints, then we'll also have a run of posters.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.300
That's done by Seven Corners Printing here in St. Paul.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.300
 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.300
The Minnesota State Fair Commemorative Art

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.300
is truly a Minnesota piece of art from start to finish

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.300
because we not only have a Minnesota artist

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.300
create the piece, but we involve Minnesota vendors,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.300
whether it be the printing process or the framing process,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.300
we're working with vendors and businesses in our community.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.300
 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.300
As soon as the artist is finished

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.300
creating the original piece of art,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.300
we take it to be matted and framed.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.300
I really like the matting to have some sort of an accent

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.300
of the color that's actually in the print.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.300
You have that background gray that's there, I think

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.300
that would be a nice neutral kind of accent on the edge.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.300
(Brienna) Tim Smith has been framing all of the commemorative art pieces

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.300
since the very beginning back in 2004.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.300
Something like this.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.300
(Adam) That's kinda nice. (woman) Oh, that's nice.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.300
(Adam) I like that. (Tim) Let's take a look at some frames,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.300
that would coordinate with those grays would be nice.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.300
(Tim) So here's a silver with a gray kind of striation in it.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.300
I really think that sets off the art.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.300
(Adam) I love it, I think we're good to go.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.300
(woman) I love it too. (Tim) Great!

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.300
(acoustic guitar plays)

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:45.340
 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.340
 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.340
(Brienna) The fair is important and significant

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.340
to the State of Minnesota

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.340
and even the larger region in so many ways.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.340
The Minnesota State Fair is actually older

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.340
than the State of Minnesota.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.340
It's an annual event that people can look forward to.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.660
Some years are tougher than others.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.660
There have been summers where there have been

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.660
horrible storms and horrible flooding

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.660
and terrible things that have happened in the community.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.660
But people can always count on the fact that

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.660
the Great Minnesota Get-Together is gonna happen.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.660
I think that the ability to rely on something like that,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.660
where you're surrounded by, you know, on any given day,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.660
200,000 of your closest friends and neighbors,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.660
is really something special.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
(bass, drums, guitar, and vibraphone play rock)

00:07:45.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
CC--Armour Captioning &amp; TPT

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
(woman) This program is made possible by

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The State's Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and the citizens of Minnesota.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
synthesizer fanfare

00:08:24.000 --> 00:09:24.000
