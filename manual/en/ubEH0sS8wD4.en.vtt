00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.900
Hi, I'm Tricia, a California organic gardener.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.980
One of my main reasons for gardening is to have homegrow tomatoes.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.540
Today we're gonna talk about tomato pruning,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.020
and some of the common problems with tomatoes, and what to do about them.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.380
The only type of tomato you should consider pruning

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.080
are indeterminate tomatoes.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.660
And you don't have to prune your tomatoes at all.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.840
But for those of us in short seasons, there are advantages.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.200
Pruning will help maximize fruit size, and quality,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.900
and if you're not growing in cages it will help prevent the tomatoes from sprawling all over the ground.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.300
For a fully-pruned tomato vine,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.100
Choose the 2 strongest and
healthiest growing tips, and cut the rest.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.560
And remember that pruning tomatoes will limit the amount of fruit that you get.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.480
This is one of two big healthy growing tips.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.340
This is just a branch.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.520
Now, I'm going to prune off
the lower, smaller growing tips.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.260
This is the small growing tip that I'm going to prune.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.020
Make sure that you don't snip until there's 2 full leaves,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.760
and don't prune when the plant is wet.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.020
And this is an immature
growing tip, not ready to snip yet.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.580
I'm also gonna prune some of these bottom branches that are touching the ground.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.600
Unhealthy branches and branches growing in a downward direction.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.180
This will really improve air circulation around the base of the plants.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.780
Be careful not to prune too much, you want to have a nice canopy of leaves over the fruit

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.820
to prevent a common problem called sunscald.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.460
A sunscalded fruit has a large, light-colored leathery patch.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.800
And that means it didn't have enough cover from the leaves and it got sunburned.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740
Another common problem is fruit cracking.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.400
The fruit will crack when it has either uneven watering or too much sun, or both.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.700
Mulches, and drip irrigation help maintain even watering.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.160
Sometimes fruit will ripen unevenly. And this is called blotchy ripening, or gray wall.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.180
It's thought to be caused by multiple factors, like too much nitrogen and not enough phosphorus and boron

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.620
and extreme temperatures.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.500
What you can do to avoid it is use a balanced fertilizer.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.800
You may see some dark spots on the leaves, stems or fruit, about 1cm in diameter.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.580
This could be early blight.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.800
To control blight, avoid overhead watering, spray a copper fungicide like Liqui-Cop every 7-10 days

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.720
as soon as the disease appears.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.320
For some other common tomato problems, it may be too late this year to do anything about them.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.960
If you have a dark leathery patch on the bottom of your tomato that grows larger from the blossom end,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.560
you could have blossom end rot,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.880
which is caused by a calcium deficiency and aggravated by uneven watering.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.940
To avoid blossom end rot in the future, you might consider adding a calcium-based amendment next year.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.940
So for this and other tips about how to get your tomatoes off to a great start,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.240
Check out our Planting Tomatoes video.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.900
Another problem is wilting caused by soil-born fungi like Fusarium or Verticillium.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.680
Unfortunately all you can do is destroy all infected plant matter, including the roots after harvest,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.740
and don't plant tomatoes, peppers, eggplants or potatoes in that spot for 4-6 years.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.520
Plant resistant varieties like Siletz and Roma, and you can apply Actinovate fungicide

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.660
which will help prevent some wilts from getting a foothold.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.780
Here's to a healthy harvest of tomatoes from your backyard,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.540
and Grow Organic for Life!
