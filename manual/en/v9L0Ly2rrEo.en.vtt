00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.679
How To Make A Simple Light Sensor.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:21.180
The Things You Need For This Project Are
An LDR ( Light Dependent Resistor ) Which

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.410
We Also Refer To As A Photo Resistor Or A
Cadmium Sulfide Cell.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:39.170
An LED ( Light Emitting Diode ), Of Which
The Longer Part Being The Anode And The Shorter

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.190
Part Being The Cathode.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.280
A One K Ohm Resistor.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.329
If You Don't Have A One K Ohm Resistor You
Can Also Use A Three-Thirty Ohm Resistor In

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.190
Place Of It.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.850
A Nine Volt Battery.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.280
A Nine Volt Battery Clip.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.840
And, The Breadboard.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.670
The Positive Rail Of The Breadboard, And This
Is The Negative Rail.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.100
And Here's The Circuit Diagram.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:29.490
We Start By Inserting The LDR On The Breadboard.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:55.750
We Connect The First Terminal Of The LDr To
The Positive Rail Of The Breadboard With The

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.750
One K Ohm Resistor.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.320
We Insert The LED On The Breadboard.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:15.510
We Connect The Cathode Of The LED To The Negative
Rail Of The Breadboard.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:32.390
We Connect The Anode Of The LED To The Second
Terminal Of The LDR.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:51.820
Now, We Connect The Nine Volt Battery To the
Nine Volt Battery Clip.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.450
We Connect The Negative Terminal Of The battery
To The Negative Rail Of The Breadboard.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:06.940
And The Positive To The Positive Rail.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.060
As You Can See The LED Lights Up.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.820
Depending Upon The Intensity Or The Brightness
Of The Light Received By The LDR Is The Brightness

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:30.900
Of The LED.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:46.760
We Can Also Use A Three Volt Power Supply
For This Project.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.110
For That, We Won't Be Needing The Nine Volt
Battery And The Resistor.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:03.810
We Take The Positive Of The Three Volt Power
And Insert It In The Positive Rail Of The

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.910
Breadboard.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.870
And The Negative To The Negative Rail.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:18.470
We Insert A Wire From One Part Of The LDR
To The Positive Rail Of The Breadboard And

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:47.810
The LED Glows.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.510
Thanx For Watching.
