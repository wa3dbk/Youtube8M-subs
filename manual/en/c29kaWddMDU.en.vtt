00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:14.150
What if our world has become so noisy, that
we have forgotten what silence really means.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.099
Imagine a world without sound.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:23.099
Have you ever wondered what a blind man sees,
or a deaf person hears?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.009
How an unschooled person experiences a world
without knowledge.

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.009
What if you were trapped inside a world of
silence because you could not see, hear, or read?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.470
 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.969
MegaVoice breaks the silence!

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.120
In 1988, MegaVoice developed the first solar
powered digital audio bible.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.089
4.35 billion people in the world are unable
to read or are oral learners and therefore

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:00.089
unable to experience God's life giving word
for themselves.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.130
MegaVoice audio players offer Bible translations
and scripture messages to thousands of blind

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
and illiterate people in their own language.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.130
Its distribution has now reached 1 million
units with an audio library of 8,400 scripture

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.040
based titles in over 4,600 languages and dialects.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.040
They can listen, then they have more knowledge
about God.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.799
There will be more people being saved.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.100
Perfected for a rural environment, the audio
player is rugged and tamper proof, giving

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.289
no mechanical problems. And because it is
solar powered, it literally reaches the ends

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.259
of the world. No need for batteries or electricity.

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.969
Shepherds here, they see God in everything
around them. They are very close to nature,

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:14.260
and what I hear from the pastor, feedback
from him is that they boys are asking questions

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.260
who Jesus is. So when I'm doing followup,
the boys ask questions about the bible, what

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.160
I've heard and they ask questions, "Okay,
what is actually on this device, because we

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.480
are not familiar with this."

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.480
There is no limit to the potential of the
MegaVoice audio player.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.460
Organizations can even load their own messages
onto the audio player, and there is no limit

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.000
to who can be involved.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.750
The reality is that we do not all find ourselves
among the blind and the illiterate, however,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.000
anybody can become part of MegaVoice's vision
to an unreached world.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.010
By becoming a prayer partner, you can intercede
for God's powerful hand to be on the ministry.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.730
As a volunteer, you could help assemble the
next batch of audio players that must go out.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.540
As an ambassador, you could promote MegaVoice
in your circle of influence.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.530
Or as an investor in the Kingdom, you could
sponsor MegaVoice Bibles, for the life change

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.860
of millions.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.850
Together, with MegaVoice, you could break
the silence!
