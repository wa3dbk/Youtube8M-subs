00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.900
The result of a set is what I just touched
on previously in the last segment and I'll

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.330
go into it even a little bit further. Now
we talked about this thing called the swing.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.360
The word swing has nothing to do with the
word playground and has nothing to do with

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.910
dancing. It has to do with the loss of points
versus the gain of points, and again if it's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.731
a low level bid it's really not going to matter
too much, it's not going to hurt you too much.

00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:36.690
Any bids from say, two because, if you each
bid one, that's the most even a two bid can

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.110
split. If your bid is combined then you're
bidding one trick and you're bidding one trick.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.830
Well, a couple of my friends said if you can
bid one you should bid nil. Oh really? If

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.960
you got the ace of spades are you going to
bid nil? If you've got the ace and a jack

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.170
of clubs are you going to bid a nil? So the
point is that the set is what pretty much

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.390
decided the hands. Now another thing that
I tell all of my partners to do and I advise

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.100
people to do is if the bid comes around to
fourth seat again, let's look at this scenario.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:22.340
This is you here and you are the dealer. This
person over here bids a three, this person

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.980
bids a five, and this person bids a one. You
have a hand that looks like you've got four

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.160
tricks, you're pretty sure of taking four
tricks. You might even have ace, king, queen,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.080
jack of spades and nothing else. Do you push
it to thirteen? Absolutely, no, no,no, no,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.430
no unless there is a bag situation where toward
the end of the game you're risking going out

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.440
by taking a bag, never, never, never push
the bid to thirteen in fourth seat unless

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.510
the score clearly dictates that. The reason
for that is, you're partner has put up a big

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.180
old five if you had all those spades; he's
bidding five on side suits. If by chance somebody

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.400
comes in and trumps one of his five tricks
and you only have four you're not going to

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.250
be able to pick him up because, you already
bid the four that you expected to take. So

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.910
again, the game really, clearly focuses on
avoiding the sets and the impact of being

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.230
set. So, safety in contracts, safety in bidding,
and particularly when you're bidding numerical

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.290
bids, remember the average bid of a hand is
eleven tricks. So when you start pushing it

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.770
to twelve, when you start pushing it to thirteen,
then you're taking full responsibility, you're

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.920
telling your partner I probably have two extra
tricks. So again, bid slightly conservatively.
