00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:07.210
So this is a 2002 Mazda Tribute
and I'm going to be pulling the

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.679
upper intake manifold off it.
I've already undone a lot of the

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.940
plugs and wires that you have to take off
it

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.949
but I'll run through them.
I'll go round in a circle like a clock.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.519
Um, there's these three hoses here which
I haven't found in the manual yet

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.169
So I don't know what they're called.
But you have to undo that one,

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:37.010
that one - that's a vacuum hose,
undo that one, and remove them.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.010
This is the EGR VRV which is
exhaust gas... um...

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:46.769
something... exhaust gas

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.769
recirculation.
And it's a um, vacuum regulator valve.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.579
There's, an electrical clip that goes there
and if you unplug stuff, label it, like I

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.200
have there.
So you unclip that and there's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.990
two vacuum plugs at the bottom that come off.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.500
That, that vacuum plug is like a network of
plugs

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.600
and that also goes into this EGR
up here, so that just pops off

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.600
that's easy that one.
The bottom two are a bit harder.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.490
Um, I haven't done the EGR gas pipe yet
which is down in here

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.170
I'll try and get... just there
That white,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.509
nut there unscrews.
It's kind of like the gas nut on a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.149
regular gas bottle.
Use a big shifter or a spanner to get it off.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.560
But, the manual says just to pull it out
just enough to get it off the valve.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.500
So that metal pipe, and all the joints on
it

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.859
are probably a little bit fragile.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:01.859
This is the AIC [IAC] plug.
That's the AI- oh, IAC it is sorry.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.399
Not AIC. IAC unit.
So that just unclips.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.399
Um... on the back there,
this plug here is the, TPS,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.640
the Throttle Position Sensor.
That just unplugs.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.150
Make sure you label all these wires as you
go.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.360
Um, this is the air intake,
which just unscrews and it pulls off

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.030
I pulled this off
to make it a bit easier

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.360
to get that rubber hose off.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.300
And then, this was the...
this was the cruise control and the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.360
throttle cable.
To get the- the cruise control just clips

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.790
out.
But the throttle cable...

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.700
You have to pull, this back,
and then you can slip the cable out.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.590
Makes it a lot easier.
It's probably the only way you can do it.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.140
And then, the mounts.
There was three bolts for the mounts.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.620
Two there.
And... one over here.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.830
You just undo them and they come off.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.000
So you gotta undo all those first
and... we'll go from there.
