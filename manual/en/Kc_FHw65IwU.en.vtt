Hey Besties!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.411
Welcome to another hair tutorial.

00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:21.529
This week we're going to try a retro rolled
fringe.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.619
Let's get started!

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.009
We're going to cheat by using a special hair
insert.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.240
This will make making the shape really easy.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:42.840
First tie up the rest of your hair.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.000
Brush your fringe upwards and hairspray the
underneath.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:05.750
Tease it as well and enjoy your new look.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.780
My puff has an elastic so I pinned it out
of the way.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:24.710
Place the puff under the edge of your fringe.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.479
Pin it in place and roll it under.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:40.700
Once you've rolled as far as you can go, pin
on either side.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:02:01.590
Fluff the sides out to cover the ends of the
puff.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.170
Hair spray any stray bits down.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.340
The teasing we did earlier will help avoid
getting any splits in the fringe were you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.280
can see the puff.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:38.840
For extra points, roll the rest of the hair
forwards and pin as well.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.640
Add a scarf or an usamimi for a nicely vintage
look.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.510
Ready to go back in time!

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.660
