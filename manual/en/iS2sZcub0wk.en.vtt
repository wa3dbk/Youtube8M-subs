00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:10.739
The Road to Elf City

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:17.075
Alas we come to the fifth and final of the road to Prifdinas videos, it's almost time for you to access the city yourself.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.812
But for now we're going to give you two more elf clans and these are the ones who were determined by you in a poll, they are the Hefin and the Meilyr. 

00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:27.916
The Hefin are agility and prayer and the Meilyr are Dungeoneering and Herblore.

00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:37.977
I'll admit that when agility and prayer won the poll for the skill focus for the Hefin clan 

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:40.691
we didn't really have a clue how we were going to mix those two together. 

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:44.237
But then inspiration came with a kind of battle monk Shaolin feel 

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:49.877
so we took those peaceful meditative ideas and we came up with our first update, which is the Serenity polls.

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.351
These just out from the crater below, and players will be able to balance on these with one leg. 

00:00:54.351 --> 00:01:00.238
Lady Hefin will then call out poses that she wants you to perform, and - if you do it right - you'll start to generate XP. 

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:04.412
That's agility XP rather than bonus XP, which has been a recent change to the design. 

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:08.494
With luck, and if everyone is on the ball (rather than making a coffee or running to the toilet) 

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:14.085
we should see ranks of people all moving from one Shaolin-style animation to another. It'll look sweet.

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:21.615
Pickpocketing-wise, we have elves that are carrying bones and some agility-replenishing stuff, but the next blockbuster is the agility course. 

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.688
We've been working solidly on a new route for the course. 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.720
Where it once would take in the whole city, we felt that would involve too much running and not enough death-defying acts. 

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:36.523
So our plan is to climb over the Hefin cathedral, jump to the clan tower, and generally perform as many ridiculous feats in the Hefin area as possible. 

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:40.122
The plan is even to have a choice of paths at a couple of points.

00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:43.316
Complete the course and a light creature will give you a random item. 

00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:48.370
That might be worthwhile objects, rest animation overrides of the serenity post poses or wishes. 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.082
These wishes will give you rewards that will improve or change your next lap of the course, like XP multipliers, or even time trials.

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:58.292
Part of the agility course, as I said, was the Hefin church. 

00:01:58.293 --> 00:02:04.398
Here you'll find a rest musician, gnome glider and an altar, but - more importantly - there is the Stone Cleansing. 

00:02:04.398 --> 00:02:10.516
You'll be buying a cleansing crystal here, using it up over a period of time as you effectively exorcise a Seren stone. 

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:17.018
The aim of this area is to generate prayer XP at a slower but cheaper rate than traditional methods like gilded altars and the ectofuntus, 

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:20.377
so it's a neat alternative for those who want to save a few pennies.

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:24.496
Now we come to the Meilyr another clan that was decided by the players. 

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:28.417
This time they chose to have dungeoneering and herblore which is very hard to mix together, 

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:33.398
but we found a way but to tell you would be to ruin plagues end and that would be inconceivable 

00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:38.803
but know that they're explorers looking for rare herbs that they can then put into rare potions.

00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:47.688
Of all the families, Meilyr has the most stuff wedged into it... as long as you have the levels. 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.851
For example, there's the level 95 Dungeoneering resource dungeon. 

00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:57.471
This has a few things you'll recognise - pawya and grenwall, impling spawns and a bloodwood tree, for example - but also a few special additions. 

00:02:57.506 --> 00:03:03.685
My favourite is Gorajo hoardstalker. He will give you one card per day, and that card can be used on a Dungeoneering floor of your choice. 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.711
The effect of that card will include things like a guaranteed combination potion recipes, guaranteed journals, or increased damage against the boss. 

00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:14.257
And that's just the common ones. We're planning to keep our hand close to our chest on this one...

00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:21.669
Divination locations will be popping up randomly here, and you'll have a second resource limit, so that you can gather a small amount from them per day. 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.048
Finally, there'll be a random impling spawn which should help with filling your impling codex.

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:32.555
Back on the surface of the Meilyr clan, we aim to release the harmony pillars. These pillars will act like mini-challenges. 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.889
For every 50,000XP you gain in a skill that the pillar is charged in, it will gain a growth stage.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.842
After four growth stages, you'll be able to harvest the pillar and get harmony moss. 

00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:49.264
Harmony moss is an ingredient for perfect potions - basically, high-level skilling potions - something the game has been crying out for. 

00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:53.261
These skilling potions will greatly improve your abilities to train throughout RuneScape.

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:57.153
And not just in the Elf City, and we hope to make these a great moneyspinner for skillers.

00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:02.945
On the way, in the outer Meilyr areas, we find the level 115 Dungeoneering resource dungeon. 

00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:08.229
Again, this contains some recognizable stuff: namely crystal flecked sandstone and a bank deposit box. 

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:12.445
But it's the other inclusions that get me more enthusiastic than you'd expect from me, which is saying something. 

00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:18.645
First there's a new slayer creature. They'll be dropping something recognizable from Dungeoneering to be used in the wider world.

00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:23.542
And then there is the motherlode Maw. This used to be a motherlode mine, but now it's a mouth, 

00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:28.342
with the player warily putting their arm into a familiar face and pulling out a random item once per day.

00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:36.264
This originally caused some controversy when we first announced it, as it would contribute towards completionist and trimmed compeltionist cape requirements. 

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:42.032
We've changed that subtly so that it makes you more likely to gain these completionist requirements when elsewhere in the world. 

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:48.153
We would tell you more, but we'd have to throw you into the motherlode maw. Just know that our aim is to not devalue the two capes.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.117
Aside from a fruit tree patch, there is something up on the surface that has been putting Mod C3DPO into a frenzy. 

00:04:54.418 --> 00:04:58.186
It's the herblore shop, where players can buy and unlock combination potion recipes. 

00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:02.557
Some of these will be found in Daemonheim in the same manner as sagas, while others will just need a pocketful of cash. 

00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:08.336
Regardless, when bought, players will be able to fill their crystal flasks with combinations of their favourite potions. 

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:14.360
Want to fuse an overload with super antifire? Well you can. And if you want to combine potions to create new effects? You can do that too. 

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:20.931
We're adding to the list of combination potions as we're going along, so there will be even more options than were originally in the design document.

00:05:22.606 --> 00:05:27.967
Now we reach the emotional end of our journey, all that's left is for you to access the city "yourelf". 

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:32.599
It's been a fantastic experience, showing you the city, incorporating all of your feedback. 

00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:36.156
We just hope that you love it as much as we've enjoyed making it.
