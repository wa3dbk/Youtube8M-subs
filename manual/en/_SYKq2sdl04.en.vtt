00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.160
G'day everyone.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.510
My name is Daniel O'Grady, and welcome to
another Wasabicars video.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.340
Today, we are jumping in the back of an ambulance
because we are having a "Coronary".

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.720
A Corona-ary.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.820
It's a heart condition.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:33.920
So, this Toyopet Corona is one of about 100
cars in the Sepia Collection.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.090
It is a private collection.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.260
It is a collection that does rotate its contents.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.020
The guy running it does buy and sell often.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.120
He generally focuses on, well, not your mainstream
JDM's.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.170
It's not all Skylines &amp; Celicas.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.629
It's not like that at all.

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.850
He collects the more obscure stuff.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.890
I'm thankful for that because there's lots
of interesting cars, including this ambulance.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.149
Check out the grille, it says "Toyopet".

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:09.149
I did some googling.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.820
Well, I attempted to do some googling and
I didn't find any information on this particular

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.820
car.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.900
What I was hoping for was the year.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.750
I'm not really sure of the year.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.119
I'm guessing... 60's.

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.080
I can't narrow it down.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.300
I actually don't know much about cars.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.910
My interest in cars is general and so is my
knowledge.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.850
I probably have no business running a car
channel.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.890
So, apologies for that.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.320
What model is it?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.020
It's a Corona RT46V.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.289
So, there you go.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.880
That's the two-door wagon.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.220
There you go, guys.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.050
It's an ambulance.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.430
Lot's of room in the back.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.289
You could probably even, you know, lay someone
down in the back, if they really had to lay

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.289
down.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.580
Lot's of space.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.410
You could have someone sitting next to them,
checking pulses and stuff.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.540
Oh my god.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.560
I think I am having a Coronary.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.150
I'm going to leave it there, guys.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.040
I'm just hoping you are all well.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.783
Thanks for watching Wasabicars, and telling
a friend, and buying t-shirts and all that

00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:22.783
sort of stuff.

00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:23.783
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

00:02:23.783 --> 00:02:24.783
Love it.

00:02:24.783 --> 00:02:25.783
Thank you so much, guys.

00:02:25.783 --> 00:02:26.783
See you next time!

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:26.784
Goodbye.
