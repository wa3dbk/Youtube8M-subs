00:00:01.053 --> 00:00:02.991
and you are a liar.

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:05.160
But not a snitch !

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:07.762
Excuse me ?

00:00:07.827 --> 00:00:09.597
No, l don't
think l will.

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:14.238
- Mr. Slade.
- This is such a crock of shit !

00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:17.173
[ Trask ] Please watch your
Ianguage, Mr. Slade.

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:20.176
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.412
Mr. Simms, l will give you one
final opportunity to speak up.

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:26.015
Mr. Simms
doesn't want it.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.017
He doesn't need
to be labeled...

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:30.754
''still worthy of
being a Baird man.''

00:00:30.818 --> 00:00:32.755
What the hell
is that ?

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.757
What is your motto here ?

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:39.063
''Boys, inform on your
classmates, save your hide;

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:42.031
anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you at the stake'' ?

00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:44.868
Well, gentlemen,

00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:48.139
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run...

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:50.140
and some guys stay.

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:53.679
Here's Charlie facin' the fire,
and there's George...

00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:56.046
hidin' in
big daddy's pocket.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.048
And what are you doin' ?

00:00:58.112 --> 00:01:00.016
You're gonna
reward George...

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:03.455
and destroy Charlie.

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:07.894
-Are you finished, Mr. Slade ?
-No, l'm just gettin' warmed up.

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:10.528
[ Slade ] l don't know who
went to this place.

00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:13.297
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryant,

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:15.299
William Tell, whoever.

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:18.470
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.471
lt's gone.

00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:23.008
You're buildin'
a rat ship here,

00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:25.777
a vessel for
seagoin' snitches.

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:29.683
And if you think you're
preparin' these minnows for manhood,

00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:31.683
you better think again,

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:34.687
because l say you are
killin' the very spirit...

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:36.922
this institution
proclaims it instills.

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:40.026
What a sham.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.162
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin' on here today ?

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:46.766
l mean, the only class
in this act is sittin' next to me.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.537
l'm here to tell you
this boy's soul is intact.

00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.440
lt's non-negotiable.
You know how l know ?

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:57.011
Someone here, and l'm not gonna say who,
offered to buy it.

00:01:57.074 --> 00:02:00.714
- Only Charlie here wasn't sellin'.
- Sir, you're out of order.

00:02:00.778 --> 00:02:03.150
l show you out of order.

00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:06.253
You don't know what
out of order is, Mr. Trask.

00:02:06.317 --> 00:02:08.755
l'd show you,
but l'm too old,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.257
l'm too tired,
too fuckin' blind.

00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:14.595
lf l were the man l was
five years ago, l'd take...

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.592
a flamethrower
to this place !

00:02:19.298 --> 00:02:23.239
Out of order ? Who the hell
you think you're talkin' to ?

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.341
l've been around,
you know ?

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:30.178
There was a time
l could see.

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:32.179
And l have seen.

00:02:32.244 --> 00:02:34.616
Boys like these,
younger than these,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.554
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:41.690
But there is nothin'
like the sight...

00:02:41.754 --> 00:02:43.691
of an amputated spirit.

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:47.530
There is
no prosthetic for that.
