00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:06.490
We all want to make the right choices
especially when it comes to the comfort

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.170
of our family and the welfare of our
community. That's why signing up for

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.449
natural gas is the right choice when it
comes to saving you time, money, and

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:21.369
protecting our environment. Natural gas
is a domestic North American resource

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.099
that burns cleaner and more efficiently
than oil. You can save money with natural

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.239
gas while feeling good that you have
chosen a clean energy source that will

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.590
improve the air quality of your home and
community.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.100
Natural gas is a versatile fuel and can
be used for many of your household

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.730
appliances like home heating, stoves, and
ovens, water heaters, and clothes dryers.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.940
Welcoming a clean affordable and
reliable energy source into your home

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.010
can be done in a few easy steps. If your
neighbors already use natural gas,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.460
chances are you can too. Call Unitil at
888-4-UNITIL and a

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.690
representative will confirm if natural
gas is available to you and then guide

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.780
you through the cost and installation
process. If a gas main does not exist in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.760
your neighborhood your Unitil
representative will provide you with

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.860
your options and additional pricing to
have a service line installed.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.580
Next you will need to hire an independent
plumbing/heating contractor to either

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.320
convert your existing heating system to
natural gas or to install a new gas

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.450
heating system. If you currently heat
with oil of propane you may not require

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.160
a new system. Many oil heating systems
can easily be converted to burn natural

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.460
gas by replacing the oil burner with a
natural gas conversion burner.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.310
And propane systems can be even easier
to convert to burn natural gas.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.150
Your chosen contractor will install your
natural gas equipment and provide the

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.680
necessary interior piping. Be sure to
discuss with your contractor where the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.780
natural gas meter will be located. Your
Unitil representative can help identify

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.680
the best meter location and required
clearance from windows and doors.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.540
After choosing your contractor call Unitil to
install your natural gas service line.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.530
Unitil will call the Dig Safe hotline to
mark any underground utility lines in

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.170
front of your property and also obtain
the necessary permits from your town.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.010
On the scheduled installation date Unitil
will dig a narrow trench from the gas

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.180
main in the street to your home and make
all the proper connecti ons.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.080
No need to worry, Unitl will refill the trench and rake it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.989
smooth making it easier for you to
reestablish any displaced landscaping.

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.620
Once your heating contractor has
completed his/her work call Unitil to have a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.269
gas meter installed. Normally the
installation takes place within three

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.209
business days of your call. When it comes
to the comfort of your family take pride

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.010
in making the cleaner more
cost-effective choice with natural gas.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.620
