00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:13.342
There are two types of energy: energy from nourishment and energy from stimulation.

00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:19.332
Energy through stimulation is reactive and is short-term,

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:23.555
whereas energy through nourishment is proactive and is long-term.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:32.203
When you eat sugary foods, it causes an insulin rush. It gives you energy right away, and it does work, but it's short-term and it's fleeting.

00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:36.034
I call that biological debt when you have to pay it back.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:40.755
Kind of like shopping with a credit card, you get the energy now, but you do have to pay it back.

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.892
When the crash comes, the bill is big.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:53.087
A lot of people try to pay it off with more stimulation, and then you get this cycle,

00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:57.054
so it goes stimulation, fatigue, stimulation, fatigue. It cycles like that.

00:00:57.054 --> 00:01:00.265
You just look around and you see all the doughnut shops and the coffee shops.

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:06.019
It's very clear that we're a society dependent on these stimulants to get energy just to get through the day,

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.910
and each time that cycle completes, it actually gets worse, so it snowballs.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.363
The effect gets worse and worse, and it can lead, eventually, to disease.

00:01:16.548 --> 00:01:18.957
There are significant health costs to this cycle.

00:01:18.957 --> 00:01:21.120
Stress leads to elevated cortisol.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:29.677
Elevated cortisol can lead to reduced immune function, storage of body fat, inflammation, premature aging,

00:01:29.677 --> 00:01:35.014
and long-term possible insulin resistance, hypoglycemia, or worse.

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:41.011
Stimulation isn't just about food. You can actually become overstimulated through over things,

00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:49.929
such as TV, especially violent TV, loud music, amusement parks like right behind me here, even violent video games.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.864
That's actually given birth to a whole theory that kids, when they play violent video games, get an adrenaline rush,

00:01:55.864 --> 00:02:01.325
and then they get fatigued after, so then they crave sugary foods and even caffeine in some cases,

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:07.596
which can actually lead to a chemical addiction of stimulation, and that becomes a problem.

00:02:12.996 --> 00:02:17.340
What's the difference between energy from stimulation as opposed to energy from nourishment?

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.466
There's a few things.

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:24.167
One, energy from stimulation is short-term, and it treats the symptom of fatigue, not the cause.

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:29.509
And it's fleeting. You have to constantly stoke it with more stimulants to maintain it.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:36.590
Energy through nourishment is lasting. It's long-term, and it's sustainable, and it won't fatigue your adrenals.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.407
It also leads to recalibration.

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:41.266
I learned about recalibration a few years back.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:45.753
I tried this experiment where I actually ate nothing but greens for about three days.

00:02:45.753 --> 00:02:49.290
Then I had some blueberries, and it felt like I just drank a pot of coffee,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.625
because my body had recalibrated on how it senses food,

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:56.636
so it no longer required stimulants to have a lot of energy.

00:02:56.636 --> 00:03:04.766
That is a good way to start the recalibration process and then get your energy from whole foods and not be dependent on stimulants.

00:03:06.597 --> 00:03:08.350
Recalibration takes time.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.483
Start slow and ease into it.

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:15.277
Cleansing and withdrawal symptoms are common, especially if you're a heavy caffeine user.

00:03:15.277 --> 00:03:17.183
You don't have to do it quickly.

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:21.491
Look, don't get me wrong. Caffeine isn't always bad.

00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:26.035
In fact, you can actually use it as a tool to get more done now.

00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:28.202
Just know that you will have to pay it back later.

00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:33.373
For example, if you're training for a hard athletic event and you want to do a hard workout,

00:03:33.373 --> 00:03:39.966
having a little bit of caffeine before is going to allow you to work harder, which gets you fitter more quickly.

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:46.639
Also, for working, for example, if you're working long hours and you need that little kick to get through an extra amount of work,

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.015
that's fine. Have some caffeine.

00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:52.926
However, just remember you do have to pay it back.

00:03:52.926 --> 00:03:54.595
You will be going to biological debt,

00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:58.165
so just rest a little more later to offset what you've borrowed now.

00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:04.260
