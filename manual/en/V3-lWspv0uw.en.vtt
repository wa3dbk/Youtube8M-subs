00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:14.629
Hi I am Archana Arte. I am a complete 
 foodie, I just love cooking new dishes.

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.738
Today I am going to use these curry leaves to make a dal.

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:27.074
The ingredients you will need include 1 cup tur 
 dal, 1 tbsp ghee, 1/4th cup asafoetida 

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:37.153
1/2 tbsp turmeric powder, 15-16 curry leaves, 1/2 tsp mustard 
 seeds, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds and salt to taste

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:42.666
First, soak the dal in water.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:48.961
Tip 
Pre-soaked dal cooks faster and easily.

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.906
Now lets cook the pre-soaked dal.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:10.312
This much water is not enough. We will need 
 to add some more water to it.

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:20.181
To add the right amount of water use the 
 line mark on your fingers as a measurement.

00:01:20.183 --> 00:01:22.301
Now let's turn on the cooker. 

00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:36.127
We will add 1/2 tsp turmeric and asafoetida powder in it.
The 
 turmeric powder will give it the yellow colour. 

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:44.680
The asafoetida reduces the thickness of the dal.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:02:06.240
Tip
Always put the whistle on the lid after you have covered the pressure cooker, 
 if not you will struggle to cover the lid because of the pressure.

00:02:06.244 --> 00:02:17.660
Now let the dal cook for 3 whistles, after which 
 switch off the burner and wait for 5 minutes.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:24.410
3 whistles are done. Let's switch off the gas. 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:35.330
After switching off the gas, let the cooker cool for 5 minutes 
 and ensure that no steam is coming out from the whistle.

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:49.040
The dal looks cooked. This dal now is plain without any additional flavours to it. If 
 you add a little bit of salt and sugar this will be a 'varan.'

00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:53.540
So, now we shall make the seasoning for 
 the dal.
This will give it more flavour.

00:02:56.326 --> 00:03:03.660
Add 1tsp ghee in a separate pan. Once it is heated 
 a bit, we will add the other ingredients.  

00:02:56.326 --> 00:03:03.660
Add 1tsp ghee in a separate pan. Once it is heated 
 a bit, we will add the other ingredients.  

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:17.160
First, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, 
 add 1/2 tsp asafoetida and 5-6 curry leaves.

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:37.380
Now quickly pour the dal into the seasoning and add salt to taste.

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:43.650
Keep stirring the dal for 2-3 minutes.
Your dal is 
 finally cooked and ready to be served.
