00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.999
 

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.318
Landscape photography is a creative process,

00:00:24.492 --> 00:00:26.996
and filters are vital creative tools.

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:34.352
Some filter effects cannot be replicated
in postproduction.

00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:37.690
Polarisers are one example of this

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.025
and ND standard filters are another.

00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:51.337
Both are very much part of the craft
of photography in the field.

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:54.310
I’d now like to show you
how they work in practice.

00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:05.328
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.552
The polariser has a number of advantages.

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:21.042
The most obvious one
is that it darkens a blue sky

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:23.669
but it has other applications, too.

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:28.498
It removes reflections from vegetation, for example,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.705
which increases colour saturation.

00:01:31.878 --> 00:01:36.672
And it removes reflections from water,

00:01:36.714 --> 00:01:40.534
allowing you to see beneath its surface.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.239
 

00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:51.533
After the ND grad, the polariser
is the most important filter

00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:53.682
for a landscape photographer.

00:01:54.727 --> 00:02:00.243
It’s expensive but you only need one.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.551
The system holder has an accessory ring

00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:11.740
 onto which the 105mm polarising filter fits.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.079
The ring needs to be attached
to the outside of the filter holder.

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:23.021
I recommend fitting the polariser onto the holder
before you attach it to the camera.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.104
Hold the filter flat and screw the polariser onto it

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.693
to avoid the danger of dropping it.

00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:46.600
The polariser darkens the light coming into the camera

00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:54.609
so I set the orientation of the polariser
before I put it on the camera.

00:03:00.316 --> 00:03:02.930
You don’t have to turn the holder,

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.276
you simply have to turn the polariser itself within the ring.

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:12.745
I always have the brass lug on the right.

00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:21.180
You look at the scene and rotate the polariser.

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:28.534
It’s easier to see the changes this way
than when it is on the camera.

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:31.880
In this case, the effect is very obvious.

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.609
 

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:45.394
To increase the exposure time
and get a more fluid feel to the water,

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.806
 I’m using an ND standard.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.531
This is a two-stop filter.

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:56.699
I’m going to take the holder off

00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:03.215
and place the filter in the rear guide rails.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.772
The waterfall at the bottom of this picture
is very brightly lit.

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.837
I think I can improve the image

00:04:16.884 --> 00:04:23.938
and balance the exposure
by using a 0.6 ND grad inverted.

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.496
I’m going to insert this one upside down
in the second guide rails.

00:04:50.444 --> 00:04:54.160
The image is bright enough for me to see the effect

00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:03.196
and the grad is doing exactly what I want it to.

00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:14.266
The exposure has reduced to one second
at my preferred aperture.

00:05:15.223 --> 00:05:18.091
I’m just going to make a test picture.
