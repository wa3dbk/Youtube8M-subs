Howdy folks hows it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen today i'm showing you how to make

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:12.130
your very own peanut butter from home.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.990
Looks amazing right and I can't tell you how
deliciously simple and easy and basic and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.300
novice yet tasty and just satisfying this
is you can make it as chunky and as smooth

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.949
as you like, it's minimal ingredients hit
pause now right them all down if you want

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.880
to have a go, it's very similar to when we
made Nutella the other day and this is basically

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.880
how you do it.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.630
Get your peanuts and pour them onto a baking
tray then drizzle over a little peanut oil

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.090
a pinch of salt, then mix it all around to
get it nice and coated.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.300
Slam it into a pre-heated oven you wanna cook
them for around about 10-15 minutes just for

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.100
them to brown but you can actually customise
this bit aswell because the more you brown

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.990
them the deeper the colour and the taste is
gonna be, once you are happy with your peanuts

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.540
and I did just say peanuts this isn't the
giant reese's peanut butter cup video we did,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.020
just leave them on the side on the tray just
to cool down naturally about 5-10 mins they

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.360
don't need to be stone cold but just let them
relax a little bit they've been having a hard

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.360
time in that oven.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.671
Put the cooled peanuts into a blender i've
divided my mixture by two just because of

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:14.590
the size of the blender i'm using then you
wanna add in your golden syrup, pinch of salt

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.130
and the peanut oil and then just whizz it
all up and let it break down naturally.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.000
After the first minute or so of blending it
might be like a thick paste and you don't

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.890
want it like that ok, so rather than pouring
oil in and being tempted like that add some

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.890
water ok because you don't want it to be like
an oil spill and continue to whizz it up until

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.280
you're happy with your texture.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.610
After about 3 or 4 minutes it'll go super
smooth.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.850
With it all broken down and it nice and smooth
you've effectively made peanut butter, there

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.272
was me thinking peanut butter, with the butter
in the title actually had butter in it and

00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:44.420
i'm sure the store bought stuff probably does
but that is it and it tastes amazing, here

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.340
is a little shot of it in a bowl I didn't
wanna do anything with it at this stage because

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.280
I just wanted smooth peanut butter but what
you could do then is add some cocoa powder

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.640
you can add some nutella and make a nutella
peanut butter oh my gosh that'd be good, if

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.409
you wanted to make it chunkier maybe break-up
or bash some peanut pieces and mix it through

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.979
- chunky peanut butter!

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.119
Keep it in an air tight jar or container and
spread it on, eating it til your hearts to

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.119
