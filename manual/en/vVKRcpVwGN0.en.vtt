00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.129
Hi, I'm Daphne Stamaris and I got into
computers in kind of a weird way, like

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.209
it wasn't an "ah-ha" thing

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.639
I just wanted something kind of

00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:21.579
new and different for me because I'd 
never worked on computers before and never

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:23.589
really dealt much with technology

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.469
so it was kind of

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:29.200
an interesting field for me.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.320
I got my AA in Computer Network Engineering
at Pierce College.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.670
At the same time I earned a
certificate in network administration

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.440
um, and I currently work here at Pierce 
College as well

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.129
I also did an internship with the
IT department at Pierce College.

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.910
Kind of have a loyalty thing with Pierce
college obviously.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.020
Technology is always changing and
there's always something new coming

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.769
out. I mean operating systems,

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.980
new programs, new Office suites.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.760
There's always something new
that you have to learn

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
but that kind of the nice part of it too
because then it's not

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.290
always the same thing you don't always
come to work and have to do the same

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.410
exact task or,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.220
you know, have this same problem because
every computer is different and there

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.820
are so many different things you can do
in this field and so many different

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.440
things coming out that

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.880
it kind of expands it a lot.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.120
It's interesting being a female in a male
dominated field but, um, 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.590
it's actually kind of fun.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.050
I know that sounds really weird but it
is.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.240
There's always something new happening,
males don't expect to see me in the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.960
field, but it, it has it's benefits

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.939
for instance there is

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.270
scholarship opportunities opening up

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.590
for females you decide to go into
computers.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.840
In some cases, I'd not experienced
it myself, but

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.920
career opportunities more for females

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.200
in the field.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.009
I wasn't prepared for the fact that

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.470
just because there's a problem on one
computer and it's happening on another

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.899
and that it's not the same problem.

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.709
Um, even if it's the same exact
computer it can be a completely

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.479
different problem just like very 
unique and very

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:28.699
frustrating at times but very fun
because it opens

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:34.339
doors to learning more and it's interesting.
I don't really have a typical day because

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.129
it kind of depends

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.009
which is why this field is so awesome.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.759
But generally I try to come in and

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:47.059
I maintain the lab for
the C and E classrooms 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.579
so I try to make sure that all the
compares are working and running

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.409
I also maintained the

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.040
department website for C and E.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.889
By doing so I maintain a jobs
board for students hoping that if

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.259
they're having a hard time looking for
jobs that that could possibly help them.

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.899
I think that job market is improving
for the field uh... there's a lot of

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.979
opportunities opening up

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.989
and I've noticed a lot more job offers

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.809
and a lot more job openings for entry
level positions and positions

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:23.159
that are good for students coming 
out to the field.
