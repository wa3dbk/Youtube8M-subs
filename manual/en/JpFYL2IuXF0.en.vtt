00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.980
gay pride parades are becoming more
corporate in the gay community is a

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.609
little worried about it because more
corporations

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.110
usually equals a little more censorship

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.030
were a lot more censorship so I you know
they're is that the gay pride parade in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.279
Dallas there was a lot of controversy
about that because all the sudden

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.830
they're all these corporate sponsors

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.539
and I can understand why a parade would
need corporate sponsors you want to be

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.609
able to pay for the festivities and I
can get really expensive

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.650
but corporations don't want to put their
name on something

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.200
if they know that there will be nudity
or if there's going to be any type of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.730
risque behavior

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.579
and people are understandably upset
because you think gay pride parade

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.860
and you think fun risky behavior fiction
ends

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.789
you think CNN's exactly so what are you
guys some quotes from people who are a

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:47.969
little upset about this

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.210
Daniel Scott coats says the following:
to make the parade more family-friendly

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.379
and to accommodate comfort for the
increasing number of attending

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.449
heterosexuals in corporate sponsorship

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.460
participants are being asked to cover up
the queer is effectively being a race

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670
from our pride celebration

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.140
so my favorite quote closer activists
hearty hey termine

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.860
which already has an awesome name he
says this simulation is Isis we toned

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.369
down

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.640
throw away all our joyous sexy this

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.330
why to do that turns the Pride Parade in
20 we are ashamed parade

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.810
and I refuse to be part of a I love this
guy

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.250
his joyous sexiness shall not be
comparable

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.680
okay I'm right there with you hater I
mean

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.380
party later I get okay so what are your
thoughts on this because

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.700
more and more gay couples are being
allowed to adopt which is great news and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.729
they want to take their children to
these events

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.899
but they feel like these events are a
little too I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.409
like risk air salacious or never for
kids to show up to

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.490
but my take on that is kinda like
whatever

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.469
having gay parades were like this from
the beginning like why do we have to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.719
change it just to make it
family-friendly

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.210
it's like saying all we can to change a
strip club I'm not trying to compare day

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.409
parades a strip club

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.729
but it's like me going to a strip club
thing I have children now

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.739
I would like this trick up 2 Chainz well
you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.410
a pretty good analogy is a Mardi GRA
right okay could you write because

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.660
Mardi Gras is yes it's it's not a strip
club

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.670
right it is got flowed sadness over this

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.720
family-friendly summer but is not and
then you got pics every

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.319
right so like are we supposed to like
putting big

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.910
exxon and Bank of America slogan or
mardi gras and say all right

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.560
there were no sanitize the whole thing
for five girls week every

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.140
everything society download to the
sanitation little over 5

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.019
I totally agree okay so I'm I with the
guys

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.640
who want to keep having fun in in bring
out their joy sexiness

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.300
reggae so in look part a bit

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.760
is great news of course like the fact
that now corporations

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.930
accept gay people great in 10 bond in

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.110
be involved in gay parades so any more
straight people showing up a gay parades

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.230
who this ok terrific news but there's no
need to bring it down

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.230
I mean Mardi Gras as assimilated into

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.019
at least knows culture and they didn't
or down immediately

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.409
have from way back in the day but but
not much

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.640
righted so at least bon has your
sexiness as tits

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.420
it is fun for everybody okay in and you
everybody knows from

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.940
like if you've ever gone to a gay parade
there's a party you like okay yes

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.950
okay we're gay people like everybody
else great for the idiots who don't know

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.379
that

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.370
enjoy that part right and then there's
the fun part where you're like oh okay I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.700
didn't think they could happen but

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.659
you know that but it's happening yeah
yeah and by the way just like much what

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.890
you said about how great it is the
corporations are now sponsoring events

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.569
like this

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.980
of course I mean it goes back to the
whole thing about how corporations have

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.909
no morality

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.470
they don't judge one way or another they
go to where the money is and right now

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.170
the money is in the gay community

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.099
so of course they're gonna sponsor
events like that yea I it's got a lot

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.760
when right where travel quite that way

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.470
well I got bad news for you the free
market is a cited a gay people have

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.310
disposable income yeah okay the market
is very much interested

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.209
and that this post link now i would
offer a gyro says who wrote about this

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.959
is a blogger

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.570
yes and he wrote but I got him all the
gay politics twenty years ago in order

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.049
when the right to serve in the military
have a job and get married among others

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.400
to nothing do with public nudity i'm ok
do a good explanation

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.199
how this looks back door civil rights
but I've not heard a good one yet

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.410
the larger makes a good point bread

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.270
gay pride has to different purposes the
gay pride events

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.650
great one is with john is talking about
he's absolutely right

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.790
you know the massive we're though not

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.350
massive problem is some public nudity
whatever it might be the fun

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.430
if you are having is that is so iraq
related to

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.960
gay rights it's not related to gay
rights but if thats one of the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.330
components up celebrating Gay Pride

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.020
then I don't have an issue i mean look
I'm not gay so for me to say I don't

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.800
have an issue with it is one thing but

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.060
obviously their members the gay
community that love that they like the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.840
spectacular sexy this is that one
person's let you know

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.620
let the rabbit just because it's not for
you doesn't mean it can't be for anyone

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.930
else yeah the second part of it is
expressing yourself

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.340
less other express themselves and so I i
feel that it's a shame to limit

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.430
so I vote don't limit measure my vote
counts

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.380
and I hear the other side is that
wonderful gay couple their five-year-old

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.910
son they come to the parade near like

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.720
would like to be able to show them you
know why we're proud to be gay

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.250
but then you know the things that we go
she loves ice from

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.690
into me hey you know that's life
