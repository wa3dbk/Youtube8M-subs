THE DAIRY COWS ON

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.600
SPOKANE'S FAMILY FARM ARE
A HAPPY HERD; WITH GREEN

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.767
PASTURES, CLEAN CORRALS
AND LOTS OF LOVE.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.233
I'm passionate about
cows, I love good cows.

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:38.667
In order to be a dairy
farmer you need to really

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.167
love your cows and we love
our cows, they're kind of

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.700
like family.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.867
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
FLUENT IN BOVINE TO

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.033
UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE
HERE IS PRETTY SWEET.

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.600
NESTLED ON THE WEST PLAINS
OF EASTERN WASHINGTON,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.900
SPOKANE'S FAMILY FARM
IS HOME TO SOME OF THE

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.600
FRESHEST MILK IN
THE NORTHWEST.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.900
ESTABLISHED IN 2008 BY
MIKE AND TRISH VIEIRA, THE

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.967
DAIRIES MISSION IS BLACK
AND WHITE: TO PROVIDE

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:02.333
CUSTOMERS WITH HIGH
QUALITY, LIGHTLY PROCESSED

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.933
MILK THAT IS DELIVERED
JUST AS NATURE INTENDED.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.867
ON SPOKANE'S FAMILY FARM,
MILK GOES FROM COW TO CUP

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:13.567
IN LESS THAN 72 HOURS AND
TRAVELS JUST 20 MILES.

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:17.200
If you want to do it any
better or any fresher than

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.467
that you have to
have your own cow.

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:25.333
It is so creamy and so
wholesome and I've had

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.167
children say that they
don't need chocolate in

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:31.567
their milk anymore because
Spokane's family farm milk

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.567
is that sweet, and it
comes naturally that

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.867
sweet, but the taste alone
usually sells our milk

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.267
right up front.

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:40.033
We have never had anyone
ever say that it wasn't

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.533
awesome.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.700
When you taste Spokane's
Family Farm milk it's just

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.400
rich and creamy in a
different way than I've

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.100
ever tasted before.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.333
It tastes wholesome; it
just tastes like real

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.333
food.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.400
You drink a glass of this
milk and you're like, oh

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.800
is this what milk is
supposed to taste like.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.400
MODERN MILKING MACHINES
HELP THIS DAIRY PRODUCE

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400
ABOUT 500 GALLONS OF
MILK EVERY OTHER DAY.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.733
BUT THE VIEIRA'S STILL
TAKE A HANDS ON APPROACH

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.933
WHEN IT COMES TO MILK
PRODUCTION AND CARE OF

00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:08.167
THEIR COWS.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.500
We renovated a farm that
was built in 1937 hasn't

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.100
seen a dairy cow
on it since 1962.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.500
We milk in a flat barn I
have to squat down to milk

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.133
every cow, I feed by
hand in the parlor, so

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.567
everything's still pretty
manual and hard work.

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:29.400
A typical day here on the
farm, I get up at 4:30 in

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.433
the morning, I'm out here
by 4:35 and I just go out

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.767
to the barn and I throw
down hay for the cows,

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:37.233
walk through the cows get
them all up and make sure

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:40.167
everybody's okay and up
at the feed bunk eating

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:42.433
before I go into the barn
and start setting up to

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.200
sanitize and getting ready
to milk and about 5:05

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.433
It's time to milk and I
bring the girls into the

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:51.200
barn and it takes me about
an hour to milk and about

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.767
another hour to clean
up when I'm done.

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:56.533
Every other day it's a
little different, on my

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:59.033
bottling days as soon as
I'm done I'm transferring

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.167
raw milk into the
pasteurizer and getting

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:02.700
ready for bottling.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.367
Meanwhile, I'm doing all
my clean up out here, I'm

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:07.800
harrowing my corrals, I
feed the cows one more

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.633
time at 10, then I usually
have time to go get

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:14.467
cleaned up before I go
into the bottling room, so

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:16.867
I'm in there for a couple
of hours bottling and then

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:20.067
cleaning up and then that
milk, I'll take it right

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.267
directly to the
distributor and get back

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:25.467
at home in time to maybe
grab a bite to eat and get

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:28.633
back out to start milking
again for the evening

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:29.833
milking.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:30.900
It's a long day.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.600
I've been passionate for
the dairy industry and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.467
dairy cattle since my
first visit to my uncle's

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.533
farm in second grade,
and that's when I got the

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:43.100
itch, got the bug to have
dairy cows, and got it in

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.067
my blood.

00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:47.967
You know it's kind of like
the old saying says you

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:50.067
can take the girl out of
the country, you never

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:53.800
take the country out of
the girl and that's kind

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.233
of me from the get go.

00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:58.733
I was farming since a very
little girl and just love

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:00.100
the critters.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.267
STATE LICENSED AND
FEDERALLY APPROVED,

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:04.500
SPOKANE'S FAMILY FARM
FOLLOWS STRICT GUIDELINES

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.700
TO ENSURE THEIR MILK IS
SAFE, PURE, AND NATURAL.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.200
BUT IT'S NOT ORGANIC.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200
AND THERE ARE 30
GOOD REASONS WHY.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.300
Our herd's valuable to us,
so we wanted to reserve

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.467
the right to use
antibiotics in a life

00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:18.900
threatening situation.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.433
On an organic farm we
can't have an antibiotic

00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:23.533
on the farm where our
philosophy was we'll just

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:27.567
take her out of the herd
if we ever have to treat

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:28.600
them.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.800
We're natural, we cannot
ship any milk with any

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.467
antibiotics, we have a
drug lab, cause have to

00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:35.833
test every batch of milk
for antibiotics and so if

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:39.567
we have to treat a cow
she comes out of the milk

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:41.600
tank, we milk her
separately and she gets

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.333
tested until she tests
negative for antibiotics

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.500
and which at that time she
can go back into the herd.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.033
The milk components are
kept very, very natural;

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:53.267
we do the best we can to
keep it preserved as we

00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:55.300
can as it just
came from the cow.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.167
It is only pasteurized for
safety very lightly at 145

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:00.733
degrees then we do not
homogenize so we skip that

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.767
whole step altogether so
you get that wonderful

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:05.167
cream on top that cows are
supposed to produce and

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:07.300
you get to do what you
want with it if you want

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.967
to make butter with your
kids or if you want to

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:14.867
drink it it's all
good it's all personal

00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:15.867
preference FIELD TRIPS
AREN'T JUST FOR KIDS.

00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:16.967
AND ON SPOKANE'S FAMILY
FARM, TOURS LET PEOPLE SEE

00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:18.033
WHERE THE MILK THEY'RE
DRINKING CAME FROM AND HOW

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:20.300
IT GOT THERE.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.467
LAST YEAR ABOUT 8000
PEOPLE VISITORS STOPPED BY

00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:24.233
THIS LITTLE HOUSE
ON THE DAIRY.

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:27.233
We could actually come out
to the farm and I could

00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:29.767
bring my boys out here and
actually show them where

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:31.333
the milk is coming from.

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:33.667
To actually have them be
able to see the process,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.800
it just makes it more than
just the milk we drink.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.500
I kind of like seeing all
of the animals for the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.733
first time just because
like you see them on TV

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:44.067
all the time but then when
you see them in person

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:46.467
it's just like you get
to interact with them.

00:05:46.467 --> 00:05:49.100
Here at Spokane's family
farm I get the joy of

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.100
cooking for the people
that come for my tours.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.533
They have a choice of
ending their tour with our

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:55.733
fresh milk with homemade
cookies or they get to

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:57.100
have homemade ice cream.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.567
The eggs that I use and
the cream and milk comes

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.633
right off this farm they
get to see it handled,

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:03.733
they get to see where
it comes and they get to

00:06:03.733 --> 00:06:06.267
taste the finished product
and that just, you don't

00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:08.367
get any better
feeling than that.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.833
That is just
what we're about.

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:13.533
MILK FROM SPOKANE'S FAMILY
FARM IS AVAILABLE RIGHT ON

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:15.400
THE DAIRY AND AT GROCERY
STORES THROUGHOUT THE

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.833
NORTHWEST.

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:20.500
THE VIEIRA'S ARE SURE
AFTER ONE SIP YOU'LL AGREE

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.467
THAT MILK FROM THEIR
CONTENTED COWS IS THE

00:06:23.467 --> 00:06:26.800
CREAM OF THE CROP.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.800
Dairy farming is such a
hard job, but you have to

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.933
love the cows, you have to
love what you do and you

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.067
have to have that purpose
when you go to bed at

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:35.600
night completely
exhausted, it's an

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.067
exhaustion that just gives
you a solid peace about

00:06:38.067 --> 00:06:39.900
who you are and where
we are in this world.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.467
Trish and my name go out
on every single jug of

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:44.767
milk its right there Mike
and Trish, bottled by

00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:47.433
Spokane's family farm.

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:49.900
It's a very small farm,
a very simple farm, it's

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.333
awfully hard work but
everything we do we do

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:55.933
with pride.
