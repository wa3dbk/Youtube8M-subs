A helionizon
graphing device?

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:07.924
The day guy,
he knows this area
really good.

00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:09.760
I can't help you.

00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:12.562
Was this
a double occupancy?

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.182
Correct.
That is my mate.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.334
Yeah. Right.
You know,
I'm sure she is.

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:22.038
That's...

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:24.658
That's fine.
O.K.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.670
Will that be,
uh...Cash...
Or charge?

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:38.354
Heh?

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.223
How are
you paying?

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:42.893
We shall remunerate

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.394
With metallic
tender disks.

00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:45.929
Correct.

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:47.664
This is fine.
Yeah.

00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:55.755
[bed vibrating]

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.168
Ha ha ha ha!

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.994
Hee hee hee hee!

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.363
Primitive.

00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.099
We must find one
with components

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:25.001
To communicate
distress to remulak.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.605
The high master
will be displeased
about the ship.

00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:29.606
Affirmative.

00:01:29.674 --> 00:01:32.542
He will surely
cut off my plarg.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.543
Aahh!

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.044
Do not despair,
prymaat.

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:36.546
We will be rescued.

00:01:36.614 --> 00:01:38.548
Until then,
we must adapt.

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:40.550
When the hydrogen
droplets cease,

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:43.052
We will live
undetected on earth

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.554
Amongst
the bluntskulls.

00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:46.556
Beldar,
how can we live

00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:48.391
Among
the bluntskulls?

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.495
We will blend in.

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:54.130
[television]
&lt;i&gt;my goodness!&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:55.815
&lt;i&gt;Wow!&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:57.084 --> 00:02:00.520
&lt;i&gt;Here's the man that&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;made it happen last match.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:04.124
Aahh!           Aahh!
