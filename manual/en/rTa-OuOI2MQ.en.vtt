00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:08.240
So we'll start by soaking your feet in a warm
water soak. You'll want a bowl big enough

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.269
for both feet. And before getting anyone's
feet wet, you'll want to ask your client if

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.579
there are any open cuts on her feet or his
feet just to make sure you are not going to

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:26.369
infect or agitate anything. So, do you have
any cuts or bruises on your feet I should

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.119
know about? (No.) Great, so into this bowl
of warm water, we are going to add about a

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:41.650
quarter of a cup of Epsom salts. These help
draw out the toxins from your feet and help

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.960
soften up your feet. Epsom salts are also
really good general muscle relaxer. Less than

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.960
a quarter of a cup usually isn't enough to
really be effective. And more than a quarter

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:05.360
of a cup tends to cloud up the water and about
a handful is all you'll need. Too much really

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.660
is difficult for your body to start to absorb.
And then we'll also add about a quarter of

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:24.430
a cup of apple cider vinegar.
And the acidity of the vinegar is also going

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.390
to promote blood flow to your feet. So we'll
get our feet nicely softened up. Apple cider

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:45.000
vinegar also has a great smell and it's not
too acidic like using a regular white distilled

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.260
vinegar or like a rice vinegar. It's one of
the more mellow vinegars you can use. At this

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.050
point you can also put in your aromatherapy
oils if you want to include any. For the feet,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.390
if you are looking for a more energetic and
energizing massage, you'll want to use a peppermint

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.000
or spearmint. If you are looking for something
to be more relaxing and calming, chamomile

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.390
and lavender and geranium are all great to
put in there. And if you are dealing with

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.390
someone who's got specific injury soreness,
juniper is a great aromatherapy oil to throw

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.230
in. And we'll let the feet soak for about
five to ten minutes, and then dry them off

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.170
and start our massage.
