00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.520
There are many beautiful fishes in this pond. Let's become their friends!!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.300
There was once a pond which remained full of water throughout the year.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.180
Many beautiful fishes lived there.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.540
Amongst them, three fishes were very good friends.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.320
However, their thinking was entirely different from each other.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:10.800
The first fish was very wise.  
She Said, "We should always think before doing anything."

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.000
The second fish was intelligent.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.040
She Said " Whenever there is a problem, we should use our intelligence to find a solution.!"

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.760
The third fish believed in fate.
She said "Whatever is bound to happen will surely happen."

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.200
" Itâ€™s all a matter of luck.!"

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.600
One day, the wise fish heard two fishermen talking to each other.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.200
Fisherman:  Oh! look here! There are so many big and fat fishes in the pond.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.000
I will again come here tomorrow to catch them.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.750
Hearing this, the wise fish to rushed to her friends.  She told them all that she had heard about the fishermen.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.700
She said "We must leave this pond immediately and go to some other one."

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:28.280
The intelligent fish "No, no.  We must wait for the fisherman to come.  When they will come, then we will find out a way to escape."

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.080
The third fish:  "Oh, will you both please keep quiet?!  I have lived in this pond all my life.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.400
Why should I leave it?! Whatever is destined to happen will surely happen. Why worry unnecessarily!!"

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.000
These words scared the wise fish. She decided to leave the pond that very moment.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:07.400
The next morning, the fisherman came to the pond.  He threw his net into the water.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:16.209
In a short while he caught many fishes. The two friends of the wise fish were also amongst them.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:25.500
The intelligent fish quickly thought of a plan to save her life.  She lay still in the net as if she was dead.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.260
The fisherman said " Oh! What is this? This fish looks dead.  What is the use of taking such a rotten fish?!"

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.720
So he removed the intelligent fish from the net and threw her back into the water.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.740
She then jumped immediately and swam away.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:07.040
Now the third fish, who believed in luck, began to jump up and down to free  herself from the net.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:16.000
The fisherman saw her doing that so he pulled her from the net and threw her into his basket.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.560
So, in this way, the first two fishes saved themselves, while the third one died.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:44.260
Moral of this story:  "We should always think properly before doing anything so we can avoid problems."
