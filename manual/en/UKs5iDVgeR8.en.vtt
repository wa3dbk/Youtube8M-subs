00:00:01.698 --> 00:00:05.185
Badr Hari

00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:13.687
Q: How do you feel about the match?

00:00:13.687 --> 00:00:21.693
A: It was great in itself. Zabit is a technical fighter.

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:31.593
He's not at my level yet, though. I thought I'd show him that tonight.

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:49.123
I'm happy with how my game plan went.

00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:52.975
Q: Is there someone you want to fight tomorrow?

00:01:52.975 --> 00:02:09.353
Alistair is also moving up to the next round.

00:02:09.617 --> 00:02:16.410
A: This system of randomly assigning opponents is strange.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.383
But I'm prepared for anyone.

00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:41.655
The next tournament will be hard, so I'll prepare to fight anyone without any problems.
