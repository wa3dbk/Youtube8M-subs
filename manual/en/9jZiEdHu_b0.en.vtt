00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.010
up

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.140
2015 Subaru Crosstrek is in its element,
outdoors

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.480
the funky wagon based on the Impreza has
been a success for Subaru since it went

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.240
on sale just a couple years ago

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.740
and for 2015 Subaru has designed a special
addition color to celebrate that

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.439
success

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.150
its retna searing yellow

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.360
or bananarama

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.630
or something

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.710
whatever the color the car gets a lot of
attention just based on its capability

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.900
despite its small size there's a ton of
interior space

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.100
and even though the small 2-liter four
is a bit on the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.730
mmm strain side it has just enough power
to get wherever it needs to go

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.340
inside the Crosstrek is the biggest
difference over last year

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.710
super dumped its spartan infotainment
system

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.290
and plugged in its really sleek new head unit
its swipe-able,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.880
zoomable, and really seeable, a big
improvement over last year

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.630
although I'm not sure that I've ever
used Aha Radio in my life

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.330
the other big upgrade over last year is
the eyesight system

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.340
which is available now in higher trims of
the Crosstrek this forward windshield

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.250
looking nerve farm controls the
Crosstrek safety brain

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.900
a suite of features that includes
adaptive cruise control lane departure

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.460
warnings

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.410
and emergency braking if you've got to
smack into something safety and

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.910
entertainment don't necessarily turn
your crank

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.119
this year Subaru is gonna make the Crosstrek in a stripped-down base version

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.590
that really just gives people like me
what they're looking for

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.050
an all-wheel drive wagon can basically go anywhere
and all their gear up a mountain

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.229
now once you get up the mountain I guess
you are going to have to entertain yourself but

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.080
I can do that with cards or something. At its heart the
Crosstrek is a small Impreza with tall

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.789
shoes on

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.369
the two liter boxer for is the only
engine you can get the Crosstrek

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.739
and that could be paired with the CVT or
a five-speed manual transmission

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.459
although I prefer manuals and really
anything else

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.130
over a CVT, the continuously variable
gear is far and away the most popular

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.470
pick for this car and it's entirely
serviceable

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.709
appeared say 7,000 feet the boxers
modest 148 horsepower

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.750
is an entirely at a ideas but it is a
little noisy

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.970
that may not mean much to the average
buyer was just looking to stuff a crosstrek

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.590
 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.769
full of as many bikes, canoes,

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.000
skateboards, longboards,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.350
surfboards, snowboards,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.370
and anything else that they want to drag
up to the mountains for the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.240
weekend

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.660
getting into and how to the Crosstrek
is a breeze

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.780
but it's not really any different than
the Impreza once you're inside

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.710
the same interior fades into the
background a little bit and it doesn't

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.790
feel much different than the base sedan

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.420
the 22.3 cubic feet of cargo
capacity

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.790
is less than say a Mazda CX5 but more
than a Jeep Renegade

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.920
and the Crosstrek is comparably priced
among both of them

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.410
but offers all wheel drive a standard as
you might imagine with the smaller

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.920
engine

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.310
fuel economy ranges in the high 20's
depending on the transmission and where

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.950
you're driving

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.370
and its usability is off the charts and
if you're cool with face melting yellow

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.100
then show it off! Be sure to click the link
