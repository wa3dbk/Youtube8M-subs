00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.900
The President:
Well, thank you all for coming to the White House today as we

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.667
commemorate the life and work of
a President in the presence of

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.000
those who loved
him, and knew him,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.266
and respected him deeply as
both a leader and as a man.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.467
And in particular, I want to
thank our special guest here

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:27.300
today, Nancy Reagan,
our former First Lady,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.700
who redefined that role in her
time at the White House --

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.867
and who has, in the many years
since, taken on a new role,

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.800
as an advocate on behalf of
treatments that hold the promise

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.867
of improving and saving lives.

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:42.467
And I should just add, she has
been extraordinarily gracious to

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:47.867
both me and Michelle during our
transition here and I'm thankful for that.

00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:52.800
There are few who are not moved
by the love that Ms. Reagan felt

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.667
for her husband -- and fewer
still who are not inspired by

00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:00.767
how this love led her to take
up the twin causes of stem cell

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:04.800
research and
Alzheimer's research.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.033
In saying a long goodbye, Nancy
Reagan became a voice on behalf

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.967
of millions of families
experiencing the depleting,

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:15.266
aching reality of
Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.367
I'd also like to recognize the
members of Congress who are

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:22.467
standing alongside us, who
worked so hard to pass the

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.533
Ronald Reagan Centennial
Commission Act,

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:29.066
particularly Congressman
Elton Gallegly,

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.200
the lead sponsor of this bill.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.300
Finally, I want to thank
the trustees of the Reagan

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.300
Foundation who are
here today as well.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.834
This legislation -- approved
by an overwhelming bipartisan

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.734
majority in the House
of Representatives,

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:46.967
and passed unanimously
in the Senate --

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.400
will create a commission to honor President Reagan on the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.433
100th anniversary of his birth.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.967
And I am proud to
sign it into law.

00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:59.233
President Reagan understood that
while there are often strong

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:02.767
disagreements between parties
and political adversaries --

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.133
disagreements that can be
a source of conflict and

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:11.300
bitterness -- it is important to
keep in mind all that we share.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.467
For all of the deepest of
divides that exist in America,

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:20.000
the bonds that bring us together
are that much stronger.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.533
And we may see the
world differently,

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:25.533
but we must never stop seeing
one another as fellow Americans

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.200
-- and as patriots -- who want
what is best for the country

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.800
that we love.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.433
This nation was built on the
basis of the principle that we

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:39.500
are stronger, not weaker, for
even the most vigorous debates

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.333
-- debates that have energized
our politics since the inventors

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:45.667
of America argued over our
founding documents more than two

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:47.400
centuries ago.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.633
Through the weighing of
different views we take measure

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:52.233
of where we stand
and where we must go.

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.734
And the moment we fail to
recognize the good in those with

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:57.400
whom we quarrel, is the moment
that we've lost sight of who we

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.567
are as a people.

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:04.367
President Reagan helped as much
as any President to restore a

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:06.800
sense of optimism
in our country,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.734
a spirit that
transcended politics --

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:13.367
that transcended even the most heated arguments of the day.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:17.467
It was this optimism that
allowed leaders like the

00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:19.700
President and
Speaker Tip O'Neill,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.633
who held sharply
different philosophies,

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:24.867
to sit down together at the end
of difficult debates as friends,

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:28.000
and to work with one another on
complex and contentious issues

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
like Social Security.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.166
It was this optimism that the
American people sorely needed

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:36.300
during a difficult period -- a
period of economic and global

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.567
challenges that tested
us in unprecedented ways.

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:44.967
In these perilous times,
President Reagan had the ability

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:48.967
to communicate directly and
movingly to the American people;

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:52.266
to understand both the hardships
they felt in their lives and the

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:56.100
hopes that they had
for their country.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.367
That was powerful,
that was important,

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:03.700
and we are better off for the
extraordinary leadership that he showed.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.633
So I'm glad to have
all of you here today;

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:10.333
I'm especially glad to have
Mrs. Reagan here today as we

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.667
sign this bill.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:13.967
I'll look forward to the seeing
the fruits of this commission's

00:04:13.967 --> 00:04:16.500
work, culminating in the
celebration of President

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.600
Reagan's life on the occasion
of his 100th birthday.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.133
And on that morning in America,
we can be proud to come together

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.567
as one nation --
and one people --

00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:29.000
to honor a leader who loved this country and wanted nothing more

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.567
than to see its
promise fulfilled.

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:33.900
So thank you all very much.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.834
God bless you.

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:36.767
God bless the United
States of America.

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:38.367
Ms. Reagan, let's
go sign this bill.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:15.100
(the Act is signed)

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.100
The President:
Well, I think that President Reagan's signature was more

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.400
legible than mine.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.633
(laughter)

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.166
All right, there you go.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:29.266
And, actually, you
guys each get a --

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:30.734
get one of these pens.

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:35.033
Congratulations for doing this.

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:36.233
Here you go.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.433
Here you go.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.200
And you have plenty of Presidential pens.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.533
(laughter)
