00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.630
When filleting a fish, what you really want
to do is, well, whenever you do anything,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.349
whenever you're doing any kind of prep, whatever
the meat, always make sure that you have a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.700
really nice sharp knife.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.219
A sharp knife is a safe knife.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.370
I know we've heard that before, but it's very
very true, because the sharper the knife,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.269
the less pressure you're going to have to
apply.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.439
As soon as you start applying pressure to
a knife, that's when you can slip and you

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.369
can hurt yourself, or just lose meat.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460
Really make sure that your knife is nice and
sharp.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.440
The next thing you want to do is when you
have a fish, whether it's round or flat (so

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.989
round like snapper, salmon, stripe bass, and
any of those fish that are actually round

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.850
and have two sides, or something like a flounder
that's flat that has two sides but you can

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.570
get four fillets out, either way), what you
want to do is you want to make sure that you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.020
have a starting point and an ending point
for your fillet or your cut.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.920
What you can do is you can take your knife
and draw a line around the back of its head

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.500
and down behind the gills.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.910
It's actually a little bone structure that
you can follow.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.939
You can just draw a line there and then come
down to the tail and draw another line.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.350
By drawing those two lines, you've kind of
created your points A and B.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.880
You can now then take your knife, and if it's
a round fish you would come up from actually

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.240
up by the middle fin which is kind of up by
the spine on the back, like a shark fin almost.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.650
Run along there, and go from your point A
to B.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.159
If you're dealing with something like a flounder
or a flat fish, you could even start in the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.450
middle of the fillet and just come down, almost
like splitting a chicken.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.579
Just coming right down the middle to the spine
and then opening it up like a book.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.640
Once you actually are starting to fillet,
whatever you do, always make sure that you

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.219
use nice clean strokes.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.479
If you're doing a short, sawing motion, you
could really shred up the meat and lose a

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.790
lot of product.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.020
The fillet knife, or the boning knife, is
actually a great tool for that, because what

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.140
you can do now is you can actually bend the
knife a little bit and use it to just glide

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.830
the teeth across the bones.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.730
Literally, just kind of releasing the meat
off the bone.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.410
So you don't have to saw.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.260
Just nice clean strokes, and that fillet should
open up for you.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.019
Once your fillet has been released off the
spine, you can actually take the knife and

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.939
just kind of clear the skin off from the inside
and release that entire fillet from the fish.
