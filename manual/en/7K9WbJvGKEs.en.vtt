Hi, I'm Sam with Grocery Coupon Network and
today I wanted to talk to you a little bit

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400
about saving on organic foods.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.700
Organic coupons are out there, they just don't
come around quite as often as non-organic

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.199
coupons do.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.300
But the best way to save on organic foods
is the same way you save on non-organic foods.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.230
Wait for a sale, pair it with a coupon, stack
another coupon if possible, a store coupon

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.480
and buying in bulk.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.650
Those are my four best tips for saving on
organic foods.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.900
At Whole Foods and Target they both have store
coupons that come around occasionally that

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.780
you can stack with manufacturer's coupons
on their organic products.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.570
This makes for a great deal if you can catch
it at a time when there's a sale or sometimes

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.350
even if it's not on sale.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.530
If your coupons are a high enough value it
still makes for a really good deal to stack

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.379
the coupons and save.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.600
So these are some products that I just wanted
to share with you.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.890
This I got at target using a printable coupon
from Grocery Coupon Network.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.080
It was on sale for $1.25 and it was a $0.50
off coupon so I paid $0.75 for this can of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.890
organic diced tomatoes.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.600
And you would pay that for a can of non-organic
tomatoes if you weren't using a coupon or

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.110
didn't have a sale.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.340
So this is a good deal and it's a product
we use a lot in my house.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.080
Another staple item that we always need is
flour, organic flour.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.310
Whole Foods recently had this on sale for
$1.98 and there was a $1.00 printable coupon

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.280
available a while back also Grocery Coupon
Network and it made for a really great deal,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.020
only $0.98 a bag but occasionally like last
year Whole Foods had a coupon you could stack

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.780
with it making it free.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.940
It was $1.00 off Whole Foods coupon and a
$1.00 off printable coupon so free organic

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.180
flour.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.490
This is a product we also like in my house.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.260
We eat it as snacks, we eat it on yogurt.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.950
It's a new, newish product, Natures Path Organic
Love Crunch Granola and it's kind of a pricy

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.950
product.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.090
Normally about $5.00 for the bag but this
week at Whole Foods it was on sale for $3.50

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.080
plus there were two coupons you could stack
making it $1.75 per bag which is a great deal

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.430
for this level and quality of organic granola.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.510
But you can save on organic foods.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.840
It's a little bit harder and you have to work
a little bit more for it but you can find

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.669
some really great organic deals by using coupons.

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:46.069
So follow Grocery Coupon Network for all of
our match-ups and coupon tips and to help

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.269
