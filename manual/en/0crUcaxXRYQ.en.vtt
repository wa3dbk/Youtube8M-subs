00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.500
CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : We don't have any forecast data but over the last three METARs the trend is quite stable and the weather seems to be ok.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.500
EMMANUEL LAMPTEY : And uh.. we don't have any NOTAMs that are affecting our, our flights....

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.500
EMMANUEL LAMPTEY : For diversion, we are using Accra as our alternate in case of any problem.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.500
CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : Ok, and what are we using for diversion when coming back to Accra?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.500
EMMANUEL LAMPTEY : For fuel, three point three tons are already in tanks. You need to tell him the actual amount of fuel you require to relay out there before you move.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.500
CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : Ok perfect, and we have to get the load sheet also.

CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : Oh ok.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.500
CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : Alright, so lets hope we can do that. I understand that the aircraft, there are no technical remarks at all and it's all been taken care of.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.500
CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : The flight time should be about half an hour I estimate, lets have a look here, 24 minutes and 21 minutes, so say 25 minutes at most.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.500
The weather is good and the temperature up there at the moment is 26 degrees and probably going to be 27 before we get up there as there is some high pressure.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.500

SENIOR FO KEN BRUCE-TAGOE : Runway two-zero.
CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : Runway two-zero. Ok, that means we'll go there and have to fly around and then land.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.500
CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : When we get back here, lets make sure we get the toilet service and cleaning done on the aircraft for the next sectors.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.500
CAPT. TOMMY FJELD : Yes, the cruise altitude will probably be around.. well, it is filed for...
SENIOR FO KEN BRUCE-TAGOE : One five and one six...

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.500
