Welcome to health care at home

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.140
One of our viewer Meenakshi Patel she has email and written us

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.151
That how to cure Acid Relux on that she was asking us to do an episode

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.620
Ms. Meenakshi we have to take some precautions to save our self from acid reflux.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.800
In acid reflux the food we eat

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.705
And to digest that food our liver release some juices which are quite acidic

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:38.716
and when those juices comes to our this portion or sometime to our throat as well

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.120
then it problems a lot like heart burning too

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.580
Some people do have complaint that their throat start burning in acid reflux.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.400
So what to do to cure our self for this

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.187
Drink as much as water you can drink you that the acids can be neutralized.

00:00:57.187 --> 00:01:00.460
So drink at least 2-1/2 to 3 liter of water in a day.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.536
And if drink at least 2-1/2 to 3 liter of water in a day then chances of acid reflux are very low

00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:10.152
Along with this take care of one thing, take small bites of your food

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.510
take small bites  and chew them thoroughly

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.220
when you chew  the food it produces saliva

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.780
as much as saliva will get into your body with your food

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.163
chances of acid reflux will be low down accordingly

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.600
Along with this don't eat spicy, deep fried food. In case you eat such food

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.020
then chances are there to get caught by acid reflux.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.659
So, try to eat less in quantity if you want to have such food or have rarely.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.440
People have started eating fast food in normally life and diet.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.949
then they have high chances to have acid reflux.

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:52.169
One more thing to be taken care of if you consume alcohol then don't do smoking along with alcohol.

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:55.822
Otherwise its definite that you will have this problem.

And if you are smoker then don't consume alcohol while smoking.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.920
Whenever smoking &amp; alcohol is in combination then acid reflux can happen.

00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:11.543
So, firstly you do one thing if you can't quit alcohol then do it in limit &amp; don't do smoking along with.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.940
And try to quit smoking as it only increases the problem of acid reflux.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:21.299
Second remedy is that you should elevate your bed for 6 inches.

00:02:21.738 --> 00:02:24.778
Elevation doesn't mean that you put pillows.

00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:28.798
you have to give 6inches packing at least below your bed.

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:33.743
with this your bed will be bit elevate and with this you will get some  relief in acid reflux.

00:02:33.743 --> 00:02:37.240
And take care of one more thing that your dinner.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.380
it should be 3 ours prior your nap. Means if you sleep around 12 pm then finish your dinner till 9 pm

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.862
and try to have extremely light dinner

00:02:45.862 --> 00:02:50.511
As much as it is possible try to have soup and salad in your dinner and if you will consume such items

00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:54.043
you can take heavy lunch but make sure to have very light dinner

00:02:54.043 --> 00:03:00.403
And secondly don't eat major food in one go instead take a handful amount of food in every 2 hours

00:03:00.403 --> 00:03:04.888
if you will eat so then also you will get relief in the problem of acid reflux.

00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:10.700
Along with this you can do one more thing you can Consume Aloe Vera juice.

00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:14.473
This will also give you so much of relief in acid reflux.

00:03:14.473 --> 00:03:18.825
If you have too much problem of acid reflux then you must consume 1/2 cup of gooseberry juice.

00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:23.620
Mix, 1/2 cup of gooseberry juice in the aloe vera juice &amp; if you will consume this

so, if you will 2 max ripe banana then you will get relief in acid reflux.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.200
similarly if you eat an apple before sleeping

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.640
so this also works like a natural antacid. so if you consume an apple before 2 hours of sleeping even then

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.440
you will get relief in acid reflux. If you eat 1/2 spoon of fennel seeds after your every meal

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.180

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.940
Along with this food which is high in acid like tomatoes, try not to consume such food
