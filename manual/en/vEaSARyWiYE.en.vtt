00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.040
Annnnd we're back

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.960
I'm Chris, this is Marcel and this is
Matt

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.920
and we're gonna show you what to do
after your board is fully dried for eight

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.920
hours in the bag

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.920
So I'm going to leave it to you boys, show them how it's done.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.110
 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.110
Gonna put our center line down with our RockitRuler

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.400
 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.420
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.680
And with those down

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.060
you can connects the dots

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.460
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.140
 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.530
 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.250
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.360
With that done

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.940
apply the shape

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.000
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.920
with this shape you can see I cut out little triangles or diamonds

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.640
This will let you

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.640
align your board with the center line on your mold.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.090
 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.879
With that done, let's trace.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.610
I'm tracing this by hand, but for edges that are straight

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.500
I really suggest using a ruler

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.930
You know that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.650
you've got one long straight edge, you might as well

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.200
get the best straight edge you can get.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.890
 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.510
 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.350
There you go

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.250
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.190
Voila!

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.330
So now I'll be placing my truck holes with the Rockitruler as well.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.599
There's two ways to do this, you can

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.680
figure out your wheel base from the
center and work from there

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.680
or do like I do and work from the tips

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.830
 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.920
you can align

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.500
the RockitRuler with these diamonds in
the middle, just like your template

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
and using either a pencil

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.650
or a punch, make yourself some truck holes

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.650
 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.550
The trucks are square with each
other

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.160
there we go.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.760
Now that you have the outline marked

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.580
you can cut out your shape. The more
precise you make this cut

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.690
the less work you will have to make your
board accurate to the original design

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.310
take your time cutting around the board
you can use a jigsaw

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.010
bandsaw scrollsaw even a router template

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.060
to accomplish this step. The use of
clamps

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.510
or a jawhorse can help to stabilize
material as you cut it

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.560
You're board is all cut out but you may
need to straighten up some lines for

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.320
accuracy

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.550
using an edge sander or handheld belt
sander

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.610
will help to shape the board quicker
than hand sanding

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.190
or scraping if you want to round the
edges of your board

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.930
you can do that by hand or with the
router. You can also drill holes

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.930
at this point before you start sanding
the board.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.390
This looks plenty smooth. Nice job Marcel

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.980
So now that the boards all sanded and ready for
finish

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.140
you may want to start thinking about
your artwork. Artwork can be put on

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.250
before finish

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.380
or after depending how you doing it. Once
you have your artwork on

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.780
or maybe you're gonna do a blank deck
you might want to think about actual

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.160
clear coat type finish

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.700
any outdoor stuff will do whether it's a
brush on varathane

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.400
or spray on urethane, as long as it's
rated for outdoors and you follow

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.310
instructions

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.539
you should be good

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.110
That's it for how to make a board using
the TAP bag. Make sure to follow,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.380
like, subscribe, all that good stuff and
stay tuned for more tutorials from

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.919
