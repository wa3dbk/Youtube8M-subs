00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.659
welcome to travel now, I'm karen Schaler

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:19.419
on this show we're taking you to Louisville the home of the kentucky derby and the home 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.890
to an inspiring culinary scene

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.210
we are here at one of the best restaurants in louisville ky 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.720
where they focus on farm fresh ingredience

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.929
so i'm gonna go inside and talk with one of the farmers who is also one of the owners

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.820
and i'm here with ivory chodkowski he is
as i said one of the farmers and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850
one of the owners here at harvest restaurant

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.060
first explain the whole farm to table 
concept you have here

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.690
what our focus is is seasonal foods uh... so we don't

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.139
make up a menu based on whatever food

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:50.190
producer

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.470
meat or any other distribution company
has its only what is available on farms

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.830
locally and the chef regularly works
with

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.080
um... those farmers and we figure it
out year-to-year season to season

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.520
what sort of thing do you want people to know when
they are deciding on a restaurant

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.720
you have so many here in louisville what's
unique about harvest

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.529
well i think we're

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:14.179
more seasonal and more local than any other place 
some thing's are

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:15.570
really off limits

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.030
uh... we don't have a dish that's a
seafood dish

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.940
uh... you know that ust happens to be on the
menu we've decided not to do that until

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.729
we can figure out how the source

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.090
local aqua-culture products

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.370
so uh... were not so pure that
we won't have chocolate or coffee or

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.930
whatever but they're there won't be any
main dishes whose principal ingredient is

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.240
something that is other than

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.430
from here so it's really a
celebration of things that we have 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.490
locally so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.140
uh... i think some people go astray when they go somewhere else to buy 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.990
their things end up with something
that's 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.930
not as good it's an authentic experiencing coming here if 
you really want farm fresh food

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.260
it's super autthentic

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.909
and i think uh...

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.830
as well as serving a really
great and delicious plate as striving to be the 
best restaurant in louisville

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.760
and raise the visibility 
of the local food movement we'd be

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.490
really really happy
