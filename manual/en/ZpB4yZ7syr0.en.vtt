00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.170
NEW YORK MAGAZINE HAS
CREATED A COVER STORY ABOUT

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.290
BILL COSBY AND HIS ACCUSERS.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.050
OF COURSE, IT’S A COVER STORY AND
THE COVER OF THE

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.639
STORY, AND IT IS A VERY
INTERESTING WAY OF VISUALIZING

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.240
THE WHOLE CONTROVERSY
INVOLVING BILL COSBY.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.110
IT FEATURES THIRTY-FIVE WOMEN
WHO HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.370
EITHER SEXUAL ASSAULT OR RAPE,
AND ALSO THERE ARE SOME

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.470
EMPTY CHAIRS THAT YOU CAN SEE ON
THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE COVER.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.470
LET'S PUT THAT UP AGAIN.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.081
THEY ARE NOT VERY CLEAR ABOUT
WHAT THE EMPTY CHAIR

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:34.610
NECESSARILY SYMBOLIZES, HOWEVER,
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THE

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.870
COVER ARE USING THE HASHTAG
#THEEMPTYCHAIR

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.910
TO ENCOURAGE ANY

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.740
OTHER VICTIMS THAT HAVEN'T COME
FORWARD YET TO COME FORWARD.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.579
THAT'S THIRTY-FIVE OUT OF THE
FORTY-SIX WOMEN WHO HAVE

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.020
COME FORWARD ALREADY ON BILL
COSBY WHO, OF COURSE, YOU

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.610
KNOW NOW, ADMITTED DURING COURT
PROCEEDINGS THAT HE DID USE

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.340
QUAALUDES TO TRY TO
SLEEP WITH WOMEN.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.649
HE SEEMED TO THINK THAT IT
WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.049
HE SAID IT WAS LIKE HOW HE
NORMALLY SEDUCED WOMEN, BY

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.530
MAKING THEM COMPLETELY POWERLESS
TO FIGHT BACK WHEN I GET ON

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.530
TOP OF THEM.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.812
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE, BUT I THINK
THAT HE, EVERYONE HAS GOT

00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:15.580
TO LIVE WITH THEMSELVES, SO HE
PROBABLY DID BELIEVE IT –

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.952
I THINK HE TRIED TO
RATIONALIZE IT TO MAKE THEM

00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:20.130
FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIMSELF.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.710
I THINK HE COMES FROM A
DIFFERENT TIME.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.090
I READ THE COVER STORY WHICH WAS
INSANELY LONG, BUT IT TALKS

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.610
ABOUT HOW MUCH SOCIETY HAS
CHANGED IN THE PERCEPTION

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.070
OF RAPE.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.920
RAPE USED TO BE THOUGHT OF
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS AS

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.130
YOU ARE WALKING DOWN THE STREET
AND A STRANGER JUMPS OUT

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.720
AND FORCES YOU TO
HAVE SEX WITH THEM.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.260
IN REALITY, RAPE ISN'T
REALLY LIKE THAT.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.659
IN THEIR COSBY'S PERCEPTION, AND
THIS IS BASED ON THE DEPOSITION,

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.409
HE GOT THE USING QUAALUDES WITH
NO DIFFERENT THAN USING ALCOHOL

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.450
IN ORDER TO SEDUCE SOMEONE IF
YOU HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.150
WHICH IS SO CRAZY, OF COURSE
HE'S WRONG ABOUT THAT.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.690
ALCOHOL MAY GET PEOPLE INTO
THE MOOD, AND A NATIVE OR

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.110
WILLING TO CONSENT.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.030
QUAALUDES, YOU HAVE NO ABILITY
TO CONSENT AND YOU CANNOT MOVE.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.140
AND AS RIGHT ABOUT THE CONTEXT.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.840
IT IS NOT TO EXCUSE BILL COSBY
AT ALL, AND HE DID THIS FOR

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.030
DECADES UPON DECADES, IT IS TO
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW FAR

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.030
WE HAVE COME.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.750
THE SENSE IS POSITIVE THAT WE
RECOGNIZE THE ERRORS OF THE

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.610
WAYS OF OUR PAST, AND WE ARE IN
A MUCH BETTER SITUATION

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.760
WHERE WE SAY, HELLO, OF COURSE
HAVING AN ACQUAINTANCE COME

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.349
UP TO YOUR ROOM, FOR EXAMPLE,
DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.129
ALLOWED TO RIP THEIR CLOTHES OFF
AND MAKE THEM IMMOBILE, AND

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.970
FORCE YOURSELF UPON THEM, RIGHT?

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.561
IF YOU GO AS FAR BACK TO THE
BIBLE AND SAY THAT IF A

00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:58.160
WOMAN IS NOT YELLING LOUDLY
ENOUGH DURING SEX, WHEN SHE

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.750
IS BEING RAPED, OUTSIDE OF TOWN,
THAT SHE'S GUILTY.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.860
SHE'S GUILTY.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.860
RIGHT?

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.400
SO, THIS IDEA THAT A WOMAN, IF
SHE IS WITH A MAN, ALONE,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.580
THAT SHE CONSENTED ALREADY,
WHICH IS CRAZY, BUT THEY

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.760
USED TO SAY THAT.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.099
IN BILL COSBY'S PERCEPTION, A
WOMAN COMING TO HIS HOTEL

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.069
ROOM WAS CONSENT.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.090
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT HE WAS
ABLE TO SAY THESE THINGS IN

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.650
A DEPOSITION AND HE FACED NO
PROSECUTION WHATSOEVER.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.590
IT IS CORRECT THAT HE HAS
NEVER FACED ANY TYPE OF

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.160
PROSECUTION, HE HAS NEVER
BEEN CONVICTED OF RAPE.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.610
BUT THE FACT THAT HE ADMITTED TO
OBTAINING THESE DRUGS WITH

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.450
THE INTENTION OF DRUGGING YOUNG
WOMEN AND HAVING SEX WITH

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.580
THEM, PROVES THAT HE HAS
DONE SOMETHING WRONG.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.430
I THINK OF THE COVER STORY,
AND THE COVER ITSELF, IS

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.930
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.731
SO, FIRST OFF, YOU LOOK AT ALL
THOSE WOMEN, AND THOSE ARE

00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:05.099
THE WHOOPI GOLDBERG’S
OF THE WORLD.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.290
YOU THINK THAT, THROUGHOUT ALL
THOSE DIFFERENT DECADES,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.799
THAT THEY ALL HAD AN INCREDIBLY
SIMILAR STORY, ONE THAT

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.930
COSBY ADMITS IN A DEPOSITION IS
WHAT HE USED TO DO IN TERMS

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.560
OF THE QUAALUDES, AND MAKING
SURE

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.569
THAT THEY COULD NOT MOVE
AND RESIST THEM –

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.020
ALL OF THOSE WOMEN ARE
MAKING IT UP?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.900
COME ON.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.979
THE EMPTY CHAIR, IT'S BRILLIANT.

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.449
SOME PEOPLE TOOK IT AS
REPRESENTING ALL THE OTHER WOMEN

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.520
WHO MIGHT HAVE COME FORWARD, OR
COULD COME FORWARD LATER.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.729
I TOOK IT AS, YOU'LL BE THE NEXT
PERSON IF YOU DON'T PUT A

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.080
STOP TO IT.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.969
IT IS JUST A SMART WAY TO
GET A MESSAGE ACROSS.

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.569
I LOVE WHAT THEY DID.

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.780
I THINK IT IS ONE THING TO TALK
ABOUT THE FORTY-SIX WOMEN

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.349
WHO HAVE COME FORWARD, IT IS
ANOTHER THING TO VISUALIZE.

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.139
VISUALIZING IT HOPEFULLY
CHANGES SOME PEOPLE'S MINDS,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.439
BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO
DEFEND HIM BECAUSE OF THE

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.460
IMAGE THAT HE HAD FOR SUCH A
LONG TIME, BUT HONESTLY,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.169
FOR ME, THE SECOND THAT I READ
THAT HE ADMITTED TO BUYING

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.680
THOSE DRUGS WITH THE INTENTION
OF DRUGGING YOUNG WOMEN AND

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.509
HAVING SEX WITH THEM, THAT'S IT,
HE'S GUILTY IN MY EYES.

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.279
VERY POWERFUL COVER, NICE
JOB.
