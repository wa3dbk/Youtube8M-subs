Hi, I'm Ann Myrick, and today I'm going to
show you how to pick out art for the dining

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:13.950
room. This is a very small dining room so
there are really two walls that you can work

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.029
with, and I really do not like over kill art
work. If you're going to have a wall that

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.619
has something big on it, I also like what
I call a breathing wall where you might have

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.019
a wall where there's pictures and another
wall where there's pictures, and then all

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.441
of a sudden you have a wall that kind of you
can breathe and you don't have to, you know,

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:43.210
there's not another picture there. So, in
this situation, I--this is a piece, it's a

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.400
very special piece, an inherited piece, and
I really wanted it to be the focal point and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.059
really the only thing, and again this is a
small dining room. I will say that a lot times,

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.929
I think people tend to put too many things
in a dining room. They will, you know, if

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.530
they have a dining room set, sometimes there
will be three and four pieces. So, there's

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.890
all these pieces in this very small room.
So, a lot of times, be careful about putting

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.360
too much in your dining room. Having a large
picture like this really gives you a focus.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.060
So, I left this wall blank. You could put
an architectural piece or something that doesn't

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.259
really fight with this piece on the wall or
you can leave it. But in your dining room,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.659
you really can do whatever you want to do.
You can, if your dining room is, I really

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.430
like the blend of informal, formal or old,
new. So, if you have a dining room and it's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.130
very formal, putting architectural pieces,
putting rustic pieces, creating interest kind

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:59.759
of energizes the eye. If you have a lot of
the same type of grouping, to do something

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.439
really different in a real bright color, will
kind of add energy. So, have fun with your

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.660
pictures, have fun with your artwork. There's
really not a lot of rules, just try to get

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.830
creative and do things that are different
and just, you know, put two mirrors together

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.030
and see if you like it. Put two pieces of
a shutter together and see what you think,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.300
but just have fun and play with it. This is
Ann Myrick and that's how you pick out artwork

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.080
for a dining room.
