Hi! I”m Ed Dowling from eddowling.com. I'm
here to talk about slide guitar techniques.

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:14.499
Basically, how do we play the slide guitar,
on behalf of expertvillage.com. I've tuned

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:23.109
this is open A, true open A, and we're going
to talk about basically how do you play the

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.900
slide guitar. The strings have to flat. This
thing is flat; there's no arch like on a fret

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.940
board. Down here they're flat, so when you
put this thing down, the strings vibrate against

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.400
it just like a fret. If you've pushed it on
fret, the fret's upside down. This is a fret.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.510
Notice that I'm just touching it. I'm not
shoving it down. Just let the thing right

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:57.370
on top until you get a clear tone. Now, this
is open A. This is the chord A. In a normal

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.549
blues in the key of A, I'm going to be playing
A, D, and E. This if this is an A note and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:14.679
I go A, B, C , D. This is a D note. This is
a E note. This is the A chord. This is the

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:21.340
D chord. This is the E chord. Just for grins,
this is an F, this is a G, and now we're back

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.909
to A. If you've learned A, B, C, D, E, F,
G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Now to play A, D and

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:49.979
E, I'm going to go like this.
A, D, E, D. Now, in open A at the 12th fret,

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.590
we've got another A. It's the octave. So whenever
you're playing in open tuning, you have the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:09.130
option when you're playing the route for the
open chord, you can play it open or the 12

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:18.230
fret. Let's play a progression that goes A
to G. Well Gs 2 frets lower than A, let's

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:36.020
go to D. Do it again. A, G, E, A. Basic slide
guitar.
