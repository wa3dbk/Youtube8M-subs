00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
hand wash laundry with a salad spinner

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.509
Hi it's AlaskaGranny  do you own a salad spinner

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.710
if you do it is the  simplest way ever

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.820
to wash a few things out  by hand

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.269
put the bowl in the sink

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.970
take the basket and put that in the bowl

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.390
turn on water whatever temperature you want

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.539
put in a little squirt of soap

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.010
use regular detergent

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.010
use up samples or use shampoo

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.510
it's just body oils and soil that you are removing

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.760
if something is super dirty you don't want to do this

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.339
take your garments i have 2 shirts I am going to wash and they fit in here nicely

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.339
squish them around a little bit

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.239
and let them soak

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.390
my garments are done now look how easy this is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.640
pull out the basket  dump out the water put the basket back in and fill it up

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.790
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.890
get it all filled up

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.340
squeeze them around a little bit

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.710
let them soak for a minute

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.770
then I always give  two  rinses

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.229
I'll take it up rinse it again

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.229
fill it up again by

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.149
i can see the water is clear all the
soap is out  I''m satisfied that my

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.070
clothes are clean

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.340
fresh and clean so I am going to dump out the water

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.360
now the fun part

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.069
put the lid on it your salad spinner

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.980
I'm gonna pull the cord

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.050
 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.780
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.140
push the button to stop it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.010
look how much water is coming out

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.700
put on the lid and spin it a couple of times

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.700
satisfied all the  water is out

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.260
I would do it down iin the sink

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.730
then it's a simple it isn't going to go flying off the counter

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.420
easy to dump it out

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.520
this is so simple

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.780
you only have to do it a couple of times

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.970
until you are satisfied that the water is out

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.750
your garments are  ready to be hung up

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.310
how simple is that

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.140
and then you hang  them to finish
drying and they are all fresh and clean

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.980
