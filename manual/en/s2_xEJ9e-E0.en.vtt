00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.280
Hi, my name is Stephanie Manley, and I'm with
CopyKat Recipes, so let's get

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.280
cooking.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.510
Chipotle's Mexican Grill Cilantro-Lime Basmati
rice, we're going

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.630
to start cooking our basmati rice here in
a pot.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.140
I'm just going to add a
little bit of vegetable oil here.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.990
I'm using olive oil just because I think it's
a little healthier.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.350
You can
use butter.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.820
You could use canola oil, or any other vegetable
oil you have

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.000
laying around.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.660
I have the heat on medium-high heat and next
I'm going to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.530
add the basmati rice.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.890
We just want to cook this up until it gets
a nice, pretty sheen on it.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.020
While this is heating, I'm going to add the
juice of one lime to this.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.950
There's the other half of my lime.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.780
I just used a regular plain old pot.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.360
For cooking rice, you may want to use a nonstick,
like I have here.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.610
This is
a special type of nonstick.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.150
It's called a green pot, but you can use any
pot.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.729
Now that all my rice is coated with oil and
has a nice sheen on it,

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:35.569
I'm going to go ahead and add my water, so
now I'm going to put the lid on

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.200
it, and let it simmer.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.369
We're going to come back when the rice is
done and we're going to finish it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.450
up with cilantro, a little bit of salt, and
a touch of lime, so rice is now

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.450
done.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.929
I just put it in this pot right here.

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.890
I'm going to fluff it up a
little bit, and now I'm going to add the cilantro.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.140
It says two teaspoons in the recipe, but you
know what?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.560
I love cilantro,
so I'm going to add a little extra.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.060
I'm just going to stir that together.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.230
It smells so good.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.271
I'm going to add a little extra squeeze of
lime and now

00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.271
we're going to add our salt.

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:12.930
We sprinkle our salt in, give this a quick
stir.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.659
You know this makes a
wonderful side dish for so many things.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.150
You can make your own build-your-
own burritos at home.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.930
So we've just made Chipotle's Mexican Grill
Cilantro-

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.939
