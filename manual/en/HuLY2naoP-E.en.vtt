Welcome everybody, my name is Lars Erick Robinson,
I'm a illustrator. My company is LarsEr Arts,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.720
"All around Art-tainment", is my slogan. Today
we're going to talk about, how Pablo Picasso,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.510
how he had different kind of styles, and the
different styles that Pablo Picasso painted.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.150
And what's interesting with him, is, in different
periods of his life, he actually- his style

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.250
changes with it. So he went from his early
works period is what it's called, by actually

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.079
doing more realistic work, which is a self
portrait of Pablo Picasso, to more of a blue

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.450
period, where he had one of his suicide of
one of his best friends past away, and that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.960
actually showed up in his work where he felt
suicidal and a lot of his work became blue

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.070
and dark, so that's one way that he developed.
And that's a very brave thing back then, because,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.420
maybe he wasn't able to get much commissions,
but after taking all those risk he was able

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.940
to become more popular just because of that.
Then he had his rose period, where in his

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.369
rose period he got a little lighter he starts
showing more of what a phase of what he's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.069
going to do later in his life, but it's still
more of unrealistic stage. He's developing

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:22.649
now as an artist, and he's understanding that
in his cubism style he was inspired by Suzon

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.960
flatten spaces that he use to do in his landscapes,
he worked along with Georges Broche is another

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.060
painter, where he developed cubism. And cubism
is basically taking angles of one shape and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.869
understanding that there's another form right
beside it, that you can actually look at it,

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:48.270
and twist it at the same time and understand
that it's a geo-symmetric like that. And then

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.119
he went into his later period, which is considered
to be his lazier period, but it's actually

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.341
very famous, he's getting more in depth, and
it gets more fine art, and this is actually

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:06.850
a more big jump into more modern art, it's
a synthetic cubism later in his life. So it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.319
shows you different steps of what he went
through, and through his life showed those

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.930
changes, through his styles. Thank you for
joining me, and hope you enjoyed that.
