Hello!

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.000
I've got the coolest, newest thing to share
with you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.059
It's a way of sharing your iPad screen on
any computer.

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.589
Interested?

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.650
Keep watching.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.930
Hi there! Gideon Shalwick here.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.300
In today's video, I'm going to share with
you something that I've been looking forward

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.300
for quite a while.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.830
And that is how to share the screen of your
iPad on any computer screen of your choice.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.790
That has a number of really, really cool applications;
if you're wondering what the heck am I talking

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.370
about, why would you want to do that.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.950
Well first off, when you're doing educational
type of videos, this one for example, you

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.890
want to be able to switch between what you're
doing on your iPad screen and whatever else,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.250
whatever you're recording.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.640
That's very useful for people like me who
are recording videos like this.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.350
It's also useful if you just want to use it
like a Bamboo writing tablet.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.580
You can use this like a writing tablet for
your computer.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.129
Not quite, but you'll see what I mean soon.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.129
This is really really great.

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:08.439
Now, I've got a couple of sources to credit
for this.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.420
The first one is Mashable; on one of their
videos, they talked about this little sort

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.420
of thing.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.840
The Bamboo Stylus that you can use for drawing
on your iPad.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.000
I know it's been around for ages, but I've
just got one myself.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's really really cool.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.799
It has taken my iPad to a whole new level.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.710
And the other person I want to credit is Ed
Dale for showing the application that you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.180
need to use for sharing your iPad screen with
any other computer screen of your choice.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.180
How does this work?

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.100
Let's have a look.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.039
The basic setup is if you just want to share
the screen of your iPad on a computer screen.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.360
So I've got another computer here.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.759
In fact, there's another computer sitting
right there.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.700
I can see the same screen that I have on my
iPad on my screen over there that I'm recording,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700
by the way.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.229
But if you just want to have a really simple
setup, this is what is going to look like.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.380
You are going to have your iPad over hereÃ‰
Actually, let's get to see how this works

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.380
in real life.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.939
I'm going to use a red pen here.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.991
So I'm going to circle this.

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:05.490
This is your iPad, of course.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.999
Just so that you can see.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.709
You're running a special app on here.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.310
Basically that sends the screen images to
your computer screen over here, which is very

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.110
very cool.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.319
This all happens in real time, It's pretty
much instant.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.819
You can go full screen on your computer to
make it look pretty good.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.670
There are some issues with the aspect ratio
because the aspect ratio of your iPad is probably

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.200
not going to be the same as the screen aspect
ratio of your computer screen.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.209
The other thing that I also use and recommend
is recording with Screenflow and Camtasia.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.690
The app that you need for this is actually
not something that you install on your iPad.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.260
It's something that you need to install on
the computer where you want to share the screen

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.569
of your computer.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.650
The app that you need for that is called Reflection.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.590
I think it's called Reflection, or something
like that.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.849
I'll link to it below this video.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.670
So you just click on it and go and get it.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.950
I think it's something like 5 or 10 bucks.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.969
How ever much it is, it's totally worth it
because it allows you to share your screen

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.130
like this which is very very useful.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.609
Say, you want to do what I'm doing in this
video, for example.

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.010
You want to flick between what you have on
your iPad screen and what you're recording

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.010
on your camera.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.409
For that you'll need a setup like this -- an
Advanced Setup.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:34.840
That's me, sitting at the desk with my little
iPad over there.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.840
Of course, that is now sending the signals
out to my computer where it's getting recorded,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.610
the screen is getting recorded there with
either Screenflow or Camtasia, if you're on

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.610
PC.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.280
Of course, here's my camera, recording me.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.269
What happens is this is not a real time thing
where I switch between the screen on my iPad

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.609
and the screen of my computer, or the screen
that you're seeing through the camera.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:05.480
I do this afterwards in Screenflow, then I
just flick between whatever gets recorded

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.989
and what gets recorded on my computer screen
right now.

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.959
Well it will be, later on when you watch it.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.400
Let's not going to get into that rabbit hole.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.070
In any case, that is the sort of setup that
you need to be able to do that.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.420
I'm sure you can think of a ton of other really
cool applications for this.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.310
I have just found this really really good
for educational purposes and for illustration

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.310
purposes.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.140
As you can see, I can be very visual here
with my communication and it's super quick

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.170
for me to prepare now.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.720
I don't even need to think about creating
Keynote slides presentations and stuff.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.890
I can just flick between what I have drawn
on my iPad and what I'm recording on the camera.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.970
Tell me, how would you like to use this?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.320
Do you have sort of other applications in
mind?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.650
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.620

video.
