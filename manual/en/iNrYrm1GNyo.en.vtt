00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.630
hello musicians My name is Andrew Mercer and today
we're going to a very short tutorial on

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.540
how to do

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.690
the matching for mashups

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.690
remixes mixtapes

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.759
doing beat matching in our destiny is
actually quite simple the technology

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.460
used to do it as not that complicated at
all

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.859
you need usually years

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.239
kickbacks to check with this a deluge
years net this question of how to do

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.350
matching came from one of our
subscribers

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.260
been at play thank you bennett play for
this uh... this question

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.590
he wanted to know how you can do beat
matching for things like mixtapes and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.270
national mashups

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.430
so here we go

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.370
i actually have two songs in here that
it created in grad stand for this

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.190
purpose and uh... i'm gonna try to match
up both of these songs so uh... i want

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.469
to match them up in the context of
trying to do it for mixed t

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.299
okay so you want one song

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.260
take ends

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.860
and gradually with the beats matching up
and go into the next song okay so here

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.590
is that what the first song sounds lack

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.910
and hears about the second time

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.670
so they have a fairly close to implement
a pretty close to each other

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.270
now justin demonstrate that many zooming
here with mine he needing a mouse

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.580
uh... now uh... you'll notice that we
have sounds like this is a snare drum

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.320
right here is hits a derek repulse nasa
snare drum here i'm pretty sure that's

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.960
when the air and that's when they're
let's have a listen to make sure on

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.330
heating solo on the track you see that

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.460
so i can hear that required self solo
means by itself

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.940
so let's see if this is a snare drum

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.970
yes it is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.200
all case let's see deceived this isn't
it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.730
yes that is a snare drum to

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.090
so now what i'm gonna do isn't going to
go to my time shift to appear in the two

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.500
men you see that time shift to

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.670
easy stuff

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.010
now i'm going to slide this guy over

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.990
so both of the snare drums lined up

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.869
now on r_t_c_ the temple na matching up
already

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.599
you see these are pretty close to impose
but you can see that this near-term

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.719
right here is already starting to be
able to call me after work half a per

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.670
half a measure

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.880
and look at gmail more as you go across
these dark pulses are the snare drum

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.369
beats a generally there on the beat

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:28.599
nancy reagan wire winder is a go across
that's because the temple is not the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.889
same

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.519
now when you do next a sort of thing you
don't have to have exactly the same

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.069
temple got too close but it does need to
be exact now what i'm going to do is

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.790
with this i want dist pop song

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.399
to dance in the region in somewhere
around here

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:47.389
or can we go back a summer rally here

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.049
and i want the all this on to begin
around that point

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.599
so the first thing to do is only to hear
what that by olympic ending the sound

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.209
like socal something like this

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.959
first okay so that's basically what i
what they mean to sound like

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.519
and then on to beginning in the next
time to start

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.229
and that's one sam's like this runs
second i can will run as fast now

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:14.159
but that beginning says it is

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.430
so you can see this piece right here
just polls right here

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.679
that's is uh... the downbeat

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:23.329
rate near

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.799
sia here it is again

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.759
you have raised here that's a downbeat
so i want that paltz

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.939
to line up with this pops rehear

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.179
so and intensity doteasy ears for the
stuffed means easy to get peace offer to

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.459
do it for you but you wanted to do this
yourself your musicians

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.529
okay so it's al i just did that i use my
time shift to a

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.099
to move over

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.109
peace there to so the pollsters lined up

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.959
and he's my yam

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.789
might be in the mid soon to to have a
look at that

00:03:53.789 --> 00:04:00.789
u_s_ mister move back a little bit and
try and sort of sounds like

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.219
today let's go back a little bit further
t x you know i mean the wrong place

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.679
menon place i was in this of course
equivalency i want to get rid of all

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:13.229
this i want all this to go

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.379
so i want um...

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.750
has gone back to it

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.790
here might get rid of them i delete key

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.629
and now i'm going to make sure to a back

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.139
atkins here use your gears a sticker say
dat je years like picked up on the

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.199
mistake i made

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.169
now let's zoom in again

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.900
here we go out as a man in a row

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.710
and now this is the polls that i want

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.839
and i want to line up a rated the run
back home so it's rate the air

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:43.749
resume their candidate is so clear to
admit now backing him

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.460
and again you got your eyeballs regime
yours

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.979
now let's move back and see if it stays
in time

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:55.620
check it out

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.620
now that's that's pretty cool if you ask
me let's go back to listen to you

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.129
they'll max pitches matched beats met
speeds

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.889
so they know that nothing to do it

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.470
that's pretty straight forward now if
you have any comments or concerns or

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.729
