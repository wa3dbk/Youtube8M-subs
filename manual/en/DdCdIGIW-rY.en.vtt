00:00:00.311 --> 00:00:02.894
(upbeat music)

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:15.334
- Clemson University and
BMW manufacturing have a

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:17.899
strong history of collaboration.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.454
Clemson has been one of our key

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:21.253
strategic partners since 2008.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:23.563
A partnership is multi
faceted, it includes

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.883
research and developing
projects, a pipeline

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:28.649
of automotive product,
testing services and other

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:30.891
community related activities.

00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:32.691
- Over the past two years,
we've brought together

00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:36.077
BMW's best engineers
with the top automotive

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.873
graduate engineers at CUI car.

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:42.443
The result of this is a
truly transformative car

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:44.881
and a great manufacturing model.

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:46.732
- Clemson University
Internationl Center for

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:49.941
Automotive Research and
BMW manufacturing teamed

00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:53.085
up to create a unique
vehicle for niche market.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:55.635
Together, we have
completed the full spectrum

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.976
of product development
from marketing analysis to

00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:01.556
engineering, to complete
vehicle manufacturing.

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.023
The result is a versatile
vehicle that transforms

00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:08.892
from a typical SUV to an
atypical cargo carrying vehicle

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:11.648
suited for a luxury vehicle owner.

00:01:11.648 --> 00:01:13.897
- Deep Orange 4 is not
only an innovative product,

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:16.147
the manufacturing concept
behind the vehicle

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:17.866
is highly considered as well.

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.615
The Clemson students
developed the cost efficient

00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:22.429
manufacturing plan which
details how this low volume

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.778
derivative could be
assembled without negatively

00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:28.722
impacting existing BMW
production processes.

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:31.119
The ability to integrate
more low volume models

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.228
without incurring capital
intensive refueling costs

00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:35.795
and efficiency loses
will be key to success

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.994
in the future as we strive
to be able to respond

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:42.144
to changes in the market
faster with more flexibility.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.924
Students working on this
phase of the project did

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:46.384
an excellent job keeping
costs down but finding

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:48.822
optimal integration opportunities.

00:01:48.822 --> 00:01:51.064
Longer term, the results of this project

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:53.095
could end up helping
clients within our BMW

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:55.418
production network in the future.

00:01:55.418 --> 00:01:57.413
For a global production network like BMW

00:01:57.413 --> 00:01:59.452
this is clearly a win-win.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.866
- BMW manufacturing is
proud to have sponsored

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:05.489
this years Deep Orange
prototype project with CUI car.

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.072
