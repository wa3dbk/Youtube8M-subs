Christina are you wearing your gaiters?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.600
Yeah

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.100
Keep walking, keep walking

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.100
Oh shit, stop doing that Sweety.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
There's my gaiter.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.000
You want to stay here?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.900
What if it jumps to your face man?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.500
Biting

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
What if it's going to your hands?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
Hello there, back out on the trail again.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.500
Hope you enjoyed our snake video.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500
It kind of went a bit viral on Monday night.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.500
Because a well known Australian TV website

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
has actually shared the video.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.500
I know a lot of people in America have been watching the snake video as well.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.500
Just wanted to clarify that the snake was not harmed in any way.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.500
It may seem as though the GoPro is bumping into the snake,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.500
but most of that sound you here is the camera scraping along the ground.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.500
Winter is coming in Australia, you'll see us in the snow for the next few months.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.500
But once summer comes we'll be back out on the bush trails like the one I'm on now.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Hopefully we'll find some big adult sized brown snakes for you to see.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Just an idea of what's coming!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
There's people out there who want to see what it looks like when a big brown snake opens it's fangs

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.000
and strikes at the camera.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.500
Thanks for watching the snake video,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.500
make sure you hit the subscribe button. 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.000
Because I've got a sneaky feeling that this GoPro camera has a date,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.500
with a number of deadly adult sized Australian snakes.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.060
Oh there's a Kookaburra up there!
