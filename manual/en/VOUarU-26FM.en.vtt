00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.290
Next we are going to talk about the Silhouette
frame for ladies. Silhouette is the rimless

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.579
drill mount that we talked about a little
bit earlier. It is mounted by push pins and

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:20.361
that is what you want to look for when you
are looking at getting a rimless style. That

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:24.620
is going to be that push pin mounting. No
screws. You don't want screws on the back

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.950
of your rimless glasses. They can get too
tight and crack your lenses. Silhouette has

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.469
been doing this for a long time and now everybody
is copying these guys when it comes to drill

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:46.239
mount glasses. The silhouette is basically
the I guess the beginning of this great trend

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.249
that is going throughout the industry of rimless
glasses. In my practice, we've just stuck

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:57.110
by these guys. These guys manufacture their
frames in Austria and never ever had a problem

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.210
with these glasses. They have been very durable
for a lot of good looks and fashion. The best

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.020
part of the Silhouette brand is that you can
mix and match. You can pick what lens shape

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.900
you like and then pick a different color of
temple. Say you want to have this shape and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.800
you want to have the gold. You can go down
and do the gold and so on and so forth as

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.940
you go through this line. Everything is mix
and match. You can pick different size temples

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.490
if they are too small and a lot of frame companies
don't have this type of I guess convenience

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.950
in choosing exactly what type of glasses you
are going to wind up getting. Sometimes you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.050
are limited in sizes. Not so with Silhouette.
Very finely crafted. They are little bit on

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.070
the higher end. A lot of people think that
oh it's just the lenses are drill mounted

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.350
and the frame can't be that expensive but
they are a titanium frame. They are imported

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.890
from Austria so there is some cost incurred
there by the patient but all in all if you

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.500
are looking for rimless glasses, I wouldn't
go beyond Silhouette. Silhouette offers you

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.700
the very best.
