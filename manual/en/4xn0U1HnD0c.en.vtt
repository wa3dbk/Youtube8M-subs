hi this is chihiro. today i tried a daily makeup and holiday makeup.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.482
let's start with daily makeup.

00:00:20.398 --> 00:00:29.755
use this CC cream as a primer coz i 
 prefer a skin-like finish with easy steps.

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:49.887
i blend it with my fingers. this cc cream has SPF 50 with PA 
 ++++ but it doesnt feel like harsh on my skin and pretty hydrating.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.767
its easy to blend. for under the eyes and around the nose, i put 
 2nd layer to hide the redness well. and the base is done.

00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:07.837
let's move onto the eye makeup. i take this nude in the box3 palette and use 
 the 2nd left color which is a mat color and darker than my skin tone.

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:19.450
i use this color on the outer corners to give a definition to 
 my eyes.  doing so at first makes it more natural.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.783
next, use this butterfly dream eyes 006 palette and take the 2nd 
 bottom shimmery color and put it all over the lid.

00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:35.696
you can put it over the darker brown color. this 
 shimmery color gives a light on your eyes.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:45.320
from the same palette, put the 2nd top ivory color on the 
 inner corner of the eyes and along the lower lashlines.

00:01:46.804 --> 00:01:54.570
fill the upper waterlines with gel eyeliner to make eyes sharper.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:02:04.880
as this is a daily makeup, i use 
 brown mascara both top and bottom lashes.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:15.120
for eyebrows, use the same mat brown color from the palette and 
 a brow brush and just try to fill the gaps.

00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:30.810
to achieve a natural flush on my cheeks, i use this cream blush 
 with a brush. i use #6 beige red in this video.

00:02:32.207 --> 00:02:39.210
firstly, put some blush cream on the highest point of the cheeks.

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:48.610
and then blend it outwards in oval. try not to 
 put the color over the iris lines. 

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.130
blend it towards hair lines. that makes it more natural.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.360
i like this product coz i can build up the color intensity by layering.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:10.060
use this lasting finish creamy lip for lips. this is 
 #4 which is a coral orange natural color.

00:03:11.203 --> 00:03:17.800
on top of the case, there is a small mirror 
 so its so handy when you are outside!

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:28.420
this hydrates my lips well like lip balm. its also pigmented.

00:03:29.593 --> 00:03:32.210
my daily makeup is done!

00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:36.540
now let's start a holiday makeup!

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:40.890
the base is the same as a daily makeup so 
 ill skip it and start with the eye makeup.

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:49.150
take the mat brown color from the nude in the 
 box3 palette and put it on the outer corners.

00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:57.700
this time, dont forget to put it along the lower lashline as well. 
i will use a 
 blue eyeshadow and i wanna make it casual so i use this mat brown first.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:05.840
take this mint color from butterfly dream eyes palette 8 all over the lids.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.150
put the same mint color along the lash line too.

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:16.520
use the middle color from the nude in the box palette 
 and put inner corner of the eyes as a highlight.

00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:27.640
i use a liquid eyeliner to make strong lines. when you use color 
 eyeshadows, they wash out the eyes so i use black eyeliner.

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:36.390
again, like eyeliner, i wanna make my eyes sharper, i 
 use a black mascara and apply it well.

00:04:37.904 --> 00:04:48.760
for eyebrows, take those 2 colors and draw a line on the bottom 
 of the brows and blend it upwards to make it natural.

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:56.450
for cheeks, i use the same cream blush but in red this time.

00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:01.490
blend it well.

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:07.540
for lips, i use a lasting finish creamy lip 6 Blood red.

00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:13.080
when you use strong colors both on eyes and lips, it can 
 be too much so dont forget to make it balanced.

00:05:14.184 --> 00:05:16.620
ok. the holiday makeup is done!

00:05:19.287 --> 00:05:23.290
thank you for watching till the end. ill 
 see you in the next video. bye.
