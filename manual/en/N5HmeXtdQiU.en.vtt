00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:28.329
I'm 
so excited to tell you about some new technology

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.410
in regards to hand controls and people with
disabilities having the ability to drive.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.650
For many years, I was unable to really drive
the way I like to drive, and the way I was

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.269
used to drive pre-injury, because I wanted
to have that shifting ability in my vehicle

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.190
and maintain both hands on the steering wheel.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.180
Well, the new Guido Simplex hand controls
give me all the above, and it's worked out

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.839
really well for me, because it allows me to
have both hands on the steering wheel as I

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.460
press this ring to accelerate.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.060
I started using the ring initially, and now
they have a new type called The Ghost, which

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.500
I absolutely love, because it's actually on
the back of the steering wheel, so you don't

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.590
have to use your thumbs.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130
Now what you do is you hold on to your steering
wheel.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.560
And most of you that are disabled know that
us holding on to our steering wheels is very

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.920
important to us.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.010
And now we're actually using our fingers to
control the acceleration of the vehicle.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.710
And not only can we use our fingers to control
the acceleration, we can actually use our

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.530
fingers to paddle shift and upshift and downshift
if you drive a sports car that has that feature.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.380
So one thing that's really exciting is the
fact that I can actually now downshift my

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.990
vehicle, while I have my hand on the brake.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.429
And again, for those sports car enthusiasts,
you know how important, how much fun it is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.920
to drive a car that allows you that feature.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.219
The only thing that I have to say about the
Guido hand controls that may prohibit some

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:59.249
people from moving forward and buying them
is the fact that they cost around $8,500 installed.

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.189
Now the question is, is it worth it?

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.390
Well, if you're somebody like me who drives
a sports car and wants that sensation and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.190
that ability to downshift, upshift, and kind
of drive a little bit on the wild side, then

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.670
this hand control is for you.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.120
Or actually, simply if you just want to have
the ability to put both hands on the steering

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.860
wheel and drive a normal car, this is a great
option.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:03:07.260
For $8,500 it's what you make of it.
