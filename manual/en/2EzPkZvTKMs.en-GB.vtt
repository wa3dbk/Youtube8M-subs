00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.000
Now these are a little bit controversial but
I promise you they will be well worth it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.940
Stick with me and we will be making maple
bacon buttermilk scones, totally delicious

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.880
and so worthwhile making.
To kick it off, plain flour going into the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.490
bowl, with our raising ingredients. So a bit
of baking powder, I've got some bicarbonate

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.740
of soda, so it's a teaspoon of bicarbonate
going in here. Should do nicely. And then

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.300
of course we have some butter, basically all
we're going to do is combine them. There are

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.239
a few ways you can do this. By all means go
in with your finger tips and get all this

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.550
pushed in together and get nice bread crumb
mixture. But I have this fantastic little

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.370
implement which does beautiful things for
pastry to make sure that you have a wonderful

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.289
cold butter throughout your mix. So get that
in there and just press the butter into the

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.219
flour.
Now I came across these beautiful little scones

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.809
on a trip to New York and I've been making
them ever since. They're a true winner with

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.329
my friends and family and I love making them
on a Saturday morning when there's nothing

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.090
else going on in the kitchen.
Okay, this is looking good. So once you've

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.520
got rough breadcrumbs you've got little rouge
lumps of butter in there. This is the time

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.680
we're going to add our wet ingredients. So
I'll loose that, now create a little bit of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.400
a well in the centre of this. And what we're
going to pour in here is some buttermilk and

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.869
of course a lot of maple syrup. We've got
a good amount of maple syrup going in here

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.710
and now controversial ingredient but totally
essential. We've got some salted bacon in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.710
here beautiful crisped up in a frying pan
and it adds a hit of saltiness in amongst

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.600
that sweetness of the maple syrup.
Using the fork now, just mix that together.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.979
Just bring in the dry ingredients into the
wet ones and once it's started to come together

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.920
like a rough dough at that point we're going
to turn it out onto a floured surface and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.100
just roll it out into scones.
Just make sure it's completely floured all

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.960
the way over and underneath. Grab your rolling
pin and just give it a nice, light roll. You're

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.790
looking to go probably about an inch in thickness.
Use a cutter and just cut out little shapes.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.730
Now if you find it sticks like that what you
can do is just dip it straight into the flour

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:37.420
so that it comes out nice and easily.
Sprinkle a baking sheet with just a little

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.590
but of flour to just make sure they don't
stick. They probably won't, but it's worth

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:51.060
while anyway. And the transfer all these little
babies over.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.290
Okay, these rest for about 10 minutes in the
fridge and then they're ready for the oven.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.330
And now all I need to do is egg these little
babies up. And it's important that you just

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.760
do the top because if you do the sides it
won't rise as beautifully as they should.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.150
Now just season with a good sprinkle of sea
salt on the top . Sounds very strange but

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.450
it's that hit of sea salt, but of crunch on
the top against that sweet maple syrup in

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.380
there.
So 180 degrees Celcius, 350 degrees Farenheit

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.960
for about 25 minutes and you'll get something
beautiful.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.770
The combination of the salty bacon and the
sweet scones works perfectly and the texture

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.480
is incredible. You've got to try this out
guys and let us know how you get on!
