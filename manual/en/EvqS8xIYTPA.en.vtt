00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:06.749
&gt;&gt; Ready and...

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:14.860
&gt;&gt; It's about making music of course and providing
fabulous entertainment for friends and family

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.860
who come to see us

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.140
&gt;&gt; There are no slackers in the group.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.359
Everybody is committed.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.500
They are wholly invested.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500
They work whole heartedly.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.060
They are a very collegial group of guys.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.589
&gt;&gt; Contrary to popular belief there's not
a lot of divas in the VMC because if you are

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.590
diva you aren't going to join a chorus of
a 100 people.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.670
&gt;&gt; Listen to the chord changes please

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.510
&gt;&gt; I love the rehearsal process for me that's
what really keeps me going through the week.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.019
Something completely different than anything
else I do and it's fantastic to be with this

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.019
group of people.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.519
&gt;&gt; We've spent months and months and months
rehearsing.

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.820
Rehearsing this choreography, rehearsing the
words, learning the words and when it comes

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.449
to the showtime.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.789
The true love of what we do comes out.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.420
&gt;&gt; It's the longevity of the men's chorus
which makes it really outstanding.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.740
We are a relatively young community in Vancouver
but the VMC been around since 1981.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.530
&gt;&gt; When you start this kind of work you don't
necessarily know that you are going to do

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.230
it for a long period of time.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.790
You start on a season by season basis.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.520
Eventually I realized that it was really a
central part of my career in terms of conducting

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.430
and my work in the gay community and stuff
like that.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.000
&gt;&gt; I think it's also a great was to build
community.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.060
We are able to disseminate information among
us we are able to do things as a group that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.000
other people can't necessarily can't do as
an individual and have a real positive impact.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.920
&gt;&gt; It's also a real fraternity a real community
of guys that we just have a lot of fun together

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.990
in our rehearsal and there is a real bonding.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.291
&gt;&gt; I joined the singing but I stay for the
brotherhood.

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:50.660
Singing is just what we do that's what we
do best.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.159
But there is so much more going on behind
the scenes and it's hard to explain.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.159
&gt;&gt; The economy flight from London was filled
with friendlier chattier people.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:06.080
And the skytrain ride is something I'll never
forget.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.149
&gt;&gt; The title at this performance is Queens.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.340
It was actually just the theme of the show
was going to be about queens because of course

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.500
this is the 60th anniversary year of Elizabeth
II's reign.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.500
I think this show has more non-stop entertainment
than most of our others.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.370
&gt;&gt; A lot of movement a lot of dancing we have
two new members of the chorus who have done

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.760
some amazing choreography for us.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.989
We move as a group but we also move as individual
dancers so there is small ensembles that dance

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.209
but then the entire group also dances as well.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.430
It's spectacular.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.900
It's a sense of accomplishment when you hear
the audience applaud and that's who we do

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.900
it for

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.939
&gt;&gt; Certainly glee has had something to do
with that I think people are suddenly seeing

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.170
the cool in choral singing again.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.810
So it's always entertaining when you see 90
fully-grown gay men get their glee on.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.810
So that's very entertaining.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.810
