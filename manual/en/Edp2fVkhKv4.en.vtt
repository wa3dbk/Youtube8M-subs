In this next clip, I'm going to show you how
to white wash over the existing stained furniture.

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:10.410
Ok, we're back. I'm just want to show you,
I'm going to use an enamel, you could use

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.599
a pickling stain but it's not as thick and
I've done some test coats here and I like

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.980
this look, this rustic look of it coming through
very antique rustic look. Very thick white,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.239
that's chipping off an old armoire, that happens
to be painted over. That's the look I'm going

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:35.640
for. I like the enamel effect better and what
I use it just a half a cup of enamel, half

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.940
and half ratios so whatever you pour in, go
half enamel, half water. You're going to have

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.590
to mix it up because water and the enamel,
they don't seem to mix that great, so you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.970
have to just sit here and get air and once
you get it mixed up, you won't see anymore

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:56.109
water. Once you do that, you know you're ready
to go. Here's how I do this. This is a one

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.970
sweep motion. I'm just going to take my rag
and I'm going to put an excessive amount,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.560
not that much but enough, an excessive amount
meaning, right across the top. What I like

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.350
to do, now, because you have all these nicks,
you're going to see how great this looks.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.970
When applying, we're just going to get an
excessive amount on our, not, like I say,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.860
when I say excessive, I just mean right across
the top here, that's going to be our guideline.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.159
Going with the grain of the furniture, one
swiping motion, you're just going to go down.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.380
You're going to grab here, from the top, and
keep trying to pull it down. See it's great

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.270
though, all those little nicks now become
more apparent and that's the look I'm going

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.420
to go for, and we're going to get it right
there. We're going to do it a little bit more

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.950
and come straight down, see that? I like it
thick like that, see that thickness. I go

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.180
nice and light now, after I get my first swipe,
I'm just going to leave it like that. That's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:57.850
how I want it to dry. I'm going to come down
here and just keep going down the thing, I'm

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.600
going to pull it and pull it up from the top.
Always want to go with the same thing, once

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.700
you get the amount that you want, you can
just move on and just leave it like that,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.401
to dry. We'll come back and we'll touch stuff
up. You don't want to go too thick and you

00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:20.980
just want to go with a nice light sweep, over
the wood, like so. Remember, when doing this,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.920
you want to go with nice soft, softly rubbing
over this, especially after you get that first

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.982
coat. Don't worry if it doesn't look perfect
yet, there's some more steps that are really

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:34.530
going to make this look old but you could
see, it's starting to come along, you see

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.420
our little nicks. We're actually going to
beat it up, later on, but do all of your hutch,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.720
do your shelves, do your doors, let everything
dry, we'll come back, after that, and we'll

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.350
show you what's next. It is a weekend project
folks, so plan ahead.
