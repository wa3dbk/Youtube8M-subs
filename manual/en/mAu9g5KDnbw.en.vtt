00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.796
My name is Shiho Nishio. I'm in charge of
small animals here at the Fukuyama Zoo.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:39.170
Wallabies are found throughout Australia.

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:43.396
Many people mistake them for young kangaroos,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.791
but they're actually an entirely different type of animal.

00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:53.900
As of now, there aren't many clear distinctions,
so they're classified according to size,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.895
with kangaroos being large, wallabies being small,
and wallaroos being somewhere in-between.

00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:13.021
Just like kangaroos, the main characteristic
of wallabies is their pouch.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.213
The way they raise their young inside these
pouches is one of their defining features.

00:01:18.555 --> 00:01:23.988
We can't see the young being born, so we take the day
their head sticks out of the pouch as the date of birth.

00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:28.943
So unlike other mammals, where we use the day
they emerge from the womb as the date of birth,

00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:35.500
with wallabies we use the day they emerge
from the pouch as their birthday, instead.

00:01:35.918 --> 00:01:38.781
We can see them move inside the pouch
before they pop out.

00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:44.681
We've occasionally seen their feet or arms
pop out of the pouch.

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:52.271
They mature inside the pouch, so normally we see
a leg or tail before actually seeing the face.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.268
Now it's time go feed the wallabies.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.968
Here's what we feed them.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.770
At our zoo we feed them things like apples,
carrots, bread, and sweet potatoes.

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:23.300
Wallabies eat with their hands, so we cut
everything up into sticks to make it easier for them.

00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:30.316
We also give them oak leaves, Japanese
mustard spinach, and lettuce.

00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:50.296
Wallabies usually use their hands when they eat.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.090
But with certain foods, they'll just use their mouths.

00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:04.966
I see the wallabies every day,
so naturally I get attached to them.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.771
Each one of them has their own unique personality,

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:12.120
and of course we've given them all names,
so we're very fond of them.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.173
This female wallaby eating right now is named Konoko.

00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:19.716
Konoko.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.726
Next to Konoko is Boy.

00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.690
He's Konoko's father.

00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:30.821
Over towards the back we have Lala.

00:03:32.576 --> 00:03:36.936
The wallabies are already outside
when I get here in the morning,

00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:43.468
so I feed them and then they spend the day
basking in the sun and playing around.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.930
In the evening, they return to their sleeping area to eat again
before heading outside to play around some more.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.738
They shove each other playfully,
as well as chase and sniff each other.

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:07.993
My favorite parts of wallabies are their eyes and ears.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.756
I'm sure they can hear all the other animals
here at the zoo.

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:18.528
I like the way their ear moves around in response to that.

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:25.291
They say wallabies are very cautious.
They're also very timid.

00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:36.760
Maybe it's just me, but the wallabies
at our zoo don't seem so shy, though.
