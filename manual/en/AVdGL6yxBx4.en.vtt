00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.650
don't rob is gonna explain why we should
totally take him seriously as a

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.900
presidential candidate

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.250
now I'm sure you know he's already
teased Iran roughly nine hundred and

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.139
twelve times

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.280
I mean this guy you know back during the
William Howard Taft administration was

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.599
like

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.340
I'm gonna run this town let me tell you
%uh never did

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.080
never did %uh so less less and I have a
lot to say about it after

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.090
for small could you be taken seriously
as a presidential candidate

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.810
well I think that I've built a great
great company I know that I built a

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.019
great company with a tremendous net
worth

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.059
and beaten a lot of people that are very
smart and that's really what the country

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.180
needs what do you say to those who say
that

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.140
a possible trump candidacy is a joke
that here is a publicity stunt this is a

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.450
way to get more attention

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.110
for yourself well you know interestingly
I filed

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.559
applications last time and i actually
filed my net worth because I'm a private

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.840
person so nobody knows some people
really shocked at the number now the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.379
numbers a lot bigger than it was

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.530
how strong the company is how much cash
the whole thing I mean it's a beautiful

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.440
company it's a company like this country
should look to what is the number

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.369
already worth now

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.920
probably over ten billion dollars and if
you were to run for president

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.240
how much would you be willing to spend
on the campaign well if I made a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.590
decision that spend a lot

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.070
but a modern presidential campaign can
be you know half a billion dollars you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.909
can be or more

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.250
got no I'd be willing to spend that
concluded I'd spend whatever it took

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.920
all how insufferable is he I can't take
it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.140
I can't take it it Donald how seriously
should we take you as a candidate

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.470
got my company is doing spectacular
thank you so much for asking its own

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.890
your check company

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.100
no yes what your company didn't wait
where's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.990
word your company come from a
conversation anyway don't go back to

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.420
politics

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.070
you know I'm or ten million dollars
right I gotta lotta money into chicks

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.680
dig it you know no senaka

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.850
great stuff again how

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.909
why you are you bringing that up and
seems a

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.390
unnecessary and that's not even true by
the way but I

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.100
look it up earlier a lot more so the
report estimates just over 3.2 billion

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.710
dollars

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.250
now obviously that's an absurd amount of
money is nothing to scoff at

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.190
but i just show you his mentality show
you he's a liar now we will he live a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.760
lie about

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.629
unnecessary think and what his dad four
hundred million dollars

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.849
if you have it anyone to $400 million
dollar headstart

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.770
they'll do just peachy if you give
anyone a five million dollar headstart

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.270
they'll do just peachy and Donald Trump

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.720
well known fact he went bankrupt 4

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.190
times this is the business genius you
wanna worship

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.370
I went bankrupt 0 times

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.540
so I guess by at least one measure I'm a
better businessman Donald Trump

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.330
and let's get this silly idea I love
people's heads

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.709
ASAP that running a government

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.660
is like running a business one is for
profit and personal gain

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.150
and one is for precisely not that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.709
whole point of having a government is
have something take your things

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.230
that businesses simply too greedy to
handle and we look at a politician i

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.790
mean they have three main functions:

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.849
and it depends whether it's state local
or federal

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.360
but by and large the first one is
upholding the Constitution

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.470
the second one is legislating the will
love your constituents

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.640
and the third is being a visionary to
create a better society

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.099
it has nothing to do with green or
profits for a product

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.489
not on that and the last thing from said
that really got under my skin because it

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.390
shows you have broken our democracy is

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.590
it was just a casual like oh yeah I'd
spend whatever it takes to win

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.080
i just bided by the country

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.810
sure I want to lead it so i buy it well
how broken is

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.230
is our system I mean and you can blame
the Supreme Court in a series of

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.709
decisions the most recent one

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.940
are being citizens united they said I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.260
Moneygall free speech but you realize
the implications are that so by

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.620
definition the perk whereas the most
money

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.099
will have the loudest voice they have a
megaphone and we're

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.189
on volume negative point 0001 decibel

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.400
we need to get our democracy back how
broken

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.060
is our government it's like where openly
in oligarchy and a kleptocracy

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.109
and raising douchebag donald Trump

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.110
cans die Albina government fuck it why
not I'll do it on a Tuesday before noon
