00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.830
the structures and materials evaluation
group at the University of Dayton

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.459
Research Institute has expertise and
evaluating current an emerging materials

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.549
and structures under a variety of
conditions

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.419
in addition to performing standardized
test they're often required to develop

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:21.079
unique test protocols in fabricate
specialized test fixtures in systems in

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.910
order to properly evaluate the
performance of structures and components

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.930
under real-world environments or
situations as an example of meeting

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.920
customer specific needs

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.609
the University of Dayton Research
Institute

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.940
is the only organization in the world that can 
certify sulky's for US Trotting Association racing

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.020
In harness racing the driver rides on a
lightweight card called a sulky

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.100
any new sake design that will be used in
harness racing team by the United States

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.110
trotting association must first be
tested and certified by the university

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.770
of Dayton Research Institute each bike
must be submitted to be a scary for

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.260
measurement

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.449
and intern

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.379
once it passes those measurements it is
brought to the University of Dayton

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.570
for dynamic testing to

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.670
make sure that a strong enough support
withstand rigors of racing

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.650
and I do believe now that

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.710
they are much safer than they were

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.119
years ago

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.979
before a sulky can be certified
researchers in UDRIs structures and

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.690
materials evaluation group

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.490
put the cart through a series of
rigorous tests

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.750
developed by UDRI researchers

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.880
that simulate the same type of lows the
sulky will experience on the track during

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.630
multiple races

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.360
as the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.739
they come to the

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:36.350
end of the race

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.700
down the front stretch the drivers
encouraging the horse quite a bit

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.250
and jumping up and down so we simulate
those g loading conditions here

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.970
with this test rig the sulky is attached
to a fully adjustable custom test system

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.090
and load is applied at the point of the
driver center of gravity

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.640
the sake is put through an initial
static load to a level of three g's

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.420
the sulky is then put through a series of
loads to replicate the forces that the

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.520
sake sees during a race

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.489
the series is repeated ten thousand
times

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.469
the load is released and the sulky is
inspected to make sure no cracks have developed

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.749
the last check is a final load
of five g's

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.609
any sulky which exhibits a structural
failure during this test which would

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.749
render the vehicle unsafe for the driver or
others on the track is considered to

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.299
have failed the certification test

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.939
if the sulky passes the test the
particular sulky model can now be

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.999
manufactured and raced in a US trotting
association sanctioned event
