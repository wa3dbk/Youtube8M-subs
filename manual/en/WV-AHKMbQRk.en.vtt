00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.759
Joel Scruggs, Public Affairs Specialist, Bonneville
Power Administration (off camera): Traditionally,

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.320
a fish hatchery is where fish eggs are artificially
fertilized, hatched and raised. Then once

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.670
they become juveniles they’re released into
the wild. At the Yakama Nation’s Salmon

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.930
hatchery in Prosser, Washington, they’re
doing something else. Here, they’re rejuvenating

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.070
kelts, which are wild adult steelhead that
have recently spawned.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.410
Joe Blodgett, Fisheries Biologist, Yakama
Nation: Steelhead have a unique lifecycle

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.510
where they don’t have to die after they
spawn like a salmon does. So with the kelts,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.390
they’ll drift back out and act like a giant
smolt trying to go back out to the ocean.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.030
You know, you can imaging the journey they
had coming back from the ocean: fighting the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.859
predators, the currents, and then spawning
in the wild. When they’re drifting back

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.469
out to the ocean there’s no energy left
in them. So we intercept them after they spawn,

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.469
hold them in our facility, recondition them,
hope they get their eggs to regenerate and

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:54.839
then release them back into the system.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.190
We saw these fish leaving the river system
and knowing they don’t seem to be repeat

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.470
spawning. So how can we help them out? And
rather than put another hatchery setting in

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.460
like you do for salmon, we’re using their
unique lifecycle.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.580
Yeah, so we intercept them. We give them a
safe environment. We treat them for any type

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.430
of diseases; give them some antibiotics and
feed, and then let them go back out and do

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.680
their thing.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:32.430
(Sounds from weighing and measuring process)

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.620
We’ll put a PIT (passive integrated transponder)
tag in all of our steelhead that we’re working

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.851
on today just to track and to get some evaluation
on how they’re doing. This is just a way

00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.200
to name the fish. And when the fish first
comes in we’ll do meristics. We’ll do

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.890
some lengths and weights and scale samples;
DNA samples. And with this tag we can link

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.420
it back to the original fish. So even with
its offspring we’ll be able to go through

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.540
and say this fish produced this many fish
here. It’s a valuable tool to have for monitoring

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.770
the success of our programs.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.570
Joel Scruggs: Steelhead are different than
salmon. They’re actually a sea run rainbow

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.150
trout, so they can repeat spawn like freshwater
trout. This characteristic is called iteroparity,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.620
but unfortunately there aren’t many kelts
left in the Columbia River Basin. The steelhead

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.439
populations that originate above Bonneville
Dam are listed under the Endangered Species

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.489
Act. The historical numbers of downstream
migrating kelts are not well documented, but

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.049
current rates show high mortality, due to
flows, pollution and fish passage.

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.659
Joe Blodgett: The bottom line is the river
has changed. The flows have changed. The fish

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.480
passages were designed for smaller fish, not
a big two-foot smolt.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.189
Doug Hatch, Senior Scientist, Columbia River
Inter-Tribal Fish Commission: Only 1.5 percent

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.830
of the spawning population is made of these
repeat spawners. We’re trying to come up

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.670
with any kind of novel approach to restoration
that would rebuild populations. If we could

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.659
boost that to 20 or 30 percent then we’ve
made a sizeable increase to the population.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.970
Joel Scruggs: The Columbia River Inter-Tribal
Fish Commission in collaboration with the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.151
Yakima/Klickitat Fisheries Project has been
reconditioning kelts from the Yakima River

00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.859
since 1999 and so far the results are encouraging.

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.579
Joe Blodgett: We’ve actually radio-tagged
some of the fish and videotaped them spawning

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.200
in the wild. And that’s exciting. And with
the PIT tags, we’ve had them come back into

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.669
our system for a third time. They’ve gone
up and spawned a second time and they’ve

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.310
come back through. So we’re seeing evidence
that it’s happening. Now we’re going to

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.639
try and see how viable the eggs are and we’re
doing that with artificial spawning channels

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.129
and with more radio tags.

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.270
Joel Scruggs: After six to eight months of
nurturing, feeding and growing these refreshed

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.340
kelts are ready to be released back into the
wild.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.000
Joe Blodgett: When we release them they look
they’re fresh fish out of the ocean. So

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
they’re big and they’re bright and they’re
full of eggs.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.180
(Sounds from truck releasing kelts back into
the river)

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:57.840
They’ll go back into the tributaries in
another couple months and start spawning.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.200
After that they’ll drift back out like smolts
and we’ll see them March through June back

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.579
in our system again, hopefully ready to go
through another cycle.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.719
Doug Hatch: Had we not intervened those fish
would have died. They would have perished.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.480
Instead, a good number of them are going to
go back upstream and spawn again.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.150
Joe Blodgett: With this we allow the fish
to go back out and spawn in their own habitat,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.390
pick their own mates, pick their own areas
and spawn without interfering with their genetic

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.290
makeup. I think this tool will be around for
awhile to help with the steelhead population.
