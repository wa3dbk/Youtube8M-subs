00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.230
My name is Marquell Osborne; I’m from Dallas,
TX.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:26.700
One of the reasons why I chose rightlook was
because of the honest answers that were provided

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.210
to me during questioning by Mr. Steve Drennon.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.060
He gave me a comfortable feeling knowing that
this particular company was a great opportunity

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.760
for me and would provide me the necessary
tools and training to be successful at Paintless

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.820
Dent Repair.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.850
Greg was my trainer and he was excellent,
he was able to show me what it’s going to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.170
take as far a dedication.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.350
His instructions were very simple, they were
clear to understand.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.390
He allowed me to focus when I needed to focus
and he was also very encouraging.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.610
He was able to show me what corrections I
needed to make and also understand what the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.860
principles of PDR is.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.640
My first couple of days, I had quite a few
questions and doubt as to my abilities and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.180
as I continued, my confidence continued to
grow to where I feel more comfortable at the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.390
end of training.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.950
Working on the practice panels was a little
bit more challenging than I had anticipated

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.790
but as I progressed it got better.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.560
I was pretty confident by the time I moved
onto an actual vehicle knowing that I had

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.130
the basic understanding and principles of
PDR and had been prepared by Greg.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.780
It allowed me the opportunity to be a little
built more comfortable working on customer

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.070
cars.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.009
I do feel that rightlook has separated me
from competitors by allowing me the opportunity

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.120
to understand what it is going to take as
far as motivation, training, and being prepared

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.150
and laying the ground work to be successful.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.070
I know for a fact this is going to allow me
an opportunity to build a great future for

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.790
retirement from my current job in law enforcement
and I think it’s also be something that

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.440
will also allow other people to be successful
if they’re looking for other trades in skills

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:45.720
to be prepared for their future as well.
