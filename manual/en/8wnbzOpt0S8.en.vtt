It's a good experience and a good
opportunity to see what you learn in lectures, what

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.400
you're reading about and actually seeing that being applied at a very high level at one of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.620
the highest levels. Obviously, with it being
a foreign country, to see it being

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.290
applied slightly differently to how it
might be applied at home.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.830
I think especially with the Olympics
that just happened, I think it's good to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.920
see how coaching is different in
different areas of the world. Spain won the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.690
football World Cup so it was really good to see a lot of football and futsal to see how

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.220
good they are and how they train and how their coaches train and mentor them.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.000
To come to different countries and see how they coach because everywhere

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.380
is different in the world, all the philosophies are different. So it's about

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.250
versatile environments and taking
something from another country and

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.200
putting it into your coaching, which makes you a better, more well-rounded coach.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.040
We've been able to speak to some of the coaches here. It's great to actually probe them, to

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.270
ask what do you think of this, and how do you do these sorts of things. There were a few questions

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.630
the other day with one of the coaches about his
philosophy in coaching and the club's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.420
philosophy in coaching. It was good to see an
honest response from them,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.540
letting us into how they actually work within a professional set-up. It's been really interesting coming

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.619
to a different country especially with tutors who can show you about and give you extra

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.930
knowledge. It enables you to talk to different people and get
different perspectives on life as an athlete

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.210
and athletes from around the world. It also

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.930
shows you that you can achieve things and become a good coach.
