Word up Foodtubers, it is DJ BBQ here from Matchday Munchies man!

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.760
The USA is in the World Cup man, throw it in here man let's do this come on. We invented this sport, we're gonna crush it.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.660
What?

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.540
Soccer?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.960
The one you actually hit the ball with your feet... ok.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.180
Anyway, so we're going to do DJ BBQ's Jalapeno Party Poppers

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.600
The tastiest snacks known to planet awesome-a-tron

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.190
A sweet and spicy jalapeno
pepper, stuffed with two types of cheeses 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.600
Wrapped in salty bacon and then char-grilled on a BBQ.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.600
It's a RAD dish for sharing when you've got a big crew, you're in front of the TV, you're kicking the ball around...

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.630
or maybe you're throwing the ball around... you know what I mean? Come on throw it in there dude...

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.340
Alright, we're gonna start with the filling, which consists of 100 grams of cream cheese.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.080
Get in there!

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.160
Then we add some Monterey Jack. We want 75 grams of that stuff.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.280
Then it's two spring onions. They go in.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.120
Next up... coriander. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.780
Get in there coriander

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.420
Alright. Season with sea salt and some cracked pepper.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.940
We can throw a pinch of Paprika in there.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.340
Oh that's gonna be good

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.120
Did you guys call the cops? I didn't do anything wrong! Was that you guys calling the cops?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.520
It's the fashion police. The fashion Police? Is this too much?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.440
Let's get the Jalapenos ready! So... small knife.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.720
We're gonna make an incision on the top... like so.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.700
Then we're gonna do another incision down the middle

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.000
And then, I want you to grab your small spoon and then just grab all of the stuff out of there.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.820
Get rid of the seeds and all the middle bits

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.760
So we've got a blank canvas to fill with your beautiful cheesy concoction. 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.780
So... you guys got it? Listen, I've got a lot more to get through so I'm gonna hit the fast forward button.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.500
Where is it? It's here, right here.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.800
There we go man... a dozen Jalapenos gutted!

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.880
Ready for the awesome cheesy filling. Get in there man.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.800
Shove it inside the Jalapeno.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.980
You know what will go really good with this Jalapeno party popper? an ice cold beer.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.560
Why don't you guys check out our friends over at Drinks Tube, see what they got rocking. Woo!

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.520
and there's the final jalapeno and now, a nicepack of streaky, smokey bacon.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.480
Here we go. So I'm gonna pull it off and I'm gonna cut it down the middle.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.380
and then it's time for the wrap!

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.520
So you grab your Jalapeno. You grab your bacon and you wrap it around the awesomeness.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.020
Now we're gonna skewer it with tooth picks.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.680
Soak those toothpicks for at least an hour man... because wood burns.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.460
So you can throw that right through the middle and there you go!

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.300
There's your Jalapeno Party Popper ready for the grill.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.640
So this is gonna take me some time guys, so I'm going to hit another fast forward button. Is that ok?

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.560
Is that cool with you guys?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.880
Alright we got a nice medium direct heat rocking in there. That's feeling perfect.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.160
My hand can only stay there for about 4 seconds, so you know it's the right heat.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.420
Woo! Let's make 'em pop!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.420
Get them all in there. Have some fun.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.080
Have a party... and then I'm going to eat you.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.340
So we're gonna crisp up that bacon around that jalapeno. That's gonna be the tastiest matchday treat known to this planet.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.580
So these things need about 10-15 minutes. It all depends on your heat. So keep an eye on them, you don't want them to burn you know.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.440
Look at this man... that is popping... look at that, Oh yeah. 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.220
That means she's time to turn

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.100
Woo look at that there's that char going on in there.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.220
So if you guys don't have access to a BBQ you can do this in an oven

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.520
you can do it on a griddle pan... just do them.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.800
Alright they've had 10 minutes and they have that nice charred colour coming through, then bacon is crisping up

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.600
It's time to pull them and munch

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.280
Come on dudes

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.560
Alright. They've just come off the grill, you've entered the room, your friends are sitting down getting ready to watch the big game.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.480
You lay these bad boys out, they munch and you win the World Cup of Matchday Munchie foods.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.750

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.460
This thing looks too good... get rid of that.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.940
Oh wow, are you kidding me! The crispy bacon, wrapped around that kinda spicy, hot peno.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.320
That beautiful mixture of cheese, just oozing out of that bad boy.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.020
That is a tasty sensation times infinite 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.420
