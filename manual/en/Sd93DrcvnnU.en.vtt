Hi, I'm Michelle Phelan, Nutritionist at Blossom
Bariatrics. Today we're going to discuss a

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.640
few very helpful tips for bariatric patients.
Today I'm here to discuss the top five foods

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.750
of folks who are candidates for bariatric
surgery. The first one on the list is high

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.529
sugary, high calorie coffee drinks. Anything
that's a frappucino, anything that looks like

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.729
a coffee milkshake, kick it to the curb. Those
are one of the worst culprits ever. Alright,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.329
number two, processed carbs. Now you all know
about these, but somehow they still find a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.600
way to sneak back in to your pantry and in
to your cupboards, alright? So here we go

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.139
and I'm going to name them, bread, pasta,
cereal, granola, chips, crackers, cookies,

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:55.339
bagels, muffins, english muffins, little mini
cupcakes, pies, little tiny 100 calorie snack

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.449
packs. Those are some of the worst culprits
ever. The third thing, of course, is salad

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.480
dressings. You think you're doing great with
a delicious salad, but then you pile on a

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.880
high calorie salad dressing that's full of
a fat that's not beneficial. The best way

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.830
to go is an olive oil based salad dressing
like Italian, olive-oil vinaigrette. Of course,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.610
these are all the best choices. Number four,
high sugar energy drinks, these are really,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.950
really one of the top things. People think
they are doing a great job because it says

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.180
high energy, B vitamins, other amino acids,
but if you look at the sugar content, typically

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.030
they're at least 24-48 grams of sugar per
serving. You also have to remember, usually

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.520
those big cans or those big containers carry
two to three servings. So if you just finish

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.950
off one you're actually getting three times
the amount of sugar that's listed per serving

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.840
on the label on the back. Number five, smoothies,
now we need to pay attention folks. Smoothies

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.670
don't automatically equal health. Now protein
smoothies made with your whey protein isolate

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.340
powder or your plant based protein powder,
those are what I'm talking about, if you don't

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.280
add a lot of fruit and other things in there
like chocolate syrup and all that deliciousness,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.090
we need to make sure that when we say smoothies
it's very, very lean on the fruit so those

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.609
fruit smoothies at those wonderful delicious
Jamba Juice and tropical smoothie places,

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:39.139
even if you add whey protein as the option,
you're still getting way too much fruit and

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:47.379
way too much sugar. So the ratio is off. Keep
your smoothies protein based. Thanks for watching.
