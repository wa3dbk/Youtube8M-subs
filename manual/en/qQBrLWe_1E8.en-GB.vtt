00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.950
My name is Mark D'Cruz of Ma-Ke Bonsai and I have Johnny Gires here with me.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.220
Today we're going to demonstrate how to wire a bonsai pot.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:22.060
We will require a small set of tools: scissors, jin pliers, wire cutters, 2mm wire and 1.5 mm wire

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.370
and the mesh, and of course the bonsai pot that we're going to be working with.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.290
We try not to waste too much of the mesh so the mesh is exactly the right size.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.340
Notice that he removes any of the edges that are going to be there.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.340
Now we're going to build the 2 mm U clip.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.220
 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.540
He measures the clip to fit inside just snuggly into the hole.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.470
This is the simplest form of binding the mesh to the pot.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.090
 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.920
You have two little legs that you bend over. Firm it against the bonsai pot.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.230
Cut off any excess wire so that it doesn't hit any of the display tables at a later stage.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.580
Ensure that it is parallel to the length of the pot, and now we'll put in the second wire.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.810
 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.850
The wire should go basically around the pot once. Cut off two lengths.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.410
 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.310
So you thread the pot on the closest side of the ceramic. Down the other side,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.420
and on one side, you have a long arm and on the other side, you have a short arm.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.460
Then do the same thing with the second wire.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.450
We've got the wires settled out and spread out so that later on,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.370
when you put the root ball inside, it will bind it quite nicely.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.670
And that's how you wire a bonsai pot.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:11.727
