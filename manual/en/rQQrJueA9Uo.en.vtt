00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
 

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.160
Dr. Robert van de Geijn: So, I've
opened up the IPython Notebook's 4.1.1,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.970
Predicting the Weather.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.400
And as always, what we're
going to do is make a copy.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.480
 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.660
And what do we have here?

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.020
Well, I conveniently put the table
that indicates how the weather changes

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.720
in our idealized world from
today to tomorrow for any day,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.120
and I went ahead and created
a transition matrix P.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.060
And we better make sure that
we execute that so we have it.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.490
And then, to indicate
that today is cloudy,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.190
we discussed the fact that we just used
the second unit basis vector for that.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.990
So, x0 now is the vector that
tells us what the weather is today,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.970
and today, it is cloudy.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.960
Now, if we want to predict the
weather for tomorrow, all we do

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.020
is, we multiply the transition matrix
times the vector and we get that.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.260
If we now want to know what
it is the day after tomorrow,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.670
we take the transition
matrix and we multiply it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.060
times the vector that tells us what the
weather is on day one, and we get that.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.510
x3 is equal to P times x2.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.650
And we can print that
out and we get that.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:36.492
Now, we could have done P3 is
equal to P times P times p1,

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:38.200
and we would have
gotten the same answer.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.680
Or we could have done P
times P times P times x0,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.610
and we would also got the same answer.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.840
But let's make it simple.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.470
And we'll do P times
x2, and we get that.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:05.770
Then going from day three to day four,
we get x4 is equal to P times x3.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.720
 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.979
And we want to print that.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.030
 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.530
And then we may want to just
start copying and pasting.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.720
You know how I love to copy and paste.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.070
And we get that.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.010
And we do it again, and
now we go from five to six.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.296
Oops.

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:32.795
Yep.

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:37.220
 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.515
And finally, we go from six to seven.

00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:47.300
 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.910
And now we have the vector that
predicts the weather next week,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.560
given that today it is cloudy.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.820
Now, we could predict the
next 20 days, and for that, we

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.980
would write a little loop.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.790
So, here's the little loop,
and we can execute that.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.660
And we can see what happens
from one day to the next.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.580
Now, the important
thing here is that you

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.630
start noticing that this vector
going from day 19 to day 20

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.280
doesn't change much.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.700
We say that the vector has converged or
is converging to a stable vector, which

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.540
then predicts the
weather on a typical day.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.350
Now, we could obviously change this
loop to do the next entire year.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.504
Let's just assume that a
year has 365 days in it.

00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:40.170
And that would take a little bit longer.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.580
And if we go all the way to
the end, we would definitely

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.350
notice that this vector
is not changing anymore.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.020
 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.030
So, you can go back, and you can do
exactly the same calculation, where

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.235
all you do is you change the
vector that says that today

00:03:56.235 --> 00:04:01.070
is cloudy to a vector
that says today is sunny.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.210
And we can just go and execute
all the same things over again.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.740
What you'll notice is that
again, things start to stabilize.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.890
And at the end of a year, we get roughly
the same vector as we got before.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.760
And you can go back
and do the same thing,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.930
and put in the third unit
basis vector, and see

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.460
what happens if you start
with a day that's rainy.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.500
 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.980
So what we saw when we did our IPython
notebook was that given a vector that

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.760
indicates that today it
is cloudy, we can come up

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.970
with a vector of what the probabilities
are for tomorrow and the day

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.360
after, and the day after, and the day
after, and the day after, and so forth.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.670
Then finally, a week from now.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.160
One thing you notice is that these
numbers are starting to stabilize.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.420
There's not much change anymore.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.999
What that means is that we are
converging to a stable vector.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.040
Now, what does that mean?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.320
This vector here simply
becomes the vector

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.020
that tells us what is the probability
of it being sunny, cloudy,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.600
or ray on a typical day without
really specifying what that day is.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.820
And you can imagine if you do this
in an infinite number of times,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.200
that then truly, the
vector would become stable.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.990
Later in this course we're
going to try to relate that

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.800
to eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.449
