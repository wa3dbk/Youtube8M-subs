00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.890
Today I'm joined with Jeff Phillips from Mobility
SVM in order to discuss the wheelchair accessible

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.560
Chevy truck.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.250
Some of the features of our truck we can do
both 1500 and 2500 trucks two and four-wheel

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.250
drive.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.770
It has a five-person capacity.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.790
One of the cool features and we'll show you
that in a little bit is we don't lose the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.390
backseat of our truck so you have full capacity
of your backseat and so forth.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.720
Some of the standard features for our Chevy
Silverado is this door.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.690
It comes out 36 inches which means you can
park in a standard parking spot.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.210
You have 54 inches in the interior to come
in to there and 57 inches inside which is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.340
very similar to most vans that are in the
market.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.980
It has a three-year 36,000 mile warranty on
the vehicle as well.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.130
And again, as you look at our vehicle you
could tell.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.180
There's not a conversion in there.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.440
You can't tell there's a conversion on our
vehicle, it looks great and it looks like

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.340
just a regular Silverado driving down the
highway.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.969
You know one of the things that's really tough
for most people that are injured is in the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.700
past one of these things it'll do is a lot
of times they'll have to have a swing out

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.110
door, they have to break down their chair,
put it in the back.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.320
That takes a significant amount of time, somewhere
in the avenue of six to eight minutes.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.370
Our truck takes 45 seconds to load in and
out so that's going to be a savings.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.900
They won't have to break down their chair.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.439
It'll just help them a lot.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.200
If you're looking for a wheelchair accessible
option and you want the off road capabilities

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.350
and ruggedness, Mobility SVM is the package
for you.
