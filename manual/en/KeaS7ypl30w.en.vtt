Hi! My name is Dawn Shannon for Expert Village,
I’m also a hairstylist and owner of Intuition

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:12.620
Salon and Spa, you can visit us on the web
at www.intuitionsalonandspa.com. I’m now

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.510
going to go ahead and I’m going to remove
a little bit of bulk through the top area

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.550
here. First we’re going to start in the
back I’m going to start at the bottom, first

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.259
we’re going to do this with the razor and
then later we’re going to go in with the

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.180
notching shears. Now in through here when
I look I see that the color isn’t blending

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.510
so well this is something I can use my razor
to do to help blend in those colors so it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.400
doesn’t look choppy and also remove bulk
at the same time. I lightly hold my razor

00:00:47.400 --> 00:01:24.840
when working I can always go and take more
out, now I’m going to up in through here

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.759
and when you’re up in this area you very,
very, very lightly razor and this takes out

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:45.649
some of the bulk it’ll give more volume.
You can also do a technique like this…and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:54.719
like this…now this piece right here being
it’s right at top I’m not going to thin

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.909
up in here so she doesn’t get a bunch of
little pieces sticking up. I’m then going

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:52.230
to move over into this top area and very lightly
I’m going to razor up in through here…and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.830
that is how you go about texturizing the top
part of the hair with a razor which there’s

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.260
lots of other tips and techniques you can
also do too.
