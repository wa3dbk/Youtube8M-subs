00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.455
"Poultry Exposure and Cancer"

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.439
Thousands of Americans continue 
to die from asbestos exposure 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.785
decades after many 
uses were banned 

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:17.230
because the cancers can 
take years to show up.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.012
We are now in the so-called third 
wave of asbestos related disease. 

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:24.203
The first wave was in 
the asbestos miners,

00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:25.800
which started in the 1920s. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.942
The second phase 
was in the workers—

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:30.017
the ship-builders and 
construction workers 

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:32.900
that used the stuff in 
the 30s, 40s, and 50s. 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.103
Now as "buildings constructed 
with asbestos" 

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:39.679
"over the past six decades begin 
to age and deteriorate”, 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.553
not only are 
workers at risk,

00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:45.468
but "Potential also exists for 
serious environmental exposure" 

00:00:45.468 --> 00:00:48.932
"to asbestos among residents, tenants 
and users of these buildings"

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:54.329
"such as school children, office workers,
 maintenance workers, and the general public.” 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.327
The CDC, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, 

00:00:59.327 --> 00:01:03.301
and the EPA "have projected 
that over the next 30 years"

00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.342
"approximately 1,000 cases of 
mesothelioma and lung cancer "

00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:08.951
"will occur among persons 
in the United States" 

00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:13.177
"exposed to asbestos in school 
buildings as school children." 

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:16.156
But it all started 
with the workers. 

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:20.920
As one internal industry 
memo callously put it, 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.102
"If you've enjoyed a good life while working 
with asbestos products why not die from it." 

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:32.183
To see if something 
is carcinogenic, 

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:35.457
you study those who have 
the most exposure.

00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:36.797
That's how we learned 
about the potential 

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.877
cancer-causing 
dangers of asbestos, 

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:40.680
and that's how we're 
learning about 

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:45.000
the potential cancer-causing 
dangers of poultry viruses.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.670
For years I've talked about 
the excess mortality 

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.910
in poultry workers associated 
with these wart-causing 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.690
chicken cancer viruses 
that may be transmitted 

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:59.440
to those in the general population 
handling fresh or frozen chicken. 

00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:03.070
Last year I talked about the largest 
study to date, at the time,

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.330
confirming the findings 
of three other studies 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.070
“that workers in poultry slaughtering 
and processing plants"

00:02:08.073 --> 00:02:11.090
"have increased risk of 
dying from certain cancers”, 

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.670
and adding death 
from penis cancer

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.160
to the risks linked 
to poultry exposure. 

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:20.830
That was looking at 
20,000 poultry workers. 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:25.500
Well, we have yet another study, 
looking at 30,000. 

00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:26.740
The purpose of 
the study was to 

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:30.280
"test the hypothesis that exposure 
to poultry (cancer) viruses" 

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:32.830
"that widely occurs occupationally 
in poultry workers"

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.590
not to mention the 
general population,

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:39.150
"may be associated with 
increased risks of deaths" 

00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:41.940
"from liver and 
pancreatic cancers." 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.270
They found that those 
who slaughter chickens 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.660
have about 9 times the odds of both 
pancreatic cancer and liver cancer. 

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.130
Just to put this in context,

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.660
the most carefully studied risk 
factor for pancreatic cancer, 

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.720
one of our deadliest cancers, 
is cigarette smoking. 

00:02:56.722 --> 00:03:00.540
Even if you smoke for more 
than 50 years, though, 

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:03.910
you only about double your 
odds of pancreatic cancer. 

00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:05.490
Those that slaughter 
poultry appear to have 

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:08.080
nearly 9 times the odds.

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.850
For liver cancer, 
it's more alcohol. 

00:03:11.856 --> 00:03:13.840
Those that consume more 
than a four drinks a day 

00:03:13.847 --> 00:03:15.930
have triple odds of lung cancer, 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.350
whereas poultry slaughtering appears 

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:21.110
to increase one's odds 9 fold. 

00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:24.220
There are diseases unique 
to the meat industry, 

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:27.720
like the newly described 
"salami brusher's disease" 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.940
that affects those whose job 
it is to wire brush off 

00:03:30.948 --> 00:03:34.010
the white mold that 
naturally grows on salami,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.180
for 8 hours a day, 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.900
but most diseases suffered by 
meat workers are more universal. 

00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:43.790
The reason the connection 
between asbestos and cancer 

00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:45.870
was so easy to 
nail down is that

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:50.580
asbestos caused a particularly 
unusual cancer, 

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:52.390
which was virtually 
unknown until there was

00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:55.820
widespread asbestos mining 
and industrial use. 

00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:58.990
But the pancreatic cancer one 
might get from handling chicken, 

00:03:58.993 --> 00:04:02.970
is the same pancreatic cancer one 
might get from smoking cigarettes, 

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:07.940
so it's more difficult to tease out 
a cause-and-effect relationship.

00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:11.850
So don't expect to see 
an asbestos-type ban 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:25.180
on Kentucky Fried Chicken 
anytime soon.
