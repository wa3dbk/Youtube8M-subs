00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.190
For larger capacity production, nothing compares
to the Savage Brothers' S-92 FireMixer.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.160
As the standard cooker in the confectionery
industry for over 100 years,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.150
the FireMixer uses temperature-controlled
cooking and spring-loaded scraper-agitators

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.920
to mix your batch without burning.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.760
Many different agitator designs are available
for specialty processing

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.450
such as cooking and coating nuts, rice crispie
treats, caramel corn, and other products.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:38.320
Depending on the recipe and kettle, batch
sizes up to 130 pounds or 60 kilograms can

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.130
be processed on the FireMixer.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.390
A great appliance to use with the FireMixer
is the LifTIL Truk Kettle Lift.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.420
Designed for confectioners and bakers with
small kitchens, this compact lifter will handle

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.110
all Savage cooking kettles
and mixing bowls up to 140 quarts for easy,

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.440
one-person table-top pouring.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.860
For fast, even batch cooling, consider Savage
Brothers' Cooling Tables.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.130
Four standard sizes are available for your
batch size and are interconnectable to create

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:25.390
even longer surfaces.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.470
Because Savage Brothers has been working to
stay current on the needs of all its diverse

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.810
customers,
a 2000-pound Melt Tank was created for the

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.070
large batch confectioner.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.730
Designed to melt and feed warm chocolate into
a Temperer, Enrober or Depositor,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:47.770
the Melt Tank is perfect for the batch confectioner
using chocolate compounds, icings, and fondants.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.800
This versatile machine is also suitable for
performing industrial operations with products

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.520
such as wax, soaps, cosmetics,
and other products with similar melting ranges.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.220
For smaller batch melting or tempering needs,
Savage Brothers makes seven tank sizes ranging

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.740
from 50 pounds to 1250 pounds.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.200
Chocolatiers use the Metered Transfer Pump
to measure and transfer chocolate or other

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:22.460
products from the Melt Tank to your next processing
step.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.771
When processing large-capacity products, craftspeople
will be glad to know that Savage Brothers

00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:32.690
has provided a way to move even the heaviest
of containers single-handedly!

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.490
The Model “C” LifTIL Truk Bowl Lift, our
most popular model, will handle most lifting

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.870
and pouring tasks, and is adaptable for many
other types of containers.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.630
Various models, both mobile and fixed, offer
one-person lifting and pouring to the height

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.090
you need.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.050
Lifting just doesn't get easier than this!

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.040
As Savage Brothers continues to serve artisan
