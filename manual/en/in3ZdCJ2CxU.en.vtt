I try to stay away from using real books in
the beginning when I'm teaching a child to

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.360
read because they will have a lot of words
that they haven't learned the rules for yet

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.200
and that can become confusing. We want to
go slowly and step by step so therefore it

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.350
becomes necessary at some point to generate
your own hand made books. Now if you don't

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.619
want to go through all this trouble, you can
do this in your workbook like everything else

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.650
in your notebook and you can just do it step
by step. But I find that it's neat to make

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.050
these little things, you can make them very
quickly and you can slowly develop a library

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.220
of them and keep them on a shelf. It also
teaches a child the proper way to take care

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.180
of a book if they mess it up, it's not like
they're ruining a book they paid for. And

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.030
the way we do it is very simple, take an 8
1/2 x 11 basic copy sheet, like this. Fold

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.860
in half, staple it, boom, boom, boom. If you
get a long arm stapler you can make it look

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.350
professional and staple it right along the
seam but you don't have to. And simple, title

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.030
it, give it a simple picture. Use your creativity,
but most importantly use only the words the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.980
child has learned up until this point. That
will limit you and the story won't be Shakespeare,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.360
it won't be John Grisom but it will be a great
story for that child learning to read. Start

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.460
very simple. A cat sat. There's your picture,
just throw in a little picture so they get

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.530
some kind of sense yes I read it right, look
at that. Now mix it up. A dog ran. Notice

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.020
I didn't say a dog sat. We want to mix it
up a little bit. If you use the same word

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.420
on every page or even the same types of words,
then they start to try to guess and they're

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.780
not really trying to sound out. And then you
can get a little more complicated. I usually

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.890
won't do two lines until a little while later.
But you can say a big rat was on the dog.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.670
A silly picture. Notice every word here is
a word that you can sound out except for was

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.390
and the which are a non-phonetic words that
we've also learned through our flash cards.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.250
You can go on until the end and just create
your own and make it as fun as you'll like.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.390
I usually take about 3 sheets, makes about
12 pages all together or you can do 4 sheets

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.410
and have 16 pages.
