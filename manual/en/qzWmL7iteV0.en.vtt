00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:23.520
I wanna show you that I care
But I don't have the nerve
I wanna say I love you
But I can't find the words

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:34.180
I wish that you could know how I
Really felt all of this time
But no matter what I do
You can't see the signs

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.620
He was an average teen
He partied often and he sagged his jeans
Sat in the very back of the class
So he could nap and dream

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.480
And fantasize about the girl he was obsessed with
The one who stole his heart and always kept it

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.480
'Cause ever since the seventh grade
She was always standin' in his center stage
But every time he tried to talk to her
She would just step away

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.700
And though she never spoke to him, it didn't matter
'Cause Billy never liked the chit-chatter

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.660
So what if a little passive?
To him she was attractive
He could sense a massive personality perfectly
By the way she acted

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.500
Plus she wrote poems for the paper every month
It was the lines on the page that had him fallin' in love

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.600
But he never told his friends
They would say that he was crazy
So no one ever found out that Billy liked Amy

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.100
He just gracefully endured
Being blatantly ignored
But sooner or later
Billy wouldn't take it anymore

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:27.600
I wanna show you that I care
But I don't have the nerve
I wanna say I love you
But I can't find the words

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.960
I wish that you could know how I
Really felt all of this time
But no matter what I do
You can't see the signs

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.140
So he's takin' his chances
Tired of all the wasted advances
Sick and tired of never havin' dates for the dances

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.320
If he wanted Amy he needed to step it up 
So one day he stopped her by her locker
To confess his love

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.600
And he told her that she was beautiful and lit up his sky
Like, "Columbus with a compass would get lost in your eyes”

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.960
But she didn't respond, just gave him a weird look
She tried to give him a shrug but she was carryin' books

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.540
But that was all that it took, he put himself out there and he got crushed
So he had to run away before the tears rushed

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.660
A whole week, he locked himself in his apartment
'Cause he didn't have the strength
To face the world so broken-hearted

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.960
After seven days of darkness, got a letter in the mail
But before he even looked at it, he let that ship sail

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.140
He was too concerned with all the sadness in his life
So instead of a letter opener he grabbed a kitchen knife

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:31.300
I wanna show you that I care
But I don't have the nerve
I wanna say I love you
But I can't find the words

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:42.300
I wish that you could know how I
Really felt all of this time
But no matter what I do
You can't see the signs

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.060
She was far from your average teen
The quiet type who never had a scene 
Studied often and wrote poems for the school magazine

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.660
She had a little secret and she always kept it
There was a boy that she was obsessed with

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:06.480
So when she wrote a poem for the school paper every month
Every line on the page was dedicated to her crush
But she never told her friends, they would say that it was silly
So no one ever found out that Amy liked Billy

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.180
'Till the day that Billy stopped her by her locker during school
But she couldn't understand him and responded like a fool

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.340
And gave him a weird look
She tried doin' sign language
But she couldn't 'cause she was carryin' all her books

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:27.980
See, even though Amy was equally obsessed
She was too embarrassed to tell him that she was born deaf
Avoided him at school, but to make her love known
She would leave him little signs through the lines of her poems

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:38.300
So she sent one to his home, after seven days passed
'Cause it seemed like Billy wasn't showin' up to class
So she's going home confused, trapped in the worst mood
Flippin' on the TV to a tragic story on the news

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.280
It was the picture of your average teen, all it said was this:

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.100
"LOCAL TEEN SUICIDAL WITH A KNIFE TO HIS WRIST"

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.600
At the scene where he died was a letter never read
From a girl named Amy and it said:

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:59.320
I wanna show you that I care
But I don't have the nerve
I wanna say I love you
But I can't find the words

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:10.220
I wish that you could know how I
Really felt all of this time
But no matter what I do
You can't see the signs
