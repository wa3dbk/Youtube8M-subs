00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.440
Okay so now we are back and we are ready to
do part three of the quiche and it really

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.690
is so quick because you can see there are
24 of them already done. I cut the puff pastry

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.669
crust, didn't even need to make that, just
defrosted it right out of the freezer, then

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.280
I cut some apples and cheese. I cut some apples
and cheese and I know it is not a conventional

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.900
quiche filling but it really is good. If you
are doing this at home, you can put whatever

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.150
vegetable you have in your fridge or whatever
you like. Your can do caramelized onions,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.050
you can do mushrooms, peppers whatever you
like, different kinds of cheeses, different

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.570
kinds of meat. But for the moment now we are
going to do the last step and remember how

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.920
I was telling you about my friend who thought
quiche was oh so difficult to do and the reason

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.690
I say that is because I read Julia Child's
"Kitchen Wisdom" and there is one simple formula

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:06.040
you need to know is that for every egg you
crack you want to fill to the half cup way

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.590
with either cream or milk or evaporated milk
or whatever you like so, because I am going

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:24.060
to start with four eggs here.
You mathematicians will now that now we are

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:33.210
going to be filling to the two cup mark, half
a cup for each egg and I am just using a one

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:43.020
percent nice and light so much of the holiday
fare is pretty heavy and it works just fine.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.150
I probably would not do it with skim, with
nonfat milk because probably it would get

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.479
too thin but honestly with this ratio every
time you are going to get the right texture

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:04.201
when it cooks. Because I have got the apple
and the cheese and I am just whisking this

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:09.160
with a fork, you don't need any fancy equipment
to do this, it is thyme, just a little bit

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:19.489
of dried thyme. You could add a little bit
more salt if you like but the cheese generally

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.310
takes care of the salt content. Then all I
am going to do is pour these right in there

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:34.830
and then I am going to bake it at 350 for
about 30 minutes and it's okay if it goes

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:44.610
over the edge because the puff pastry as it
does will puff up around it. Okay and that's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.629
it. So these 24, see that was not much harder
than taking it out of the box, right, these

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.690
are going to go right in the oven at 350 in
about 30 minutes you will see them get all

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.280
nice and golden brown and puffed up and they
are ready to go.
