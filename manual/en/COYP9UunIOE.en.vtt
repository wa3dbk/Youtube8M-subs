Hi everyone and welcome to RaceCloud.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.540
I am Vasil 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.800
and you are with our kart and driving tips blog, 

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.000
aimed to help you become a champion!

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.350
So, now, when you are ready to enter the track, 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.454
it's time for some basic driving tips.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500
The first, and maybe the most important of 
these tips is the correct seating position.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Since the different chassis manufacturers offer 
numerous options for setup of the seat position,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.500
you need to refer to their specifications 
for the seat vertical and horizontal alignment. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.300
After choosing the right seat size, assuring 
a tight fit and confident body support,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
you need to fix it on the right position, 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.550
to result in the right seating position and perfect weight distribution. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.000
As a result you should get a body position offering 
the suitable bends in the knees and elbows, 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.000
guaranteeing stable support and relaxed stance.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.396
Depending on the driver's height the 
distance between the seat and the pedals 

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:06.850
can be adjusted not only through changing the 
longitudinal position of the seat,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but also by moving the heel support backward and forward.   

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.500
Since the correct steering operation is crucial for the proper kart control, 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.000
the position of the hands on the wheel is a key factor for 
"reading" the feedback from the tyres and applying precise input. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.500
The hands should be positioned on 3 and 9 o' clock positions 
and should not change their place in any case. 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:39.000
In conjunction with the seating position the steering wheel should be 
mounted in a way that guarantee a proper reach and operation with it. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.800
You should not use the steering wheel as an additional 
support for the body through the hands -- 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.200
they should be relaxed and used only for controlling the wheel and steering. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.500
The operation with the steering wheel should be fast but smooth, with 
no unnecessary additional movements and corrections within the corner. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Steering must be precise with no more steering input than needed since every additional movement or bigger input results in lose of speed and power.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.500
The heel support mentioned before is the one 
giving you a proper support in the seat,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.500
so the hands remain relaxed and doing their job with the steering. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
When the position of the heel support is determined, 
you should adjust the travel of the pedals,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.500
so your foot is able reach both the fully released 
and pressed positions without any tension.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.000
Operating the pedals should be fast and smooth again, 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.000
and there should not be a moment on the track 
when your feet are not doing anything -- 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.500
you should be either accelerating or braking, or both, but never none of them.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.500
The gas and brake pedals should be used progressively, 
not only in their fully on or off positions.
