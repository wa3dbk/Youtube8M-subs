MATT SENATORE: Hi, this is Matt on behalf
of Expert Village, and today we are going

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:19.000
to make our Spicy Spanish Patties. Okay, now
I want to show how to take our ground turkey

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.490
and add them to our turnover pastries or "para
empanadas." I can't speak Spanish but there

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.320
you have it. Now, it is important when you
take this out, don't take them out and leave

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.621
them, put them in defrost too long, because
they will get too soft, and they will just

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:39.670
be really gooey and it won't be useful. As
you are cooking half way through, then pull

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.329
them out, and let them thaw a little bit.
So, right now this is perfect. So we are going

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.840
to take this, it is still cold, but it is
still soft, not too hard. I'm going to put

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.579
that there, then we are going to add just
a few fork fulls in the middle, not much just

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.820
a little bit, so we can fold over easy. See
how we are adding that in the middle here?

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:15.140
Just get a little bit in there, just like
that, okay. And now we are going to take one

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.330
flap and fold it over just like that, and
then we are going to take our fork and we

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:34.869
are going to press on the ends, like this,
and it'll grooves. Make sure that none are

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:43.060
spilling out of the sides, because then this
won't work. Just knows how that is coming

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:55.180
along, just make our little grooves with our
fork, and there you have it. We have our turnover

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.240
with our ground turkey in the middle.
