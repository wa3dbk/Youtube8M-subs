00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.840
There's a proper way to coil lines on a boat.
Most of the lines on the boat are braided

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:17.499
lines, and they're--you want to coil them
up in a specific way. Not like a cowboy would,

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:24.180
by putting a twist in it and forming loops,
because if you do that, what will happen is--see

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.720
how I'm twisting it now, the improper way;
don't do it this way. When you take it apart,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.830
you end up with what they call knuckles in
the line. Of course it doesn't do it with

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.010
me. You end up with knuckles, which are these
little things like this, and they get caught

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.782
up in the blocks when we're trying to let
them out. So on a braided line, when you coil

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:58.920
it up, you actually want to just pull--bring
the line in and let it lay naturally. And

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:09.070
what it will do is form a figure eight naturally,
and you lay it the same direction each time.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:26.970
And it forms a figure eight. And then when
you drop the line down onto the deck, you

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.720
won't get knuckles, and it won't get locked
up in the blocks. So once you get to the end

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.120
of this line, if you don't have these nice,
fancy clips to hang your lines, what you can

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:56.850
do is reach through this line, grab the working
end, put a twist or two in it, and hang it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.619
over a winch. Now you can pull it down, and
it hangs nice and neatly. Now when it's read--you're

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.810
ready to use it, you can lift it off and drop
it down, and everything comes off nice and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:16.260
easy. Nothing comes out in knots. So that's
the way to properly--that's one way of properly

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.280
coiling up a braided line.
