00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.000
That was a bad movie…

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.080
“The illegally parked bicycle was removed.”

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 Oh no!! I’m having such a bad day.

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.002
What…!

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.000
Such a boring road.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.000
You think? It’s pretty convenient, this ‘city sharing.’

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:52.000
This town is way too busy.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.080
Transporter 54!

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.000
Makito, let me drive!

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.000
What?

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.050
Let’s chase it!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.090
The legendary noodle soup stand?

00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:15.000
I finally found it! Please hang on to it!

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.000
So this is it,

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.000
 The noodle soup stand that everyone’s talking about even before the urban project of the transformable city was carried out.

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.000
The only way to taste it is to catch up with it.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.000
The running urban legend…I love that kind of thing!

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.000
The car is a running museum, no, a running endangered species!

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.000
Please catch up with it!

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.000
If not, today is going to end up in disaster.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(It is now 7PM. 7th and 10th avenue will begin its shifting.)

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.000
Oh no, the block shift has begun!

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.000
What?!

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.050
So what!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I won’t let it go!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
(Good job today!)

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:06.000
(For those worked hard. For your tomorrow. Try the Tsurukame Energy Drink!)

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.000
We didn’t make it…

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I’m sorry I got you involved in this strange thing.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.000
Huh?

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.000
Add a booster here… and a power limiter…

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:23.000
We’ll be able to obtain the M code information… his identify code is…

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.000
Umm…

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:38.000
Okay!

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:43.020
And the game begins!

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.000
"Dream Island  No Trespassing"

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Go for it!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We caught up with you, you freak museum!

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:03.000
I need to take a picture and upload this!

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:04.090
3 bowls of noodle soup!

00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:06.080
With boiled eggs!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I’m not giving up!

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:13.000
H, Hey…!

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.000
Who do you think I am!

00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.000
Wow!

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:18.000
Go!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Huh?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Noooo!

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:34.000
We’re going to die!

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:35.000
Hey guys.

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:36.000
Huh?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.000
I’m sorry I got you into all this.

00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:40.000
You’re saying that now?

00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:42.000
Well… let’s go.

00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:43.000
To wherever we can.

00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:45.000
Full speed as soon as we land!

00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:47.000
Step on the gas!

00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:48.000
Okay!

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:59.000
Go for it!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We made it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Welcome. What can I get you?

00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:39.000
Let’s dig in!

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.000
This is great…

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.000
This soup is delicous!

00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:52.000
Whoa, type M159, 6.2 liter V8 DOHC 32 valve?!

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.000
Thanks to you guys I’ll be able to have some great rice wine tonight. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
By the way

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.000
There is one thing I’m dying to eat along with some rice wine…

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.000
You guys haven’t heard of the legendary Tofu stand, have you?
