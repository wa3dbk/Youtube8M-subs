00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:12.249
There are several basic steps you need to master before you can command downhill skiing

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.345
bumps

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:23.029
steep passages

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.061
and powder skiing

00:00:40.026 --> 00:00:43.014
The most important movements

00:00:44.987 --> 00:00:46.505
are side

00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:48.951
to side

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.565
and up and down

00:00:56.948 --> 00:01:00.460
Basic movements for alpine skiing

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.673
To make a turn, you have to move from side to side

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:15.183
The movements make the skis edge in such a way that they carve a turn

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.868
Tip your feet and knees in the direction you wish to turn

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:35.002
With your skis edged, you will be able to stand firm throughout the turn

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:43.990
and then lean your body in the same direction as your feet and knees

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.908
The up-and-down movements help obtain a round turn

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:05.158
Use your ankle and knees to start the up-and-down movements

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:11.979
You begin your turn by moving upwards whereby you release the pressure from your skis

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:17.698
When your skis are directed towards the valley, you should begin the down movements

00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:23.752
This supplies pressure onto your skis and helps you to complete the turn

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:32.502
The more you apply pressure onto your skies while you are turning, the more they will turn

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:44.167
Skiing with rhythm and flow saves energy

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.056
Don't force your skis excessively like this skier

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:57.911
you will only use a lot of energy and then skiing becomes a hassle

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:04.572
Be patient before you initiate your next turn

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.739
Only when the skis start to turn

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.386
should you apply pressure from your body's weight so that your turn can be rounded and competed

00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:21.424
Try linking your turns

00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:25.896
as soon as you complete one turn, begin the next

00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.321
If you let your skis follow their natural curves

00:03:30.321 --> 00:03:34.222
you will achieve more elegant and effortless skiing

00:03:47.797 --> 00:03:53.985
You have to adjust yourself to changing terrain and speed by altering your movements

00:03:54.904 --> 00:03:57.987
When you find yourself going at a high speed

00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:03.432
you should keep a good distance between your skis and lower your body

00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:11.411
When you find yourself in irregular terrain

00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:17.271
keep close contact with the snow by letting your legs giving in to the bumps

00:04:19.532 --> 00:04:24.207
And in powder, you should let your movements more or lesst flow

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.994
By keeping your skis together, you won't sink into the deep snow
