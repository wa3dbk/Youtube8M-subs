00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:05.300
Hi everyone!

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.833
We continue to get experience in Team Battles.

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.967
Today we review playing from the bottom spawn on the map Mines.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:15.600
As usual, Slide from Na'Vi is giving this advice through me.

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:30.100
Fast tanks, tanks with good elevation angles and heavily armoured turrets set the pace on Mines.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:34.167
We are pretty low on the latter two stats with this setup.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:39.433
Since many teams tend to play with five heavies, we usually have more mobility.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.200
We'll start with this example.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.867
Let's say, the enemy has two tier 1s and five heavy tanks.

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:54.533
In this case we'll send the ninety to the hill and cover him with our IS-3. To do this, the ISs go to F4 right away and aim at E5.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.733
The AMX 50 100s stay hidden but close by.

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:02.267
We send the T1s to island in H1 and to the house in F8.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:04.533
Then we wait for the info from our scout.

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.800
The ninety spots several tanks in the centre.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200
In this situation there are three options for our next move.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:11.300
First.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600
The opponents have taken positions in the D5 region

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:18.300
and suddenly one of our heavies receives a shot from the island.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.267
This means at least one enemy tier 8 is near the water.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:24.867
We rush the centre at once, since we have an advantage in numbers.

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.900
Attacking 5 vs 4 and voila!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.967
Then finishing the last tier 8 isn't a problem.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:37.433
It's very important to keep in mind where the tank on the island can shoot and stay safe from it to keep it as a 5vs4.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.067
Second option.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:41.233
The enemies rush the centre.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.833
In this situation we hide the ninety in a safe place but still on the hill.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.767
This way, the scout stays in the game to distract the enemy.

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:56.000
If the enemy heavies go for the hill, then our heavies shoot their sides and counter-attack.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.167
The IS-3s absorb shells, the AMX 50 100s deal the damage and the ninety baits the enemy by shooting from the other side,

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.533
trying to make them turn their turrets towards him.

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:08.300
Good focus-firing and victory is ours.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.767
If the enemies rush the centre and bottom instead of the hill, then our ninety flanks them as soon as possible

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.633
and deals as much damage as he can.

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:24.000
We aim for the fuel tanks and set them on fire!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.833
It's important to keep the 50 100s behind the IS-3s so that they don't get killed at the very beginning of the enemy's attack.

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:34.800
Remember, each autoloader must unload at least one drum at the enemy.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:40.367
If all of your team does everything needed of them then the enemy has no chance.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:41.967
Option three.

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:44.600
The enemies took positions near their base.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.033
In this case we'll have to work up a sweat.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.567
A lot depends on our 13 90.

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:53.600
His task is to carefully scout and shoot when he can.

00:02:54.267 --> 00:03:02.567
Note the right way to do this -- our ninety drives in a path so that a rock is constantly between him and the potential enemy in A4.

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:07.267
From here he can shoot at C4 and a part of D5.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.900
By the way, even if you've spotted no one in the bush in C4, you should make several blind shots at it.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.433
To leave this position, go back the same way you did on the approach.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.633
While the ninety does its job on the hill, the IS-3s make use of their sturdy turrets in the centre.

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:28.967
Our team's task at this stage is to act as careful as possible and try to get an advantage in hit points.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.633
Don't forget to use the T1s.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.133
If you see that the enemy is entrenched -- push the flanks.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.467
We carefully send our scout to the island and cover it with a 50 100 from the centre.

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:44.367
The second T1 goes to the village covered by the ninety.

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:51.900
The T1's goal is to get closer to the enemy and passively spot, but first you need to get rid of the enemy tier 1s.

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:59.600
Thanks to this we are able to act freely and pin the enemy down since they will have no tripwires remaining on the flanks.

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:05.033
The ninety proxies the enemies near the hill and the 100s detour through the village.

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.533
We stay close to the right side to stay unspotted for as long as possible.

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:11.233
We wait for the right moment and unload our drums.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:16.300
As soon as the enemies turn their attention to the 100s -- we push upon them with our IS-3s.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.267
The main thing to remember is to hide the 100s until the right moment and, as usual, focus your fire.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.033
But, sending tanks through the village is quite risky.

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:29.700
It's more reliable to attack with all the heavies through the centre.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.467
However it all depends on the situation.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.667
For example:

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:39.300
4 enemy heavies in D5 and another one in the bushes in C4.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.767
Our ninety shoots at it.

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.233
Meanwhile the IS-3s absorb shots with their turrets.

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:50.667
We already have an advantage and we can play with a simple plan: rush the centre!

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:53.233
The ISs go first, the 100s follow.

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:57.200
The ninety continues to control the heavy in C4.

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:00.100
An aggressive attack and the battle is won.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.267
If the enemy have TDs, you should play in a similar style but you need to be even more careful.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.733
One good shot from a TD can mess things up.

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:14.067
We scout with the ninety, bait shots with the IS-3s, whilst keeping the 100s safe.

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:16.900
We shoot at the bushes in A4 from time to time.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.400
The TD is most likely behind this rock.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.767
So shoot at both of its sides.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.867
There's no need to hurry.

00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:26.467
It's important to get an advantage in HP.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.433
It will be hard to have a successful attack without one.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.400
As for the rest -- we act similar to the other situations.

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:39.733
Loosen the defence, press the flanks with the T1s, wait for the right moment and attack.

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:43.567
What to do if the enemy setup is as fast as ours?

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.667
This is a tough question.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.567
If the enemy has ONE fast tank then we can challenge the hill but in most cases the enemy light tank will be there before ours.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.600
The road is better from the northern base.

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:01.267
The IS-3s will try to help the ninety by shooting from F4.

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:03.833
Then we play from the central rock.

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:06.000
The 100s cover the ISs as usual.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.167
In this case, much depends on the personal skill of the tankers.

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:13.633
There is no guaranteed way of winning.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.600
Another way is to play defensively.

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:21.333
It is especially good if the enemy has several fast tanks and not just one.

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:24.167
We place the T1 in a bush in F8.

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:27.333
Another one goes under the hill in G6.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.233
The ninety goes to the island in H1 and one of the 100s to K4.

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:37.767
The other one along with an IS-3 stays near the base and the other IS-3 goes to F5.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.300
The T1s scout the approach to the hill from the village.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.533
One of the IS-3s scouts the centre.

00:06:44.633 --> 00:06:48.700
The ninety controls the island and can shoot at E5 if needed.

00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:52.400
One of the 100s aims here too.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.367
The other one aims at the hill.

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:58.167
The IS-3 from J7 is ready to shoot at the village.

00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:03.967
The main thing here is to stay alert and not to turn your turrets, keep aiming at the needed spots and wait.

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:09.200
We have given away the hill to the faster enemy but we fully control the approaches to our base.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.367
Our goal is to catch the enemy on a mistake.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.500
One careless peek from an enemy tank and we have an tier 8 gun advantage.

00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:21.000
As you know, winning such a battle isn't hard.

00:07:21.133 --> 00:07:25.533
We proceed to attack and capture the hill using our extra gun to our advantage.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.467
Sometimes in order to win you have to let your enemy feel in control for a while.

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:34.633
Not everyone has the patience to do this but you will need to be able to.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.733
That's all for today.

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:38.667
Next time we'll review playing from the north spawn.

00:07:38.767 --> 00:07:42.267

00:07:42.367 --> 00:07:43.767
See you!
