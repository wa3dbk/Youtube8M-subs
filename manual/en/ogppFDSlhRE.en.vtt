00:00:26.124 --> 00:00:33.249
In the wavering image.

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:41.124
Our wish is eternally endless.

00:00:54.853 --> 00:01:01.730
Before I realized it, I abandoned happiness in order to live.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.918
By lying, I was clinging and dancing on a mere illusion.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.358
At the edge of my sight of having my eyes closed.

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:21.232
I was searching for your smiling face.

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:35.609
We embrace our dreams and run through the wavering image, that's right.

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:49.765
I'll grip this thought that I've kept shut in my chest since some other day again now.

00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:11.290
The warriors flocked together and finished fighting tonight too.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.352
How many ages will we overcome before we find the truth?

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:24.855
Continuing across the distant sky.

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:30.730
An unfinished dream is weeping.

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:38.432
In the wavering image.

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:45.180
Our wish is eternally endless, that's right.

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:52.262
I'll wipe away my many spilling tears.

00:02:52.262 --> 00:02:58.950
And go aim for tomorrow.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.490
Words that I couldn't say on some other day.

00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:26.546
I want to present them to you today.

00:03:27.264 --> 00:03:41.015
While we're still guided by the wavering image, letâ€™s run through it.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:54.970
That's right! I'll grip this thought that I've kept shut in my chest since some other day again now.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.910
In the blinding era.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.350
Surely we'll walk from now on too, right?
