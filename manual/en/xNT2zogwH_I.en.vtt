00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.650
What's up guys, I'm Tim Gettys.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm here with world series champion, kind
of funny family,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.240
and Mortal Kombat super fan, Hunter Pence.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.330
&gt;&gt; That's me.
What's up?

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.970
&gt;&gt; So we just got to play some Mortal
Kombat X.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.490
Does it feel like Mortal Kombat?

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.040
&gt;&gt; I mean, what a question.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.010
It is Mortal Kombat.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.049
It's Mortal Kombat X.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.250
It's pretty rad to,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.710
to jump into all the characters from you
know, my youth that I grew up with.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.090
You know the ones that they've announced.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.900
There's, there's a lot of them.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.525
There's some new ones, which is cool too,
to throw a new twist.

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:30.570
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.039
&gt;&gt; But to jump into Scorpion Sub Zero.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.260
You know, to see the daughter of Johnny
Cage and Sonya Blade, it's, it's just a-

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.120
&gt;&gt; Cassie Cage.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.025
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Cassie Cage.

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:42.030
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; But it's the daughter them two,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.880
so, it's, it's pretty crazy, and, it
definitely feels it's got the blood,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.295
it's got the gore that you remember as a
kid, and kind of on a whole new level.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:49.810
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.290
So, her specifically, she actually has
different fighting styles, and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.790
all of the characters have.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.280
The body style variation.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.050
So on the character select screen, you can
choose.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Between three variations.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.600
And it's not.
They don't all have

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.610
the standard of things.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.930
Where it's not just the, the defensive or
offensive or whatever.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.260
Each character has things that are
tailored to them.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.485
And Cassie specifically has one.

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:09.365
That's a little more Sonya, or one that's
a little more Johnny Cage, or

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:10.560
one that's a little more in, in between.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.165
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; What did you think

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:13.575
about the different variations for the
characters you play?

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:18.255
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, that's that a pretty you,
the unique dynamic to add.

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:20.505
You know, because a lot of times you fall
in love with the character,

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:24.735
you're like I love you know, Scorpio or I
love Sub Zero or I love you know for

00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:26.599
me, Kabal, which hasn't been announced
yet.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.040
and, and you run into like this horrible
counter.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.290
Ugh, I have to do one as a zoner, I can't
do anything.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.250
Or if anyone's in your face, you can't do
anything.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.850
Well now, each character has 3 different
styles.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.150
So say, if one spell is weaker against,
you know, say a zoner or

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.490
someone's weaker upfront.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.310
Or you want to be fast, or you want to be
powerful, or whatever the case may be.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.220
They all have 3 different things, so.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.420
It allows your mind more creativity, and
it allows you to really love your

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.455
character and to, to learn, and, and I
guess just go in.

00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:55.650
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; With as much as you can, and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.210
it also makes it where you can keep it
fresh.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.385
And you can keep it fresh with everyone,
so I think.

00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:02.535
More options make the game more fun, and

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:06.205
this is a really cool thing that they've
put in to this Mortal Combat X.

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:09.085
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and another option you got to do
was the game mode called Living Towers,

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:10.825
which is the new challenge mode of this
game.

00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:13.007
Where you kind of go up the tower, and
there's the three different ones.

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.627
There's the quick, which is kind of you
got to do.

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:17.697
And then there's the daily ones, which are
new ones everyday.

00:02:17.697 --> 00:02:19.767
And then there's the premier ones, which
are more themed.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:22.397
So it'll be like holiday specific ones or

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:24.557
based on specific Mortal Kombat events and
all that stuff.

00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:26.207
We did a little bit of the daily
challenges.

00:02:26.207 --> 00:02:27.727
What do you think about that?

00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:28.947
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I, it's, it's definitely new and

00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:31.567
I think anyone that's played Mortal Kombat
from, from back in the day,

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:32.577
you remember the towers.

00:02:32.577 --> 00:02:34.070
You remember working your way up.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.670
And you know, me personally, I, I spend a
lot of times on airplanes and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.520
on my Vita doing the same tower over, and
over again.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.590
So now there's, there's different towers.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.020
I didn't get to get too it,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.650
but there is, they are throwing different
challenges at you.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You're like, you know,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.840
you're running through the matches with
like bombs being dropped and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.370
it could hit anybody, or lasers going
across the screen.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.060
So.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.020
They've thrown some curve balls that we
haven't seen before.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.730
They give you a lot of opportunities to
find the way that you enjoy the game and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.280
a, I think it's definitely like a cool
addition to, a, to Mortal Kombat.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.510
&gt;&gt; The coolest thing I think we saw today
was the Faction War.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.630
Which is this new thing where it's online
and its ever present between,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.550
no matter what version your playing, or
which console and that's a.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.210
And you play, you choose one of the five
factions and everything you do,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.000
whether it's single player or online kind
of feeds into this point system and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.160
helps the, the different factions based on
the families and stuff in the game win.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.010
What did you think about that?

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so to me, I think a lot of people
and, and I've always loved fighting games.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.340
And I think most games one of the coolest
things beyond, just like

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.530
making yourself a better player and
enjoying the skill and the competition.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.650
It feels good to be playing and earning
something.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.750
It feels good you know, to be building up,
whatever status and

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.030
to have whatever icon or to, to just have
a cause behind it other than just,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.030
you know, increasing your skill or beating
someone.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.610
That's just for you.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.460
So, with this it allows team matches.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.980
It allows you to like create friends
throughout your factions.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.670
Like hey, let's go out, let's challenge
this faction.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.520
They have a couple unique concepts with
that in, in, in store, and you're, you're,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.990
as you're playing your games and you're
enjoying, you know, playing and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.130
getting better and having your fun, you're
also, you know, you feel like

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.280
you're gaining something.&gt;&gt;Yeah&gt;&gt;So, I
think that that is, is, a special.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.830
Addition to this game as well.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.280
That just kind of gives you more
gratification to, to winning,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.760
to playing and win, lose or draw like when
you're going in you're gaining something.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.670
So you feel better as you're playing.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you feel really rewarded.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.660
I like that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.390
it's cool too that it's single player or
multiplayer.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You can do team battles with your

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.340
friends where there's like five on five
men.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.600
Where it's five one on one matches
happening at the same time.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And it's close to [INAUDIBLE] stuff,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.950
that's pretty cool.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.560
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.730
And, and I look forward to seeing like
what you're gonna be gaining.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.830
Cuz we didn't really get into the details
about that.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.355
But to me.
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:39.690
&gt;&gt; I think yeah,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.990
however you like to play the game you're
gonna helping your faction,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.135
you're gonna be gaining points.

00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:44.300
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And you know,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.460
ultimately making yourself sweet while
you're playing.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Thanks a lot.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.960
&gt;&gt; Alright.
Thank you Tim.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.480
