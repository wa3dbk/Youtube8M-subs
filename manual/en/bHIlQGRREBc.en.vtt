00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.521
I’m Magdalena, I’m an international student and I came from Poland

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:09.397
I am a final year student; I’m doing the LLB International Law

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.413
I decided to choose Kingston because I wanted to study international law at an undergraduate level

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:24.539
The second reason is the fact that Kingston has a lot of international students with different backgrounds,

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:28.084
different religions and different cultures from around the world

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.799
And I wanted to experience something new and meet a lot of new people

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:39.168
Since I’m doing LLB International Law I covered all core LLB modules

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.086
Such as Criminal Law, Equity, Land Law, Legal Systems and Methods

00:00:45.448 --> 00:00:51.192
But because it is international law as well I was doing German as a second language

00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:58.865
International Criminal Law, Public International Law, Comparative Legal Systems, European Union Law

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:05.740
I really like my course, as I said because it is more concentrated on international law and international issues

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:11.637
Which is really important nowadays, in my opinion

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:17.834
And in terms of extracurricular activities I am a member of different societies and clubs

00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:22.283
I am a member of the United Nations Society which is very active

00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:29.756
We went to France last year for a conference about breach of human rights the Middle East

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:36.503
I’m a part of the EGIS Society, they are organising a lot of actions against genocide

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:40.692
I’m also working as a Student Ambassador as well

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:44.368
We are employed by the UK Marketing team to promote higher education

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:49.348
Which helped me develop different skills and obviously improve my CV

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.322
I’m a member of the Dance Society as well

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.759
And as I said before I love the fact that Kingston is very international

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:04.663
so I could meet people from all around the world and learn about new cultures and new religions and different themes.

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:10.350
My dream is to work for the United Nations, especially Unicef

00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:18.836
But I would love to work for anything connected to the European Union, or any international law firm

00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:26.304
I would love to go abroad after this year for an Erasmus exchange, maybe to Germany, maybe to Switzerland

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:31.700
And then I was thinking about doing my Masters

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:37.510
And then maybe LPC, Legal Practice Course, and then training contract

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:39.825
And then hopefully qualifying as a solicitor

00:02:40.972 --> 00:02:43.660
I would recommend Kingston because

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:52.555
It has loads of international students and so I think it is a great benefit that you can meet people from all around the world

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:58.100
As I said with different beliefs, different opinions, from different backgrounds

00:02:58.973 --> 00:03:03.228
And Kingston offers a lot of extracurricular activities

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.787
You can work here; you can get a part-time job

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:12.349
Like the Kingston Employability Service offers a lot of help

00:03:13.573 --> 00:03:15.260
Loads of clubs, sports clubs

00:03:16.992 --> 00:03:23.804
And I think that the great benefit is the fact that Kingston is close to Central London

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:34.394
so if you want to get work experience or go to clubs, or to any concerts it is only twenty minutes from here
