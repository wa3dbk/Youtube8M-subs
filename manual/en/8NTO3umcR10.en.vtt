00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:08.319
 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.670
 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.830
 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.770
 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.560
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.140
 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.150
 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.870
 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.850
 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.850
Painting reflections isn't exactly
easy,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.649
but it's no rocket science either. You
just have to observe a few ground rules.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.089
For example: the reflection is always a
shade darker than the original.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.900
 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.750
 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.530
I begin by drawing the outline of the
clouds on top of the underpainting

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.530
I then fill in the shape of the clouds

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.780
with the white yellow color. I use a
spalter

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.400
a flat broad hog hair brush which is
very suitable for applying these kinds

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.840
of large surfaces

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.710
where details are not important jet.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.760
This painting displays backlight.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.230
A characteristic of backlight is that,
combined with a large water surface,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.270
it presents the most fantastic sparkles.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.060
Millions of little waves all act as
little mirrors

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.170
and each one of them reflets the sun.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.170
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.689
 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.929
This one of the best parts of painting:
applying the highlights

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.940
With only a few touches you can
sometimes bring a painting to life.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.549
Here I'm trying to paint the ripple of
the water

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.090
with a mixture of titanium white and
Naples yellow.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.090
I added quite a lot of Liquin to
make the paint easy to handle.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.120
I apply

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.879
parts with a hard hand brush making the
direction on the stroke perfectly

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:41.879
visible

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.340
my

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.860
afterwards placing a horizontal stroke
with a badge in brush

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.019
it creates the suggestion a reflection

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.860
both vertical and the reflection in the
horizontal the water's surface I

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.430
displayed

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.599
I still feel as if something is missing.
I decide to do something that will

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.110
probably drastically change the
character that painting.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.760
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.950
A kite...

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.430
 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.640
 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.900
Using short horizontal touches

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.910
I suggest the movement of the water. The
shape will be less taut

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.380
and the transition with the surrounding
becomes more blurred.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.310
All rules for painting reflections will
return here.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.620
Looking at it from a distance I am
surprised by the result.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.680
All over sudden there is much more
unity in the painting.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.609
the bright colors of the kite make a
beautiful contrast with the blue colors,

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:08.980
thus also enhancing the light. I have been
struggling for days to get on with the

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.590
painting

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.170
and it was solved within less than 30
minutes.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.239
This once again shows

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.239
that everything will turn out fine if
you just keep painting.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.760
 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.470
 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.610
 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.629
 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.939
