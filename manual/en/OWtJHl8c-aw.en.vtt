Hi. Thank you for visiting Coastal Custom
Wine Cellars California. My name is Jerry

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.050
Wilson and I'm going to take you on a short
tour today on our wine cellar design processes

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.340
and actual projects that we have recently
completed in southern California. Actually

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.560
it is in Coto De Caza.
This gentleman has a closet are underneath

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.560
the stairway, we demolished the wall, we insulated
it and we sealed it. We put up the moisture

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.600
proof dry wall and in this photo that I am
sharing with you we just wrapped up the painting,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.600
and in some subsequent pictures, we replaced
the doors with full dual plane glass view.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.350
We put in Napa Valley Oak Barrel flooring
which is quite beautiful and made an incredible

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.829
statement for such a small area.
Now let us take a look on the wine cellar

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.320
design California, as I've mentioned these
are complementary, there are multiple pages

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.800
including the plan view which you're looking
at and we will also look into elevations and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.079
3D wine cellar design visuals. The total bottle
capacity although in a small room we did managed

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.180
to get 329 bottles storage.
Elevation A is directly across from the entry

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.350
and there's a diamond bin storage here for
bulk configuration or storage I should say

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.539
just above that is a single bottle storage
openings which is called a high reveal display

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:23.340
row. The high reveal display row is actually
laminated by some soft LED ribbon lights as

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.149
well.
The right side wine rack is not of full height

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.679
like the others are because of the stairwell
and making it sloped and it's turned down

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.079
in this particular area but we were able to
create this rack with the table top so he

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.329
could set things down or even open a bottle
of wine in the cellar if he wanted to. We

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.299
have some wood case storage openings and that
is what these icons are representing the wooden

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.840
cases.
The left side wall as you enter, we have quarter

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.759
round display shelves on the far left. At
the top here this the wooden louvered grill

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.759
covers that will conceal the fan coil. Label
horizontal displays and some more bulk storage.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.729
We will take a look on some 3D wine cellar
design California visuals, overhead view.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:19.329
All in all it is a nice design considering
the limited space that we have to work with.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.129
Here is the picture of the wine storage that
once it was installed we have the wooden flooring

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.129
down here and the door turned out really quite
nice and in this we are standing in the gentleman's

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.629
office peering into the storage area which
is now a beautiful custom wine cellars California.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:44.340
This is a mahogany stained or kind of like
a cherry stained door if you will an operable

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.599
wrought iron detail, operable means that the
wrought iron is on a hinge and you can open

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.950
it for cleaning purposes.
All in all it was a fun project to work with

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.489
and we would certainly help you design and
put forward your projects if you have one,

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.489
