Hi. My name is Derek Tarnow, I've been playing
guitar for twelve years and I teach and perform.

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.249
In this clip, I'm going to talk about selecting
guitar strings. The first thing to decide

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.730
when selecting guitar strings is, you know,
what guitar you're selecting guitar strings

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.289
for. I got out a couple of different kinds
of guitars here. Just to show that, you know,

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.009
hey, there are different kinds of guitars
and they all need different strings. What

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.880
I'm holding is a classic guitar. It needs
a nylon strings. A safe bet, when you're buying

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.320
strings for just about any guitar is D'Addario.
They make at you know, least decent strings

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.900
to the best strings for whatever the guitar
you're going to restring. What I have on here

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.420
now are actually the D'Addario Pro-Arte Classical
Guitar Strings. Because it's a classical guitar.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:02.290
Over here I have my strap for my electrical
guitar. On this guitar I like to, to just

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:10.399
play just the regular D'Addario strings for
electric guitars. Over here, I have a hollow

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:17.930
body. On this guitar, I like to use Flat Wounds,
but that's total a preference thing. Flat

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.130
Wound strings on most guitars like, like your
strats or your acoustic guitars you have Round

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.229
Wound Strings. On the Flat Wound Strings,
the wrapping or the around the strings is

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:38.409
flattened to reduce the fret noise. But again,
on this guitar, I just have the D'Addario

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.340
chromes which is just their flat wound series
of strings. On my acoustic, I don't play acoustic

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.719
very often, so I don't. I'm not too picky
about strings on that. I think for right now

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.859
actually just Martin Strings on it because
it's a Martin Guitar. It doesn't really matter.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:01.929
You don't have to match your guitar with your
strings at all. In fact, it's usually not

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.930
a good idea. Also an important thing to consider
when you're choosing guitar strings is, maybe

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.050
you're playing ability. If you are a beginning
student, you might want to start with a lighter

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.830
gage string. If you're younger, maybe some
eights. If you're a little older like, like

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.920
by older like late middle school, really high
school, get some nine gage strings. Your hands

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.220
can usually handle it. Also, what kind of
style you're playing. Bluesier guitar players

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.390
like to play on a little heavier strings then
metal players. Metal players on really light

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.261
gage strings. Because they get that really
shrieky, streaking sound that they go for.

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:48.570
Anyway, if you have any questions about guitar
strings. Generally when you go to a guitar

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.920
music shop, there would be someone there that
would know what they're talking about, to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.730
help you out and to help you choose a set
of strings that would get you by. Also, don't

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.130
be afraid to experiment and try new strings
because that's really the only way that you're

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.780
going to find out what strings you like or
don't like and why. And that is an important

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.800
thing to know.
