Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen, and in this segment
we're going to talk about how to repel flies

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.650
naturally. Now flies have been around for
longer than humans and they'll probably be

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.140
around even longer than us. So when it comes
to insects and bugs and animals, my theory

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.680
is you don't ever want to kill them because
they deserve to be here just as much as we

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.270
do. But we need to set boundaries for them
and control their actions. So the first thing

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.640
that you can do to repel flies is to make
sure that the inside of your house is totally

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.411
closed off from any holes or any access to
where the flies can get in the house. So make

00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:42.100
sure you have screens on all of your windows,
make sure you have screen doors. Make sure

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.350
there's no gaps where the cable comes into
the house. Make sure that you don't leave

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.500
fresh fruit outside in the kitchen in the
heat of the summer when there's lots of flies.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.050
Make sure that you cover things up. Make sure
that you don't leave any honey out or you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.180
make sure that there's no food or water left
out. 'Cause flies need food and water to survive

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.549
and that's what they're looking for. And the
easy way to repel them is by making sure that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.979
they have no reason to come into the house.
And if you're outside, and they're around,

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.149
there's different things that you can do that
will help. For example, flies don't like the

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.689
scent of mint or the scent of thyme or rosemary
or lavender or cayenne pepper or any herb

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.859
that's really strong. So if you've got flies
around the house whether you cover yourself

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:40.569
with some lavender oil or you spray some lavender
around the house or vinegar or thyme or rosemary

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:47.249
or garlic, any of the heavy spices will repel
the flies. Saying that, there's no foolproof

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:52.609
way to control them in the end. There's lots
of tricks - people hang up paper with some

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:58.680
honey or some syrup on it, and they collect
the flies and dispose of them that way. If

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.310
you had no holes between the inside and the
outside, the flies won't come in, and when

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.599
you're outside, eating dinner, you have a
nice deck area where the flies are a problem,

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:13.320
a lot of times just putting a netting around
it can control it or as I said, putting some

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.480
lavender oil on yourself or sprinkling around
some rosemary, all of it helps, but there's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.710
really no way to get rid of them completely.
