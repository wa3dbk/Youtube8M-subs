00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi, my name's Brian.  Today we're going to be adding "add a leaf" or "add a spring" shocks to a Jeep Commander.
so

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.910
happily

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.079
perhaps print shop students g

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.049
two thousand seven

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.650
It's a little bit "squishy"

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.509
understands

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.140
The owner's done some homework online and found these specific details about this shock.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.330
Monroe load

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.910
adjusting shock absorbers

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.180
commanders are like brian said notoriously squishy in the back end when you put a load on

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.820
them

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.710
and these monroe

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.720
loader testing shocks are guaranteed not
to sac up to just over a thousand pounds

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.810
of love

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.330
so pretty impressive

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.510
and their valve so that when you don't
have a load

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.880
they ride bike there or young when do
you have a road

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.440
they automatically to us

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.140
and stiff mature the rear end of your
vehicle

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.039
which makes it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.690
more comfortable and more importantly
safer all traveling down the highway so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.690
basically we're not street pieces

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.640
sourcebook but the shock so they could
be a really difficult installation of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.600
the commute date-rape easy installation
of the parkway first

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.860
parkway looks like this that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.100
compresses suspension

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.000
the one who put that tupelo digesting
type of justice oxalic

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.250
the point that they're sticking woody
allen

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.690
hold back tears

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.840
kasinga's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.230
instead he suggested push it up in the
place to them

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.800
it'd it'd be working with the priority
here in this spring

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.780
villages

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.900
all of this is going to be fighting

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.490
t_b_s_ illicit hayek

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580
somewhere desert back

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.270
addresses the issue of happy about the
white gloves of breaking television

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.360
audiences are relieved because the job
of keeping up by the way

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.570
whitewhales

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.909
supported by the frame in for the pics
control arms of default control or

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.790
forward

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.149
there's little boxes and then the frame

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.239
it's double later that's where we have
those and then we had jackets up a

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.719
little bit because the way we haven't
mail as you'll see in the near future

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.569
um... the sharks will be right exactly

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.000
the really need to be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.349
was also good

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.479
so out of fifty millimeter socket

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.029
for forty millimeter richard could be
half inch or whatever

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.149
you know that

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.619
basically put on the fifteen billion
turk

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:39.639
capitalists

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.189
let's just get this

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.659
that's where your reactions in spoke the
rich here

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.129
was bought out the rest of the way

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.689
that it's a really cheesy stick

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.959
starting to see that it's just that

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.909
right just the right decision

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.049
work back axles they need to have been
supportive

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.449
late criteria needed

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:06.540
visa said earlier these are also looked
at the height of just erase the back

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.180
into the vehicle up just a little bit
get that kind of uh...

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.950
alike records as a whole lot of muscle
of the best paperwork to

of

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.430
also known as rick

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.869
dave says its rate

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.449
will to smile weblog

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.489
below that

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.900
understand stallings shots

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.949
picture it's it's worth it

just reach in there

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:38.899
ended supported from the back
synergistic reversal

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:40.939
injured are

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.029
support the shop with one hand

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.049
portable that with the other

put it up inside there

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.029
in place

go ahead and start this bolt by hand
just a little bit this makes you get

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.229
your three thread started

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.139
if you cross the river by putting a bolt
intricate

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.089
this easy jobs can you get a lot harder
real quick

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:28.550
started with a few threats as you go to
work this in dave had a question as you

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.160

below street bolton this'll be spent in
fast in a little slow down the middle

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.639
stopping vibrate

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.169
as soon as it starts to stopping by

really strong really small for that

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.659
over the past that you get this is the
right track by jacking up the frame

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.930
and in supporting the rear axle

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.639
walks this

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.960
be jealous
