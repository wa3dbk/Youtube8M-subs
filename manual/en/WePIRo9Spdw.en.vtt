00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.160
As nations around the world begin to
adopt green building initiatives

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.820
BuildBlock Insulating Concrete Forms
offer substantial benefits over concrete

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.880
block construction. Using BuildBlock ICFs
instead of concrete blocks will decrease

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
many construction costs, reduce the
overall job completion time,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.340
increase the safety of the construction
process, and lower ongoing operating expenses.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.320
The most significant way in which ICF's
reduce construction cost is by reducing

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.120
the overall construction time and labor.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.879
This allows you to lease or occupy the
structure sooner increasing the rate of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.579
return on your investment both short and
long term. One BuildBlock ICF is 16

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.980
inches tall and 48 inches long.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.820
The wall area of a single ICF form
equates to six standard concrete masonry units.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.600
Just as important, the features of an ICF
form eliminate the need for several

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.330
products and construction steps which
are required in concrete block

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.300
construction. The strong interlocking
connection grid makes stacking ICFs fast and easy.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.979
This eliminates the time consuming
practice of mortaring between concrete

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.130
blocks and reduces the number of skilled
masonry laborers required. The molded in

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.140
web securely lock in place two number
five rebar virtually eliminating the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.200
time consuming process of tying steal.
The webs also serve as furring strips

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.369
for interior and exterior finishes
eliminating the additional step of

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.780
adding furring strips as required with
concrete block. These furring strips

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.770
include hardpoints with a pullout
strength of about 500 pounds and are

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.740
easily identified by molded-in markings
on both sides of the form. The EPS panels

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.940
stay in place

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.050
creating permanent installation and
ready to finish surface for brick, siding,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.520
EFFs or stucco. This stable substrate
eliminates the common problem of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.440
stair-step cracking in the stucco finish.
The molded in number cut lines located

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.770
on both sides of the ICF save installers
valuable time. Cutting an ICF is quick

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.110
and easy to do with a simple hand saw.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.230
Compare that to the grueling process of
cutting concrete block.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.540
Not only does the lightweight nature of
ICF's make them faster to work with, it

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.629
also creates a much safer environment
for workers.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.709
This will result in fewer job site
related injuries and lower workers

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.740
compensation premiums.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.150
To further expedite the construction
process additional types of ICF forms

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.620
are available including 90 and 45 degree
corner, brick ledge, and double taper top forms.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.240
ICF walls can be engineered to bear
substantially greater loads than

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.080
concrete block walls vertically and
horizontally. The ICF walls can actually

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.620
be engineered to share the load that
would otherwise rest solely on large

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.200
steel or concrete columns. Also elevator
shafts and walls located under

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.420
escalators can be formed with ICFs. It's
easy to see how these many features

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.340
reduce construction time when compared
to concrete blocks. Faster, easier

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.010
construction time means fewer skilled
laborers, fewer overall labor hours, less

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.560
construction loan interest, and faster
occupancy. These significant areas of

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.880
savings help to mitigate the cost of
using this state-of-the-art construction

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.410
technology. The construction advantages
of ICF technology are only the beginning.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.480
The finished ICF structure is highly
energy-efficient, remarkably comfortable,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.000
quiet, and very safe.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.170
EPS has an R value of approximately R-4
per inch.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.040
When combined with the thermal mass of
the concrete and a significant reduction

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.960
in air infiltration.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.890
This can result in a performance R-value of R-30 to R-50.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.640
This built in energy efficiency
significantly reduces annual energy

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.960
costs when compared to concrete block
structures. Providing substantial savings

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.150
over the life of the building. The mass
of the insulated concrete walls also

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.620
serves to create a quiet comfortable
interior for occupants. Internal

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.350
temperatures are more stable and
uniform.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.630
ICF walls are an excellent choice for
the construction of theaters. An 8-inch

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.730
ICF wall has an STC of 53 without the
need for additional sound mitigation

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.470
materials or methods.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.820
ICF walls are significantly stronger
than those built with concrete blocks.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.710
ICF structures are proven to be highly
resistant to tornadoes, hurricanes,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.400
earthquakes, and fire, providing safety
and peace of mind for occupants.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.000
Around the globe

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.440
ICF construction technology is changing
the way the world builds.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.270
Now is the time to partner with BuildBlock Building Systems. Build it once,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.080
build it for life with BuildBlock.
