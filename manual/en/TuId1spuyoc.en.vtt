00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.090
Let's add 4/11 to 9/13.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.210
So in order to add
these two fractions,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.965
we need to find a
common denominator.

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:11.340
And that common
denominator needs

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.610
to be the least common
multiple of 11 and 13.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.520
And these 2 numbers, they
don't share any common factors.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.520
So their least common
multiple is literally just

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.470
going to be the
product of 11 and 13.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.440
So we could say 13 times 11.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.374
13 times 1 is 13.

00:00:29.374 --> 00:00:35.250
13 times another 1 is 13, or you
could say 13 times 10 is 130.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.410
And we get 3, 4, 1-- 143.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.746
So that's going to be
our common denominator.

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:42.870
So I'll write it over here.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.870
So something over 143 plus
something else over 143.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.160
And to go from 4/11
to something over 143,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.060
we multiplied the
11 times 13, or we

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.930
multiplied the
denominator times 13.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.270
So we're going have to multiply
the numerator times 13,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.250
as well.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.100
And 4 times 13, let's see.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.714
4 times 10 is 40.

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:06.310
4 times 3 is 12.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.430
So it gives us 52.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.230
And you can work that
out by hand if you like.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.480
4 times 13 is 52.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.110
And then to go from 13 to
143, we multiplied by 11.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.990
So if we multiplied
the denominator by 11,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.198
if we don't want to change
the value of the fraction,

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:24.490
we have to multiply
the numerator by 11.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.206
9 times 11 is 99.

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:28.330
And now we're ready to add.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.800
This is equal to our
common denominator is 143.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.900
And 52 plus 99-- 52
plus 100 would be 152,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.640
and this is going to
be 1 less than that.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.980
So it's going to be 151.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.620
And I think that's about as
simplified as we can get.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.290
As far as I know,
it doesn't look

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.600
like there are any common
factors between 151 and 143.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.560
So we just get 151/143.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.910
We can write this
as a mixed number

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.560
because 143 goes
into 151 one time.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.180
1 times 143 is 143.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.130
When you subtract, let's see.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.630
This can become an 11.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.730
This is a 4.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.310
11 minus 3 is 8.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.780
You have a remainder of 8.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.020
So this is the same thing.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.740
151/143 is the same
thing as 1 and 8/143.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.420
And now it becomes
even more clear

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.460
that these can't be
simplified anymore.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.270
And we are done.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.820
This is the same thing as
1-- I'll write the 1 a little

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.133
bit bigger-- 1 and 8/143.
