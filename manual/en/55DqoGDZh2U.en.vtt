00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.559
alabama all this state employees um...

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.569
have to pay twenty five dollars a month

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:11.980
standard for what's happening

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.639
they're given a one-year to get in shape

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.310
if they're not a ship within a year and
you know that this is state employees

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.630
only of will get free health care right

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.500
if they don't shape up they have to pay
twenty five dollars a month

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.999
and arab and i know this program is a
second fascist state

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.349
let's go to united states right out
there three percent are all be slightly

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.309
overweight obese than real life

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.540
and they don't eat well

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.800
no i don't have that statement cities
cellular since the trend is going on

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.670
whether i would go with text

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.080
and i the specific tax is too large

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.350
and set off certain foreigners liberal
city tour

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.180
design

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.790
of date now unless extent on it was the
best city

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.700
but now uh... on this story uh... this
is not something that i don't want

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.040
americans about you have you have indeed
it was so i wanted to have an brick date

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.780
now you treasure being fat

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.150
uh... i really really disagree with this

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.230
look idec that you think originally more
healthy

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.850
that saves money for them and for the
company and plus if less than live

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.160
longer i get all that

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.930
but given incentive

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.369
that to get healthy

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.100
and give them money which is how by the
way most states do it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.939
and not something to that was some
companies to it that way but would you

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.000
penalize people for how they look

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.510
work that's over the perception of
people out

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.870
meant that doesn't sit right with a lot
of folks that doesn't right with me

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.230
and by the way also remember that at
this point the genetic some people

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.180
really can do anything about it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.090
and now you get the chechen twenty five
bucks a month up a blessing you know

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.970
this way they were in fact they are
pretty bad shape because of that an

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.510
a_b_c_ from across the face with a
twenty five dollar pat surcharge

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.649
okay

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.780
make a lot

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.450
a by the way it quitting their standards
are denied the charge twenty five months

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.819
important would i be it's about time you
definitely

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.770
you all for the backbone body mass in
the republics

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.479
