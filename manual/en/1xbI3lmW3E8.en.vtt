00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.720
What is your vision for the display industry
and how does NEC Display Solutions impact

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.620
that vision?
Displays are windows into information and

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.220
the industry is really at a point of breakthrough
and understanding what that means and how

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.030
content can be brought to life - how we evolve
from let's say static into more of a digital

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.969
content environment. And what's interesting
is that the display in and of itself is not

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.070
new into the marketplace, it's been around
for quite a while, but the technology and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.310
the software and the way that the display
is being used is really at a point of breakthrough.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.860
We are seeing new progression being made and
how content is being brought to life and how

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.940
companies are creating more of an experiential
environment by using displays and using the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.920
solutions to engage consumers or engage those
that are interested in what's being brought

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.490
into the marketplace.
NEC is at a point where we provide a lot of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.340
the technology and a lot of the solutions
both from a hardware and software perspective

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.890
into the market that enables this creativity
to take place. We bring a wide variety of

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.810
channel partners as well as ecosystem partners
to help meet the specific needs or the unique

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.270
needs that each vertical may have, each customer
may have in driving their business and really

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.600
bringing their brand into the marketplace.
To what extent are you nurturing existing

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.330
and new markets and what do channel partners
play in your strategy?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.810
Existing markets are very important both from
a local perspective and a global perspective

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.299
and we continue to leverage resources that
we have around R and D to innovate the technology,

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.490
to improve the technologies that are in those
spaces. But we also are focused on creating

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.909
new markets in the global market, in the global
arena - those verticals that maybe have not

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:08.049
had a chance to really leverage the capabilities
of displays and of solutions - we can now

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.910
help them to understand and to be creative
and to explore what can this technology bring

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.670
to their business and how can it help them
to ultimately either reach customers, improve

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.680
their business process or create a more collaborative
environment.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.790
We often know firsthand what companies produce
in market but not why they do what they do.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.010
What inspires you and your employees to come
to work each day?

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.840
What excites us is that our customer success
defines our success. So, we know we're successful

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.940
when our customers are successful. That means
being flexible, uh being open and being adaptive

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.530
not only as a company, but with our technology
and with our solutions and with our partners

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.410
as well, whether they be channel partners
or the ecosystem partners that we bring to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.819
the table.
So, what really motivates the organization

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.560
is being faced with a channel and knowing
that challenge is going to be different with

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.700
every customer that we work with and being
rewarded with the success of our customers

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.640
is really what motivates the organization
daily.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.379
We read in the news a lot about dig data and
analytics. How do they impact business performance?

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.640
Big data and analytics are really at the forefront
of information that's relevant to a company.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.050
We talked about information relevant to a
customer, but relevant to a company is the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.629
analytics that drive a lot of the behaviors
or capture the behaviors of consumers. Understanding

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:43.680
those analytics and understanding why we
as consumers do what we do is important in

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.140
that environment and being able to look at
the analytics and understand specific behaviors

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.220
and drive business decisions on those analytics
is very important and can be very beneficial

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.440
to companies to know what products to position
where or to even understand why customers

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.989
walk in certain directions and not other directions.
So, there's a lot that can be done around

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.840
the analytics to understand really what is,
what is happening in a particular environment

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.080
and how to drive business success based upon
that information.
