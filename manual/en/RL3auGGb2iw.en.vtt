00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.589
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure for removing and

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:13.620
reinstalling a motor mount. In this step,
we're going to talk about removal of the motor

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.369
mount bolt itself and removal of the mount
from the body of the vehicle. As you can see

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.019
I have a bolt head here that runs through
the center of the motor mount. On this side,

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:33.360
there is a nut with a fastening clip on it.
Now this fastening clip here is going to make

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.200
it so I don't need to put a wrench on this
side of the nut. I'll just take my half inch

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.600
drive ratchet. I have a 17 millimeter socket
on there. Let you get a look at that. And

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:04.480
put it on the bolt and give a good tug.
This bolt runs all the way through from this

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.110
bracket through the center of the motor mount
and through the other side. It?s a heavy duty

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.910
grade 8 hardened steel bolt and what it does
is makes a sandwich out of this bracket and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:41.930
the motor mount itself. Once you hear the
retaining clip fall off the other side, you

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.100
can slide the bolt all the way out, as you
can see it?s a fairly long winded guy. And

00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:00.390
slide the motor mount up and out of the vehicle.
That is the proper way to remove the motor

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.460
mount mounting bolt and remove the engine
mount itself.
