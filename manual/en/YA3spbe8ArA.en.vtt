Ciao, today we're going to cook a recipe under italian colors...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're going to cook a broccoli, dry tomatoes, mozzarella tart.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, we need, puff pastry, broccoli, mozzarella and dry tomatoes

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Start with broccoli, cut them in small pieces and boil them for 7 minutes

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
While brocoli are cooking, prepare mozzarella, cut slices and recut them in 2 pieces

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then, cut dry tomatoes in 2 pieces in lengthwise

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
After strained brocolis and let them cool down

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now, we're going to prepare the tart, take a plate and put ingredients

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's going to be a "tarte tatin", so, we'll turn it over after cooking

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Start with dry tomatoes, put them properly because that will be the top of the tart

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Add mozzarella and brocoli

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Cover it with puff pastry, cut it if too 
 big and fold it down arround ingredients

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Put it in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The tart has to be lightly brown to be turned over

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500
Yummy !

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Serve it as an appetizer or as a starter with 
 a bit of salt and olive oil

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500
