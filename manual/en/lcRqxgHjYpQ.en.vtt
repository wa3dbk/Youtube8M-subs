00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.490
So the multiple twist and turns are a lot
like the single twist and turn only you keep

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.170
it going. The most difficult thing about this
move is the more you do it the more dizzier

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.340
your get. It is a pretty simple rule and it
is fun and it looks impressive. So I'm going

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.869
to start with my walk, my inside foot is going
to be my initial turn. There is my initial

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.650
turn and instead of stopping where I would
normally would I'm going to continue my turn

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:51.310
and just shift from one foot to the next.
I would demonstrate one more time. So you

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:00.920
are walking, your initial turn is one instead
of stopping here you are going to continue

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:12.060
your turning on your feet.
There are 2 ways to spin yourself around this

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.479
pole. One is with your hands above one hand
above your head and one hand around your buttock

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.130
area. The other way is to keep both of your
hands low. Watch my hands as I do this turn

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:34.369
with one hand above and one hand below. Here
is my hand below and here is my hand above.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:47.200
By keeping my hands here I keep a good balance
between me and the pole. Low hand, high hand,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:02:02.670
turn, low hand, high hand. Now if I want to
have both hands low it is a little bit more

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.860
difficult you have to know where your body
is.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.090
Both looks nice, both are very graceful.
