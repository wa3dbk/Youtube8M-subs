00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
Hi ! I hope you're fine today !

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.880
We're back in a new video!

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.040
I introduce you my piano.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.600
Yes so...

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.500
There're people for who it's bycicle, there are some, for who it's ping-pong...

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.740
And there're persons for who it's One Direction.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.560
My two passions are piano and bubble wrap.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.200
OH OH OH !

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.180
A while ago, I bought a piano on internet, I was very happy, very excited.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.220
The delivery guy arrived at my home, he rang at my door,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220
I carried my gigantic package to the first floor,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.760
I was very excited, like, like a Christmas morning!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.560
I open carefully my package,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.720
I build the furniture - because it's like a Ikea furniture, you see? - As I have a levels 5 in Ikea furniture building; I built it in less than 2 hours 45

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.340
I was so happy, but i didn't open the keyboard yet..

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.440
I open the keyboard, and i saw this :

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560
But there it is everything's right, after a dogfight for 2 weeks with the customer service,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.980
I recovered a new piano, ready to play.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.600
Me, I was expecting a piano sound, but when I turn it on, I discovered that there are people inside!

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.060
People stucked in my piano ! Right !

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.560
I see you don't believe me !

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.640
*breath*

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.880
*man voice* You see this ! However, heard this ? That was a human sound !

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.360
It makes me tag, it freaks me ! I have it for 3 days now, I don't sleep anymore !

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.960
*man voice* You see !

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.440
You..

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.420
But a machine can't makes a sound like that, it's not possible !

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.020
Listen !

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.620
*man voice* Here !

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.660
It looks like, each notes of this piano is connected to a telephone line, which goes directly in Asia, where an operator is waiting; and every time that a little light turns on,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.600
he does : *man voice*

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.660
It's possible, I'm telling you !

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.440
I need bubble wrap. Bubble wrap !

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.940
Ah, it makes me feel good !

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.440
Ah yes !

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760
Ah yes it.. I'm relaxed !

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Answer !

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.660
Yes hello ! Yes !

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700
Yes hello ! Are you Roland ?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.940
Yes Roland ! Hi !

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.240
Eum.. There are people in your piano, Roland.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.100
Hum..

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.600
Hum.. Listen Roro !

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.460
Yes, there are people.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.220
Here.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.540
You.. No I.. No i'm not joking ! Listen !

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.460
*man's voice* Here !

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.620
Yes !

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880
No it's not my wife who made a joke !

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.380
There are people..

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Alright there are people in my head.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.320
Alright..

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.280
You're nothing Roland. Bye ! Bye Roland !

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.740
Asshole !

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.060
*man's voice*

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.120
You hear that ! *men's voices*

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.920
Here it's the proof that they're alive ! I didn't press !

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.300
Can you here me ? What do you want from me ? *man's voice*

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.180
Alright.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.760
Do you want me to play now ?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.680
'Cause I have so some stuff to do

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.400
And we can make this la.. *men's voices*

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.540
Ok.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.480
Ok.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.360
Don't need to be rude !

00:02:33.400 --> 00:03:17.240
*play piano with the voices*

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.200
Alright it's good, it's good.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.480
Stop, alright, alright it's good !

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.280
We understand !

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.200
Bubble wrap !

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.300
*bubbles explosive sound*

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:35.180
*play piano again with the voices*

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.020
Oh that's creepy !

00:03:36.060 --> 00:04:22.440
*continues to play*

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.000
Alright it's good, i'm done !

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.760
I'm done to make sing humans.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.540
I don't know where you are, but you're maybe in a basement.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.800
And maybe someone is stinging you for you to sing.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.760
I don't know.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.780
It's unhealthy.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.120
I stop, that's all.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.020
Me, I bought a piano for relax myself.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.440
Now, it weighs on my conscience.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.480
It gives me a pressure...

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.660
I feel like i'm toturing people every time i press a button.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.060
*man's voice* Him, he sore feets.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.180
*man's voice* Him, in the leg.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.440
*man's voice* Him, somebody is cuting off his hip with a saw.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.920
What's happening if I press this button,here ?

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.920
*piano sound* Oh ! A piano sound !

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.220
I didn't see !

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.120
What a jerk !

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.220
I noticed a very strange thing about the piano.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.340
A thing that is for all the humanity.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.660
No matter your religion,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.820
no matter your skin color,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.120
no matter your shoe size,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.140
or the size of your sex.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.320
It has nothing

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.980
Anyway, it works everytime.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.200
When someone don't really know how to play piano and that he's walking to a keyboard

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.420
he plays everytime the same song

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:18.360
*music "I Have Good Tobacco"*

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.240
This song is rubbish !

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.520
She's simplistically, nobody give a fuck

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.580
Nobody have it on his smartphone or on his iPod !

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.280
Lyric, can we talk about the lyric ?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.060
[singing exaggeratedly] I have good tobacco in my snuff box, I have good tobacco and you will get none.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.840
Son of a..

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.000
[exploding bubbles] Aaaaah !

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.940
He have tobacco in his snuff box, and he doesn't want to lend.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.740
Berk !

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760
Nobody use a snuff box in 2015.(now in 2016)

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.100
Everyone literally beats the balls of a snuffbox.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.360
No, I say bullshits.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.300
There's not just "I Have Good Tobacco"

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.320
You have too :

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.300
*"Under the moonlight"*

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.820
Firt, the guy is named Pierrot.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.880
If you have a guy who's name is Pierrot in your entourage,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.760
change your life !

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.480
Pierrot, it's a son of a bitch name.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.900
Why can't he has a name like everyone ?

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.340
Jeremy, Jonathan, euh Maxime, as he want !

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.300
Under the moonlight, my friend Pierrot

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.440
Do you have a friend whose name is Pierrot ?

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.940
I didn't have a friend whose name's Pierrot .

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.640
Nobody has a friend whose name's Pierrot.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.660
The only people who have friends whose name are Pierrot

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.120
They probably smoke their tobacco in a fucking snuffbox

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.840
[singing] Lend me your pen to write a word.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.880
Asshole !

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.680
Pierrot is an asshole.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.220
You know him the Pierrot.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.720
The Pierrot, it's that one who didn't bought the school supplies in time.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.720
And who takes pencils all the year to everyone.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.800
But the problem, it's not that !

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.400
Us, we're nice, we help him with a BIC 4 colors when he need it !

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.240
The problem, it's that Pierrot

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.700
He just breaking balls in the middle the night for ask a pen !

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.300
UNDER THE MOONLIGHT !

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.800
It means in addition whether the night,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.800
He comes pissed you off at night

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.500
That already you can't sleep !

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.880
[singing] My candle is dead, I don't have a light anymore

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.520
Pierrot, we're in 2015 (now in 2016 again), you push a button and the light turns on !

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.240
*human's voice*

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.560
[singin] This video is over,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.200
If you like it you can share it,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.880
And maybe leave a green thumb, and even, a comment !

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:51.800
*human's voice*

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.360
Dabisous !!
