An actor’s appearance is a major part of
his or her performance. Making the actor look

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.831
right for the role is the job of the Makeup
Artist. Professional Makeup Artists work in

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:22.450
TV, movies and live theater. They begin by
reading the script and learning details about

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.470
the production. To create their designs, they
consider many factors, including the age of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.750
each character and the setting and time period
of the story. Artistic ability often comes

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.409
into play. For example, they may be called
upon to make the actor look older…or younger.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:49.359
In addition to make-up, many artists deal
with hair as well, creating looks with wigs

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:56.010
or fake beards and mustaches. They also design
rubber or plastic prostheses that can be used

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.739
to change performers’ appearances. The Makeup
Artist is part of a bigger team of people

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.050
that put a production together, and must be
able to work well with everyone. They consult

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:17.430
with the lighting crew and the director about
specific makeup needs. Long hours, nights

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.869
and weekends are part of the job. And a good
Makeup Artist will be standing by at all times

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.350
for touch ups during performances. It takes
determination to succeed in this field. Many

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.090
start by first taking classes in a vocational
school that teaches cosmetics. Then they get

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:47.299
on-the-job training as an assistant to an
experienced makeup artist. It can take a long

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.399
time to build your reputation, and to earn
good money. But the work can be exciting.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.320
Not all the stars are in the spotlight. You
can be a major player in any production as

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.349
a Makeup Artist.
