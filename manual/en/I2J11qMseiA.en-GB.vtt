00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.899
Hello, my name is Marilena Mademtzi.I come from 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.210
Greece and I am studing here, full time,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.090
doing a PhD in autism.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.090
Before I started my PhD, I had applied to do a masters degree here

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.920
at the same university, again in autism studies.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.300
Whilst I was studying for my masters, I had an opportunity to work on a research project 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.180
taking place at the university

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.830
Which was on technology in autism

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.760
And it was called ECHOs. And while I was working there

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.970
I realised that I really loved what was going on there

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.980
And actually, this is what motivated me to come here to study for a PhD.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.470
This, in the same subject, not the same project but still working with children with autism

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.000
And using innovative technologies to improve a variety of skills.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.489
I definitely feel it is hard work! But it’s a great experience,

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.130
And it’s not only the academic experience  

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:09.580
but the people you know who are working there, the opportunities you have doing research,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.000
Seeing different areas of expertise. 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.000
Actually, during my PhD, again, I was hired to work on a research project 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.659
This project helped actually to inform my PhD as well

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.659
because I had the opportunity to see different projects taking place

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.530
In technology so it was easy for me to decide what I wanted to do  

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.000
And the research design that I wanted to follow for my PhD as well

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.409
Besides this, we have a lovely office, there are people from different

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.000
programmes in education so you can actually exchange different opinions and they can help you a lot. 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:59.189
If someone wants to a PhD actually, you have to decide that this is what you actually want.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.189
It’s hard work as I said before, so you have to be committed to this

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.200
It’s like your little child! You carry it everywhere, even when on holidays, even when you go to sleep!

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.370
It’s the first thought when you wake up and the last thought before you go to bed.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:24.900
Other than that, if you really love it, I don’t think it’s really hard

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.130
because generally, if you love something, even if it’s challenging, you want to do it.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.730
I would definitely recommend this PhD programme in Birmingham

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.850
because as well as being in a very good university, with all the services, all the resources,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.000
the library that you can use,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.030
it’s just that here, the professors and lecturers are very keen on helping people that come here

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.380
So they involve them in different projects besides their PhD, they give them opportunities to participate 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.240
in conferences and other papers

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.459
So this enhances all the experience around research. And after finishing your PhD

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.580
actually, people are in a very good position to start working as independent researchers. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.360
Definitely, since I’ve been doing a PhD, I want to do research

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.790
So either I would like to go into academia or 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.470
Work as a researcher on different projects which take place in different universities
