Welcome to Expert Village I'm Steve Blank
drummer in the Cruisers here to talk to you

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:15.549
about some advanced drum exercises. For the
advanced 4 drum exercises let's warm up our

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.450
feet right left right left right left right
left left right left right left right left

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:32.680
right right left right left right left right
left left right left right left right

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:44.039
so now with the hands if you don't have four
drums hit something else high hat or cymbal

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:54.920
to whatever you've got to hit as the fourth
thing. Actually this would work with any number.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.289
Here's the big V is actually the five drum
exercise 1,2,3,4,5 1,2,3,4,5. When we are

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.270
moving to the right we lead with the right
when we move the left we lead with our left

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:17.980
two hits on each drum or cymbal. Great exercise
for increasing speed around the drums so now

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:29.470
the advance exercise would be with the feet.
You want to be pretty smooth with your hands

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.700
before you try at the feet and then warm up
feet separately. Right left right left right

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.960
left right left right left left right left
right left right and so forth another variation

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:56.630
hitting the small pad their on my left in
one final variation
