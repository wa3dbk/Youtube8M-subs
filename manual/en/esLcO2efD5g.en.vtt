00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:25.159
Admittedly, the easy thing to do in a situation
like this is to fall back on Yakof Smirnoff’s

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.329
famous “In Soviet Russia” bit.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.140
But since he’s still actually getting work
(albeit in Branson), it’d be crass and potentially

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.280
SOPArific of me to carelessly throw around
such a piece of material.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.830
Besides, there’s plenty more to talk about
in this game.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.070
Like pigs.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.940
And... well, pigs.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.120
Capitalist pigs.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.760
Trying to destroy a rocket.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.530
All Your Creeps is your standard tower defense
game, but with significantly more BACON.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.400
That’s right, the assailants in this game
- the “creeps,” as it were - are of the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.289
porcine persuasion, though this doesn’t
prevent them from coming into battle armed

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.479
to the teeth with cannons a’blazin.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.570
Four barrels good, two barrels bad, as it
were.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.840
As is typical for the genre, there’s a rock/paper/scissors/something
else mechanic at play between the various

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.700
types of raiding swine and the towers you
use to rebuff their attacks.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
Each side has four different units to command,
replenished at set intervals indicated by

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.630
the circle around your targeting reticule.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.939
While it’s a cute idea, All Your Creeps
suffers from a rather shallow experience;

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.149
there are only two game modes available, a
five-minute timed bout and an endless challenge

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.719
- and only one stage, a snowy Siberian waste.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.570
I half expect Boris and Natalya to clamber
out of a bunker with the keys to the Goldeneye.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.829
But, hey, the game’s only a buck.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.549
And it supports up to four players at a time,
in any configuration of teams.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.749
And if you want something a little more French
than the admittedly hackneyed Russianesque

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.549
font - I know that’s not a real word and
I don’t care - simply leave the title screen

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.369
rolling on the credits through one complete
cycle.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.060
Your reward for actually taking the time to
acknowledge the folks at Red Button Games

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.750
for creating this thing?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.750
ALL YOUR CREPES.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.560
Man, I get hungry just thinking about it.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.310
A beret for every pig, and every pig in a
beret!

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.190
A little bit of ham with your crepes, it seems.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.700
All part of this complete breakfast.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.830
Well, that’s not true.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.920
That rocket would have to be an orange tree
or something, and one of your towers would

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.880
have to be a juicer, which means the capitalist
swine would have to send Jack LaLanne, and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.530
that would require necromancers, and pig necromancers
scare the bacon right out of me.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.530
Literally.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.290
Just think of the danger they could wreak
if said conjurations were retroactive!

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.730
To say nothing of the toast.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.090
So there you have it.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.480
The true terror of Animal Tower.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.530
I just had to theorize the second coming of
a fitness legend, while some heavily-armed

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.170
pigs crash into walls and try to avert a Soviet
missile launch.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.900
I love the XBLA indie section just for reasons
like this; the most absurd premises can make

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.240
their way into the living rooms of thousands
if not millions, challenging their ability

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.260
to maintain sanity in these trying times.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.430
It’s like the video game equivalent of Monty
Python.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.780
What’s next?

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.140
Super Johann Gambolputty Brothers?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.600
No One Can Stop The Spanish Inquisition?

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.370
The Knights Who Say Ni no Kuni?

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.020
Ooh, I’ve got it: RED.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.020
DEAD.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.090
PARROT.
