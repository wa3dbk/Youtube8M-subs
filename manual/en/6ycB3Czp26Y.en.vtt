Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week,

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:03.900
your guide to everything
that's happening

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.934
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:08.100
This week, the President worked
to help consumers learn about

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.400
and enroll in quality,
affordable health insurance

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.367
plans through the marketplaces,
welcomed Iraq's Prime Minister

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:14.500
to the White House,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.266
hosted the Stanley Cup
Champion Chicago Blackhawks,

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.467
and kicked off the newly
reinstated White House tours

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:21.867
with a surprise drop-in.

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.133
That's November 1st
to November 7th, or...

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.967
"Casual with a Raffish Look."

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.800
The President:
The pocket square, huh?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.900
I mean, kind of casual,
but sort of a raffish look.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.433
That's a sharp
look, right there.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.767
Narrator:
On Friday, the President
welcomed to the White House

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:39.133
Prime Minister
of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki,

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.500
where the two discussed economic
and regional security issues.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.400
The President:
The main theme was
that the United States

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.934
wants to be a strong and
effective partner with Iraq,

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:49.700
and we are deeply invested
in seeing an Iraq

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.066
that is inclusive,
that is democratic,

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.734
and that is prosperous.

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.166
Narrator:
On Championship Monday,

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:58.367
the President telephoned Boston
Red Sox manager John Farrell

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:00.066
to congratulate
him on the team's

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.633
third World Series
victory in 10 years.

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.433
Later, the President joined
Chicago fans in the East Room

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.066
to welcome back his hometown

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.500
Stanley Cup Champion
Chicago Blackhawks.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.300
The President:
But since I've been President,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.800
only one team has brought
a world championship

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800
to my hometown of Chicago,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.000
and now the Blackhawks
have done it twice.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.066
[applause]

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.600
Twice!

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.400
To the Bulls, Bears,
Cubs, White Sox,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.734
I am term-limited --

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:26.967
[laughter]

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:29.300
-- so you guys
got to get moving.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.633
Narrator:
On Tuesday,
White House tours resumed

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.934
for the first time since March.

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.233
The President:
And you just happened
to come on a day

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:37.867
that I was hanging out here.

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:39.500
I don't always do this.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.600
Well, it's great to meet you.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.800
This is the First Lady.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.633
Mrs. Obama:
What's your name?

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:43.533
The President:
I have more gray hair

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.200
than they have on me
in the wax museum, I suspect.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.133
- Tours just reopened, and I'm
in the White House right now,

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.767
and I just met the First Lady
and President Obama

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.200
and their two dogs.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.367
I consciously reminded myself
that I have to talk

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:57.000
to the President and the
First Lady and not the dogs.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.767
But I --
oh, gosh, what did I say?

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.000
It's such a blur.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.200
The President:
Congratulations.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.433
Just passed the bar;
that's great.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:04.800
All right, you must feel good.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.000
- He congratulated me.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.500
I just passed the bar on
Thursday -- and the First Lady.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.467
I said I was following
in their footsteps.

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:13.567
The President:
Give me a high five.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:14.567
Good to see you.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.133
Tell everybody back in
Sweden we said hello.

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:17.767
- It was such a big surprise.

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:21.600
We went here just for a
visit, and there they are.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.400
And we've come all the way from
Sweden, so it's wonderful, yeah.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.867
The President:
Well, it's wonderful to see you.

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.967
We had a such a nice
time in Stockholm.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:32.700
Everybody treated us so well.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.867
Narrator:
Then the President headed off
to meet with business leaders

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:37.000
to discuss the need for
the House of Representatives

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.800
to pass comprehensive
immigration reform.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.867
The President:
These businesses are
going to have more customers.

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:45.934
We're going to see people
who are firmly working here,

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:49.834
out of the shadows, paying taxes
and getting right with the law.

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:52.700
Narrator:
On Wednesday, the President
traveled to the Lone Star State

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.100
to meet with and
thank local volunteers

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.767
who are helping consumers
learn about and enroll in

00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.633
quality, affordable
health insurance plans

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:01.367
through the marketplace.

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:04.467
He visited a local temple to
join canvassers and navigators

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.767
working with Dallas
Area Interfaith,

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:08.667
one of the most active
groups in the community

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.066
working on enrollment
and outreach efforts.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:14.700
- I decided that I would join
you and many of you to make sure

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.400
that everybody understands
affordable health care.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.100

And thanks again for checking
out your West Wing Week.

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.600
The President:
I've seen her do this,
but, like, all day.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.967
Mrs. Obama:
You thought she couldn't hang.

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:31.633
The President:
She did okay.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.266
She only jumped on one kid.
