00:00:01.154 --> 00:00:05.474
My name is Robert Swan and I'm proud to be a patron of Solar Impulse

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.880
this is such an exciting time!

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.080
Many many years ago I became the first person in history

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.180
to walk to the North and South pole

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.780
People call me an explorer

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.300
Well I don't think I am

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.200
I believe that the last great exploration left on earth

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.400
is to survive on earth

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.720
And what Solar Impulse, Bertrand and the team are doing

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.140
is really showing leadership

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.280
and inspiration on that last great survival journey

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.840
We have to get things right, time is now

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.220
It's not in the future, it's now

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.740
And what Solar Impulse is doing it engaging us all

00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:52.968
on the fact that action is necessary

00:00:52.968 --> 00:00:57.220
We all see reports of climate change, ice caps melting 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.000
We all know that climate change is an issue

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.440
finding the strength and the courage to actually do something about it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.380
And I cannot tell you how proud I am

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.160
how amazed I am

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.800
With the support of all your sponsors

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.654
that you've got this together

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.360
Every mile that you are in the sky

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.180
Every kilometers you are in the sky

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.234
We are all behind you!

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.420
And I just think that all of us

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480
should go the extra step

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.040
to follow your inspiration

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.140
And in our own small way

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.780
exactly a year after you finish this magnificent flight

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.140
We are returning to the Antarctic

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.960
to make a journey... guess what?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.740
only surviving on the sun for our energy for our survival

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.865
So we are following in your footsteps

00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:54.294
Good luck to you all

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.200
And this is Robert Swan, patron of Solar Impulse

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.600
Message ends.
