00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.320
 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.730
 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.660
 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.410
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.579
 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.380
Before you

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.239
begin your repair be sure to unplug your TV
from any power source and properly ground

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.809
yourself.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.699
We have already removed the back cover of
our TV, but you will want to remove all the

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.870
screws connecting your back cover to your
TV and then simply remove the back cover piece.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.289
Over here we have the main board. The main
board controls your TVs inputs and outputs,

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:10.289
this main board is connected to the backlight
inverter/LED driver via this ribbon cable.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.500
Right here we have the backlight inverter/LED
driver. This is what supplys power to turn

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.500
on the backlighting for the TV. LED TVs are
basically the same as LCD TVs with one real

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.720
exception, the source of illumination for
the screen and the board that drives that

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.720
illumination. LED TVs use LED backlights as
opposed to LCD TVs which use CCFLs, cold cathode

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.010
fluorescent lamps. The screen though on an
LED TV and LCD TV are the same.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.340
This TV has two power supply boards. Here
we have the G7 power supply board, this provides

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.630
power to the backlight inverter/LED driver
via this cable. The two power supply boards

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.730
are connected to each other right here. The
other power supply is called the G6 power

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.069
supply. The G6 power supply connects to the
main board and to a power saving switch located

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.689
on the outside of the TV. That goes to the
switch, this connection here goes to the main

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.290
board.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.389
Now we have already removed the cover for
our T-con board right here, but this LED driver

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.450
also has a cover. Here is what the T-con board
cover looked like originally before we unscrewed

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.450
it. So if you are doing any repairs to the
backlight inverter/LED driver or the T-con

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:04.109
board, you will need to remove the covers
for each of them, before you replace the board.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.930
Removing the covers can be simply done by
removing the screws that hold them to the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.779
panel. The T-con board actually takes the
image and sends it to the panel which makes

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:24.779
it show up on your screen. You can see the
T-con board is connected to the LED driver/backlight

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.450
inverter here and then connects to the panel
via these cables here.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.450
One of the most common problems with an LED
TV is that the TV will not turn on. If your

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.669
TV will not turn on and you have no power
on your TV, that is most likely a problem

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.139
with the power supply.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:04:00.139
Here are some common symptoms that LED TVs
can show that could be a bad main board. If

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.859
your inputs are not working and you have no
signal from the HDMI connection, the tuner

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.540
connection, the RCA connection or any of those
connections etc. That could be a bad main

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.540
board. If your TV has no audio. If your TV
set restarts on its own while powered on,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.350
that could be a bad main board. The LED driver
is similar to an LCD TVs backlight inverter,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.400
so the most common problem here is that you
wouldn't have lighting from the LED driver.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.280
So your TV would turn on, you could have sound
but you would have no image on the screen

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.759
and no backlights.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:45.590
Once again, you could use a flashlight and
run the flashlight test on your TV. We will

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.580
put up the link right now on the video for
the flashlight test and you can learn how

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.580
to determine with a flashlight if your TV
has back lighting or not. If you find out

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.479
that your TV does not have back lighting this
would be the most common problem here, the

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.460
LED driver.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.409
Some common problems with the T-con board,
is that if you have no picture on your screen

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.289
but your TV does have backlights and sound,
that could be the T-con. Earlier we said it

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:25.039
could be the main board, but the T-con could
also be at fault if that is the symptom. You

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.539
could also have colored vertical lines on
your screen or half of the screen is missing

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.180
the picture. Those would both be symptoms
that could be a bad T-con board.
