hi I'm judith kingsbury from savvy vegetarian
dot com

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.710
welcome to my kitchen
today I'm going to make quinoa black bean

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.689
salad
i've already got the quinoa cooked

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.470
3 cups of cooked quinoa
and 2 cups of black beans

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.360
approximately
so here we go lets start with the green beans

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:46.690
now I'm going to chop some olives
just going to roughly chop them

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:58.030
i've got a red pepper I'm going to chop into
little pieces

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.059
some green pepper now
take out the seeds

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:13.149
chop it into strips
then little pieces

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.970
cucumber
this is a nice locally grown one that I picked

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.360
up this morning
now I have my cucumber peeled

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:31.800
going to chop it
into small pieces

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.330
got some celery to chop up
snip off the ends

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.280
then slice it
lengthwise like that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.650
and again
chop it in little bits

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.940
now for some carrot
slice it lengthwise

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.430
and again
dice it

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.429
then the only thing that we have to do
is to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.690
mince some garlic
slice the cloves up

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:17.720
then mince them
ok I've got my garlic minced up

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.340
got the oil heated up in my frying pan
now I'm adding my garlic

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.720
saute the garlic for a minute
sauteing the garlic mellows the flavor so

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.880
you don't get
garlic breath like you do when you use raw

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.500
garlic
so to this i'm going to add

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.910
my green beans
celery green pepper

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.750
red pepper
and carrots

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.860
saute all of those
i just want to make them tender crisp

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.480
i just noticed that i forgot to add my jalapeno
so i'm going to just quickly

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.480
mince that up
and throw it in there

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.990
add in my spices
teaspoon of coriander and a teaspoon of cumin

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.691
stir those up
sauteing the spices brings out the flavor

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.980
and
again mellows that raw taste that they sometimes

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.300
have
now i'm going to put the lid on

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.100
and let them cook a bit
while I chop up the scallions and basil

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.770
you can add the onions in with the salad
or just serve them on top as a garnish

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.680
found this lovely fresh ripe locally grown
tomato

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.980
at the store this morning
going to chop that up and put it in too

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.030
now at this point you can deseed the tomato
if you like

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.750
so its not so watery
just stick your thumb in there and wiggle

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:58.180
it around
tomato seeded

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:07.510
and i'm going to chop it up into small chunks
and the fresh basil

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:19.660
just going to slice it in thin slices
give it a bit of a chop in the other direction

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.400
you can't really chop basil far ahead of time
because it tends to oxidize and turn black

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.949
i've got the veggies just tender crisp
all mixed with the spices and the garlic

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:42.020
let that cool off a bit
now i'm ready to put my salad together

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.249
first the quinoa goes in the bowl
then the black beans

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.749
i'm going to throw in the tomato and basil
but reserve the scallions

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.219
for garnish
add the cucumber

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:05.740
and the olives
give those a stir

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.249
add my dressing
this is 2 tablespoons of olive oil

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:17.879
and 3 tablespoons of lime juice
and some salt and pepper

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:27.139
stir that in
then add my sauteed veggies

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.029
i'm just going to marinate this salad covered
in the fridge for an hour

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:37.120
so that the flavors can all blend together
then we'll have it for lunch

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.360
