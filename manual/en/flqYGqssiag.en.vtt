What is going on with the Obama campaign's expectation of 
 the upcoming Presidential Debates 2012 with Mitt Romney?

00:00:11.684 --> 00:00:19.684
The first debate pitting President Obama against Mitt Romney is scheduled for Wednesday 
 October 3, 2012 Obama's spin machine is already in full force.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:33.520
Case in point is from an ABC News article that says Obama is heading to Las Vegas to 
 prep for the debate for 3 days while getting in a few campaign stops in the process.

00:00:52.954 --> 00:01:02.954
The statement said: The President will have a little bit of time to review and practice 
 before the debates, but he has had to balance the management of world events, governing,

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.449
time out campaigning and will have less time than we anticipated to 
 sharpen and cut down his tendency to give long, substantive answers.

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:22.922
Wow, what are they expecting from Obama here? And this comes from a guy who 
 can golf, and vacation, and attend Jay-Z and Beyonce toy fundraisers whenever he wants?

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:22.922
Wow, what are they expecting from Obama here? And this comes from a guy who 
 can golf, and vacation, and attend Jay-Z and Beyonce toy fundraisers whenever he wants?

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:34.919
He's too busy to study for a debate because of the management of 
 world events, you mean like not meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu?

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:50.670
And then this comes from Politico.com quoting an email 
 that came from the Obama campaign which says:

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:50.670

00:01:51.012 --> 00:02:01.010
Presidential challengers benefit just by being on the same stage as the incumbent. Thatâ€™s one of the reasons 
 why five out of the last six presidential challengers were judged to have won the first debate.

00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:20.510
What? Are you serious? That's amazing that the Obama Campaign and apparently President Obama himself, because he has to know what the 
 campaign is putting out, thinks so highly of himself that they're saying Mitt Romney is going to get a bump

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.530
in the polls just because he's on the same 
 stage as the President of the United States.

00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:33.440
What arrogance! So are we going to see the president get shredded by Romney?

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:58.290
And although Obama is great at giving speeches and his oratory skills are exemplary, he lies like no president in history 
 and without a scripted teleprompter debate speech we could be in for some gaffes on par with Joe Biden.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:16.880
It certainly will be interesting to see the debates now with this little bit of extra added 
 spin from the Obama campaign trying to lower expectations. It could be quite fun.
