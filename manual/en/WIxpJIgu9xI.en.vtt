00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.220
 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.020
 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.120
G'day I'm Toby Richardson,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.370
I teach photography in the School of Art, Architecture and Design 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.340
and this mural is called A Splash of Colour for George Street.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.860
I think one of the first seeds sown was listening to what

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.170
students had to say during UniJam 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.220
and students particularly within this campus were saying 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.190
that they thought it just needed some enlivening.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.960
The new Vice Chancellor supported this idea because

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.090
he is listening to the students from that UniJam forum.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.730
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.740
It was quite exciting, something new for the Uni 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.510
and I think quite new for Adelaide. 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.270
We were quite excited to brighten up the campus.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.690
 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.150
Splash Adelaide decided to support this project 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.570
because it was something that was activating 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.470
an underutilised area of the city 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.030
and it was also promoting artists, students and the Uni

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.990
and some of the great work that can be done in Adelaide.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.410
 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.800
We were asked to submit our individual concepts for the road 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.970
then we came together and had a one day workshop 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.310
where we nutted out a couple of final designs

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.930
but I think the influence mostly was to add colour 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.950
using simple geometric shapes, but in a fun way. 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.190
 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.020
From those proposals we  selected students to work with 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.960
Steve Wilson, myself and artists Tom Buchanan and Andy McIntire.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.390
So we had students from Architecture, from Interior, 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.110
students from Visual Arts and Visual Communication. 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.490
 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.840
I studied Industrial Design for a year 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.500
before I studied Visual Arts and Photography 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.080
and that really informed how I looked at the project. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.260
It was an interesting opportunity to use my creative skills 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.210
on a medium that I am not used to working with. 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.500
 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.740
I thought it was a really good project and something 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.540
that is leaving a mark on the street. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.320
I wanted it to be sort of fresh and modern and bright.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.150
To have it here in Adelaide is something really cool I think.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.800
 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.990
It was hard work but it was lots of fun, 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.270
yeah it didn't take long there was a team of ten.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.580
 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.960
We all got along really well and it came out great 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.060
and everyone chipped in and did their part 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.030
I couldn't be happier with the group I got to work with.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.850
 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.630
Learning to work collaboratively, I think is one of the major things.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.090
Students were working to a pretty tight brief, 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.340
within a short parameter of time. 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.190
Working with clients, liasing with clients, liasing with one another,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.010
having the opportunity to see a little idea grow into a really big idea 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.140
and actually physically see that on a landscape of this scale, 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.300
of this magnitude, is fantastic for them, 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.440
great for their portfolio, great for future projects.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.090
 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.730
I think the final art work is fantastic.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.160
It really shows what can be achieved with a small group of people

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.770
that are all keen and eager to change the city

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.330
and shows what can happen when students work with established artists 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.880
and they can create something that is on such a large scale

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.710
yet still looks very professional. 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.070
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.070
It looks great and I think everyone did really, really well.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.470
 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.200
I think it's wonderful, just the way that it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.440
engages people who move through it.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.860
 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.740
I think it just engergises the community. 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.190
It's just vibrant and playful and I think Adelaide needs a bit more. 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.700
 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.930
We would love the opportunity to do more.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.540
We would like to see the work get off the ground and up some walls. 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.250
We are happy to do it  anywhere. 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.940
 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.400
The entire creative team would like to thank UniSA

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.440
for the opportunity, for the backing, 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.240
for the belief that we could actually make a difference 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.500
and to Splash, Adelaide City Council for being part partner. 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.850
