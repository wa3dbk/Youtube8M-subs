00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
It is all true

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.575
My heart broke into many bits

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:30.160
I want you to want me

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.130
I need you to need me

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.975
I love you to love me

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:42.030
I drool over you, my ice cream boy

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.541
You silly Los Angeles boy

00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:50.195
Got me thinking 
I could stand a chance

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.025
I wait way too long
My time is up

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.897
Inside of me saying
You are too tough

00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:05.920
When it could be easy

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.455
But it's tough, tough
When it comes to you

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.956
You are my only drug
That I cannot have

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.115
You are my only drug
That I need to lose

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.490
You are my only drug
That can destroy me

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.200
You are my only drug
I cannot have

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.190
I can see the fire
Inside of you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.740
Constantly flickering
And wilting

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.605
No need to pretend
To be someone else

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:52.625
It is true you are my
lovely hero, baby

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:55.482
But you are no good for me

00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:58.610
I cannot stop picturing
us together

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.445
I cannot stop thinking
of you

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.485
My heart aches

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.790
[But you are my only drug
I cannot have]

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.905
I wait way too long
My time is up

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:16.288
Inside of me saying
You are too tough

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.900
When it could be
oh, so easy

00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:22.505
But it's tough, tough
When it comes to you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.730
You are my only drug
That I cannot have

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:29.310
You are my only drug
That I need to lose

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.155
You are my only drug
That can destroy me

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:36.069
You are my only drug
That I cannot have

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:48.470
It's way cheaper having
some coffee with you...

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:50.530
Fuck it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.635
Meet me on Hollywood
and Vine

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.150
You silly Los Angeles boy

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:58.724
Got me going crazy
Without you

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:03.405
Don't tell me to sleep
Nice like an angel

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.885
It's tough, oh so tough

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:11.590
You are no good for me

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.815
Forget you...

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:20.992
I wait way too long
My time is up

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:25.630
Inside of me saying
You are too tough

00:03:26.114 --> 00:03:27.615
When it could be 
Oh, so easy

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.815
You are no good

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.785
But it's tough, tough
When it comes to you

00:03:33.487 --> 00:03:36.494
You are my only drug
That I cannot have

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.065
You are my only drug 
That I need to lose

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.670
You are my only drug
That can destroy me

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:47.585
You are my only drug
That I cannot have

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.315
You are my only drug
That I cannot have

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.750
You are my only drug
That I need to lose

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:07.170
You are my only drug
That can destroy me

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.992
[You are my favorite drug..]

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:12.620
[...that I will never have again.]
