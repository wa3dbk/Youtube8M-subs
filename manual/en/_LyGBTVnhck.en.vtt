00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.370
Whatoplay presents the Top 10 Action games
on the PlayStation 3.es

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.080
Our ranking is not a personal opinion. It's
based on a 1 to 10 score that aggregates gamers

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.000
and critics' reviews into a unique score
called playscore.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.029
Opening at number 10 is Uncharted 3: Drake's
Deception

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.210
It's hard to start-off the list with a game
so good, that you won't be surprised if

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.670
anyone would claim it to be Number 1.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.980
This game ups itself from its predecessor
on:

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.469
added co-op gameplay
better soundtrack and voice-acting

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.300
and more combat options!
I mean, how cool is it to punch a gun-toting

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.269
shmuck, in-the-face, with your bare-hands?

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.269
It holds a playscore of 9.2

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.129
Ninth on the list is God of War 3

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.710
This is the third and final installment on
an epic franchise that made gamers become

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.840
- godslayers!

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.300
The game would have been perfect, had it polished
its core story progression. However, the sheer

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.110
scale of things, the added weapons, the bloodier
boss battles, and the great ending, more than

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.030
satisfies any gamer, whether they be a fan
- or not, of the series.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.990
A superb ending to a non-dragging franchise.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.280
God of war reeives a playscore of 9.3

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.810
ranked number 8 is Dark Souls 2

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.880
The third game of the Souls series that is
responsible for many gamers' anger management

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.140
issues.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.920
This time around, the combat is more polished
compared to earlier versions. Also, a few

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.920
improvements worth mentioning are:
new enemy designs

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.060
clever multiplayer experience
and the added Fast-travel system

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.100
Oh, and a super-hardcore feature is added
that would make fans either love it more!

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.340
or hate it.You be the judge. No spoilers here

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.630
A playscore of 9.3

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.630
At number 7 is Resident Evil HD Remaster

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.349
A remaster of the 1996 horror game that introduced
the zombie-game craze is back!

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.340
Resident Evil looks certainly good for a dated
game, and the atmosphere still gives me chills

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.790
like before. Resident Evil shines its best
with its:

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.709
smart puzzles
difficult zombie encounters

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.790
and merciless fixed-camera angles!

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.780
A game for nostalgic fans and hardcore gamers
alike!

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.780
It holds a playscore of 9.4

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.650
Ranked number 6 is Batman: Arkham City

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.349
Following the success of Arkham Asylum, the
game moves on to a bigger setting with more

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.510
villains to hunt down..

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.590
And although, the boss fights are disappointingly
easy, the new open-world setting and the many

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.319
side quest and trophies, kept me more than
occupied and entertained!

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.040
Arkham City is a great game to experience
a more brutal and less stuck-up Batman

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.310
A playscore of 9.4

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.639
5th on the ranking is Metal Gear Solid 4:
Guns of the Patriots

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.499
As always Hideo Kojima does great on combining
a heavy story with spectacular gameplay!

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:27.909
For me, this game is on my all-time best list
for these reasons:

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.400
Very good introduction to new shooting mechanics
Mind-blowing audio and graphical quality

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.169
rewarding stealth options
and lots and lots of cool new toys to play

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.239
with!

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.090
Guns of the Patriots has a playscore of 9.4

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.120
At fourth place is Red Dead Redemption

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.749
Let out your wild side and play the best Wild-West
rendition of a video game!

00:03:55.749 --> 00:04:01.129
Its success is built on:
a great story that builds up on multiple climaxes

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.400
a variety of missions and side quest - ranging
from herding cattles to dueling

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.079
a beautiful environment - coz you got that
classic look of the west

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.180
a memorable cast
and a superb multiplayer content that will

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.350
keep you playing long after you've finished
the story!

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.310
Red Dead Redemption has a playscore of 9.4

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.690
Number 3 is Grand Theft Auto 5

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.000
Rockstar outdid themselves with a game that
gives you too much freedom, that you'll

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.150
find yourself forgetting the main story of
the game.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.479
GTA5 bags the place
With stunning visuals

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.930
varied and funny characters
excellent writing and voice acting

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.910
an incredible open-world
and an added first-person mode that lets you

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.030
experience GTA in a whole different way!

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.479
Although for now GTA online has some annoying
issues, I'm not that bothered at all.

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.710
A playscore of 9.4

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.800
2nd best is Uncharted 2: Among Thieves

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.220
Ever wonder what would an acrobatic Indiana
Jones be like?

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.460
In Uncharted 2, you play as Nathan Drake,
a treasure hunter with an attitude.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.289
The game improves itself on:
a breathtaking environment

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.729
impressive adventure story
new and exciting puzzles

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.909
varied combat options
and a satisfying multiplayer experience meant

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.349
to hook hardcore gamers!

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.039
Considered as one of PS3's finest, uncharter
2 among thieves

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.110
It holds a playscore of 9.5

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.590
And the best ps3 action game is The Last of
Us

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.690
A game so good, that it got a remastered version
a year after its release!!

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.080
Right from the start of the game smacks you
hard with a flurry of emotion! don't even

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.639
lie about not getting the feels. It makes
you realize that - the last of us is unlike

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.009
any game you've ever played before!

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.379
With its superb storytelling.
breathtaking post-apocalyptic setting

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.870
excellent gameplay
And awesome voice-acting

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.650
You have not lived if you have never played
this game.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.150
The Last of Us holds a playscore of 9.6

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:20.150

action games of all time.
