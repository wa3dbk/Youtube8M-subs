00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.060
&gt;&gt; Turning your canteen around Wirreanda High
School

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.770
&gt;&gt; This video elaborates on Wirreanda High
School's journey as the community work together

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.719
to create a viable canteen, which is making
a small profit. 'Right bite' print and website

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.970
resources have been central to their menu
selection. The school has a list of the voice

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.380
and support of the school community. Crucial
to their success is support from leadership,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.390
canteen committee and advice through cluster
group networks.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.350
&gt;&gt; The school also gives students an opportunity
to share their views and taste test a variety

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.510
of options before they are introduced to the
canteen's menu.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.680
&gt;&gt; The key to maintaining a parent volunteer
base is seeking their insights and opinions,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.600
creating standardised recipes that are easy
to follow, recognising their contributions

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.740
through an invitation to an end of year celebratory
lunch.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.580
&gt;&gt; Jill, the canteen manager at Wirreanda
shares her journey in making a 'right bite'

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.800
compliant canteen a viable and successful
proposition.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.189
&gt;&gt; We've turned our canteen around by revealing
all aspects of the day to day running of the

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:18.649
canteen, um, from menu choices, to recipes,
profit margins, and we've done this with the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.850
supportive um, canteen committee, and um,
other stake holders within our school community.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:34.689
&gt;&gt; I use the resources um, to guide me from
'right bite', I liaise with other school canteens

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.540
in the area, to see what there using. I attend
regular canteen cluster group meetings, where

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.859
we share our ideas and recipes and I also
use the internet.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.880
&gt;&gt; At Wirreanda we listen to the students,
by regular attending student voice meeting,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.139
our version of SRC, we talked to the parents
and volunteers within the school, we do occasional

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:03.909
tastings for the students to sample new menu
items, and we try to get as much feedback

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.300
from the students where possible, at recess
and lunch time, and in any other areas that

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.040
are available to us.
&gt;&gt; Keys to turning the canteen around to break

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.769
even or perhaps even making a small profit
were adding the correct mark up to all our

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.099
items, each school would be different, using
standardised recipes as to minimise waste,

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:32.860
um, maximising our paid staff hours to best
suite our needs, when... um, err, for busier

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.430
times, and creating strong relationships with
all um parties that were interested in the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.340
canteen, being from admin right down to the
students.
