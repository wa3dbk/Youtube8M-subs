Hello! Thank you so much for all 
your comments and suggestions.

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:07.520
Today, I am going to draw a realistic mouth.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.740
I start by doing the outline 
of the upper lip

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.449
and then, the lower lip.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:23.449
I am drawing lightly with an HB lead, so that
I can do any corrections as needed.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.410
The upper lip is usually a little bit thinner
than the lower lip.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.910
I start giving some texture, more or less
following the shape of the lips.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.890
To work on the shadows 
I switch to a 3B lead.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.890
I go darker to make them stand out.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.739
Remember that the upper lip 
will be more in shadow

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.619
and the lower lip will catch more light and
reflection.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:11.619
Use a brush to soften the lines and
to give a tone to the drawing,

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.270
and a kneaded eraser to pull the lights.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.270
The upper lip has 3 muscles: 
One in the center and 2 on the sides

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.039
While the lower lip has only 2 muscles,
divided in the middle.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.279
Even if they are hardly visible, 
you will draw better

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:33.770
if you understand some anatomy.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.770
I like them. These lips are getting 
really sexy!

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.049
I give it more texture, more detail 
and specially I go darker,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.569
so that by contrast my lights look brighter.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.849
I keep reinforcing what I had done 
and giving it

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.579
more volume by darks and lights.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.849
When I pull the reflections 
I usually soften them

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.579
with the brush.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.150
I want to go a little bit darker 
on the upper lip.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.150
And I make a reflected light on the bottom
of the lower lip.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.150
Ok! We are done!

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.550
