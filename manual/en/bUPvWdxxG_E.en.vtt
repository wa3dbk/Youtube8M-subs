00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.330
Hi all. So I've been spending this
weekend playing

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.530
Destiny on PlayStation 4 the beta that's been made

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.269
available to everyone. So what do I think? Well I think

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.720
Bungie have pulled off a bit of a marvel
here. Not only have they managed to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.140
capture

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.489
a perfect first-person shooter but they've also managed to weave in

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.519
co-op gameplay and the PVP game mechanics

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
beautifully into this world. It all kind
of makes sense

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.519
which is a rare thing to kind of say
with most games which obviously have

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.170
a big story involved. Destiny

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.809
is not only a beautiful looking game it
truly is next gen.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.960
Don't get me wrong, it is truly next gen
but it delivers a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.339
visceral punch in its shooting mechanics
which really do invoke the very best of 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.730
Halo. Action can be fast and furious

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.769
and at times so frantic you'll actually lose a bead  

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.640
on what the heck is going on, forcing you to back away from the fight

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.140
and get your bearings, so you can then, 
obviously

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.540
storm straight back into the fight. The use
of special powers and the need

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.530
to collect ammunition during a fight
means that the battle lines are always

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.760
surging backwards and forwards as you're
attempting to not get overwhelmed

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.260
and obviously defeat those waves as they
come on. No more

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.180
is this true within the strike team
missions that pit three players

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.650
against a well, rather epic mini story

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.900
usually involving wave after wave of really
tough enemies

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.540
and boss fights that will get you thinking as well as shooting.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.370
Destiny's PVP is a standard kind of affair

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.410
but tweaked up slightly with the addition
of the special powers

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.950
as well as your ability to double jump. This is not Titanfall double jumping

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.410
this is more double jumping for massive
amounts of height

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.180
and hang time in the air. Brought together
with your special powers it creates a

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.460
one-two punch

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.020
that can devastate your enemy opponents. The only thing that I would initially say with 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.410
Destiny is the world feels a little brown

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.230
and this may very well be the Russian
setting that we have during the initial

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.720
beta phase

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.870
or it might signal that the game is
going to use

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.650
a bit of a brown filter across the game world.  At no point does this detract from

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.220
a beautiful looking game

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.870
it's just that I'm a little bored with brown looking shooters.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.350
Destiny is going to sell bucket loads. There
is no two ways about it.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.200
This game shows what next-gen is meant to be all about,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.550
delivering a brand new play experience
whilst

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.360
perfecting everything that came before it. The use of single-player

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.920
co-op and multiplayer PVP hangs together beautifully well

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.500
within the narrated story Bungie have delivered here.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.880
If you haven't checked out the beta yet you
really really should,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.880
it's going to be available on Xbox One and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.140
Xbox 360 next week and it's now available on PlayStation 4

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.629
and PlayStation 3. It is well worth
checking out.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.700
