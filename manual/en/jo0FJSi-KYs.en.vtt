00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.479
So now that we’ve got the tension removed
from the strut assembly

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.220
We need to come in here and remove this lower
bolt

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.550
This also takes a 19mm ratchet, socket wrench

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.420
You’ll probably need both

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.239
So, it comes out, it can be kind of tight

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.589
You might need to use a breaker bar

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.079
To bust it loose

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.999
But after that it comes out pretty easily

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.769
So the control arm is out of the way

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.599
It’s dropped free

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.360
So now the strut assembly just needs to be
pulled from the truck

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.980
Well as you saw in the previous video

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.470
Our tophat bushings are pretty mangled

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.490
So the next step for us is to actually remove
these

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.940
So that we can replace them with the new ones

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.090
The 3 bolts on top use a 14mm wrench

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.110
Or a 14mm socket

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.679
So we just pulled the tophat off of the passenger
side

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.580
And you can see it has the same

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.840
Kind of wallowing effect that we had over
here on the driver’s side

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.759
So for us the definitely needed to be replaced

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.159
And if you are doing this

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.990
I would recommend at least pulling these out

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.050
It’s only 3 bolts

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.959
It’s very quick, very easy to pull these
out

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:37.999
And inspect these as well

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.200
And just like on the driver’s side shock

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.640
The passenger side has that kinda notched
area

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.079
Looks like somebody has been trying to chop
down a tree

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.149
So now we’re ready to reinstall the new
strut assembly

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.149
We have the new tophat in place

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.039
So the new one just goes right in

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.260
Just like the old one came out

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.459
Get it set in place

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.300
Run our bolt back through

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.610
So this is the part of the project

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.860
Where it helps to have two people

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.830
You need one person to help guide the shaft

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.940
Up through the tophat

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.080
And one person to jack on the floorjack

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.940
So go ahead and go up

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.930
So the shaft of the shock has passed through
the tophat

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.500
And now we need to reattach it with the bolt

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.480
This kit comes with a new nylock nut in there

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.700
And you can see my brother’s holding it
with 2 wrenches

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.310
The top of the shaft will actually spin

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.990
So the big wrench he’s using is a 19mm

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.420
And the small one is an 8mm

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.730
So just go ahead and snug that down

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.210
As tight as it needs to be

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.280
And then we’re ready to start reassembling
the ball joints

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.880
So we’ve got the shock bolted in place

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.720
Tightened up at the top

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.040
And now we’re just reinstalling these two
bolts here at the bottom

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.560
That connect the ball joint to the knuckle
itself

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.370
So we finished torquing those 2 bolts under
the steering knuckle

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.480
Torqued them to spec

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.960
And now we’re just going to tighten down

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.710
This lower mounting point of the strut assembly

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.210
And again this just uses a 19mm socket

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.210
And a 19mm wrench

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.070
So we’ll get that tightened down

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.350
And then we’ll come in and we’ll retighten
these

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.730
Lower control arm mounting bolts

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.080
And there we are, we’re all finished up

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.400
We’ve got one more skid plate to put on

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.240
But my brother wants to do an oil change first

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.940
So, he’ll just throw that back on later

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.010
Come under here

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.860
We’ve got all of our new shiny parts

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.370
Everything’s torqued to spec

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.840
The reality is this took us about 20 minutes
per side

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.480
So, that’s kind of what you can expect

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.060
Granted you don’t have any fasteners that
are

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.430
Cross threaded or rusted, or anything like
that

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.880
We didn’t run into any problems like that

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.070
This truck does have just over 100,000 miles
on it

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440
But yeah… like I said…

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.190
20 minutes per side

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.520
Nobody got injured

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.889
Everybody’s got all they’re fingers and
toes and eyeballs and everything

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.139
So it was real easy

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.680
So, I appreciate y’all watching

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.530
