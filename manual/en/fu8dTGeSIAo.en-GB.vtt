00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Hello,ladies and gentlemen

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.995
Welcome to another episode of Minecraft theory

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.880
I am Sober

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.175
If you miss the last episode, don't forget to check that out by clicking here

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.395
No more delay.Let's get into the topic

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:14.960
Have you even wonder why there are desert temple and jungle temple in a minecraft map?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.195
What do they use for?

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:17.689
Who built these structures?

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.774
In order to find out the truth behind these temple

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:24.334
I typed in "Temple" in Wikipedia and looked for the definition of it

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.880
It says temple is a structure reserved for religious or spiritual activites

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.860
such as prayer or sacrifice

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.534
So that means desert temple and jungle temple are related to something about religion

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:40.063
However, most of you know that there are so many traps in these temple

00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:44.575
Why would place for religion needs to setup so many traps to blow the visitor up?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.980
Another thing is the chests in these temple

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.180
Just the same question as the previous video

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.500
Who put them there?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.535
But here is another thing that much more meaningful to mention

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:57.520
Inside those chests you can find a lot of treasure

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.600
such as diamond and emerald

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.280
And most strangely, bone and rotten flesh?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.234
And the chances that bone and rotten flesh appear in the chests are the highest

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.040
If I told you that there is a box that consist of bone, rotten flesh and a lot of treasure

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.980
what do you think the box is?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.040
Did "coffin" this word came up in your mind?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.820
That’s what I can only think of when I first noticed that .

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:27.034
Wait! Still remember the definition of Temple in Wikipedia?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.980
”Reserved for religious or spiritual activities, such as prayer and sacrifice”

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.300
Scarifice! I think most of you know what I am thinking, right?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.734
Here is the theory, ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:41.454
The temple is a place for religious sacrifice.

00:01:41.454 --> 00:01:45.780
There’s been a very big group of people that have some sort of religion 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.300
believe that a sacrifice could help them on staying alive like well-farming.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.674
You know, that’s what minecraft up to.

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:54.775
so far everything is pretty simple.

00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:56.380
 Lets take it to another level.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.720
How about ocean monument?

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.054
Is that just the same?

00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:04.100
Unfortunately, ocean mounment is totally different from jungle temple and desert temple.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.215
First of all, there is no chest in the ocean mounment.

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:10.275
Secondly, ocean mounment is right under the water.

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:14.195
Also, the size of ocean monument is much bigger than those temples.

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.875
Last but not least,  there is no guardian around those temples.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:22.094
Because the ocean monument is so differ from jungle temple and desert temple.

00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:26.460
So the same theory can’t explain the purpose of the ocean monument anymore.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.695
Then let’s take a look at the information of ocean monument.

00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:33.440
One of the most unique things about ocean monument is the guardian.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.080
I have checked the information about them and I have found something very interesting.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.374
Take a look at the possible drops and here is the weird one.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.460
fish?

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.000
And all kind of fish.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.300
Because I can’t found the chance of dropping a fish.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.600
So, I have done an experiment in minecraft practically in order to get this probability.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.340
The result is about 35%.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.420
At least second high in all the possible drops.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.376
Why I said at least is because I can’t get the correct probability of the prismarine shards

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.540
as sometime you can get two.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.854
As the result above, I really suspect that guardian was originally fish.

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:11.500
Because of some power of the ocean monument,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.735
the fishes transform to guardians or elder guardians.

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:18.160
Be the way, guardian will only spawn near the ocean monument,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.375
that possibly means that the ocean monument is not a normal structure

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:24.460
but with some mysterious power.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.335
Able to mix the prismarine with the fish and become the guardian.

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:32.380
That makes me think of the beacon but anyway it is a bit too far away.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.080
Another thing to mention is the water near or inside the ocean monument

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.234
is actually a part of the ocean monument.

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:41.540
If you generate an ocean monument on a superflat world,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.580
It will become like this.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.840
That means the ocean monument is generating water!

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.660
Last but not least, this second big structure in minecraft is right under the deep ocean.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.355
Can you imagine how can people built this?

00:03:54.355 --> 00:03:58.380
Everything that I have mentioned about the ocean monument seems to telling us that

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.198
it is impossible to be built by human because of the diffculties and the ability of the ocean monument

00:04:04.198 --> 00:04:10.880
but of course, there are a lot of structures in real life can’t be explained even the technology nowadays is well-developed.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.280
Maybe I will just leave it to you guys as most of the time you are cleverer than me.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.200
But anyway this is just a theory,

00:04:18.273 --> 00:04:21.793
not a very serious discussion or conspiracy theory.

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:26.554
Killing an elder guardian gives you a sponge doesn’t mean they were spongebob

00:04:26.563 --> 00:04:30.163
One last thing to mention is about the previous video.

00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:33.434
Check that out by clicking here if you have not yet watch it.

00:04:33.434 --> 00:04:35.949
You guys are really creative and clever.

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.415
An audience reminded me that there is a scale difference between the Nether and the Overworld.

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:45.114
One block in the Nether equals to eight blocks in the Overworld.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.640
And another audience mentioned that

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:51.774
this can be explained by multi-universe theory like this

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.600
This is the overworld and this is the nether in 2D

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.660
Once player starts up a portal, the space of these world get twisted

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.380
and connected together

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.583
This theory can both explain why there is a scale difference and how the portal works.

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:10.124
Also, when a lightning bolt hits a pig, the pig will becomes zombie pigman

00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:15.495
So, the disaster I have mentioned in the previous video is mostly likely related to lightning.

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:20.080
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of this epsoide of minecraft theory.
