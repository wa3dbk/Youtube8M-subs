00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.199
 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.250
Hi I'm Bill jackson with cars dot com
we're here with the redesigned Chevrolet

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.969
Aveo

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.810
5 hatchback it compared to what the
growing market with the Honda Fit Nissan

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.939
Versa and Toyota Yaris

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.590
last year the city and got redesigned
this here

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.369
it was the hatchback stern as part of
the redesign it got Chevy sort of

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.520
traditional New

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.430
split girl with the large 7 logo in the
middle and it has a short overhangs as

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.059
part of the redesign is that this answer
from the front of the tire to the bumper

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.969
it gives it's sort of a stubby look
overall but I don't really mind that

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:42.899
hatchback

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.179
again this is Chevrolet's

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.409
entry-level cars that are looking for
wood trim or fancy leather interior

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.309
you can get that but not on this model
which is just one step up from the base

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.829
model

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.030
got a manual transmission a manual mir's

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.839
should not see that every day an overall
it's what you'd expect a lot of plastic

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.330
personally I don't think it's that bad
for an entry-level car but it does have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.630
to be said that other cars such as the
Honda Fit

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.520
and the Nissan Versa our little nicer on
the inside than they have a 05

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.770
again you have a lot of headroom I which
is nice for small hatchback but one

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.550
thing and are set to drive this car for
a while as I could never get the sea

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.770
quite where I wanted it especially for
my legs I'm road all the way back and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.030
it's still a little more been there that
I like

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.740
that mean generally makes a 106 for
sparse here are going to win any races

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.280
but it's pretty good for my legit
estimated to get 27 miles per gallon

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.790
City

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.530
34 highway that's about what I got in a
week's worth the drive in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.440
about one thing though it you really
want to get the help manual transmission

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.590
and Germany automatic

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.770
it's pretty slow and you really have to
think about how you gonna pass emerge

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.960
mister happy with the manual
transmission but it's just a little more

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.770
fun to drive

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.550
like I said its hatchback and for such a
small card is actually pretty fair

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.590
amount of cargo

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.150
room here there I was able to restore
the groceries if they're pretty easily

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.190
I know our test model second at fifteen
thousand dollars in for that you get a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.970
car that takes you from here to there

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.769
but not much else for additional
information on this car or any other

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.590
gotta cars dot com on our blog kicking
tires
