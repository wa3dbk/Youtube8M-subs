Hi, this is David from the Big Easy Catering
Company in Santa Barbara, California for expertvillage.com.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.559
We are making Cajun gumbo today and I'm going
to have my assistant show you how to cut up

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.810
the vegetables for this. Okay, so we have
a stock of celery and we are going to be using

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:31.199
two ribs for this recipe. I'm going to cut
off the little ends that might be a little

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:46.130
bit tough and I'm just going to chop these.
I'm going to try to get all my vegetables

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:54.589
approximately the same length and width so
that they all cook the about the same time.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.710
That goes off to the side. Here is my onion
for this recipe. This is a large onion so

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:13.710
I'm just going to use half of it. So I'm going
to cut of the flower end, then I'm going to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:32.610
cut the onion in half and peel it. The best
way to cut an onion for me is to slice it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:53.400
across this way. Slice it down through the
top and then cross ways to get your little

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:03.570
chunks. Put that aside. The next one is my
green bell pepper. There are different ways

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.840
to doing this. But my favorite way is to cut
of the sides because I want to avoid the seeds

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.710
in the middle. So now I have my little seed
packet, I'm just going to put that on the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:32.420
side and I'm going to take my long pieces
cut them in strips and then dice them. I'm

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.819
going to keep cutting up these vegetables
and then go on to the next step.
