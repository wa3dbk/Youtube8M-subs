My name is Aashna Karki. School. My school name is Prajna Sadan. I read in class 8.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I am part of environment committee that is eco-committee. It is very nice because it helps us to know about environment sanitations, about environment cleanliness

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It helps us to keep the environment in a proper order. It help us. It give us knowledge about the sanitation of the environment. How to dispose the waste.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Importance of growing trees. It is very important because it gives us fresh air, it helps to control many natural calamities like flood, landslide.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It helps in many others. It also makes the environment friendly.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
My name is Manjil Lahur. I read in Prajna Co-educational English Medium High School. I'm a student of grade 8.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
With the school eco-committee, first I have learned many things about trees, plants and all.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Before I used to just hesitated to plant and I use to cut down. I use to love to cut down the trees but now, after joining this committee,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
being eco club member, I'm feeling internally good and I have started to stop to cut down the trees and started to plant them.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I have helped many people in the plantation of the trees, cleaning the surrounding, awareness programs. Many old people do not know about the importance of the trees and all.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
They are uneducated, illiterate so they just cut down the trees and think them wasteless. They cut down for firewood and all. Medicinal herbs and all.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But we have influenced them not to do that because those trees and plants are forest only. If we cut down the trees unnecessarily, that will harm us itself.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I would like to say that making eco club, making nursery is a very good idea. It gives own self happy. We can do many sort of things to make own self happy but that happiness exists by external only.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But internal happiness cannot begin. So, by doing this sort of activity, we can make our internal happiness and enjoy our life happily by saving own self and others.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.000
By this process, many people are influenced and they will do their self, they will teach others and will be more influenced about the importance of trees and all.
