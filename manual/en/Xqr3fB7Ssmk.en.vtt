00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.690
Hi welcome to Steve's Kitchen happy Halloween
I've got my giant orange potato or

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.350
pumpkin

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.349
it is  basically just a vegetable and it
cost fifteen dollars

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.179
let's not waste it that's not just cut
eyes in it and pop it up for Halloween

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.820
and then I see them thrown away the next
day

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.039
really after you've done your Halloween
jack o lanterns

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.769
take this pumpkin trim off any of the
bits that you don't want

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.710
 I'm going to show you how you can use
this to make some fantastic food

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.510
come on let me show you how

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.840
now here is my pumpkin as I said now you
saw the other day that I carved one for

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.079
a

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.559
a jack-o-lantern for Halloween special
I'm not going to be using that one

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.420
but you can use those jack o lanterns
just trim off the bits as I said

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.559
and use a serrated knife now if you can
get hold of one a boning knife with nice

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.659
big teeth like this

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.600
works really well what we need to do is
start by cutting up this pumpkin

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.149
into manageable pieces 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.009
now you'll see here with this knife it cuts
through like butter

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.149
it's very easy even through the stalk
there

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.250
you can get through fairly easily and
we of course

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.940
are not going to be wasting the seeds
There are not many seeds in this one but I'll

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.509
show you what we can do with them

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.910
in another video so just take yourself a
little bowl

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.259
and use a spoon and scoop these seeds
out we are going to save them

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.610
they make great eating the next thing we
want to do is just get this

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.330
fibrous sinew out of here just use a spoon
again and just drag the inside

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.179
get all of that out we're going to end up with
this wonderful

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.439
pumpkin flesh now every last bit of this
is edible

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.060
even the outside not the stalk perhaps
you could cut this up

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.030
roast it just like a butter nut squash
but today we're going to be cutting this

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490
up into smaller pieces

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.759
because we're making pumpkin puree so I'm
going to cut this now

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.520
until I've  got pieces that I can manage and
then with a small paring knife I am

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.820
just going to trim

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.100
off the outside skin like that and you
could use a potato peeler for this

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.340
any little sharp device just to get the
outside

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.220
tougher skin off now look that's just
Half of the pumpkin here I've already got

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.690
two kilos that's about four pounds of
wonderful pumpkin flesh 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.870
now we just want to cut these up now into
small manageable pieces

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.440
little cubes about this size into a
saucepan

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.690
okay I've diced the pumpkin up nice and
small little cubes

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.010
and I've covered it with water we're going to
bring that up to the boil

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.489
cover that and simmer it for 20 minutes
let it get lovely and tender

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.940
no seasoning in there whatsoever because
we'll season it with whatever we decide

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.829
to bake

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.500
later on and these pumpkin seeds by the
way can't wait to get and roast these I

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.290
love roasted pumpkin seeds but that's
another video

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.170
join me for that a little later

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.700
now that's been boiling for about 20
minutes if you come down here you'll see

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.750
that they're lovely and soft like butter
now they're ready

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.579
for us  just to drain that off I'll take that
over to a colander  drain off the water

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.579
and then we're going to bring that back
into the pan make sure most of the water

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.739
has steamed or drained off of this

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.940
now you could pop this into a food
processor you could take a masher like

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.200
this and mash it down

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.079
I love to use my stick blender it makes
things very simple

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.720
just see if I get the cable out of the way so
you can see what I'm doing just get that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.870
in there and you could just use this to get
a wonderful puree

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.620
now what you're going to end up with
this is wonderful

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.000
smooth puree which is absolutely
delicious now we need to let that cool

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.909
down a little bit

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.950
and then I'll come back and will bag it or
box it up

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.239
now once the pumpkin puree has cooled
down a little bit like that

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.459
I like to take a zip lock bag a simple little zip lock bag
 like this

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.599
and we just portion it up into the bags

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.859
so I'm looking for about a cup or about
half a pound

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.400
we'll just seal the air out of this and
you can flatten these down like that and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.590
pop them into the freezer

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.359
one or two, three of these in the freezer they
will last for months to months

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.849
now when you take them out you can
defrost them and use them

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.790
they are unseasoned  remember so you can use them in cup cakes you can use them in soups

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.349
or as  I'm going to be doing in a pumpkin
bread in my next video so join me then

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.889
be good I hope you've enjoyed this share the
love give the thumbs up

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.549
I'll see you next time

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.769
 I really do love
my pumpkin bread and there will be a

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.510
video for that

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.960

videos on the Steve's kitchen channel for

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.580
