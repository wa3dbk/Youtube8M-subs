\f0\fs26 \cf2 \cb3 &gt;&gt; Sara: Hi guys, my name
is Sara from Sara K Byrne Photography and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.240
today I'm going to be talking to you a bit
about how to do in-camera double exposures.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.240
\
\

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.230
I won a fearless award for a photo I had last
year and ever since then I've been getting

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.350
questions on how to do this.\
\

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.849
so this is a technique that originated with
film photography where you expose the same

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.520
frame of film twice, but nowadays there are
a lot of cameras that allow you to do the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.650
same technique digitally. \
\

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.230
I'm going to show you how to do them on the
5d mark 3.\

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.899
\
ok so now we're going to go through the menu

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.469
on the back of the camera. there is a little
paint brush looking button right here, its

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.100
called the creative photo button. if you hit
that a little menu is going to come up and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.139
the center option is for multiple exposure,
so just click on that\

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:06.450
\
to turn it on you go to on function/control.\

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630
\
multiple exposure mode we are going to set

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.670
to additive, we're going to use this because
its the most similar to how film works.\

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.991
\
theres three other options and we'll do a

00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:21.650
brief description in the blog post.\
\

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.280
we're going to just do two exposures, you
can do more if you'd like.\

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.450
\
we're going to be saving all images and we're

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.650
going to be in continuous shooting mode.\
\

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.469
right here, this is a cool thing.. it allows
you to select an image for the base image

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:46.479
so you don't have to shoot them right in a
row. you can in you want, but say you've taken

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.930
some photos earlier in the day and you wanted
to use those.. like I'd taken this photo last

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.530
night and I'm going to be using that one for
one of my base images. \

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.690
\
lets go use it, take some photos.\

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.700
\
Silhouettes are a really fun place to start

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.620
because you can blow out the sky behind the
person and the second image you take is only

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.290
going to fill the dark areas of the first.\
\

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.420
so we have some base images that I shot earlier,
so we only need to find textures to fill them

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.420
with.\
\

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.620
the mark 3 is awesome because if you use live
view which I highly suggest, it will show

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.959
you the overlay of both images and you won't
have to remember what your previous composition

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.480
was.\
\

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.780
now in the menu you'll remember I chose save
all images, this saves the two photos individually

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.700
and the composite result in raw form, which
is why I'm able to show you the before and

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.540
afters.\
\

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.030
sometimes I want to have more context and
facial texture in the subject. If you have

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.909
really directional sunlight you can have the
subject face the sun and slightly underexpose

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.010
skin tones. \
\

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.430
you're going to end up shooting upward a lot
of the time, and you should use the sky to

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.280
your advantage. its great for isolating the
subject and background textures, for example

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.159
if you shoot the top of a tree line instead
of shooting into the trees, the sky will blow

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.709
out the rest of the image behind her head.
I purposefully kept her face in the darker

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:26.319
part of the image to retain the full facial
line. \

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:37.439
\
alright, thanks so much for watching guys,

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:43.310
i hope it was all helpful for you. if you
have any questions, I'll do my best to answer

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.669
and I'm so excited to see what you come up
with!}
