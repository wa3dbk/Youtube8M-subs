00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.170
How to Make a Kappa Maki Roll.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.200
Kappa means cucumber, and maki means roll.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.770
So a kappa maki is a relatively simple affair—easy
to make, and even easier to eat.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:36.769
You will need A cucumber A vegetable peeler
A sharp knife 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.170
and a cutting board.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.050
Step 1.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.770
Peel the cucumber, cut off the ends, and cut
it in half lengthwise.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.890
Use a small spoon to scoop out the seeds,
cut the halves into thin strips about an eighth

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.719
of an inch wide, and set them aside.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:57.719
Step 2.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.839
Lightly moisten your hands with water, grab
a handful—or about 1/2 cup—of prepared

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.520
sushi rice, and spread it across the nori,
leaving an even border of uncovered nori along

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.670
the top edge.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.490
Don't use too much rice or pack it too tightly.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.290
It should be no more than 1/4-inch thick and
you should be able to see nori through it.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.290
Step 3.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.330
Dip your finger into the prepared wasabi and
dab it over the rice.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.720
Step 4.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.730
Place the bamboo mat in front of you and position
the rice-covered nori on top of it, about

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.159
an inch from the bottom.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.260
Step 5.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.240
Lay several cucumber slices horizontally across
the middle of the rice.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.670
Make an even row about an inch wide and let
the cucumbers stick out an inch or so on either

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.570
side.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.729
Step 6.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.251
Roll the bottom edge of the bamboo mat over
the rice, nori, and filling, shaping it all

00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:50.159
into a rectangular mound.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.380
Be sure all the filling is enclosed.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.380
Step 7.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.000
Pull the mat back, and lay it over the roll
again.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.159
Roll again, more tightly this time, applying
even pressure and shaping the roll more firmly

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.440
as you go.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.710
Step 8.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.009
Remove the roll from the mat, place the mat
over it, and give the roll a final pressing

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.390
and smoothing, compressing it tightly and
evenly.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.860
Step 9.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.420
Repeat the whole process with your remaining
half of nori—lightly layering it with rice,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.940
adding the cucumber, rolling it and cutting
it.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.940
Step 10.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.080
Lightly moisten your knife blade and cut both
rolls in half, using a delicate but firm sawing

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080
motion.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.550
Then cut each half into three equal pieces.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.780
Step 11.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.590
Place the rolls on a serving platter, garnish
with small mounds of wasabi and pickled ginger,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.930
and serve.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.050
Did you know The precursor to sushi originated
in Southeast Asia around the 4th century,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.980
when people preserved cleaned and gutted fish
in a barrel filled with salt and rice.
