00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.020
First, trace your pattern through a sheet of carbon paper to a thick wooden base...

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.460
...then paint it with matte acrylic paint

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.820
Cut all the pieces of the pattern from paper

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.460
Trace the pieces one by one to an EVA foam sheet

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.860
Cut these pieces with precision scissors

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.980
The stamp base and pattern are now ready

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.100
Stick the pattern pieces to the bottom of the base with Express glue

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.420
Place a protective plastic sheet under the textile to be painted

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.060
Spread the fabric paint evenly on the stamp using a sponge brush

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.100
Let's get stamping

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.700
Add a new coat of paint to the stamp before each use

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.140
After about 30 minutes drying time, fix the paint by ironing over a sheet of baking paper with a hot iron

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.060
Create multiple stamps, but be careful with the mirror image when making letters!
