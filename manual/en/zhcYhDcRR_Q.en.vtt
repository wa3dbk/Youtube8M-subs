00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520
SUVs are seeing a great demand in India and Hyundai has finally launched the Creta,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.500
Unveiled last year as the ix25 in China, the Creta has a lot to offer.

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:31.791
Now it has to compete with a lot of SUVs in this segment and the Creta has everything what buyers

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:36.165
are looking out for but how does it perform on the road, well lets find out today.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.960
The Hyundai Creta is an attractive looking car and gets some nice design elements like the upright front grille,

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:53.161
projector headlights with LEDs, 17-inch diamond cut wheels and faux skid plates.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.640
The front reminds one of the Santa Fe while the overall profile boldly carries the SUV stance.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.280
The Creta's interiors are extremely well laid out, high in quality and are aesthetically pleasing.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.073
The seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of room at the rear.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:18.881
While headroom and legroom is in abundance, under thigh support falls a bit short for tall passengers.

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:28.431
Hyundai has loaded the Creta with a ton of features including electrically retracting outside mirrors,

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:36.165
push button start, keyless GO, automatic climate control, 7-inch touch-screen infotainment system,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:46.800
Bluetooth, steering mounted controls, rear AC vents, 6 airbags, ESC, Hill Start Assist and cornering lights.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.613
It does miss out on a distance to empty display and automatic headlights which is present on the Elite i20.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:59.529
The Creta has lots of storage spaces on the inside and the boot is quite accommodating too.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.640
The Creta comes with a 1.6-litre petrol engine which offers adequate performance, having good low-end grunt.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:30.200
There is also a 1.4 diesel while the talking point is the 1.6-litre diesel motor that is also offered with a 6-speed automatic gearbox.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.100
The 1.6-litre Creta diesel has quite a lot of punch but there is considerable turbo lag in the low end

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.533
and you really have to push the car post 2000 RPM to make quick progress.

00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:49.573
The gearbox is very smooth and the clutch is extremely light, making the Creta very easy to drive even in congested conditions.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.920
The automatic makes driving very convenient and masks the turbo lag to some extent.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.440
NVH levels are simply fantastic on the Creta.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.880
Hyundai cars aren't known to be exciting to drive but the Creta is the best Hyundai when it comes to handling.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.260
While it's not as engaging as some of its rivals, it definitely is sure footed with good body control.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.740
The steering weighs up decently at speed and stability is excellent.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.655
The Creta's ride quality is simply fantastic and it absorbs bumps without any hesitation.

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:32.161
The brakes offer good stopping power.

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:37.576
Now the Hyundai Creta has a lot to offer, it has a very good ride quality, it handles nice,

00:03:37.576 --> 00:03:42.942
in fact it is the best handling Hyundai till date, the performance is good and there is also a diesel automatic on offer.

00:03:42.942 --> 00:03:47.696
Yes, it's priced at a premium but the Creta does offer that premium experience.

00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:51.511
How does it compete with the XUV500 and the Duster?

00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:56.732
