00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.790
Hi, my name is Brody Herman.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.339
I'd like to tell you a review Five Guys burgers
and fries.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.680
This is a greasy bag.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.250
You know there's got to be something good
in here.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.500
Man, it actually does smell good.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.369
Let's go inside and talk about the fries.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.550
You know this is a good, crispy fry.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.369
This is a fry, all viewers who can see this.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.850
It's a good fry because when it bites back.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.500
It just bites back a little.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.310
It bites back because it is a good, crispy
fry.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.580
That's how you know it is an official french
fry.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.430
Then this is how you know you have good, crispy
fries.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.990
Now, let's build this very slowly.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.090
Wow.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.300
That's hot.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:01:01.190
And now, let me tell you the difference between
weak burger and a burger that is strong.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.140
The cheese is oozing out... oozing.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.030
This is how you know you have an official
burger.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.330
Then you can start eating.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.990
Oh my god, that's good.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:38.869
Now let me tell you the difference between
a weak burger and a burger that has strength.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.159
A burger has strength is that when you can
chew and you can talk.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.710
Oops.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.320
This is the difference between good crispy
bacon.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.700
You viewers like to see the good, crispy bacon.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.350
This is how you know you have officially bacon
that is good and crispy.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.189
Good bacon.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.940
Here you go.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.250
Official bacon.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.800
I actually do like this bacon.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.220
This is an official bacon.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.940
Burger and fries.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.070
What about the customer service?

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.070
"Hello sir.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.070
May I help you?"

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.630
That is good customer service.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:43.230
Actually, a good burger has good, solid meat.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.840
Let me discuss with you why I have to open
this up.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.860
The cheese is oozing right in the bag.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.200
This is meat.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:12.180
Official good meat 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.830
in the burger.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.510
Bacon.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.030
Man that is good.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.580
I wish you could smell what I'm smelling.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:37.650
This is a good greasy bag.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:47.650
You don't have to wait for these fries to
get blended in.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:04:11.460
I'm from St. Louis, so Five Guys just opened
a couple of days ago, October 16, 2012.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.150
Sing the song.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.949
And viewers out there, if you want to go to
Five Guys burgers and fries, just go to Five

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.750

a good time.
