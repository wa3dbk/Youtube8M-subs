00:00:01.486 --> 00:00:04.353
Working on Toy Story was kind of neat,

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:08.186
because for us we were trying
to figure out how to take something

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:10.921
that we'd only done
in very, very small amounts,

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:15.898
short films, TV commercials,
and make it 7 8 minutes long.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.369
And the story was like,

00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:23.564
''Wait a minute here. This is a much
more difficult thing than l thought.''

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:29.644
When we started with Disney,

00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:32.614
they had people who had
had a lot of experience making films.

00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:34.412
They had been through it.
They knew what to do.

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:36.746
We looked to them initially as,

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:40.051
''They're gonna school us.
They're gonna teach us how to work.''

00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:42.922
Here's what the first year
on the film was like.

00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:44.790
We would board a sequence,

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:46.625
and then Tom Schumacher
and Peter Schneider

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:50.030
would fly up and they would give us
tons of notes on the boards,

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:52.432
changes to make,
ways to improve it, to make it better.

00:00:52.537 --> 00:00:55.631
And then we would crank,
turn around those notes,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.004
and then we'd fly down to Disney,

00:00:58.142 --> 00:01:00.474
pin up our boards,
and they'd give us more notes,

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:01.909
and we'd even make changes
that night.

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:05.107
And then at 6:00 a.m.
or 7:00 a.m. the next morning,

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:08.014
very early mornings, we would pitch it
to Jeffrey Katzenberg,

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.179
and then he would rip them all apart.

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:14.722
Jeffrey Katzenberg who, at the time,
was chairman of the Disney Studios,

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:17.693
and had great interest in animation,

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.559
would always be pushing for
what he called ''edge. ''

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:24.268
And the Woody character became
wildly unappealing at one point.

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:24.927
And the Woody character became
wildly unappealing at one point.

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:27.131
SLlNKY: Woody!
WOOD Y: Now what?

00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:29.468
SLlNKY: Woody, l'm having
a little difficulty...

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:31.041
WOOD Y: Slink, how hard can it be?

00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:37.103
We assembled, maybe,
the first half of the movie on story reels,

00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:39.046
and then we went down to Disney
to screen it.

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:47.922
And l tell you, l sat there,

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:51.517
and l was pretty much embarrassed
with what was on the screen.

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:54.291
l had made it.
l had directed everybody to do this.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.598
But it was a story

00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:04.403
filled with the most unhappy,
mean people.

00:02:04.942 --> 00:02:06.603
REX: Wait, no!

00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:10.807
WOOD Y: All right, all right, all right!
Save your batteries, people.

00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:16.144
Jeffrey said, ''Why is this so terrible?''
to me in the hallway.

00:02:16.654 --> 00:02:18.918
l said,
''Because it's not their movie anymore.

00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:21.890
''lt's completely not the movie
that John set out to make.''

00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:25.224
Everything kind of fell apart
at that point.

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:29.166
Disney forced us
to shut production down.

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:33.601
And they wanted us to lay people off,
and we refused.

00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:35.899
We were getting threats that,
because it didn't work well,

00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:38.567
that we were all gonna have
to go down south,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.478
and re-board the film
under their supervision.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.017
l said, ''Just give us two weeks
and we'll turn things around.''

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:49.176
lt was really very scary,

00:02:49.287 --> 00:02:53.917
and l think that's where
we really bonded as a group.

00:02:54.192 --> 00:02:56.285
LASSE TER: I turned to our guys
and I said,

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:59.591
''Let's just make the movie
we want to make. ''

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:04.598
We worked day and night,
Andrew, Pete, Joe, myself,

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:07.000
our story team, our editorial team.

00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:09.402
S TAN TON: And so we just really went
1 00% with our gut.

00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:10.974
DOC TER: Everybody's helping
everybody else.

00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:13.805
RANFT: It was like we became
one mind in a way.

00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:17.711
l just remember laughing a lot
and drawing like crazy.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:19.407
We were drawing for our lives.

00:03:19.517 --> 00:03:23.681
RANFT: I remember we got this
frenetic, overdrive way of working.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:30.093
We learned to do
the first pass so rough,

00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:31.889
because we collectively would get

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:33.826
all these ideas once we saw it up,
and we'd change...

00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:35.364
-We knew what we were looking at.
-We'd do Post-its.

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:36.433
LASSE TER: Right, right, right.

00:03:36.534 --> 00:03:37.523
S TAN TON: We knew
what we were looking at.

00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:39.000
The other thing
that was really important for me

00:03:39.103 --> 00:03:43.164
after that Black Friday screening,
was to make Woody likable.

00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:45.242
S TAN TON: It was a real education
in filmmaking for us,

00:03:45.343 --> 00:03:48.676
that just because
a character has a problem,

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.144
or he's even not a likable person,

00:03:50.248 --> 00:03:52.682
doesn't mean that they have to be
an unlikable person on the surface.

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:55.149
Right, 'cause our goal was
to make Woody so likable,

00:03:55.253 --> 00:03:57.244
then when he started
kind of becoming a jerk,

00:03:57.355 --> 00:03:59.755
it was like,
''Oh, Woody, don't make those choices,''

00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:03.349
instead of, ''What a jerk.
I don't care about this guy. ''

00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:07.858
lt's not always bad, in this process,
to have things not work.

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:11.162
When you have these
crashing things that happen,

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.102
the rebuilding allows the thing
to be so much better.

00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:15.866
LASSE TER: After this experience,
we learned a lot of things.

00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:20.475
The most important thing we learned
was to trust our own instinct,

00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:22.944
and really to make the movies
we wanted to make.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.783
Okay, now this is the reel
that we showed on Black Friday,

00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:33.288
before we re-envisioned
Woody's character.

00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:38.795
lt's, you know... lt's bad. You know?

00:04:39.063 --> 00:04:41.122
(LAUGHlNG ) lt's really bad.

00:04:41.232 --> 00:04:43.132
lt's kind of rough to watch these days.

00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:48.103
But, hey, for history's sake,
l think it's important to see.

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:53.268
So, this takes place right before
they go to Pizza Planet,

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:56.813
and all of the other toys
are placing bets

00:04:56.914 --> 00:05:01.749
as to see who Andy's gonna take,
either Woody or Buzz Lightyear.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.014
BUZZ: Woody!
WOOD Y: Ah!

00:05:04.522 --> 00:05:08.049
BUZZ: l'd just like to wish you luck.
l know you'd do the same for me.

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.389
WOOD Y: Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, yeah.
There you go.

00:05:10.494 --> 00:05:11.483
(WOOD Y GRUNTS )

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:12.995
BUZZ: Whoa!

00:05:18.302 --> 00:05:21.294
WOOD Y: What? What, what, what?
What? What are you...

00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:23.703
What's everybody looking at? What?

00:05:23.808 --> 00:05:26.299
Hey, he slipped. l tried to... He...
l couldn't hold on...

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.537
lt was an... He slipped!

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:30.004

00:05:30.114 --> 00:05:33.345
REX: l don't see him.
l think he fell onto the street.

00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:35.078
HAMM: Yeah. He's as good as roadkill.

00:05:35.186 --> 00:05:37.416

He ain't going to Pizza now.

threw Buzz out the window!

where is your honor, dirt bag?

00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:47.989
You are an absolute disgrace!

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.294
You don't deserve to wear
a 1 0-gallon hat

00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:52.096
on your pint-sized head!

00:05:52.203 --> 00:05:54.671

l want a med-evac team on the double!

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:55.739

but l have to agree with them.

00:06:23.868 --> 00:06:25.460
l don't think what you did was right.

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.504
WOOD Y: What?
Am l hearing correctly?

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:30.198
You don't think

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:33.743
l was right? Who said your job
was to think, spring wiener?

vast reserve of brain power

00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:38.539
to consider this for a moment.

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:42.210

pay any attention to you at all!
