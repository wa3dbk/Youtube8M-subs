chief staffer president obama we got a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.099
new chief of staff is name is uh...
jacob lula the wife of his jack lou and

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.790
uh... the question is what kinda guy
issues the assault progressive or see

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.209
another establishment at a guy who's in
favor of the banks et cetera wealth

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.800
we have are answer and a number of
different ways i will describe to you

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.750
jack who is going to become evident to
you who president obama selected first

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.449
of all

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.050
uh... here's a old their headline from a
couple months ago from political

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.890
colin

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.060
a liberal g_o_p_ says that it rots

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.450
and explains how eric cantor is a big
fan of uh...

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.580
jack lou

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.990
month other republicans and you really
get a sense of uh... o

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.880
where in trouble

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.070
but then you look back at his history
and we work for

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.040
can you guess who worked for

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.500
of course while a big banks

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.779
they've been for israel baba hired him
to be one of his top advisors

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:58.109
it would be really weird if he didn't
get paid

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.749
millions of dollars in the financial
industry at some point

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.869
so here's another guy so i don't think i
remain you elected made eighteen million

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.869
dollars at a hedge fund then you know he
was too enamored with the banking

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.579
industry so then pending bill daley who
just in the one year alone i'd make a

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.220
point seven million dollars

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.830
from j_p_ morgan while thank god bill
daley is gonna lose it next jackal was

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.120
made millions from citigroup

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.700
now he made me as a couple question the
waves

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.380
was by betting against the sub-prime of
mortgage market

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.560
so when the economy crashed they did
better but i actually don't find out

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.990
what it all up but we made the correct
that on that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.799
he worked in finance i'd get it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.869
he shorted out what he should have
shorted

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.740
that's not my problem with jack lou

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.680
if you have a bone to pick with annette
citigroup it should be that

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.560
in fact most of his bats word does that
stress

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.009
in fact in one year alone his group that
he was heading

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.120
loss over five hundred million dollars

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.360
after that year their losses were so bad
they stop reporting them publicly

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.100
that new bosses for group that his group
dot merge with in total o'rourke y

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.630
fifteen billion dollars any any visa and
i said he won seventy lost some what

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.079
business is that of ours

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.379
what became are businessmen citigroup
got forty five billion dollars in their

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.149
lives

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:17.679
and bad

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:23.010
rewarded jack lou at number nine hundred
thousand dollars involve issues

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.029
on his way out the door two weeks later
uses ido bombing administration

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.119
that's a problem

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:34.419
i don't mind if you win on some betsy
made on your own you lose and that

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:36.420
seemed out of bed a that's your problem

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.629
not my problem but what i'm saying you
are a million blocks

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.559
for your guest after

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.730
for your aptech collapsed of sitting at
that you had to get out of the about

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.950
may use my bailout money to get the
jackal any comes inside the office

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.989
what do you think he suggests of course
it every positioning dictated all

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.079
bombing restrictions that are no don't
deregulation the bags

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.059
uh... let's i'm sorry don't do
regulation of the banks we should be

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:06.180
regulated by stephen moore klickovic
even crazier wristband costs even more

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.129
money

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.510
so jack will get another spoons

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.659
of wall street that president obama has
promoted congratulations that's awesome

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.999
and that let's give you some of the more
uh... so more details to be absolutely

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:18.910
clear

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.310
when he was going on for confirmation
and he was at some point actually

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.360
talking the senate budget committee
abrasiveness is asking me wait a minute

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.089
now

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.509
fitting deregulation caused the problem
the fact that you degrade all the rules

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:31.779
when wall street

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.809
he said quote in that testimony

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.619
the problem in the financial industry
proceeded deregulation

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.089
by personally don't know the extent to
which the regulation drill bit

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:48.019
but i don't believe that the regulation
was approximate cost wrong again bob

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.729
was the cause was you know allow the
companies that mingle are you know

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.140
deposit or money

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.680
with the money that they were gambling
with and you will love them to then

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.900
against their own clients and then you
allow them to make as big a bet as you

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.969
want in two thousand four that's easy

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.370
took away the limits on the size of the
best they could have so they could

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.969
leverage up to the health

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:12.809
all those things and then some all the
regulations

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.649
all lead to that epic collapsed

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:16.100
interact lou

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.359
in a best case scenario is totally eight
none of that

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.979
well the diesel fuel

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.919
and the fact that he's a chief of staff
who are presently is an embarrassment

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.720
but i'm afraid he's not ignorant of that

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.430
he carried gain substantially from that
that is for the prop that meanwhile of

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.270
course the mainstream press loves
jackson

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.009
he works with the republicans are not
quite calm so he has been great

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.739
bipartisan guy

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:42.189
five years the new york times

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.120
little has built a reputation

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.650
as a pragmatic liberal that was the one

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.360
that sells you out all the time the
republic is

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.350
pragmatic liberal who believes that a
person was compromise on republicans

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.530
all long-term deficit is in order for us
told to connie in cuts the entitlement

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.360
programs

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.430
like medicare and social security

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.250
that's always there code words like on o
i had to give it ribbons everything they

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.180
wanted so that we wouldn't have even
more cuts later

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.389
medicare associated no i didn't

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.979
you get their problems or they want to
cuz you are republican you might not

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.399
think you're a republican unity party
democrat my whole life

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.500
but what are your actions indicating

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.750
when the republicans deregulated allot
one program the financial industry

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.370
you'll love them

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.860
but nobody using the bailouts in you got
nearly a million bucks off that they'll

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.580
add you loved it

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.270
when our problems contacts on the rich
people like you and your friends

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.229
loved it

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.500
that's because you are republican uart

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.009
deeply concerned

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.290
and so whatever president obama must
replace

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.820
anybody in his administration you take
off my god

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.390
hope was around the corner maybe isn't
on the right direction we all about your

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.949
left before the election even less than
a year and here comes from an suv obama

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.120
concepts

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.649
and guide doesn't have it an interpreter
progressive

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:57.760
he doesn't believe in progressivism

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.440
he believes enforces dot was less
explicit who's in favor of themselves

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.350
and jacqueline dialogue is going to talk
about it

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.059
imagine president bottom out and fax it
baby

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:09.509
progresses as she was that

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.169
any other hosts only owner know

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.759

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.760
note because of privacy can't do x y z

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.550
what they say that i've been doing the
congress it's his chief-of-staff

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.020
when every possible someone is in a
circle is own
