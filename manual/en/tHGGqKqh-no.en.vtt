Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.640
[pause]

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.840
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.280
In another DermTV episode I discussed how
it’s perfectly normal to lose 100

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.130
hairs a day, to grow 100 hairs a day, and
that this results in no balding

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.870
and no change in the density of hair on your
scalp. But what happens if

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.480
you’re losing more hairs each day than you’re
growing? Then you have “real”

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.230
hair loss and in that case, you need to see
a dermatologist to have the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.800
diagnosis made so you can be treated. But
the good news is, most cases of

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.390
hair loss can be treated and you can get your
full head of hair restored.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.069
Today, I’d like to discuss the three most
common cause of diffuse hair loss

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:49.539
in women in their 20’s and 30’s. In another
episode I’ll discuss hair loss

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.749
from sex hormones and also from side effects
from medications. And when I

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.659
say diffuse hair loss, I mean a general thinning
throughout the scalp, not

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.569
a bald patch in one place. So the first most
common cause is an abnormal

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.900
thyroid. The thyroid can be overactive or
underactive, but it’s easily

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.870
diagnosed with a simple blood test and easily
fixed and your hair re-grows.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.350
The second most common cause? Iron deficiency
 - anemia - usually caused by

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.570
excessive menstrual flow, but even in women
with normal menstrual flow, it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.600
can occur in when they don’t eat enough
meat, chicken, fish and certain

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.880
fruits and vegetables which are the highest
source of iron. It’s easily

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.200
diagnosed with a blood test and easily fixed
with iron supplements. The

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.250
third cause has to do with extreme shock to
the system and when that

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.300
happens, it’s very scary because you can
lose up to 50% of your scalp hair

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.210
in 3 months. This usually occurs when there’s
an extreme stress on the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.170
system. That stress can be physical, it can
be emotional. Physical stresses

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.200
are high fevers, temperatures of over 105
or 106, general anesthesia,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.310
childbirth, a serious automobile accident,
and emotional stress could be

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.500
the death of a loved one. In all of these
cases, the hair cycle becomes

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.910
more synchronic, that means instead of 90%
of the hairs growing at one

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.200
time, 95 or 98% grow at the same time which
means more of them enter the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.890
resting phase at the same time so there’s
much more fallout synchronously

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.500
and that’s why you lose so much in such
a short period of time. The good

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.000
news is, 3 to 6 months later all of those
follicles wake up, all of your

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:47.510
hair re-grows and you get a full head of hair
and your happy ever after.
