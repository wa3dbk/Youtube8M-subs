00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:11.766
Tonight's program
is a symphonic journey,

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:14.302
touching down
in seven different countries,

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.637
and with the help of
video and music,

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:19.807
we'll gain an appreciation
for how 19th-century Europe

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:22.777
helped shape the beautiful world
that we live in today.

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:27.014
The theme of the concert is
romanticism and nationalism.

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:29.541
Nearly all the music
we'll hear today

00:00:29.607 --> 00:00:31.910
is from about the same
generation,

00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:34.813
from the late 1800s,
from the Romantic Age,

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.615
and this music championed
national causes

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:40.385
and it also supported
this exciting notion

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:44.222
of common people finally taking
the reins in their society.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:48.817
The 19th century was a time
of national awakenings.

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:52.053
All over Europe,
from Finland to Bulgaria,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.389
little national groups
were on the rise.

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:57.626
The Czechs were one of these
and they struggled heroically,

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:59.628
surrounded
by bigger neighbors --

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:02.764
Austrian Hapsburgs,
Germans and Russians.

00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:07.235
Now, romantic music championed
both the causes of these people,

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:09.871
and it did it with art
and it did it with music.

00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:12.440
In the Romantic Age,
for the Czech people,

00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:13.909
Smetana was a favorite.

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:17.245
This piece is named for the most
important river

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:18.814
in the Czech Republic.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.584
It flows and it connects
the culture like a thread.

00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:25.120
And it also helped preserve
the identity,

00:01:25.187 --> 00:01:28.023
the culture and the language
of the Czech people

00:01:28.089 --> 00:01:29.758
amid those bigger neighbors.

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:32.527
The piece is like
a landscape portrait,

00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:34.930
and when you listen
to the music,

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:37.599
you get caught up in the melody
and you almost flow

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:40.135
through the forests,
through the villages,

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:42.904
and finally
into the capital city of Prague.

00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:45.373
And at the same time,
the music evokes

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.009
the persistent
and the heroic struggle

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:49.544
of the Czech people.

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:50.879
To this day,

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:54.316
Czechs get a lump
in their throat when they hear

00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:58.019
Smetana's hauntingly beautiful
melody, "The Moldau."
