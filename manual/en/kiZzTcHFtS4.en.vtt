Logic Board Removal

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.100 position:98%
To begin, grab your flat head and your phillips head screwdriver.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.700 position:97%
You will need to take extra care as this is the most sensitive piece

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.800
in the machine.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300 position:59%
Begin by removing the bar at the left.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.400 position:64%
First undo the first phillips head screw.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.400
Then remove the plastic piece.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.000
Remove the second screw in the bar.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 position:59%
Remove the magsafe cable located here.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.400 position:97%
You may need your flat head screwdriver to remove the power cable.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800
Once thats loose move that back.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200 position:84%
And remove the speaker held by one screw located here.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.800 position:73%
There you will notice another screw in the bar.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.000
Remove that.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.700
Now the bar should lift free.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.000
Simply lift up.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.600 position:86%
The speaker may need to be removed in removing the bar.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.600 position:58%
That snaps right off the Logic Board.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400 position:84%
Once thats removed you can continue to remove the bar.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.700
Once the bar is removed,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.400 position:98%
you will want to remove your battery connector and reed switch.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.500 position:98%
Get your flat head screwdriver and gently pry up on the battery cable

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.300
These are very fragile gold tips,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.600 position:63%
so take extra caution in removing these.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.100 position:97%
Once that is removed, remove the phillips head screw located here.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.700
There is another located here.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.700
And one in the very top.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000 position:67%
Once those are removed grab the Logic Board

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.600
at the right hand side.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.200 position:72%
And remove the inverter cable at the very top.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.000 position:72%
And once thats free, gently work your way out.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.700
And lift up and out to remove.
