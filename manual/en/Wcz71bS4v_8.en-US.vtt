00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.810
Have you heard the last news about Balotelli and Fico? But We dont care about this!  

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.239
Have you ever wondered how goku can fly?

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.299
Or how many energy dissipates Pikachu in one shock

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.469
Or why the goal of Holly and Benji disappears beyond the line of the horizon?

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.630
No? Well of course only a mad person would think about this

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.359
but we are physicists

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.380
and we are a bit crazy!

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.619
We will show you that physics is not the boring subject 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.479
that you have studied at school

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:36.080
as an example today we will make a funny calculus thanks to goku!

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.180
No, dont worry, its easy!

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.830
Do you remember when Goku goes to kaioh's planet?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.600
He cant stand because the gravity force is very strong

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330
10 times the one on earth

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.830
If this apple would have fallen on newton's head

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.430
He would have died and you weren't watching this stupid ehm...

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.500
awesome video

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.180
How can a planet so small have a gravitational force so strong?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.270
Let's find out

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.650
In this photo we can stimate the radius of the planet to be about 10 meters

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.800
Our dear Sir Isaac Newton tells us that force is equal to mass times accellerations

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.350
But we know that F is the gravitational force

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.530
So we can deduce the mass of the planet knowing that the accelleration is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.240
Is 10 g

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.060
G Is the terrestrial accelleration

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.840
What keep us on the ground

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.840
But it doesn't work for Goku

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.320
Let's write the value of the gravitational costant

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.510
And here tha value of the mass of tle planet

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.610
The mass of tle planet is about one thousand of bilions times the mass of the car of Kaioh

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.660
Let's find the density, that indicates how much mass is contained in a volume

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.770
The volume of a sphere is...

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.770
ehm... Mumble Mumble

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.370
Four over Three pi r cube

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.650
Mabye is better if i talk...

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.190
you dont even know the volume of the sphere

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.200
The value of the density is about 3 times 10 elevated at ten kg over meters cube

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.369
with a quick comparison we can note that it is 10 milion times the density of earth and sun

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.769
and only one hundred thousand times less than the density of a neutron star

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.479
So Kaioh's planet is the second most dense object in the universe

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.329
If you liked the video dont forget to subscribe this channel...

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:23.249
I had to tell this!

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:30.249
No me

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.459
Who will win the struggle? who will obtain the paternity of the project and overall...

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.869
were will be put the link??
