00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.133
Mr. Goolsbee:
Hi, I'm Austan Goolsbee,
Chairman of the Council of

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.767
Economic Advisers.

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:10.233
And if you've been watching
these White Boards,

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.266
you know that we've been talking
about how to out-educate,

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.567
out-innovate, and out-build the
rest of the world as part of the

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.100
President's "Winning
the Future" agenda.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.000
And you also know that
on the White Board website,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.834
I've been asking for your
ideas for White Boards.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:27.967
And we got some great ones,
including one here from Pauline

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:31.800
Villager in California, who
raised an issue very close to my

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.600
heart, which is
the patent system.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.567
So today, we're going to talk
about what we're doing to

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:41.266
improve the patent system and
get more ideas turned into

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.000
companies and jobs.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.066
When Alexander Graham Bell
invented the telephone in the

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:51.266
1800s, he applied and got
his patent in a month.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.300
In 1974, the main patent
for the cell phone,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.367
they still could get that
in less than two years.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:02.800
But today, we've had the number
of patent applications grow

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.233
enormously -- they've almost
tripled in the last 20 years.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:11.867
And now we've got a massive
backlog of more than 700,000

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:15.567
patents who haven't even had
their applications opened.

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:22.133
The average patent in 2011 takes
almost three years to get.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:26.367
And thousands of them take
many years more than that.

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:29.567
The thing is, three
years is far too long.

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:35.233
To put that in some context: If
you look at the failure rate of

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:42.233
new businesses, in that
kind of time frame,

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:47.233
more than one-third of
them have ceased to exist.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:51.367
In a survey of venture
capital-backed startups,

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:56.300
three-quarters of them said that
having a patent was critical for

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.667
them being able to
secure financing.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:02.500
So if we're just waiting for
people to have their application

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.433
opened and then reviewed, they
aren't going to be able to be

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:10.000
out there creating the kinds of
jobs that we're gonna need to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.367
out-innovate the
rest of the world.

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:16.000
On top of that, with so many
applications and so few

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
resources, mistakes
can get through.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.066
Actually, a patent for a
crustless peanut butter and

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:26.800
jelly sandwich got through --
who knew that my mom should have

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.400
been paying royalties
back in the day?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.867
Look, in all seriousness,
mistaken patents can gum up the

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:37.500
legal system for years; they can
cost millions of dollars and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.200
slow down innovation.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.633
So we've got to improve
this system significantly.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:46.133
The Obama Administration has
put forward a plan to fix these

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.800
patent problems.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.867
We're gonna cut the average
delay by more than 40%.

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:56.767
The patent office is going to
create a fast track procedure so

00:02:56.767 --> 00:03:00.066
that inventors, with their
most important ideas,

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.100
could get approval
within 12 months.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.700
And we will introduce a patent
review process after patents are

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.834
granted to try to quickly and
fairly resolve any patent

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:16.400
disputes without getting
embroiled in years of legal limbo.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.367
The good news is, the patent
office doesn't even cost money

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.367
-- it raises money.

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:26.233
But funds have been diverted
away from the patent office

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:28.567
itself to other things.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:32.300
We've got to let the patent
office keep its own revenues so

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.433
that they can address the needs
that American inventors and

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:39.266
businesses have so they can
grow jobs here in this country.

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:40.800
So patents are key.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.000
We've talked about
Startup America,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.867
we've talked about the
Wireless Broadband Initiative;

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:49.667
we've talked about a whole lotta
ways that we're gonna win the future.

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:52.200
We got the greatest
inventors in the world,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.400
and it's time we give them the
help they need to bring this

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.333
country where it needs to be.
