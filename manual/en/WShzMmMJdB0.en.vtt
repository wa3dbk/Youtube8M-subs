00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:26.090
For a lot of reasonsóchief among them my
boredom with industry trendsóI tend to gravitate

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.489
toward video games with artistic ambition.

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.340
Whether that ambition succeeds or not is,
of course, an issue.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.970
But if a game is at least trying to do something
differentóto create some unique aesthetic

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.050
experienceóit at least gets my attention.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.620
If I want realism, I go outside.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.040
Outside does it a lot better than video games.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:56.740
Besides, why strive for realistic facial animations
when youíre free to create things like this?

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:06.510
And I guess this is actually the easiest way
to reference...this.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.610
Itís a nice, ambiguous pronoun that provides
no connotation and allows this to explain

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.960
itself on its own terms.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.350
But for the purposes of, you know, game review...I
guess this is like Pac-Man, only in wall-less

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.170
mazes that spin...and if, when finished, Pac-Man
ate them.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.500
Of course, we canít very well spend an entire
review using just pronouns.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.750
So this is actually calledóand how awesome
is thisóCatball Eats It All.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.670
It comes from the team over at Broken Compass
Studios.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.299
Thatís a second awesome name, and in addition
to proving Broken Compass Studios has an outstanding

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.120
naming department, this also suggests they
appreciate a bit of irony.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.149
Because Broken Compass Studios definitely
has the right direction.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.640
The first thing that strikes you about Catball
Eats It All is that it is, for lack of a better

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.090
phrase, really **** bizarre.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.310
And that **** bizarreness has two primary
rootsóthe objective and the appearance.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.930
You are Catball, and like Pac-Man before you,
itís your job to eat it all.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.950
This is a classic tenet of game designóthe
idea of collecting all the stuff in a single

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.950
stage.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:39.860
What makes it interesting in this application
is...well, everything.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.010
For one, the items have no apparent rhyme,
reason or even continuity.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.690
Youíre eating a bunch of crowns right now,
but youíll eat socks in a few minutes.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.540
Two, you actually have to eat the entire maze.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.159
So even after youíve eaten all the stuff,
your plate still isnít clean.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.220
And three, you canít just take your time.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.630
Youíre under the constant pursuit of a gigantic
canine, and if you canít finish before timeís

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:25.260
up, Dogwall...Dogwall does something terrible.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.730
This really separates the game from its inspirations.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.250
You have to move fast.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.140
And the game does a tremendous job of making
you feel the pressure, an effect it pulls

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.370
off in large part because of its aforementioned
style.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.810
The level starts to get dark as time expires,
which creates a real sense of foreboding.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.330
Strange as it may sound, being stalked by
Dogwall is genuinely creepy.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.739
But itís more than just that which hunts
you.

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.720
Catball Eats It All has a surreal art style,
reminiscent of Terry Gilliamís animations

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.739
in Monty Python...only with a darker Alice
In Wonderland kind of twist.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.400
The characters have a wide-eyed gaze that
never breaks, looking out at you from their

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.010
strange world with an almost deranged stare.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.590
This style isnít just memorable, but it also
serves a purpose.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.550
It creates real tension, and that makes eating
it all a bit tougher to swallow.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.810
Strange as it may seem, this is also a really
challenging game.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:34.210
Itís such a unique take on an classic idea,
managing to be beautiful, creepy and fun simultaneously.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.890
The touch controls work great, and itís a
free download in the App Store with loads

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.290
of extra levels available as in-app purchases.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:52.340
For a game like Catball Eats It All, thatís
a price I donít mind paying.
