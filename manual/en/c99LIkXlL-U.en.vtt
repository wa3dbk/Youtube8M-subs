00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.809
for high and Diane Wallace welcome to
Adorama TV

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.400
today we're talking about the Flashpoint Blast Power Pack a portable power

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.619
pack from flashpoint and has some great
features let me show you

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.660
the flashpoint blast pack is a terrific
lightweight

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.689
inexpensive option from flashpoint for
your portable power

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.559
the blast pack will give you about 1800
shot at full power which is really

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.360
terrific

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.649
but on the off chance that you make it
through all that recharging is really

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.329
simple

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.510
because all you do is pop the battery of
and replace it with another one

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.559
so you should have never interrupted
from loss of power

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.610
with the other brands that are out there
right now once they die you have to put

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.600
the whole thing in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.460
don't have this kind of flexibility last
pack has an LED indicator on the top to

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.539
let you know where your battery life ins

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.960
and also hopes to connections say if
you're shooting with two cameras you got

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.170
to flash is going

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.080
you can power them both really simply an
easily right from top

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.150
this pack so it's much lighter weight
than what you maybe are used to right

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.760
now

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.640
it is extremely lightweight for a
battery pack so with the carrying

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.689
strap that comes with it it's really
simple to get around using this power

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.659
charging this battery only takes about
three hours saving it started shooting

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.560
really quickly

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.950
I think this blast pack for a test drive
very recently

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.960
and use it with Mike while light which

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.450
are notoriously jus hungry and I got
great we cycle times from this

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.579
it was actually a full power only about
two seconds recycle

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.680
and at half power and last near

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.399
instance so I was popping classes and
going really quickly

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.159
the battery had no trouble keeping up
the blast Pakistan attractions

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.579
and it's compatible with pretty much
everything out there so when they

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.219
shooting with your speedlights

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.750
are climbing packs are other brands you
can pretty much know that this battery

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.820
pack is going to work with them

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.720
it's a great system to have it's very
inexpensive it's very affordable so

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.160

to your set that you already use
