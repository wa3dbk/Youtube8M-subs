Hi, everybody!
My name is Sergei Polanskii

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.120
and today I am going to
show you a really cool

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.270
Dunlop ZW-45 Zakk Wylde
Signature Cry Baby Wah pedal.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.210
This pedal is crafted with
a heavy-duty raw-metal

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.740
casting which is valued so much when we
talk about numerous concert performances,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.480
because it is not going to break.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.890
It has rubber top that will not let your
foot slip off the pedal during a concert.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.180
There is also Zakk Wyldeâ€™s
embossed bullseye logo.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.050
It has no extra settings,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.710
it already sounds the way
it is supposed to sound.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.970
You can power this pedal with
a 9V battery or an adaptor.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:05:20.170
