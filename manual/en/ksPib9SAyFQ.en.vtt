00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.529
We use Pupil Premium to ensure...

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.509
...our experiences and achievements
at school...

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.679
...donâ€™t depend on what our parents
or carers earn

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.240
We use our Pupil Premium funding to
support all of our vulnerable families

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.240
by providing parent support and
support for children when they

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.400
start school.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.040
Pupil Premium means I get to
do ukulele.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.010
By having smaller size classes
in Maths I get more time with my

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.970
teacher so they can help me. This also
improves my confidence and my levels.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.570
What was really interesting about
judging the awards was that we

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.780
decided to look innovative, bold and
effective interventions and activities

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.739
and what we saw from across the country
was schools doing really exciting and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.730
interesting activities that we
can share with other schools

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.800
and we can all learn from.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.780
Pupil Premium means we get to do
Drama.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.550
I used to get really angry at
everything and I used to get

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.110
sent home every day, but when I
start going with Vicky it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.150
really helped me and now I
have not really got into trouble and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.990
I never get angry again.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.850
Radio station... we're the only
school that has one

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.850
in the whole of Yorkshire and Humber.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.420
Pupil Premium allows us to provide
extra one to one support, weekend and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.950
holiday revision classes, additional
enrichment opportunities or

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.940
awards programmes to drive success.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.930
I was particularly impressed by those
applications that were evidently

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.280
using research evidence underpinning
the strategies that they were applying.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.190
For example, those schools that were
focusing very much on the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.499
basics, on literacy and numeracy
and one to one help in those areas

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:16.279
and that were also working
very directly with the young people

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.319
to raise attainment.
