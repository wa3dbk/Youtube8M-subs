00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.720
Two of you guys pull it pretty tight.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720
That's good right there.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.570
So now I'm on this, right?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.820
But I'm also on my Dorsal-D. And now the guy
up here has to undo this dorsal-D, but both

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.340
of them are under tension right now.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.340
Right?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.960
So now three of you grab the rope with your
hands, nope the top rope.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.369
Everything you've got into it.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.020
Just lean, lean, like literally... boom!

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.900
No just literally just like that.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.050
He can undo my dorsal D, now slowly let it
down.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.090
So you've vectored me.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:53.230
Now you can take that device, you want to
show them?

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.770
And you have it locked, right?

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.920
So you would have locked that into position.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.320
No that's good, all you have to do, yeah,
you're grabbing the rope.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.320
Hand brake it, yeah.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.689
See how he's lowering me?

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.320
200 feet to the ground.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.189
Just like that, one guy.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.350
Super easy.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.030
So that's how they rescued me.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.009
That quick.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.920
The ropes already up there, right?

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.840
They always have a rope up there.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.060
All the way down to the ground.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.079
The ground guy sets up off the bumper of their
car.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.229
Cause they already have a capstan winch of
the back of one of their vehicles.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.950
They have all that gear ready.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.279
Bag's down on the ground, guys walk... walk
not run.

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.170
No panic, no hurry in rescues.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.350
All that does is get somebody hurt.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990
Walk it up to the bumper.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.960
Put it on the bumper.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.799
Rig up the Petzl I'D, right?

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.359
Pull the, the guy clips into his partner's
dorsal D, these guys tighten it up just a

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.909
little bit like you saw the first time, right?

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.619
You get it tightened up.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.350
Lock it all the way down and over, right?

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.350
And then once you have it locked down and
over, that's in the safe position.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.399
Then you vector it.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.250
Just like you guys did.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.280
Two guys could have done it, right?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.099
You didn't even have to lift me that high.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.340
Usually all you have to do is lift somebody
that much.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.040
And they're off their dorsal.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.170
The guy unclips the dorsal, now I'm on that
main line, that make sense?

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.180
So he would be hanging from a separate thing
already.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.459
The guy goes up, he gets clipped into him,
you pick him up, he takes off that twin-leg,

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.760
or the self retracting lifeline, or whatever
they're hanging from.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.200
What ever they've fallen, slipped, whatever
they've done so that they're hanging on that

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.260
dorsal-d.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.749
Something was already there, this wasn't there
initially.
