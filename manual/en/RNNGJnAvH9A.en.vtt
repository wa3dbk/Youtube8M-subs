00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.210
I'm gonna show you how easy it is to carve
convincing stone block tunnel portals, retaining

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.350
walls, and other structures out of foam insulation.
A 10 dollar 4 x 8 sheet will make a lot!

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.130
The tools you will need are an old soldering
iron, sandpaper, knife, a guide board to make

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.339
the blocks, mine is ¾" wide and thick enough
for my soldering iron. A ¾" square stick,

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.519
a square, and a wire brush. And not pictured
is a tape measure.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.450
Using a 14" square piece of blue foam, mark
the center, and measure out 3 and a half inches.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:43.110
Draw vertical lines, and a peak at 9"
Transfer the center mark to the peak and using

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:54.100
the ¾" square block, straddle the center
and mark each side. This will be the bottom

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.610
of the keystone.
Now using the square block AGAIN, line it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.829
up against the side of the keystone mark and
the arch line. Draw the other two sides, move

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.490
to the next position against the arch so that
the lines will be radiating out from the arch

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.630
and continue drawing around the blocks. You
don't have to be too precise at this point.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.570
You will use these lines as guides and can
alter them slightly while carving.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.020
Now take the square block, placing it a block
higher, this time lining the edge to center

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.500
and mark the other side. Repeat this on the
other side of center. Now you can draw in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.329
the sides of the keystone, but save the top
till later. So this is the rough outline.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.350
This is to show you how the guide board works
with the soldering iron. The tip will penetrate

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.909
the foam by around ¼" . and The shaft will
ride the board to give a steady depth. Exaggerate

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.859
the depth at this point because you will wear
down the blocks later.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.459
This is how to run the horizontal courses.
Line the board up at the bottom and using

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:04.249
the board as a guide, melt a line across the
foam. Then move the board up one course by

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:17.630
lining it up with the previous line, and melt
the next line. Lather rinse and repeat until

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:27.830
you have laid all the courses.
Once all the courses are done, turn the foam

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.890
90 degrees and start carving the vertical
lines for the blocks. Line the guide board

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.720
up with the end and melt every other course,
move the guide board lining it up with the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:52.560
last set of vertical lines, and then alternate,
skipping every other course. Continue in the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.180
alternating pattern and you'll start to see
the blocks.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.590
This is how the tunnel portal looks after
carving the blocks.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.350
At this point, cut out the portal using the
knife. You won't get nice edges, but we'll

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.600
fix that later.
Continue the mortar lines around the edges

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:20.760
inside the portal, do the same to the the
top and sides. I even continue the mortar

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:30.080
lines around the back slightly.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.770
Now that all the mortar lines are melted in,
I turn to the wire brush. I use one meant

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.820
for a drill because I have fingertip control,
but a regular wire brush would work. Start

00:03:40.820 --> 00:04:09.330
with the edges and square them up to the pattern,
but round off the sharp corners.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.270
When it comes to the block face, vary the
depth and pressure at various spots to give

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.090
more 3D to the blocks. When wirebrushing the
portal, I will undercut the blocks next the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.510
arch and the top so that the arch and top
stands out more. Don't be afraid to get too

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:46.350
aggressive, just go with the grain across

00:04:46.350 --> 00:06:01.730
the blocks and dig in more or less here and
there.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.590
After a few evenings of work, you'll have
enough tunnel portals and retaining walls

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.900
for your whole layout.
Now paint them with a light color latex house

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.410
paint. this color was left-over from our house.
It can be interior paint since it will be

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.030
sealed later. You can get these sample paints
from Lowes for a couple bucks in any color.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.690
It is important to get a good base coat, since
if there are pinholes, the spray sealer will

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.280
attack the foam. Once the base coat is thoroughly
dry I mix a brown latex paint with 10 parts

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.220
water to make it thin and runny. I Slather
it on top of the base coat. if it's too thick,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.900
I hit it with a water sprayer in spots. Stand
it up and let it run off.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.840
Once the brown is dry, I take a black latex
thinned with about 10 part water and slather

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:59.490
that on. This time, I stand it upside down
to dry.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.470
Now that everything is dry, spray it with
a krylon matte or satin finish sealer to protect

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:12.370
it from UV and start to set them on your layout.
7 new tunnels in a week. And some retaining

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.870
walls.
Thanks for watching. I hope I explained the

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.910
steps clearly. You can turn these out in no
time.
