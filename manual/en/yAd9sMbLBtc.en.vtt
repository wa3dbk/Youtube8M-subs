Hello YouTube in this video I thought I would give you a few hints and tips on how to use

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.870
this. A smartphone a wee bit more properly

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.219
especially with the cameras. I see a lot of people using the camera wrong

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.250
especially when they are taking videos. If you're going to be taken videos  

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.390
you want to have your phone this way and not that way. 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.500
So we will jump into this and we will see why!

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.250
So as you can see I have set my phone up so as it's portrait 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.010
basically up and down. Which a lot of people think is the right way 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.739
mainly as it fills the screen this way. 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.540
As you can see whenever I stick the video I have recorded 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.640
from my phone onto the next clip you will see why it leaves it 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.000
that there is black lines running down the sides

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.920
Okay so this is the video in portrait mode as you can see there is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.290
big black lines down the left and right hand side. Which when you

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.769
upload it to the likes of Facebook or YouTube,

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.610
Google+, or even to Twitter it just doesn't look right!  

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.160
It doesn't even fill the screen, it's not even like letterbox format 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.460
you can see the idea of why you need to hold the phone sideways

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.560
Okay so now I have set my phone

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.009
up this way which is now in landscape. It feels a bit awkward to start of 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.390
with especially if you're used to having your phone this way 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.649
but as you can see with the next clip
you'll see why it fills the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.910
screen a lot, lot more properly and that's the way phones should be taken videos and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.330
even taken pictures as well

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.410
A lot of people make the mistake of taken pictures that way as well

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.560
which should be that way. So we will let you the video looks like from the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.500
phone so as you get a rough idea.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.200
So this is recorded in landscape mode which as you can see

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.080
fills the complete screen and you don't have the black lines down each side.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.170
This is why if you're taken any pictures or taken any video

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.289
you keep your phone on the side with the camera

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.690
near or enough always up at the top. So as you can get that

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.810
even far better shot and your pictures/videos 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.000
will come out ten times better than what they were before.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.300
Hopefully that quick video has gave you a rough idea of why you take pictures/videos 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.340
that way with your phone

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.450
and not that way as I see a lot of people do.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.870
