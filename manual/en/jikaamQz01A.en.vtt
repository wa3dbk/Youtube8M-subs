00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.676
(upbeat music)

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:05.544
- Hi, everybody!

00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:07.371
These are potatoes.

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:11.564
We are going to make delicious
Korean side dish with this.

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:16.042
It's called algamja-jorim,
braised potatoes.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:19.778
Nobody likes a lot of wrinkles,
except for these guys.

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:22.501
When I see somebody
makes this algamja-jorim,

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:26.085
how I judge this person
is a good cook or not

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:30.677
is that I see, "Okay, how
many wrinkles you have?

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:33.627
(laughs) "Okay, is it wrinkly or not?"

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:37.412
Today, I will make it really
wrinkle, wrinkle chewy.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.283
Skin is wrinkly, braised with soy sauce.

00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:42.580
Inside is still fluffy.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.642
We are going to make this with
really simple ingredients.

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:49.902
Get this, small, little babies first.

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:53.242
Okay, these guys are one pound, one pound.

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:56.654
I usually make two pounds,
but for you guys today,

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.936
I will just make this only one pound.

00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:04.990
Okay anything just like, look at this, broken.

00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:20.369
Rinse this.

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:34.619
This is my pan, 11-inch
pan. Thick pan is better.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.544
Medium heat. Add some vegetable oil.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.506
And then, just add this.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.642
And then, cover.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.933
This recipe is so simple.

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:53.198
By the way, these days, a
lot of my fellow Koreans

00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:54.426
are watching my videos.

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:56.614
I made Korean/English captions,

00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:59.006
so I hope that my Korean friends

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:00.392
are just coming to see

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:03.644
and then learn how to make
delicious Korean food. (laughs)

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:08.571
Speaking Korean: I hope Korean captions are helping you make delicious Korean dishes.

00:02:13.358 --> 00:02:17.345
Five minutes after, I
like to shake these guys.

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:24.414
20 minutes, I'm going to cook.

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:26.855
So every five minutes, just stir this.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.992
All sides is going to be crunchy.

00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:48.898
So soon, it's going to be cooked fully,

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:53.667
and I'm going to use just
one large garlic clove.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:03:00.188
You can mince or just
just like me, thinly.

00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:02.587
Thin strips like this.

00:03:02.587 --> 00:03:06.540
And then, let's see these
guys are fully cooked.

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.761
So largest guy, I will use this one.

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.668
Let's skew it. Yeah,
easily go through this.

00:03:13.668 --> 00:03:15.967
It's well cooked. Can you see the skins?

00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:18.021
It's look crispy.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.203
We need some salty stuff.

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:24.008
I will use soy sauce.

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:29.011
One, two, three.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.511
And turn down the heat.

00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:37.659
So I use soy sauce and
this mulyeot, rice syrup.

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.986
If you don't have rice syrup,
you can add brown sugar

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:45.272
or white sugar, but this
one makes it really shiny.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.193
Three tablespoon.

00:03:47.215 --> 00:03:49.375
And garlic.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:58.461
Once we add all the soy sauce,

00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:01.196
you will see more wrinkles coming.

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:05.659
Over medium heat, we are
going to braise this.

00:04:21.023 --> 00:04:22.598
Getting shiny and shiny.

00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:24.618
Really low heat and simmer.

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:29.257
So oh my, beautiful, shiny! Turn off.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.573
And next, I'm going to add
one drop of sesame oil.

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:35.062
Is it okay? (laughs)

00:04:46.393 --> 00:04:48.830
Add some sesame seeds.

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:05.202
If you do this Korean food party,

00:05:05.202 --> 00:05:08.988
you can just serve this as a appetizer.

00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:13.210
Really, I will give you some
example, really pretty idea.

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:18.009
Look at that! Really pretty, eh?

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.803
So I did once and then people loved this.

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:23.583
"What is it?" I said, "This
is a potato!" (laughs)

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:27.126
Korean algamja-jorim. People
say that, "Wow, really pretty!"

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.717
And then, they love this.

00:05:28.717 --> 00:05:30.830
And this is just as a side dish.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.559
What are you going to do with this?

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.053
You are not going to throw away.

00:05:34.053 --> 00:05:37.629
You can chop up some kimchi
and with some hot rice,

00:05:37.632 --> 00:05:41.071
put it on the stove and stir-fry
with some hot pepper paste

00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:42.348
and make bibimbap.

00:05:42.348 --> 00:05:43.866
This is perfect.

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:47.052
Again, so see a lot of wrinkles, this guy.

00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:49.526
Look at that. Isn't he?

00:05:49.526 --> 00:05:53.541
Yeah, look at that. It's
like a turtle shell. (laughs)

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:56.496
It reminds me of turtle shell. (laughs)

00:05:56.496 --> 00:05:59.180
Okay, so hot.

00:06:02.323 --> 00:06:03.834
Mmm.

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:09.363
I love it. If I love it, you
also love it, I know. (giggles)

00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:14.017
Texture of the skin is irresistible.

00:06:16.092 --> 00:06:20.168
Mmm, I used to make this
for my children's lunch box,

00:06:20.168 --> 00:06:23.641
so whenever I make lunch box,
I make this algamja-jorim.

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:28.088
They love it. Shiny stuff is
never gone until lunch hour.

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:30.511
Lunch box when they open,
this is still shiny.

00:06:30.511 --> 00:06:34.921
Today, we made algamja-jorim.
Enjoy my recipe.

00:06:34.921 --> 00:06:38.078
See you next time! Bye!
