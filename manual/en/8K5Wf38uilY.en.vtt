00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.630
Basic Understanding of cPanel

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.520
cPanel is a web hosting control panel that
is used by most web hosting providers to allow

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.720
their customers to interact with their Web
servers.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.359
cPanel allows those who don’t have a computer
science degree to use a graphic interface

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.619
to perform almost everything you need to do
on a UNIX web server.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.019
In this video will take a short tour of the
items that are included on most cPanel setups

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.270
and what you can do with cPanel.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.989
When you signed up with your web host they
gave you a link to access the cPanel on your

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.199
account.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.649
Using that login information, let’s go to
your cPanel.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.129
The 1st thing you’ll notice is that the
opening page, or dashboard, has basic information

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.479
about your account on the left and icons of
different actions you can perform on the right.

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.789
Along the top can be a series of tabs that
allows you to access other areas of cPanel

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.750
and your web hosting account or it can all
be included in the icons on the right.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.640
Every web hosting provider is a little different
about what is included in the data on the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.259
left, the icons on the right, and sometimes
the tabs on the top.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.360
On the left you should see mostly data about
your account–your domains, your e-mail accounts,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.100
your monthly bandwidth, and lots more.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.850
On the right side, the icons are grouped together
in categories.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.110
You can move these category boxes up and down
based on what order you want to access them.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.539
One thing you’ll want to look for in the
box labeled “ software/services” is something

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.950
called either Simple Scripts or Fantastico.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.409
These are service companies that allow you
to have simplified set up of most of the popular

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.600
content management systems.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.990
If neither of these appear in your software
services box, it does not mean that you can’t

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.680
set up a CMS like WordPress or Joomla on your
server–it just means you will have to do

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.039
it manually.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.539
You will use many of the icons in your cPanel
regularly, but it’s probably a good idea

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.750
to get started with the “getting started
Wizard” if you have not worked with cPanel

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.750
before.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.110
It is usually located on the upper left corner
of the “Preferences” category box.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.200
When you go to set up e-mail addresses for
your domain, look in the mail category box.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
You will either use the “e-mail accounts”
or “forwarders” icons shown here.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.160
Our video “Setting Up Your Own Business
Email Address” provides details on how to

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.950
perform this process.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.290
There is a category box for Logs, which is
how you would track your number of visitors

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920
and access data to your website.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.700
We have another video in our training about
setting up analytics called “Setting Up

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.240
Website Analytics”, which we recommend to
perform the same service but if you want to

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.390
use the log program offered by your web host,
you can access it here.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.380
There is another category box for security.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.360
The most common icon you would use here is
for “password protect directories”.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.410
This is for when you want to require a username
and password for an area of your website.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.819
Most of the time when you set up an account
at a web host you have what is called a primary

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:05.819
domain.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.000
If you want to have other domains and other
websites on your web hosting account you can

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.390
create what is called “add-on domains”
and you would use this icon in the domains

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.269
category box to access this area.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.760
If you use a content management system, or
CMS, to set up your website it requires a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.970
database to maintain the information for the
website.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.530
The most common database used by CMSs is MySQL.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.939
In the databases category box you will find
your “MySQL databases”, a “MySQL database

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:43.720
Wizard” to help you build new databases
and “PHP my admin” to help you access

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.189
the databases that are already built.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.340
There are many more things you can do with
cPanel, but for most web administration work

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.530
you can get mostly by with the information
I just covered.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.569
Make yourself comfortable with it and don’t
hesitate to contact your web hosting support

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:09.870
if you need assistance in working in cPanel.
