00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.099
In early 2011, a version of Paul Cezanne's
"The Card Players" was sold for about 259

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:14.280
Million USD. Adjusted for inflation, that's
an equivalent of 274 million USD today (2015).

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.759
That is a lot of money. The second most expensive
painting ever sold (as of 2015) was Jackson

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:25.989
Pollock's No. 5, which was sold in late 2006
for about 140 million USD. That's an equivalent

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.819
to 165 million USD today.

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:34.090
Very often, when people look at this painting,
generally what they say is "I could do that."

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.950
Man, if I had a nickel for every time somebody
said that, well then I'd be rich enough to

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.980
buy this Jackson Pollock. Why is art so expensive?
This is a very tough question and it's kind

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.500
of entangled among so many different interdependent
factors.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.800
First of all - the art market - it's highly
speculative. It's kind of like the stock market.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.030
If somebody could explain exactly why certain
stocks go up and certain stocks go down at

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.680
certain times, what to invest in, what's not
good to invest in. If there was a simple answer

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.250
to that - then we would all be rich. But of
course there's still some trends and some

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.720
general principals on why some art works are
more expensive than others.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.470
Art is a very scarce resource. Generally when
an artist makes a work of art - it's one of

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.800
a kind - like a painting. Thus individual
works of art more valuable than mass produced

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.340
products, like those thing you buy from Walmart
that say "Made In China."

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.850
This, also made in China, but this is one
of a kind.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.060
So in general, things that are unique often
have a higher value in our society. You can

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.950
always build another million dollar home,
but you can't really paint another Monet.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.590
Because Monet's dead. And this a reason why
sometimes an artist's works will become more

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.390
valuable when he or she dies. Because they're
not really around to produce more, which makes

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.420
the works that they created while they were
alive kind of a limited resource that can't

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.119
be further produced.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.010
You can however still discover lost artworks
- but that's a topic for another time.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.399
So the value of art is often driven up but
those who invest in it, kind of like the stock

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.300
market as well. If a buyer sees value in a
particular work of art, they may choose to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.730
put money into it, and then this may or may
not cause other people to feel the same way

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.330
about that particular artwork and then in
turn drive the demand up even further. And

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.770
similar to other aspects of the financial
market, certain people have a bigger voice

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.470
and certain people are more influential, and
certain voices have more power to be able

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.830
to drive up the prices of certain artworks.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.270
Some artists also become famous. And fame
can often drive up your salary. But why do

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.970
famous artists get paid more? I don't know.
Why does Jennifer Lawrence get paid millions

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.220
of dollars per film while an unknown actress
might only get paid a few hundred dollars?

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.989
Does it really mean Jennifer Lawrence is hundreds or thousands of times better than any other actresses?

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.290
Not necessarily - because the relationship
between price and value is seldomly a linear

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.879
one. It's almost always a power law distribution.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.180
Some artworks also have historical significance.
For instance paintings of kings, popes, and/or

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.520
historical events like French Revolution.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.660
Some artists, as well as their artworks were
on the forefront of historical as well as

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.319
intellectual movements. And many of these
artworks may have been the driving force behind

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.870
historical change. And that is definitely
valuable.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.150
It's easy for us to look at the art world and
deem it as something superficial or subject

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.930
to the whims of rich and famous people. And
maybe sometimes that's what it is. But what

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.769
we sometimes forget is that these artworks
- like Jackson's Pollock's no. 5, or Paul

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.959
Cezanne's Card Players are not in fact the
most expensive artworks in the world. Many

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.870
artworks - like those held by large museums
and institutions, very often on public display,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.540
are in fact priceless. Because they have been
deemed by society to be important artifacts

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.400
of human civilization.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.739
You can argue something like the Mona Lisa
as these paintings that are just boring old

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.159
paintings of people and landscapes. But there
are people who have literally risked their

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.919
lives and died protecting these artworks,
protecting artifacts of our collective cultural heritage.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.680
And that's priceless.
