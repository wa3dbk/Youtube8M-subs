00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.685
Around 1469, a wealthy money changer commissioned

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:18.547
a young painter named Sandro Botticelli

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:19.883
to paint an altar piece.

00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:21.385
Botticelli would, of course, become known

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:23.560
as one of the greatest painters of the High Renaissance,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.179
producing works like "La Primavera"

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.614
and "The Birth of Venus."

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:30.393
But, in 1469, he had not yet earned this reputation.

00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:32.986
The scene this young artist set out to paint was well-known:

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:34.822
the Three Wise Men, or Magi,

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:37.268
arriving at the birth place of Jesus Christ.

00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:39.482
Botticelli would aspire to take this common theme

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:41.656
and produce an entirely original work,

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:42.578
while asserting himself

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:45.199
among the most important citizens of Florence.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.289
Many earlier paintings illustrate the Magi

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.412
arriving at a stable, stately manger,

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:50.945
fitting for the son of God.

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.752
The young Botticelli, however, chose

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:55.669
to place the scene in the dilapidated Roman ruin.

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:56.923
At the center of this structure,

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.925
he placed a sturdy rock for Mary and Jesus

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.761
to sit high above their visitors.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.903
With this decision, Botticelli seemed to say

00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:05.794
Christianity will be built on sturdier stuff than Rome.

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:07.761
Botticelli then populated the space

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:09.394
with important men from his city.

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:10.612
On the right side, he paints the man

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.917
who paid for this work, Gaspare del Lama,

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:14.035
looking out at the viewer

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:15.560
and confidently pointing at himself

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.604
so that there is no question

00:01:16.604 --> 00:01:18.703
who is responsible for this masterpiece.

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.263
Though born the son of a barber,

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:22.068
del Lama amassed a good sum of money

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:24.327
through currency exchange in his lifetime.

00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:26.161
He earned enough money to buy a burial chapel

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.203
and decorate it with a pretty painting.

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:30.415
The Three Wise Men appear at the center of this painting,

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:31.917
kneeling to Mary and Jesus.

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:33.626
As models for these important figures,

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:36.831
Botticelli used members of the important Medici family.

00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:38.407
Del Lama's career as a money changer

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:39.509
would not have been possible

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.353
without the help of the powerful Medici family,

00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:43.335
in particular Cosimo de' Medici,

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.387
who appears prominently at Mary's feet.

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:47.009
The other wise men can be identified

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.143
as Piero and Giovanni de' Medici,

00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:50.646
Cosimo's two sons.

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:51.936
The business of money exchange

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.605
had dubious ethical and legal associations,

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:57.193
so the friendship of this powerful family was important.

00:01:57.193 --> 00:01:59.445
And the young heir to Medici power, Lorenzo,

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:02.241
could not be omitted from this painting's composition.

00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:04.303
He appears to the left of the manger.

00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:05.981
This painting seems to say

00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:08.308
the Medici legacy, with its many healthy heirs,

00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:10.976
will be built on sturdier stuff than Rome.

00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:12.648
Botticelli then filled the rest of the space

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:15.149
with other friends and powerful figures from Florence.

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:16.683
And, among the Florentine elite,

00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:18.732
the young, confident artist painted himself

00:02:18.732 --> 00:02:20.527
looking directly at the viewer.

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:22.196
Botticelli's presence in this painting

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:24.031
illustrates a radical shift in the perception

00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:26.097
of artists during this time period.

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:27.768
Botticelli did not view himself

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:30.178
as a common craftsman hired for a simple job.

00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:31.416
He viewed himself as a friend

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:33.697
to the powerful families of Florence.

00:02:33.697 --> 00:02:35.629
Paintings like "The Adoration of the Magi"

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.601
reveal much more than a simple retelling of a biblical story.

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:40.878
They can tell the story of, among other things,

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:42.633
a modestly-born money changer

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:44.552
attempting to spend his money virtuously

00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:46.899
by making a local chapel more beautiful,

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.722
or the story of an ambitious young painter,

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:50.349
elevating the reputation of his craft

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.832
to stand among the wealthy elite of his city.
