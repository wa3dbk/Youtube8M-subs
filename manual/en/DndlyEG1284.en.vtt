00:00:02.338 --> 00:00:04.074
When you think about your iPhone

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.354
It's probably the object that you use most than your life.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.813
It's the product that you have with you all the time.

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:17.168
With this unique relationship people have with their iPhone

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:20.850
We take changing it really seriously.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.509
We don't want to just make a new phone 
 we want to make a much better phone.

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:30.845
iPhone 5 is the result of this approach.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.876
It's been completely redesigned.

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:38.251
And for the first time ever we've increased the size of the Display.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.545
By making the screen taller but not wider 
 you can see more of your content

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:47.076
but still comfortably use it with one hand.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.491
And yet even with the larger display

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:55.693
iPhone 5 is the thinnest, lightest iPhone we've ever built.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:02.826
To achieve the design this thin we had to look at 
 making many of the components inside the design smaller.

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:08.124
It's actually 18% thinner, 20% lighter than the previous iPhone.

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:11.903
It took an incredible cross-collaborative effort to do this.

00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:16.491
From the beginning, we knew we want to bring LTE to the iPhone.

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:22.292
What LTE does is that enables really fast downloads over your cellular network.

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:26.874
You'll notice a big difference compared to previous network connectivity.

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:32.712
In fact, LTE can actually be faster than the average WI-FI Connection at home.

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:38.510
The conventional approach of designing LTE into a world phone uses 2 chips

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.040
With the new iPhone, both voice and data 
 technology are combined onto a single chip.

00:01:44.547 --> 00:01:49.040
This is one of the real breakthroughs that enables iPhone 5's thin design.

00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:54.680
We're also introducing an all new Apple design A6 Chip.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.500
It delivers performance that is up to twice as fast as the previous generation.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.340
You'll experience a big increase in speed in everything you use your iPhone for.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:10.420
Especially in the way it delivers more detail and 
 boosts frame rates in graphics intensive apps.

00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:17.990
The A6 Chip is so power efficient that it 
 increases performance while also increasing its battery life

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:23.530
Given that the dimensions of the new phone and 
 all the capabilities that we want to add.

00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:27.680
We needed to manage space inside the phone very carefully.

00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:31.200
We've created the new much smaller Lightning Connector.

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:34.470
It's all digital, so it's designed for today's uses.

00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:37.830
and we made it Reversible so it fits either way.

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:45.640
We've also moved to a Sapphire lens cover which is 
 thinner and more durable than previous cover glass.

00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:49.560
This really protects the optics and keeps your photos looking great.

00:02:50.012 --> 00:02:54.800
I don't think the level of Invention has ever 
 been matched by any other product we've done.

00:02:55.233 --> 00:03:00.840
The seamless integration between Hardware and Software makes everything you do on iPhone 5

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:04.380
Just feel more Fluid, responsive and fast.

00:03:04.842 --> 00:03:08.140
and with it's amazing display you just feel like you can do more.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.740
It's great for watching HD Videos in full Widescreen.

00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:17.900
and in Portrait Mode, iPhone 5 still fits so comfortably in your hand.

00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:22.920
Our all new Maps Application is fantastic.

00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:31.950
If you look at the things like Flyover, its a completely 
 different experience than you've ever had before in Maps.

00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:36.700
Then using turn-by-turn spoken directions makes it really easy to get where you're going.

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.110
"Turn left onto Lombard Street"

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:43.870
"Then Turn right onto Van Ness Avenue"

00:03:43.868 --> 00:03:47.070
The Panoramic Feature is simply Awesome.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.260
You can capture panoramic photos just by moving your camera through the scene.

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:59.100
Once your done, the app combines what you 
 capture into a one beautiful panoramic shot.

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:03.690
And now Siri can do more for you.

00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:06.840
You can get Sports Scores and Team Schedules.

00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:11.950
Siri can also find places to eat and even help you make a reservation.

00:04:13.084 --> 00:04:16.260
Facebook is now integrated right into IOS 6

00:04:16.257 --> 00:04:20.510
So you can post Photos or share anything else 
 you want to directly from your apps.

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:26.090
And now you can make a Facetime call right over the Cellular network.

00:04:26.612 --> 00:04:30.320
So no matter where you are, you're always 
 able to see the ones you love.

00:04:32.132 --> 00:04:34.610
Along with the experience of actually using it.

00:04:35.332 --> 00:04:37.630
What makes iPhone 5 so unique

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:40.180
Is how it feels in your hand.

00:04:40.893 --> 00:04:42.650
The materials its been made with

00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:46.870
The remarkable precision with which its been built.

00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:54.250
Never before, have we built a product with 
 this extraordinary level of fit and finish.

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:00.370
We've developed manufacturing processes that are our most complex and ambitious.

00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:06.090
Starting with the Aluminium, we've machined all of the surfaces of the enclosure.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.650
We then polish and texture them.

00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:17.330
We then use crystalline diamonds cut the chamfers it's so 
 exact that your left with a near mirror finish.

00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:22.710
These techniques created a dramatic distinction between the lightly textured back

00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:25.850
and its highly polished chamfered edge.

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:33.870
This manufacturing precision extends of how these mini pieces seemingly come together.

00:05:34.978 --> 00:05:40.450
The in lay of the Product is matched 
 to housing of a highly sophisticated process.

00:05:42.044 --> 00:05:47.880
With the part of a Conveyor, 2 high 
 powered cameras take picture of the Housing.

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:56.790
An Instantaneous analysis is done and then the best match 
 out of a possible 725 cuts is determined

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:02.660
The variances from Product to Product, we now measure in microns. 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.620
We believe that we are going at such extreme lengths.

00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:11.440
Is the only way we can deliver this level of quality.

00:06:13.335 --> 00:06:18.780
To create the new iPhone, we began with a design we really love

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:25.120
But to build it, implement it we had to look 
 way beyond what we knew to be possible.

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:36.550
It took all of our learning, our best thinking to realize 
 something so simple, so clear and yet so truly extraordinary.
