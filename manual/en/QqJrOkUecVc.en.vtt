00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:22.720
I'll be late for our arrangement have to send a message saying "I'm sorry"

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.700
I forgot to paint my lips

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.860
What should I do? Should I stop somewhere on the way and fix it?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.760
But for a girl

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.400
It's a little embarassing

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.620
My reflection in the train's window

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.880
Today my bangs look strange

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.740
I want to fix them right away

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.300
'Cause... it looks strange doesn't it?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.020
Everyone is so beautiful

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.240
For some reason it's painful

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.320
I can't be unhappy I have to try harder

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.740
Can I become pretty? If only I could be pretty...

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.780
Want to be... I want to be!

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.480
Can I become pretty? If only I could be pretty...

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.380
Don't want to be like I am now

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.720
Always always have worries on my mind

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.760
Strange? Am I strange?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.500
Always always have worries on my mind

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.940
I wonder if I care too much?

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:42.460
I want to play at ease like old times with no worries

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.180
Finally I have a boyfriend. I'm relieved

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.440
Of course of course being alone is sad

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.160
Doing things like calling each other going on dates that make my heart thump

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.760
I know I got to have fun

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.080
I worry a little I worry quite a bit. Things that everyone does...

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.200
I must be not doing any single one of them

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.180
Who can explain this to me? I feel gloomy

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.020
I have to learn more or others will leave me far behind

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.380
Everyone is moving forward

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.600
It's somewhat scary

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.860
Still I want to get along well

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.280
Can I become an adult? Probably... I have to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.220
Able â€¦ I'm capable?

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.180
Can I become an adult? Probably... I have to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.540
That's what I'm supposed to be!

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:48.400
I want to have carefree conversations. It used to be much easier in the past

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.660
If only I could stay as a middle-schooler forever

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.880
Hello? Sorry I'm in a train right now

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.960
Yeah a friend

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.540
Really? Sorry I'll call you back some other time

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.600
If something happens come to me for advice

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
It's dangerous you two

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.240
Today was fun

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.900
Thanks for giving me a tour

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.420
Looks like I'll be late for our meeting (I'll send a text saying "Sorry!")

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.880
My makeup looks awful (Need to find a place to fix it)

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.440
Enjoying carefree conversations (If it's a good old friend?)

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.320
Enjoying carefree conversations

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.740
Can I become pretty? If only I could be pretty...

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.800
Want to be... I want to be!

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.680
Can I become pretty? If only I could be pretty...

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.360
Don't want to be like I am now

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.700
Always always have worries on my mind

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.700
Strange? Am I strange?

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.660
Always always have worries on my mind

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.080
I wonder if I care too much?

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:31.020
I want to play at ease like old times with no worries
