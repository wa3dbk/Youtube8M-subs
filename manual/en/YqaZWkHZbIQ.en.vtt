00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.790
Though it's mostly gone out of fashion, one
of the defining characteristics on the Super

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.209
Nintendo was that most sequels (and even some
original games) had the word 'super' in front

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.209
of them.

00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:22.160
It was meant to invoke the image of just not
any sequel, but an upgrade to everything that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.539
had come before.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.070
More revolution than evolution.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.030
In the case of Super Monsters ate my Condo,
sadly it's the latter and not the former.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.210
Not that it's a bad release, but it falls
a little short of the expectations us as the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.879
consumer get when we see 'super' in front
of something.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.000
Essentially the game has not changed too drastically
from the original release.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.370
Colored condo pieces need to be swiped to
chain up three of the same color to appease

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.950
the giant monsters that tower over it.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.940
Creating these combos will tag out a monster
of the same color, and another will take its

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.940
place.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.530
Swiping colored pieces to monsters of a different
color will anger them (and if too angry, they

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.150
will topple your condo).

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.180
Once a combo is created it will create a bronze
piece, three bronze's will make a silver,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.580
and three silvers a gold (and this just keeps
going).

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.420
If one of these pieces is swiped into a monster,
you will activate their super power (such

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.140
as doubling combos, sending the monsters to
sleep, or straightening the looming tower),

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.240
and the higher up on the combo chain the special
piece is, the longer the super power lasts

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240
for.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.890
It becomes a game of quick decisions and weighing
the pros and cons of building up combo pieces

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.770
versus using them on the monsters for the
bonuses they give (aside from just planning

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.340
which colors to send in which direction).

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.650
But that was what the original game was, so
what is so super about this new release?

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.300
Well the two minute timer is a start, creating
a more bite-sized frantic game pace, as well

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.380
as the standard inclusion of missions, ranks,
oh, and the spin wheel at the end of each

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.180
game for the chance to receive something awesome.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.650
The shop is where you can buy dapper head
wear for all the monsters, and this has an

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.909
effect on your score multiplier, and the worldwide
rankings are nice to see where you rank amongst

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.520
the other condo monster pacifiers.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.960
If you missed Monsters ate my Condo, this
super sequel while not a spectacular leap

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.460
forward is a great jumping on point to experience
the visual and auditory craziness of this

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.310
great action puzzler.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.680
Fans of the original might get some mileage
out of the tweaks, but you aren't missing

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:21.120
out on too much if you decide to stick with
the original.
