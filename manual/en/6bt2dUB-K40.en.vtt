00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.269
Hey dudes.

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.250
I’m Hilah and today on Hilah Cooking I am
not cooking up a recipe for you.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.500
I’m cooking up a book.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.500
I’m sorry.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500
That was terrible.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.260
But I know that you’ve been hearing me like
blab, blab, blab about this Learn to Cook

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.780
book that I put out last year.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.490
It was an ebook and we got so many requests
for a print book.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.490
Guess what.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.490
It’s here!

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.490
The print book is here.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.490
Look.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.490
This is an actual book.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.490
This is not a hologram.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.490
I’m holding this book.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.600
Look, Learn to Cook by Hilah Johnson.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.600
This is my book.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.510
This is 308 pages of education and information
for you to teach you the adult that you are

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.140
all the things that you feel like you probably
should know at your age but you just don’t

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.660
and you’re kind of too embarrassed to ask
because you’re like a 40-year-old man that’s

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.680
still eating Chicken McNuggets all the time.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.660
So anyway the first half of the book covers
like how to make a grocery list, how to figure

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.190
out what you even want to eat for dinner,
how to not get ripped off at the grocery store,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.410
how to not be a dick at the grocery store,
how to cut up plants, how to cut up animals,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.550
what the words mean, how to measure crap.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.579
Oh, there’s a big section on what to stock
in your pantry for a beginner and then for

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.540
like next level up there.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.940
Then there’s this whole huge spice chart.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.350
I’ve never actually seen anything like this
before in a cookbook.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.689
I think I pioneered Spice World which is going
to be the name of my store of spices if I

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:12.689
ever have one.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.840
But anyway, it has got pretty much all the
spices you might see on a regular grocery

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.700
store shelf, what they taste like, what they
go with and what to substitute for them if

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.700
you don’t have them.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.750
Then also each has included a fun fact because
I tried my very hardest to make this book

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.810
fun so that you would want to read it.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.259
By fun, I mean there are lots of dirty jokes.

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.060
There are several TMI moments probably and
there’s also little drawings done by Freak

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.479
Zone, little pictures of things.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.869
Oh, wait, there are also pictures of me.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.159
He didn’t do those but he did make little
drawing and cartoon things throughout the

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.159
book.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.520
Somehow I can’t seem to land on any of them.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.789
Anyway, the second half of the book is all
recipes [0:01:50] [Indiscernible] breakfast,

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.999
brunch, lunch, dinner, snacks, desserts, drinks
including non-alcoholic drinks if you even

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.189
care about those, including how to make coffee
because come on.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.140
Learn how to make coffee, you big baby.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.219
And then also food to impress people where
it has like all the potluck stuff that you

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.200
might want to take to a party or like how
to make some sauces to like jazz up your otherwise

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.670
kind of boring dinner and then in the back
it has got all these charts for the nerds

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.480
out there that has like equivalency tables.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.690
Oh, there’s also an index.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.690
You need that.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.300
Oh, and then some troubleshooting in the kitchen.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.920
Like what do you do if your gravy is lumpy?

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.420
What do you do if you made your beans too
burny?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.110
What do you do if your mashed potatoes are
too thin?

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.290
Answers to all of that and more in the Learn
to Cook book.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.290
Whoo!

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.460
So I will put a link at the bottom on how
you can buy it.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.750
It’s only 20 bucks and I think that’s
a pretty good deal and yeah, I love it.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.750
I’m so excited.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.170
I can’t believe that it’s finally in my
hands.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.790
I didn’t think I would be this excited but
I’m super excited.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.480
So also check out over the next couple of
weeks.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.710
We’re going to be releasing a bunch of little
quickie videos that cover like learning to

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.760
cook basics, like how to mince garlic, how
to carve a chicken and stuff like that.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760
So stay tuned for that.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.130
Make sure you subscribe to Hilah Cooking’s
YouTube channel so that you can get all that

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.140

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140
So, yay!

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.140
Book!

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.140
I love you, book!

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.140
I love you people!

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.350
I kissed the book for the people.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.590
Bye-bye.
