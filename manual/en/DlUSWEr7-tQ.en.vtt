00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.950
Writing a Bass line involves incorporating
all the knowledge that we have talked about

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.010
before.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.960
We want to use everything we have available
to us, all the notes that we know, all the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.859
rhythms that we know, good time fill, everything
that is just part of being a good musician.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.519
So, when you are in a situation, when you're
gonna be playing music, whether it is with

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.460
your friends, and professional situation or
just making music on our own.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.609
You want to give yourself certain options
that you can always depend on to be there

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.240
for making Bass lines.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.200
If you're playing on a song that has two chords,
may be the song alternates between D and G,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
you could start by just practicing playing
the root notes of those two chords in time,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.760
may be we will start with quarter notes.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.700
You could play.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.020
And may be that is perfect for the situation.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.960
May be you can add a couple other notes as
you hear that.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.920
Keep it simple.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.679
May be then, it might even be just appropriate
to just play a rhythm, you can still play

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.549
the root notes.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.219
Or may be you don't have to play all the beats.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:45.399
Or may be it is perfect to play something
more like melodic longer tones.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:02:07.889
Or may 

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:18.230
be just something shorter.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.400
Sometimes less is more.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.319
So, basically you can provide a whole set
of options for yourself, may be three or four

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.730
things you really like to do, and if you have
those in your back pocket you can try them

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.019
and if none of them work may be one of them
will lead you to hearing something brand new

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.390
that you have never done before.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.970
May be that will become one of your basics.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.290
But the principle is get somethings under
your belt that you really know how to do,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.269
so that, when you are in a situation where
some one requires you to be a bass player,

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.920
play a bass line, you wanna be supportive,
you wanted be strong and you want to feel

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.810
really secure with what you are doing.Bass
