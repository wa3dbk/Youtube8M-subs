Hey everyone, Aquaman here with Water Wisdom
sponsored by WaterFilters.NET. Today's product

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.129
is the Culligan S1. Now, this is a pleated
cellulose cartridge, but it's more durable

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.200
than your average run of the mill pleated
cellulose because of two reasons. One, the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:26.710
cellulose media is resin impregnated, so it’s
just stronger, slightly stiffer, it's going

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:35.281
to handle higher flow rates and situations
where the flow is inconsistent. Maybe a situation

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:40.629
where the flow is on again, off again, that,
where the change in flow and pressure might

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.440
otherwise ruin another filter or regular pleated
cellulose filter. This will be able to stand

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.699
up to that. Also be able to withstand water
hammer, that's an effect where the water rapidly

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.269
pulses and the pressure rapidly pulses and
could pulverize any ordinary cartridge. It

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:07.410
also has a netted sheath around the exterior
of the cartridge and this just again gives

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.600
it a durability and keeps the pleats spaced
properly around the outside. So that, if water

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.960
were to pulse in, it wouldn't split the pleats
open and you have a big gap here and then

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.890
you have three or four pleats over here that
are scrunched together, so keeps it nice and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.820
evenly spaced. Just generally a more durable
version of a pleated cellulose cartridge.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.380
It is cellulose, so it’s not appropriate
for untreated water. Only good for chlorinated

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.610
or otherwise treated water that you know does
not have micro-organisms, because cellulose

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.380
is vulnerable to that and would be a very
happy place for microorganisms to live and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.750
grow. The S1 is a 20 micron cartridge, 20
microns is just slightly smaller than the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.890
speck of milled flour. So this is a great
filter for capturing a variety of sediment,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:09.280
scale particles, rust particles, dirt, sand,
really any variety of sediment larger than

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.890
20 microns. It's an industry standard size
cartridge approximately 10 inches long by

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:23.700
2.5 inches in diameter, and fits in standard
housings like the Culligan HF-150, 160 and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.010
360 housings as well as a vast array of other
industry standard size filter housings that

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:39.810
take the 10” x 2.5” size cartridges. That's
the S1, just a basic sediment filter, more

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.600
durable than your standard pleated cellulose
filter. I’m your host Aquaman and thanks

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.099
for watching.
