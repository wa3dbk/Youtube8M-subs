00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.750
When I was small we traveled always in London.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.440
We used to stand on Shepherd's Bush.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.070
We could still stand on Tooting Bec now,
Crystal Palace, Blackheath Common.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.820
So I've basically grown up in London,
even though I've grown up in a circus, I've

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.820
grown up in London.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.250
Well it's the same for circus people and the
same for...

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.949
You've either got the sawdust in your veins
or you haven't

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.970
and the sawdust is well and truly planted
in my veins,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.730
I've always loved the circus since I was a
tiny little girl.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.170
Always, even when I was small, just a toddler,
there's pictures of me,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.690
in them days we still had performing animals,
sitting on elephants, horses.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.500
I can't even remember learning to ride a horse,
I've been able to ride all my life

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.150
Jay Cottle is my father and we're a big circus,
we are a family circus,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.960
my sister's are here, my nieces my daughter,
my other sister runs the ticket office, I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.030
work in the circus, my father travels with
us still today even though he doesn't perform

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.220
anymore, keeping us all in line.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.880
I love everything about it, I love the travelling,
I love going to different places

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.780
and different towns every week.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.470
Even when it's wet and muddy
I can just cope with it, I love it.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.050
The troop are not from a circus, many of them.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.100
So we train them at our circus school in Wookey
Hole,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.240
and then when they've finished their schooling
and they're at the correct standard,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.850
they then come and join us in the show.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.610
My daughters are in the troop and my nieces
are in the troop

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.140
but I've got another 12 so, I have to do everything,
you know,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.530
tell them to pick their costumes up.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.520
Any dramas, I have to sort it out, come and
take them to the doctors,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.520
"where's the nearest supermarket?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520
Can you take me".

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.070
I'm basically the group chaperone so I get
pretty lucky.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.070
'We're your babies'.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.340
Yeah they're my babies.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.340
'Hello!'

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.960
So obviously there's no animals in the circus
anymore but we've got

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.190
rollerskating, bikes, wheel of death, magic,
aerial silks, hula hoops.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.100
It's a full house of circus acts.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.300
Working in London now is very different,
very different, I mean we've been quite surprised

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.150
here at Clapham Common because this is a known
circus ground.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.039
Back when traveling circuses first started,
this was one of the very original grounds.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.370
When I was a younger girl, and the last time
we stood here,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.120
our tent would be packed every night, and
now we're only half full

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.139
so I think...I think the community of London
has changed

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.121
and things change all the time,
and yeah it is very different from when I

00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:25.170
was younger.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.120
I love being part of a circus family and I
like that we stay together.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.519
If you're just a couple traveling all over
the world, sometimes it's very lonely

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.780
because you've got to imagine, you're not
just moving country,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.480
you're moving a complete community because
a circus is a community.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.019
So you have to join a new community, but saying
that,

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.749
you tend to know hundreds of people and you
always know somebody

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.840
that knows somebody and generally you usually
end up somewhere where you're related to somebody

00:02:46.840 --> 00:03:07.189
along the line as well.
