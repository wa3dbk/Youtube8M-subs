00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.549
A few days ago someone made a game called
2 0 4 8 or 2048.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.310
In it you use your arrow keys to move these
tiles.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.140
So when you press the up arrow key.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.980
All the tiles will move up.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.280
When two tiles with the same number touch
each other

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.780
they will merge into one bigger number.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.330
It is your goal to get to the a 2048 tile.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.279
Which is really hard by the way.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.880
So over time the the numbers will be bigger
and bigger and you need more more and more

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.960
space to get to the biggest number.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.949
Thus making the game harder over time.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.570
If you wanna play it, there is a link in the
description.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.760
Sooo check it out.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.260
Or not because it's pretty addictive.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.580
Anyway, I wanted to make this in minecraft
of course.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.070
So I did, and this is the result.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.890
You walk left right forwards or backwards
to move these tiles.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.840
And to reset the game you can hit space at
any time.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.230
It works exactly like the original game.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920
Well ok, except for the smooth animations.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.000
If you want to download the map.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.129
There's a download link in the description
for that too.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.660
Soo check it out.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.940
Or not because it's pretty addictive.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.930
[humbles]

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.340
To make the explanation a bit more understandable.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.150
I'll make the field a bit smaller.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.260
So let's say there's a 2 over here and a 0
over here.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.990
When you press up the 2 should move up.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.870
But when this one isn't a 0.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.880
Let's say it is a 4 for example.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.080
Nothing should happen.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080
However.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.210
When these numbers are the same, two two's
for example, they should combine into a 4.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.420
Now we'll repeat that process a couple of
times.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.770
We will move this one over here, this one
over here and this one over here, now we will

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.560
move this one over here and this one over
here.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.960
And lastly we'll move this one again.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
So let's see how that works out,
I've got a 2 over here, here, and here.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.330
We'll do those 6 steps.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.330
And as you can see...

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.990
We will end with a four and a two, just like
in the original game.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.720
We'll do that process four times, for every
row, and we'll do that four times for every

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720
direction.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.840
But first we'll take a look at one of these
steps, because what is actually going on over

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840
here.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.460
The answer is.. squids.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.090
We will make 16 squids, each with a different
name.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.420
And now we can apply scores to those squids.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.340
These are just a few command blocks that are
all powered in the right order.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.260
That's because this stone is set to redstone
blocks, and back to stone.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.090
Check out this video from CitrioN.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.120
He explains how this thing works.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.100
So these 13 commandblocks are the logic behind
one single step, this entire row makes all

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.970
6 steps work, and this entire field makes
one direction work, and all these 4 fiesds,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.000
make all the directions work.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.011
And then there's this last row of command
blocks, that makes sure that a new tile is

00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.400
added every time you make a move.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.180
First it will create stone blocks for all
the tiles that are 0.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.879
And then I used spreadplayers to teleport
a squid to a random block over here.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.410
then it will be teleported relatively above
one of these squids, and then it will set

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.940
the squid underneath him to either 2 or 4.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.040
And that number is, again, randomly chosen
using spread players on this squid.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.270
And this row also summons the itemframes,
and it makes sure there isn't an extra tile

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.130
added when you did not move anything around.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.010
But that's way to advanced to explain, so
if you want to see how that works, feel free

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.470
to download the world.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.610
Or not because it's pretty addictive.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.480
Uhmm and that's it Thanks for watching and..
uhmm..

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.480
So what should I say now?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.160
You should make a fart sound and then end
the video abruptly

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160
What?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.250
Yeah you know, a fart sound

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.250
You want me to make..

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.880
Yes, using your mouth.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.160
I'm not going to do that.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.769
No you should definitely do that, people love
it.

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.280
No they don't, that.. that's stupid.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.840
Seriously try it.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.160
No I'm just.. no..

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.489
Trust me it will be fun

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.690
No I'm just going to end the video with a
black screen and thanks for watching.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.230
Well ok if you say so
