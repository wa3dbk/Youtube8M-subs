so look Russell Brand I'm not

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.510
a huge fan a Russell Brand I don't
actually really think much about him I

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.960
don't dislike him I just

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.769
don't really I I don't really know
armies on my radar that much I've seen a

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:16.830
couple movies

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.260
you know I are you fam he's funny in
number movies I think he's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.310
yeah he's pretty funny yeah he's my
depends it it sometimes use

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.960
he's funny some time away if it was
anyone really but he has a stick that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.949
I'm not so into all the time to be a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.360
so I don't dislike him but sometimes you
should the government he's peace pretty

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.820
hard

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.800
heavy and the British you myrna if that
goes over your head if you don't

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.210
understand that nice anything it's that
I

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.520
huh i'm saying not just that type stuff
in a very bad

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.450
getting know the name is a bit I've also
noticed that recently he's been

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.440
he's been I I you know more politically
oriented

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.809
I in many respects and the New Statesman
which is a pretty

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.449
very respected very long I'll a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.150
the you know very prestigious left-wing
British Journal they do these things are

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.580
sometimes they go out they have a
celebrity guest at issue in this latest

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.049
issue of the New Statesman

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.610
is guest edited by Russell Brand and the
theme is revolution

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.820
and you know Russell Brand again to the
guys credit look

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.710
very strongly supportive occupy very
outspoken

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.030
on wealth inequality on the
environmental crisis barry very

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530
outspoken and right about all the major
issues facing us today

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.619
I it's ok Jeremy Paxman

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.060
who's this British kinda Bulldog
reporter who's known for his

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.119
nasty and dismissive question everybody
actual number one time

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.369
great Jeremy Paxman moment he was
interviewing and Coulter

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.250
and he introduced there for a couple met
for like a minute gave her long intro

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.119
and then he read I the opening page up
for new book

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.540
and he goes re-read alive from
lookbook.nu goes an

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.380
got a review copy is your new book I
read the first chapter

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.080
doesn't get any better so I have a soft
spot for Jeremy Paxman but that is stick

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.550
with everybody so he's asking

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.540
Russell Brand says look Russell Brand
says he doesn't vote which person chains

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.599
like Russell Brand's like look voting
zarella then I don't do that

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.020
I don't agree with that at all but
they're going back and forth in all this

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.360
and Russell Brand's kinda making fun to
Paxman

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.340
Paxman is saying you know that Russell
Brand is clear the naive in all the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.780
stuff

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.879
and towards the end in the interview
Russell Brand has this moment where he

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.830
just gets

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.830
passionate any gets alive and you know

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.450
I just want anybody who does this I
don't care what they are I don't care if

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.890
they're a policy person or a comedian or
a worker

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.140
somebody you kind either express is the
certain passion

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.060
about where we're at and without the
kinda Iranian comfortable cynicism

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.420
as some real respect for so let's play
that sound Russell Brand he's responding

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.200
to journey 0

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.280
and really briefly Jeremy Paxman as
British broadcaster had done a rip

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.620
us some I british au recently where he
went to see is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.940
ancestors a like town in Scotland or
something so that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.050
Russell Brand references that that's the
reference was politically on surprise

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.340
you can be facetious when you're that
angry about it

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.650
yeah I'm angry I am angry because for me
it's real

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.580
me is not just some peripheral thing not
turn up once in awhile to church fight

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.049
for

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.519
for me this is what come from this is
what care about to see any

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.739
member that yep totally there's gonna be
regulation is probably going to happen

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.269
I did not know you i think i Flickr
about this is the end

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.040
this is time to wake up army but I see
you in that program

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.230
way look at your ancestors and you saw
that way your grandmother

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.379
we're at a process l4 got fucked over by
the average the crack to run a gap you

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.230
cried

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.220
because you knew that it was unfair and
I'm just not what was essentially got

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.439
that happens people now just come from a
woman is being treated like that

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.900
has been talking to a woman today is
being treated like that

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.730
so im if we can engage that feeling set
up some moment every lacrimosa

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.330
sentimentality played out in a TV for
people to pour over emotional porn

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.409
if we can engage that feeling and
strange things why wouldn't we will use

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.150
that naive

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.900
why is that not my right because I'm
act-up I me i i

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.509
taking the right I don't need the right
from you but only the rubber anybody

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.949
I'm taking

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.190
well there you have it I mean I and also
should say in an interview he references

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.500
own experience growing up in poverty in
dealing with addiction

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.870
and I you know i i i say kudos

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.040
II had respect for that even if I N
agree with everything he said in fact

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.620
write some real respect for our handle
that but Kevin 11 721

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.669
the thing about brand that a lot of
people are unaware I love

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.050
is he's very smart and well spoken as
evidence in this clip

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.340
I strongly suggest majority opposes
listen to the whole thing

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.979
more bit on Gawker I completely agree I
was great talking about

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.320
brand when Michael asked me about i
think is he's great with politicos

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.250
talking about brand the performer

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.650
oh yeh know the more he writes as is all
politics is

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.620
also you know nothing he did that was
both political at home larious was

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.300
he was on Morning Joe couple months ago
that was

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.550
soul funny in fact I implore

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.970
more celebrities regard music movies
books whatever it may be

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.509
wreath get involved with politics

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.610
I really do feel like I really feel pop
culture

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.740
pop culture rock celebrities identities
whatever

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.050
I really feel like they have a massive
role in shaping

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.389
the political outlooks for young people
I really do believe that

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.020
I really think they are a major probably
the

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.919
the most important contributor to that
told I'd really do believe nets big deal
