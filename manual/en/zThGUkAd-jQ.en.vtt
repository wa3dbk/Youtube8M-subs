00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.630
Coming off my review of the skateboard gaming
classic Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, I've decided

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.950
to continue with the genre, and how the franchise
attempted to put the Game Boy Advance on the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.950
map.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.540
After the highly successful Tony Hawk's Pro
Skater 2 managed to show handheld owners what

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.350
the Advance was capable of, the third installment
of the series had a tough act to follow in

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.900
the form of isometric levels and smaller perspectives
of them.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.120
So, Vicarious Visions and Activision got together
again and had to make an important decision,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.909
and what they decided on was exactly what
fans wanted: to change nothing.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.450
At the most, very little.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.960
The attitude of skateboarding culture returns
in the lip grinding, kick-flipping good time

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:28.860
known as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.010
On my review of the first Pro Skater, I made
it a point to mention how the trick system

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.670
is simple and fun to use, sort of like special
moves in fighting games, with the directional

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.700
buttons coming first, followed by the button
command to railgrind, grab, or flip.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.610
This is continued through the second Pro Skater,
and carries over into the third with the Advance's

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.780
button system.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.020
However, instead of the A and B buttons being
your flip and grab, you will have to use the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:03.430
shoulder buttons, and the A button activates
your railgrinds and liptricks.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:14.200
A few creative twists from the original iteration
of Pro Skater now include manuals and the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.110
tricks you can perform during a manual, and
also variations on grabs and flips able to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.990
be activated by tapping the trick buttons
twice.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.140
With all these new methods of trickery, expect
to build much higher scores than before.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.470
Also expect to have more responsibility in
terms of high score missions, of which the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.599
newest one, Sick Score, is the toughest to
complete, although that's not saying much

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:50.001
when you can now string together trick combinations
with manuals, previously unattainable in the

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.001
first two Pro Skaters.

00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.670
The evolution of the Pro Skater series, however,
is best described by the new tricks you can

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.190
perform and the variety of levels that put
Player One on the spot in terms of places

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.910
to skate.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.200
Much like the indoor skatepark environments
like Warehouse in the first Pro Skater or

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.980
the Hangar in the second, the third starts
you off in the Foundry, which now comes with

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.530
deadly obstacles like the Magma Wall which
you must wallride for a tape.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.530
Other new levels include Rio, Suburbia, LA,
and Tokyo, and the developers did well to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.570
work within the limits of the GBA to make
colorful and exciting level design.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.849
Unfortunately for console Pro Skater fans
who are used to a behind-the-back third-person

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:40.400
view of your skater like myself, the isometric
design of the GBA Pro Skaters can be disorienting,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.250
making it difficult to determine your skater's
position relative to the next rail you want

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.709
to grind or the next letter you need to pick
up to spell SKATE.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.100
Also frustrating is the lack of a command
to straighten out if you hit that quarterpipe

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.170
too hard and are heading towards a trip to
the hospital.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.379
Unlike console versions where you can hold
a shoulder button to land on your wheels in

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.599
mid-air, you can only helplessly watch as
your skater crashes into the earth.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.849
Ain't gravity a cold bitch?

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:21.660
Still, with enough practice, THPS3 for the
GBA can become manageable.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.949
So strap on that grip tape and head for the
skatepark in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, a fine

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.939
addition to the big, happy Pro Skater family.
