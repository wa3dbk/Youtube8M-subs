What's up fish tank people? Fishtanktv.com dustinsfishtanks bringing it to you on a Friday. Got to be a little bit quiet, because both the girls are up stairs sleeping, but having a good time. Crushed it all week long. Found out some of the people from work are watching. If you watching this while you're at work. Get a life! Go do something. Don't you have something to do? Don't you have a phone to install? Anyway here is what is going on. I want to show you what's up. My man Zac who ordered a nice fat order of aquatic jungles asked how to propagate Amazon Sword when they have a runner. I got seven different little leaf puts off an Amazon Sword mother that I have got. Here's how I like to do it. Look there's no exact science to this. I am just going to tell you how I do it. For me it's all about when there's a little bit of root growth there, so like this root growth right here. Roots are how plants eat, so I use dirt. I want to make sure that they can eat the dirt. So I would do is I wait until they have grown. This is more than enough root growth to really plant one down in the bottom of a tank. This one right here is actually bigger, but the roots aren't as big. I will still use this. What I have done is I have just cut the stem and I don't know if the plant can actually absorb through that stem, or if I just go through that root right there. But I would go ahead and plant it, and this one right here. That little runner I am going to leave there. If you don't see nice runners with like roots, you could plant that if you were desperate, but I suggest letting them grow and just really develop some nice roots, as they are connected to the mother plant. Here's how you do it. I am going to try and do this with one hand. This is going to be tough, but here's what we do. We just take it and grab it down like this. Just take the end and just kind of let it guide it down in there. Just like that! Tuck it down in there. I don't have a problem with having a little bit of gravel over the actual leaves and kind of like in the stem a little bit. Because it just make sure it's down there. What we are going to do and what I like to do is I like to keep an eye on like the tinniest growth on there, and just really keep an eye on that one. For this plant my point of reference is going to be the little brownish leaf right in the middle there. I am going to lay out on it, if you can see that. I have been doing it on this tank particularly because this tank's lights are so freaking bad ass. I was like day dreaming thinking about how I am going to beef up all these tanks. Here is what I am saying: when you have like one little tiny growth. Find a specific leaf or a specific spot on the plant and watch that part. I will bring it back in another video about how that leaf is doing. This one is going to be that one right there. That's kind of like how I gauge it. I like to that and I have kind of got a little knack, I think it's a good way to gauge how the plant is doing. The plants tell you the story folks! Just look at the plants. A lot of people spend a lot of time testing the water, you know "Dustin what is my pH", all these questions that are chemistry. Just look at the plants, they will tell you the story.
On that note I want to show you what is going on over here in my least sexy tank. This tank doesn't have a chance compared to the ones that have the better lighting on them. I don't know if I am going to put high outputs on this one or not just yet. But what I have done is I am floating a bunch of Java fern, because it's a very hardy plant and it can handle the abuse, but I have put in some plants here that cannot handle the abuse: liguigia ripens. It's a no no! Don't put it in a freshly dirted tank. I have put in some here just to show you kind of what will happen. I have done it before and I have cooked some, but I did put in some Jungle Val. Now one of the things a lot of rookies have commented on. It is worth noting that they will plant Jungle Val and will be like "Oh dude, it all went away", but again you have to focus on the tiny little bit of growth you got. I am going to show you right here, so down here we have got the tiny little growth coming up. That's what you want to focus on, because these leaves are made for a different tank. They are made for a different setup, so you leave them because they are still probably doing the plant some good. If they were really ready, you would cut them off, but that new growth is a good sign. That's all you need. For me with this tank being dirted a week or so ago, that for me is the go ahead of like adding more hardier species, so I am going to go ahead an move a bunch of jungle val over here and get this thing really rocking. By the way check this out, I have got this right here which is like amazing when it comes to water changes. Then I have got these two right here, and let's see if I can do this while on camera. I am a siphon sucker. I said it! That was bad. I got that on the mouth. Did I get it? No I didn't, but anyway see what I am doing. I got the siphon here down in the drain, draining and filling at the same time. It's money! So that's what's up. Dirt in a tank, go slow, do your water changes. I am going to do another one. I mean I need to. Also something to look to with a dirted tank is the duckweed. Some of it kind of bleached down and died, but it grew right back. So you can see kind of the different colors. This stuff looks healthier than the others. Duckweed is such a hardy plant. It's good for a dirted tank. I would really recommend adding a lot of it in your dirted tank.
That is what is going on. Shout out to all the new subscribers and I got to say one more thing. I got to say rest in piece to the original fishtanktv laptop. I am going to miss you Gateway, 1500 bucks five years ago, when I was pissing money during the mortgage boom. So it finally died! A lot of memories, we put in a lot of videos up. Videos basically 1 through 400 were done on that machine, so a moment of silence for my boy. Anyway I replaced it with a fat HP for like 600$ so that's it. Got some Species Sunday for you this weekend as well.Later!
