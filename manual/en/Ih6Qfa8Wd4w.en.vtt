&gt;&gt;ALL RIGHT GENTLEMEN, I NEED NOT REMIND YOU
THAT

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.830
WE HAVE A LOT RIDING ON THIS.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.400
IF THE UNICORNS DECIDE THAT WE ARE HOSTILE
THEY

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.380
WILL GORE US IN THE FACE.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.120
AND MY CHARACTER DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH HIT
POINTS TO WITHSTAND

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.529
ANOTHER FACE GORING.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.570
&gt;&gt;OKAY, ADAM, JUST TO CLARIFY,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.519
WHAT EXACTLY DO WE KNOW ABOUT UNICORNS?

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.480
&gt;&gt;THEY'RE POWERFULLY MAGICAL CREATURES,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.980
EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS, AND--

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.460
 &gt;&gt;CAN SENSE EVIL?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.320
[GASPING]

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.400
&gt;&gt;IT'S CARLY.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.940
&gt;&gt;UH, YOU MEAN SHE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED?

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.519
&gt;&gt;I THOUGHT WE SETTLED ON DEVIL-WOMAN?

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.829
&gt;&gt;I CAN HEAR YOU GUYS.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.829
&gt;&gt;I TOLD YOU THE ACOUSTICS IN HERE WERE PHENOMENAL.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.130
&gt;&gt;WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE YOU FOUL TEMPTRESS?

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.090
YOUR ACTIONS HAVE SCARRED US FOR LIFE!

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.000
&gt;&gt;OH, THAT SEEMS LIKE AN EXAGGERATION.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.930
&gt;&gt;HUH, WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE GUILD OF ADVENTURERS?

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.830
&gt;&gt;HUZZAH MAGIC POWERS AND NEVER TRUST WOMEN!

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.700
&gt;&gt;WELL, I'M AFRAID EVEN IF YOU CAN'T TRUST

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.100
ME YOU STILL NEED ME.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.760
&gt;&gt;NO I DON'T!

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.120
I MEAN, WE COLLECTIVELY DON'T NEED--

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.820
CAN SOMEONE ELSE TALK NOW PLEASE?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.370
&gt;&gt;BUT YOU DO NEED ME.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.400
ONLY A WARRIOR MAIDEN CAN RIDE A UNICORN.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.140
&gt;&gt;HA!

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.290
WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THAT WHICH IS WHY MATT'S
CHARACTER IS

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.450
SECRETLY DISGUISED AS A WOMAN.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.600
&gt;&gt;WELL, WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.400

&gt;&gt;CARLY?

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.000
CARLY ARE YOU DOWN HERE?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.040
&gt;&gt;I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.110
I INVITED A FRIEND.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.670
&gt;&gt;WHAT?

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.570
ANOTHER GIRL?

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.200
I CANNOT ABIDE BY THIS-- SWEET ELFISH CHAINMAIL.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.159
MILADY PLEASE BE SEATED.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.310
&gt;&gt;I'LL FIND YOU A CHAIR.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.820
HERE'S ONE.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.340
&gt;&gt;THANK YOU.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.200
I HEARD YOU BOYS ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE A UNICORN,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.890
BUT YOU'RE ALL SO CUTE.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.970
HAVE YOU JUST TRIED SMILING AT IT?

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.000
&gt;&gt;[NERVOUS LAUGHTER]

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.140
&gt;&gt;GUYS,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.500
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS AGAIN.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.100
&gt;&gt;SILENCE ADAM!

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.640
&gt;&gt;NO, YOU SILENCE ADAM!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.710
THESE WOMEN ARE MANIPULATING YOU AGAIN!

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.210
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TWO OF YOU?

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.070
IT USED TO BE BROS BEFORE BARMAIDS!

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.500
&gt;&gt;OH, WAKE UP ADAM THERE COMES A TIME IN EVERY
MAN'S LIFE WHEN

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.710
HE WANTS TO SHARE DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS WITH
SOMEONE

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.720
SPECIAL WHO ISN'T JASON.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.909
&gt;&gt;OFFENSE TAKEN!

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.080
&gt;&gt;YEAH, BUT SHE IS A LIAR AND SHE IS WELL,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.850
I DON'T KNOW HER, BUT I DON'T TRUST AN ATTRACTIVE

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.270
WOMAN WHO IS INTO JASON.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.500
&gt;&gt;THANK YOU.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.599
&gt;&gt;MORE OFFENSE TAKEN!

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.970
&gt;&gt;OH, SHE'S THE LIAR?

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.090
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.060
WHO LIVES IN CANADA?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.760
&gt;&gt;WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT SHE'S REAL.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.420
&gt;&gt;SHE'S NOT.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.910
&gt;&gt;I KNEW I COULDN'T TRUST YOU.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.830
&gt;&gt;YOU GUYS, WHY DON'T WE JUST PUT THE PAST
BEHIND US

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.470
AND TRY TO WORK AS A TEAM?

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.760
&gt;&gt;NO.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.700
THERE IS NO WAY I'M GOING TO BE THE DUNGEON
MASTER

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.860
IF THE TWO OF YOU ARE--

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.580
 &gt;&gt;CARLY?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.460
SORRY I'M LATE.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.840
&gt;&gt;LET'S DO THIS.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.600
&gt;&gt;WHERE SHOULD I SIT?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.540
&gt;&gt;OH, THIS SEAT IS AVAILABLE!

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.160
&gt;&gt;OH!

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.410
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL JUST STAND OR SQUAT.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.069
I'LL SQUAT.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.730
RIGHT HERE.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.720
&gt;&gt;THIS IS NICE.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.420
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A ROOM WITH AN EQUAL GENDER
RATIO BEFORE.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.700
SO, I'M GOING TO CHASE THAT FEELING.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.060
&gt;&gt;CAN WE PROCEED PLEASE?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.800
MY CHARACTER IS CURRENTLY STANDING NEXT TO

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.840
SEVERAL UNICORNS WHILST DRESSED AS A WOMAN.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.960
SO, THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.280
&gt;&gt;OH, WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO ONCE YOU'VE CAPTURED
THEM?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.319
&gt;&gt;WE PLAN ON SELLING THE HORN TO A DARK WIZARD

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.780
FOR UNTOLD FORTUNES.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.470
&gt;&gt;INTERESTING.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.160
&gt;&gt;INDEED.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.970
&gt;&gt;THE DARK WIZARD WHO LIVES ON THE EDGE OF
THE FOREST?

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.900
&gt;&gt;YES, WHY DO I FEEL FOREBODING?

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.960
&gt;&gt;LADIES?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.459
&gt;&gt;I BIND MATT AND JASON WITH A SPELL.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.760
&gt;&gt;A SPELL OF LOVE YOU MEAN?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760
WAIT WHAT?

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.379
&gt;&gt;ALL THE UNICORNS FLEE EXCEPT FOR ONE.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.879
&gt;&gt;I BIND THE UNICORN WITH ANOTHER SPELL.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.950
&gt;&gt;NO, I WAS GOING TO USE MY FEMININE WILES.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.849
I SPENT A FORTUNE ON THAT CORSET.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.640
&gt;&gt;AND I REMOVE THE UNICORN'S HORN.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.920
&gt;&gt;WE EXIT THE FOREST AND SEEK OUT THE DARK
WIZARD

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.660
TO COLLECT OUR REWARD.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.500
HUZZAH AND SUSAN B. ANTHONY.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.200
&gt;&gt;BEFORE YOU LEAVE, YOU NOTICE THE UNICORN
STIRRING.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.780
&gt;&gt;I DON'T CARE IF THE UNICORN-- 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.540
&gt;&gt;SEAM AT
THE TOP SPLITS OPEN

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.730
AND FROM IT EMERGES A MAN MERELY DRESSED AS
A UNICORN.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.930
&gt;&gt;WHAT MAN?

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.330

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.780
&gt;&gt;MATT, YOU KNEW JEREMY WAS THERE!

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.170
&gt;&gt;I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE DRAMA.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.640

&gt;&gt;I TAKE MY MIGHTY SWORD AND THROW IT AT THE
BETRAYERS!

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.769
&gt;&gt;REVENGE IS SWEET!

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.920
HE ROLLED A ONE!

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.000
&gt;&gt;CRITICAL FAIL.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.220
THE SWORD HITS A ROCK REBOUNDS AND IMPALES
YOU!

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.400
&gt;&gt;OH MY HUBRIS!

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.500

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.560
I'M STILL IMPRESSED BY YOUR CUNNING.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.030
&gt;&gt;[GASP] JASON, IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN!

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.290

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.000
&gt;&gt;YOU WON'T BE NEEDING THESE.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.550
&gt;&gt;OH, LOVE IS TRULY BLIND.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.250
