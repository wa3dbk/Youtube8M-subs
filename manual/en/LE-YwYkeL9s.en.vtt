00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.459
Hello

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.280
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.840
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.590
Regardless of your age, there are three essential
skincare products

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.990
that everybody should use every day:

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.929
a sunscreen, an exfoliant, and an antioxidant.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.039
But your skin also has additional and different
needs

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.330
that depend on your age.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.630
In this episode of the DermTV series

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.140
on skincare by the decades, I’ll discuss

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.749
the issues specific to your 50’s, to get
healthier,

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.710
more beautiful and younger looking skin.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.899
And there’s a lot of information here so
I’m going to split 50s

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.530
into three episodes.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.570
Today, I’m going to present

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.489
all of the issues and get through the first
two.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.109
Then in future episodes, I’ll tackle the
others.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.239
Let’s dive in!

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.050
In your Fifties, the issues that are generally
most important

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.690
to you are first, and always first,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.589
ongoing prevention of additional photo-aging,
lines and wrinkles.

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.569
Second, slowing the development of lines and
wrinkles

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.660
caused by unnecessary facial expressions.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.579
Third, exfoliation… but in your 50s,

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.159
it’s not only to correct age and sun related
texture problems

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.950
and sun induced color problems.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.149
It’s also to remove

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.170
the early sun induced abnormal surface cells

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.380
that can become precancerous growths and then
actual skin cancers.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.909
Fourth, fillers and more aggressive laser
correction

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.840
and improvement of lines, wrinkles and other
contours

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.329
that come from loss of skin collagen and elastic
tissue

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.090
whether from sun exposure, tobacco habits,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.180
or from repeated facial expressions or from
loss of facial fat

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.670
that occurs in everyone simply from the passage
of years.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.400
Fifth, skin tightening and firming for sagging
skin,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.940
especially in the lower face and neck.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.990
And last, in your later 50s, consideration
of surgical procedures

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.240
for eye area, neck and facial sagging or wrinkling

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.479
that just defies everything I’ve already
discussed.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.040
In terms of prevention of additional photo-aging,
lines and wrinkles,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.289
in the interest of brevity, check out the
episodes

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.119
on skincare in the 20s and 30s.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.830
So onto the second issue…

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.610
and instead of the prevention of lines and
wrinkles caused by

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.520
unnecessary facial expressions that I discussed
for the forties,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.280
now it’s really time to start slowing the
development of lines and wrinkles

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.640
caused by unnecessary facial expressions

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.910
which cause premature etching of those lines.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.940
To slow their development requires botulium
treatments

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.580
with either Dysport or Botox.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.410
Many unwanted lines and wrinkles

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.310
are caused by repeated facial expressions
t

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.160
hat are neither desirable nor productive,
like frowns and raised eyebrows.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.470
While Botox or Dysport can’t be used to
prevent all facial lines…

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.950
for example, the ones caused by necessary
expressions like smiles…

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.840
the earlier you start Botox or Dysport treatments,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.650
the better you’ll prevent those lines.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.970
So in parts 2 and 3 of skincare for the fifties,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.610
I’ll tell you what exfoliation, filler,
laser treatments,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:16.970
skin tightening and finally surgery can do
for you.
