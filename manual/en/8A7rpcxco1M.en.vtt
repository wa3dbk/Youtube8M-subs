Many of you have asked how to keep
up with the latest Chuck Knows Church.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.140
Actually, some of you have asked
how to keep up with the latest

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.220
Chuck Knows.... Emily from Sarasota has
asked how can she

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.140
she keep up with Chuck Knows Church.
Let me tell you how Emily,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.830
besides Facebook, there are really three
ways to keep up with all things Chuck.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.930
First of all, is of course our website

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.890
www.chuckknowschurch.com. There
you will find

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.489
each and every episode that you can watch
and download for free

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.620
For free, is that right? For free? For free?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.670
Not even one penny? At the website
you can also purchase

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.780
T-shirts, DVDs, and other Chuckie goodies.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.969
I don't know what they mean by Chuckie
goodies,

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.960
per se, maybe pens or just locks of my hair,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.609
maybe. That's weird, don't, we don't--

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.420
The second way is by subscribing to our
e-newsletter

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.309
We send out one and only one email
per week,

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.850
so don't even ask for more! Sorry,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.119
I get passionate. We will tell you the latest
about Chuck Knows Church the series and

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.780
you know, even the people. And we never give
your email address to anyone else.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.630
And last, but not least, if you have an
account with YouTube,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.890
come on, please subscribe to our YouTube
channel. It's a no brainer.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.960
Just go to the YouTube channel and you
hit subscribe.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.119
It's pretty simple, and it makes me very
happy.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.259
Makes our producers kind of happy,

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.289
makes me very happy. So, there we got,

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.409
three ways, Facebook, our website,

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.880
e-newsletter, or YouTube channel....three

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.509
I guess that's four really... anyway

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.810
thank you so much for all your continued
support and Chuck Knows Church

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.670
and if you don't mind I have to get back
to our latest episode that we're filming

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.549
falling asleep in Church.
