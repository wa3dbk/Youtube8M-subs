Hello I am Sarolta Eke. Hello I'm Tamas Kassai,
we are here on behalf of Expert Village. We

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.889
are going to show you how to dance Jive. Now
I will show you the lady's step for Jive basic

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:31.220
step. It looks like this, 1-2-3 and 4-5 and
6, 1-2-3 and 4-5 and 6, 1-2-3 and 4-5 and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:42.370
6. I will show you from this side as well,
it's 1-2-3 and 4-5 and 6, 1-2-3 and 4-5 and

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:53.880
6. So the foot positions for this step, I
will show you from here is right foot back,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.250
left foot in place, right foot to the side,
close left foot to right foot, right foot

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.579
to the side, left foot in place, close right
foot to left foot, left foot to side. Now

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:14.080
I can start it from the beginning, it's back,
in place, right, close, right, left, close,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.740
left. So the Jive chasse is to the side, close
and side and the chasse to the right is to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.790
the right, close and Jive. So the Jive basic
step consist of three parts. The first part

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.820
is rock back, which is right foot back and
left foot in place. The first chasse is to

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.250
the right and the second chasse is to the
left. So when you practice you should always

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.470
try to practice these small bits and when
you're sure of yourself you can put them together

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.180
and you can dance the whole basic step. So
once more I will show you, it's 1-2-3 and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:10.390
4-5 and 6. The foot technique for this step
is ball flat, ball flat, ball, ball, ball

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:25.069
flat, ball, ball, ball flat. I will show you
from here, it's ball flat, ball flat, ball,

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.120
ball, ball flat, ball, ball, ball flat. 1-2-3
and 4-5 and 6, 1-2-3 and 4-5 and 6.
