Hi! My name is Ken Marcou and I’m going
to talk a little bit about tuning drums. The

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:13.210
drums have a top and a bottom head which need
to resonate together in a harmonist way, this

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:20.400
is more than anything trial and error and
just kind of hitting it till it’s done good

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.630
to be quiet honest but there are lugs that
go around the drum, these are lugs here every

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.710
drum has them and what they do is they hold
the drum head which is this thing right here…this

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.359
is what you’ll actually hit. The top drum
head is called a batter head, the bottom drum

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:50.360
head underneath the drum is called a resonant
head, both of them resonate and they have

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.330
to resonate together to get a good sound in
drum. To do that the way I typically do it

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.079
is first thing I do is tune the top head and
I’ll mute the bottom head with my hand,

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.149
it’s not a perfect science but it works,
from here I hit each one of the lug locations

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.810
which you know basically I hit right in front
of each one of the lugs and you try to get

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:27.079
each one sounding more less the same, so like
so…now more or less each one of those hits

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.700
were about the same tone there were some with
differences though and from there I would

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:44.619
take my drum key which I have on my key chain
which is attached to me at all times believe

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.710
it or not and this is what the drum key looks
like, more less you use this to manipulate

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.240
the lug screw which is on the drum and you
can tighten it or loosen it depending on if

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.909
that lug location is too high or too low in
pitch. If it’s too low in pitch you want

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.679
to tighten the lug so that the pitch goes
up, if it’s too high in pitch you want to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.530
loosen the lug location so that pitch goes
down, I’ll demonstrate that here if I hit

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.690
this location…and then I loosen it…you
can hear the pitch change pretty substantially

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.910
that’s just one lug location, so usually
you want to do this very suddenly by turning

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.520
each lug location very suddenly, now I’m
going to pitch this back up to where it was

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:43.030
generally…and from here I want to go around
the whole drum and match all the pitches and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.040
from there you’d want to do that on the
bottom head and make sure each tone of each

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.800
head works together so that the drum in the
end sounds nice, that’s how you tune your

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.780
drums in a nutshell. .
