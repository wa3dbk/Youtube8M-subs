00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.760
Hello!

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.720
You shouldn't be in here!

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.460
What are you working on?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.820
I'm making a cake!

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.880
Is it someone's birthday?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.740
Not my birthday...

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.260
It's NYLON's 7th birthday!

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.140
It's my first time baking...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.780
But as a person who likes to cook

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.300
I don't think it'll be that challenging

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.780
We saw an article of you in NYLON

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.360
You must enjoy cooking on a daily basis!

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.840
I love to cook!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.720
When I moved out from my parent's house

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.140
That's when I began to cook

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.380
And for the past three years

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.980
I've been really into cooking

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.940
When I have a bite of something

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.740
I can guess what kind of ingredients were added

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.800
Really?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.860
I think this only has food coloring in it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.760
Only food coloring?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.600
I believe so

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.620
Hey boss! What flavor is this cake?

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.280
It has no flavoring yet!

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.220
I'm going to add strawberries later

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.720
I told you!

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.300
I told you it's just cream!

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.640
Hold it straight up

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.940
And just squeeze

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.200
That sounds easy...

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.260
Minho's turn!

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.360
That was easy

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.480
I think I can work here

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.720
Just squeeze it!

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.820
Oh no!

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.240
Did someone take a dump LOL

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.360
Someone took a dump!

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.360
Will there be special decorations on the cupcakes?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.200
I was thinking about writing something...

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.460
But it sounded hard...

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.280
So I'm just going to put on sprinkles LOL

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.400
Wow you're good!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.720
I majored in art

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.520
Oh really?

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.140
Does studying art

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.460
Have any benefit on baking?

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.300
How did you know about this place?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.520
I come here often

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.620
To read

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.080
It's like my secret place!

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.900
Like a place no one knows about?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.420
But now everybody knows about it!

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.000
I think you're really talented in baking

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.020
I don't think I'm not NOT talented...

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.200
I was surprised!

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.480
I had no idea he's a rookie!

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.300
I thought you took lessons LOL

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.920
What score would you give me?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.660
A hundred!

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.220
Ahh~

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.440
I think he should be a worker here!

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.620
I'll sign a contract right now!

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.480
Do you have any other presents

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.580
For NYLON?

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.260
I have one more!

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.480
But that's a secret

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.720
You'll find out in NYLON!

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.500
In July!

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.680
In September!

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.940
The September issue!

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.380
She is a lot better than I am...

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.780
Don't forget to pay!

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.540
It's 380 bucks in total

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.820
Can I pay in installments?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.880
Nope!

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.840
No..

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.440
I think you love to try new things!

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.460
I want to be the type of person

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.720
Who isn't scared to trying new things

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.420
I should live while I'm young LOL

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.100
This is the final product!

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.000
What does it take like?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.820
Um... I think it tastes cute? LOL

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.580
I've made the 7th birthday cupcakes for NYLON!

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.500
I'll take the first bite!
