Hi. I'm Madame Pamita and this is Madame
Pamita's Parlour of Wonders. You can find

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.640
me online at parlourofwonders.com. Today
I'm going to be talking to you about

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.270
petition papers, what is a petition paper
and how to make one. A petition paper is a

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.730
paper that you write down for spell work
with the words of what it is that you're

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.510
trying to accomplish with your spell. So
for example it just can be any really

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.280
piece of paper at all, any kind of paper, and you would write down words that would

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.080
show what it is that you're wanting to
bring in. So a simple paper with any kind

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.260
of writing on it. You can write symbols on
it. You can draw pictures on it. But

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.942
there are other different kinds of petition
papers that are specialized beyond this,

00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:59.920
just a simple piece of paper. For example,
you can use a cutout heart-shaped piece of

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.750
paper if you wanted to do a love spell and
write your petition on that. Oftentimes

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.090
people use photographs for petitions where
they write on the back of the photograph.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.630
You can write what it is that you're
wanting. If it's for yourself, you'd use

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.670
your picture, if it was for someone else,
you'd use their picture. You could use

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.240
yourself and someone else if you were
doing a spell for the two of you, for

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.290
example. So you can write on the back of
that what it is that you're wanting to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.410
accomplish with your spell and use that.
Another kind of petition paper is using

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.021
money. You can use a two dollar bill or
any denomination. A two dollar bill is

00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:41.663
special in Hoodoo because it's kind of a
unique denomination. It isn't often used.

00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:46.748
And you can write around the edges of it.
You can sign your name underneath the

00:01:46.748 --> 00:01:52.344
treasurer's name. You can do all sorts of
things working with money and using that

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:56.650
as a petition paper. What do you do with a
petition paper? Well, once you've made

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.050
your petition paper, what you
would do with it is you would put it

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.090
underneath a candle or sometimes you burn
them if you want to get rid of something.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.970
But we're going to talk about petitions
where you want to bring in something. So

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.290
if you want to bring in something, you
would fold that paper towards you because

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.320
you want to bring it to you. Then you
would turn it 90 degrees to the right and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.940
fold it towards you again. You can do that
once, twice, three times whatever you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.870
feel. And then you place that petition
paper under a candle. If you're working

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.100
with something that you want to get rid
of, you would turn and fold that petition

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.700
paper away from you. So you would fold
it away from you, turn it to the left and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.000
fold it away from you and then place it
underneath your candle for banishing, or

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.160
reversal or getting rid of something. All
right. Now I'm going to show you a

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.190
specific kind of petition paper and this
petition paper is a very old recipe. It's

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.470
one that is used for a honey jar spell. So
what you need for that is you need some

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.780
brown paper, and you can use like the thin,
brown paper that you find on a lunch bag,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.590
and a pen. And what you're going
to do is you're first going to tear

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.433
out a square
out of the brown paper.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.010
It doesn't have to be perfect, but you
do have to have all four sides being torn.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.200
It's a trick that I learned in elementary
school. You want to make sure that it's

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.600
a square, you fold the corner up like a
triangle and you say, "Aha, I got some

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.190
extra here," so I can tear that part off
to make a square. It doesn't have to be

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.060
perfect like that though but it's
nice to have a square. Okay.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.930
So now, I have my square, brown paper
with the four torn edges that I tore out

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.990
by hand. The next thing you're going to do
is you're going to write the names of the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.080
person, with a honey jar spell you're wanting
someone to feel more positive feelings and

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.540
more loving feelings towards you. So a
honey jar... if you look at the video about

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.810
honey jars you'll know what they're about....
But you're trying to get someone to feel

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.050
more positive feelings towards you. So,
what you want to do is first write that

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.835
person's name three times just like
that and you write it in cursive.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:07.830
Okay. I've written a person's name three
times. Then you turn that paper 90 degrees

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.254
to the right. Okay. Then you write
your name three times over that

00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:15.021
making a crisscross pattern.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.730
So it looks like that. The next thing

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.620
you're going to do is you're going to
write the words of what it is that you

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.270
want in your petition around that
crisscross pattern. You want something

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.000
short because you're going to write it all
the way around and repeating it and you're

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.310
going to link them at the end. So a long
petition like, "I want this person to hear

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.060
my case and find me not guilty." Too long,
so you want something short.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:10.660
So you can do something like, "Give me a
raise. Love me. Find me not guilty." In

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.970
any of those cases, you know, this is you
want someone to do something. You just get

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.110
right to the point. So in this case with
Mary Smith and John Smith, I'm going to

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.600
put the petition "love me." Very simple, and
easy and straightforward. We're going to

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.160
write it in a circle all the way around
and then link it at the end. The important

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.400
thing in this is not to lift your pen even
if you have to cross your T or dot your

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.525
Is. You want to make it one continuous
line going all the way around.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.780
And so you see I've made one continuous
line going all the way around and linking

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:11.690
them at the end. So at this point, you
would then do the rest of working with the

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.270
honey jar spell. You don't have to use
this just for honey jars though. You can

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.450
use this working with candles. This is
another way of making a petition paper a

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.060
very old fashioned way. You don't have to
write the names three times. You can write

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.700
them in any magical number 3, 7,
9, 13 and you can write those.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.340
Again it's important that you write the
person that you're wanting to do your

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.600
bidding underneath, turn it and then write
your name on top of it. And so that is how

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.320
you make a petition paper. My name is
