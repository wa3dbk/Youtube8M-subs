00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.040
&gt;&gt;&gt; DR.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.320
DAVID MARGILETH: Chemotherapy after surgery
is decided by looking at the characteristics

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
of that particular patient’s breast cancer.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.380
Things like, especially positive lymph nodes,
indicate that there’s a possibility of microscopic

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:36.260
cells circulating in that patient’s system
that at some later date, may cause metastasis.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.400
One of the tasks that we don’t have, that
needless to say would be great, is a test

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.190
that tells us, after a primary therapy or
after a local therapy that doing mastectomy

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:58.740
or lumpectomy radiotherapy, are there circulating
tumor cells that have metastatic potential?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:06.290
There are many patients, even many with no
positive breast cancer, from the past we know

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.329
were cured by local therapy alone.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:20.360
But with various factors, namely hormone receptor-negativity,
positive nodes, larger tumors, and especially

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:29.680
a higher number of positive nodes, indicate
that there are cells in that patient’s body

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.659
that have metastatic potential that we have
no test for.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.260
Patients often ask, “Well, can I get a PET
scan and an MRI and a CAT scan and a brain

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.080
scan and bone scan, and prove that I don’t
need chemotherapy?”

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.049
Unfortunately, none of those tests are sensitive
enough to pick up the cells that will eventually

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.490
cause metastasis.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.260
So that we are left with looking at large
trials, large databases, with different characteristics

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.660
of patient’s cancers, that is a low number
of positive nodes or a high number of positive

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.870
nodes or HER2-positive, or HER2-negative,
etc, and running different trials with different

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.230
adjuvant therapies.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.340
And in those trials that are often randomized,
that is neither the patient nor the doctor

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.950
picks the treatment, but randomized between,
for instance an older treatment and a newer

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.950
treatment.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.780
And in those large settings, when we have
positive data, it shows us that in a particular

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.340
group of patients given a new treatment or
a different treatment, their long-term cure

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.840
rate is higher than the older treatment.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.980
The dilemma continues to be that even though
we know group A maybe better than group B,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.769
there are obviously people in group B that
did not benefit because they might not had

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.680
needed treatment in the first place, and that
unfortunately, even patients in group A with

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.400
a new or better treatment that recur in spite
of that treatment.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.230
What we continue to need is an individual
test that determines whether a particular

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.599
patient, after their local therapy, is destined
to recur or not.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:33.569
I don’t see that test occurring in the next
five years certainly, but one would hope in

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.709
the next ten years one might have that test
so that many of the people we now treat with

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.359
adjuvant chemotherapy we would prove don’t
benefit by it and therefore, we wouldn’t

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.689
give it.

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:56.790
Hi, I am Dr. Jay Harness and I want to share
with you important information that I believe

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.719
that every newly diagnosed patient with breast
cancer needs to know.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:10.139
Susan Denver: And I want every woman to know…

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.010
Katherine Stockton: …about personalized
breast cancer treatment…

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.010
Susan Denver: …and the genomic test.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.560
Coree: A test that helps guide a woman and
her doctor…

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.280
Katherine Stockton: …to the best treatment
options for her.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.630
Susan Denver: Pass it on!
