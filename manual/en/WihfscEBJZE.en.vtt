00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.219
Dear me,

00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:07.460
You're 15. Almost 16. Woooo sophomore year,
that was a fun one.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.400
Not really.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.509
It’s 25-year-old you, ten years in the future.
Guess what? You made it. You made it to Seattle.

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.960
But that only happened a few months ago. It’s
gonna take awhile, sorry about that.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.529
I’m here to tell you that everything you’re
going through right now - so is everyone else.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.529
Well, not EVERYthing, but nevermind about
that one.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.070
You sweat through all your clothes, your boobs
are too big, your braces are definitely not

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.430
the most attractive thing about you - but
whoa buddy, your teeth are gonna look awesome.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.559
Trust me. The five years - yeah five years,
again, sorry about that - are gonna be worth

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.340
it. All those things that seem so important
and so annoying and so UGH MY LIFE SUCKS,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.190
well, a few of those things still feel like
that even has a 25-year-old “adult,” but

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.700
they eventually work to your advantage. You
may hate your boobs right now, but you will

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.820
LOVE them by the time you can afford Victoria’s
Secret and can wear low-cut things because

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.950
NO DRESS CODE muthafucka.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.620
The thing is, right now where you are, the
most important thing is how you see yourself

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.260
and who you surround yourself with. The friends
you have right now - most of them are pretty

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.220
great. I mean, there's a few douchebags, but
it’s learning how to deal with the douchebags

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.460
that makes you stronger.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.320
Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself,
whether its in an argument or a class discussion

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.970
or on the internet. Take chances. If your
brain is telling you that you’re not qualified

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.690
or not good enough to do something, slap yourself
in the face and tell yourself that you're

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.680
just as good as everybody else. Just don't
be afraid in general. It took me a long time

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.130
to figure that out.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.250
As for the next ten years…

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.500
Learn to do your taxes, for god’s sake.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.890
Take public transit. It’s really really
eye-opening.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.310
Use condoms, don’t be an idiot.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.950
Write something every single day.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.730
If you’re not confident enough to talk to
a guy, just fake it. Or grab a beer, if you're

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.710
already 21.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.689
I’ll pass on something a guy friend told
me just today. “I’m convinced that you

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.060
don’t really know how attractive you are.
You are very attractive. But for the record,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.469
I think being sweet is way more important.”

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.650
Keep telling yourself that. Every single day.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.569
Sincerely, me.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.400
Hi guys, so I decided to make that video as
part of YouTube's #DearMe campaign. If you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.099
guys haven't had a chance to check out any
of the other videos I suggest you do, because

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.099
they're really insightful and really thoughtful.
I particularly like Grace Helbig's video because

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.090
it was totally out of character for her to
get really serious and I really loved her

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.170
getting really sincere. I look up to her a
lot and I think she's really important in

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:02.159
this community and I just love seeing her
be successful at life. Anyway. I didn't wanna

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.530
leave you guys without a song of the day though,
since I didn't do one in my last video. So

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.840
today's song of the day is Renegades by the
Young Evils. They actually were on last week's

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.359
episode of Band In Seattle, which you can
actually check out right here. I'll put a

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.799
link to it. Then please if you get a chance
to, this weekend actually tomorrow night on

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.620
the CW or next week it'll be on YouTube - one
of the episodes that I actually cohosted with

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.040
Xander, so if you get a chance to watch that
if you're in the Seattle area, it's on CW,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.579
tomorrow night at 11. But check out the Young
Evils episode because it's actually really

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.209
cute, it's like half band story, half love
story. So check out the Young Evils, check

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:57.829
out that song, post any of your #DearMe responses
and just... Live Long and Prosper.
