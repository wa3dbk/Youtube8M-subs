This game will be set before the third, fourth
and fifth games in the franchise, morrowing,

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:33.350
oblivion and skyrim.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.770

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.629
Now you probably wouldn't consider yourself
a hybrid if you're a bit of an animal but

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.319

got a little hope in our hearts.

by Ubisoft Studio Massive Entertainment and

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.159
a nice thing about this engine is it wil run
in real time meaning the game will always

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.579
be playable during development.

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.120

into the groove.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.909
Batman even has a new look, a suit more armoured
than anything we've seen before so each side

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.480
works together to create new experiences.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.069
Next, the map.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.750

use Bungie's hopper technology which you'll

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.760
