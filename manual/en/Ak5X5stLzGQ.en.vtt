00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.019
How to Build a Doghouse. If your best friend
likes being outdoors, they need their own

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.430
spot to keep warm and dry. You will need A
tape measure A circular saw A work bench A

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.119
10-ft. spruce 2-by-4 Safety glasses A hammer
A bag of 16d nails (3 1/4-in.) A bag of 8d

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.140
nails (2 1/2-in.) A 4-by-8-ft. sheet of untreated
spruce plywood siding (5/8-in. thick) An 8-ft.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.480
spruce 2-by-4 A bag of cedar shavings A hand
file 1 gal. of exterior wood primer 1 gal.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.699
of exterior enamel paint A box of roofing
shingles A bag of roofing nails and two sawhorses

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.550
(optional) (optional) (optional). Step 1.
Measure your pet's height, width, and length

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.219
with the tape measure. Add approximately 12
inches to the height, 18 inches to the length,

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.300
and 9 inches to the width to determine the
dimensions of your doghouse. This one will

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.659
fit a medium-sized dog. Because a dog's body
heat warms a doghouse, it should be just large

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.611
enough for your pet to stand in and turn around
easily. Step 2. Lay the 10-foot 2-by-4 on

00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:17.380
a workbench. With the circular saw, cut it
into eight pieces: two pieces that are 22

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.340
7/8 inches long, two pieces, 20 ¾ inches
long, and four 6-inch pieces. To keep your

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.910
eyes safe from flying debris, make sure to
wear safety glasses. Step 3. Using the circular

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.730
saw, round one end of each of the 6-inch pieces
(these will become the legs of the doghouse).

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.000
Take two of the legs and one of the 22 7/8-inch
pieces. Line up the flat edges of the legs

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.050
with the edge of the platform side, and, using
the longer 16d nails, nail the feet to the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.050
piece. Repeat this step for the other side.
These pieces will be the two sides of the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.790
platform. Step 4. The 20 ¾-inch pieces will
become the front and back of the frame. Hold

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.460
the side pieces so that the legs are on the
inside and nail the front piece to the sides.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.930
Repeat this step for the back side of the
frame. Step 5. Lay the plywood on the workbench

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.390
or on two sawhorses and cut it into the following
pieces: two bottom pieces (20 ¾ inches by

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:20.250
25 7/8 inches), two roof pieces (31 7/8 inches
by 21 7/8 inches), two side pieces (16 inches

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.500
by 25 7/8 inches), one back piece (22 inches
wide and 27 inches high), and one front piece

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.820
(22 inches wide and 27 inches high). Step
6. Cut the front and back pieces so they have

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.530
a triangle shape at one end: 16 inches high
on each side and 27 inches high in the middle.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.885
One end of each board will be flat while the
other end will come to a point, like an arrow.

00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:45.840
Step 7. About 3 inches above the bottom edge
of the front piece, start cutting a door hole.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.710
The doorway should be wide enough to accommodate
your dog, flat at the bottom, and rounded

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.040
at the top. Step 8. Lay one floor piece on
your frame and line up the edges. If the floor

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.080
piece hangs over the edge, trim off any excess
wood. Nail the first floor piece to the frame

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.140
using the 16d nails, and repeat the process
for the second piece, giving your dog a two-layer

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.860
floor. Step 9. Cut the 8-foot 2-by-4 in half,
creating a pair of 2-by-2 boards. Cut each

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.310
of these boards into four 12½-inch pieces
and one 22-inch piece. You should now have

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.270
nine frame elements, which will reinforce
the doghouse. Step 10. Using the 8d nails,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.800
nail two 12½-inch frame elements to one side
panel. The elements should be placed vertically

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.560
at each end and 3½ inches from the bottom
edge. Repeat the process for the second side

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.760
panel. Nail one side panel to each side of
the frame. Step 11. Place two 12½-inch frame

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.500
elements on the back piece so that they meet
at the point and nail them with the 8d nails

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.890
into place. Attach the back piece to the back
of the frame. Repeat this process for the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.030
front piece. Place the cedar shavings on the
floor to create bedding for your best friend.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.810
Check for any exposed nails and file down
any pointy tips with the hand file. Step 12.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.489
On one of the roof pieces, attach the 22-inch
frame element with the 8d nails, centering

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.360
the piece so there is the same amount of free
space at either end. Put the roof piece into

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.270
position on top of the house and nail it to
the frames at the front and back of the doghouse.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.780
Then nail the second roof panel to the first
frame element of the first roof panel. Step

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.770
13. Paint the exterior with primer and let
dry. Then, add a coat of exterior latex paint

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.460
to protect the wood and allow to dry. Step
14. Using the roofing nails, nail down one

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.389
row of upside-down roof shingles at the bottom
edge of each roof panel. Lay down additional

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:39.849
rows on top of the first row, using short
roofing nails. Did you know Two great Danes

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.110
in Gloucestershire, England live in a doghouse
that has a spa and a plasma television set.
