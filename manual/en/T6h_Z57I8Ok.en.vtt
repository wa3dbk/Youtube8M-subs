How to Set Off 
Fireworks Safely.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.449
Protect yourself and loved ones from injury
by knowing how to launch fireworks safely.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.580
You will need Legal fireworks An open space
away from flammables An extended lighter A

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.840
source of water and safety glasses.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
Fireworks can be incredibly dangerous.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.199
Never let kids play with or light fireworks.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.250
Step 1.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.879
Make sure that setting off fireworks is legal
in your area.

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.680
Your local police precinct or firehouse will
be able to tell you.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.680
Step 2.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.989
Buy only legal fireworks from a reputable
manufacturer.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.280
Legitimate fireworks will contain an item
number, brand name, and instructions.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.410
M-80s, M-100s, blockbusters, quarter pounders,
and cherry bombs are not fireworks; they are

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.100
illegal explosives.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100
Step 3.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.090
Keep children and pets out of range at all
times to protect them and their hearing&amp;#8212;and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.160
to make sure animals don’t get scared and
bolt.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.160
Step 4.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.630
Pick a safe spot to set off your display,
meaning an open space with a flat, solid,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.750
level surface.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.479
It should be at least 30 feet away from people,
homes, cars, and flammable materials like

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.569
dry brush.

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:18.380
Don’t set off fireworks in strong winds.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.380
Step 5.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.359
Keep at a safe distance when you light fireworks
by using a butane stove lighter, extra long

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.520
matches, or a punk lighter, which is a smoldering
slow-burning stick.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.189
Hold the lighter at arm’s length, and don’t
hover over the device as you light it.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.259
Never set off fireworks in a container.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.329
Step 6.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.340
Set off fireworks one at a time.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.140
Eye protection is strongly recommended.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.140
Step 7.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.100
Don’t try to reignite a firework that doesn’t
go off.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.880
Leave it alone for at least 20 minutes and
then soak it in a bucket of water.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.689
Keep a garden hose, a pail of water, or a
fire extinguisher nearby in case you need

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.310
to put out flames.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.310
Step 8.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.819
Do we even have to say it?

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.899
Never throw fireworks or direct them toward
anyone.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.709
Don’t light them in your hand&amp;#8212;and
don’t carry them in your pocket, either!

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:07.709
Step 9.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.380
If your clothing catches fire, drop to the
floor and roll on the ground.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.379
If you get something in your eye, don’t
touch, rub, or rinse it.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.280
Just head straight for the emergency room.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.340
Step 10.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.250
When the fun is done, gather up all the firework
debris and give it a good soaking before putting

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.470
in a trash container.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.940
Did you know Between 9,000 and 10,000 people
are taken to the hospital each year for fireworks-related

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.109
injuries, with nearly half of the victims
under the age of 15.
