Hi, guys.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.260
It's C'erine from Cerinebabyyish.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.430
I'm going to be showing you guys how to do
this finger wave updo, as inspired by a women

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.470
of the '20s.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.400
It's quite difficult to do usually, but I'm
going to be showing you guys how to do it

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.920
with a deep waver iron.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.550
I'm going to begin by taking the Nexxus Hydra-Light
Root Lift Mist and spraying it directly to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.190
my roots.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.470
So I already have the rest of my hair sectioned
out and pulled up into a bun, and I'm only

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.150
going to show you how to create finger waves
to the front section of my hair.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.660
So I divided this section into three equal
parts and I sectioned off the very top and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.809
I pulled it off to the side and I pinned it
out of the way for the time being.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.729
I take the next section and do the exact same
thing.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:50.050
I'm taking the TRESemmé 24 Hour Body Finishing
Spray and using this on the bottom section.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.959
I'm taking my deep waver and clamping a section
about one inch down from my roots.

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:57.850
And I continue down to create the next wave.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.629
And the next wave until they reach a little
bit below my jaw line.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.500
Then, I let down the next section.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.630
I spray it with the TRESemmé 24 Hour Body
Finishing Spray.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.290
And I do exact same thing with the very top
section.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.940
Just make sure the waves from all three sections
line up.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.180
We're going to take the Dove Nourishing Oil
Fruit Serum just to add a little bit extra

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.170
shine to our waves.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.720
I'm next taking the waves, pulling it over
my ear, twisting it and then wrapping it around

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.850
the bun.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.960
Pin it in place with a couple of bobby pins
and adjust the look until you're happy with

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.360
how it looks from the front and the sides.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.140
And finally, just taking a small pin, just
to accessorize, and we are done with the look.
