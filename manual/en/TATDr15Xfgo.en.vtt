00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:06.190
Listen to me, Burt.
Nobody likes you.

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:08.066
Nobody will ever like you.

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:12.863
Welcome to the
amazing world of magic.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.576
Everyone loves a magician.

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:19.286
And they'll love you too.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.145
- Do you want to be my partner?
- More than anything!

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:29.046
I'm Burt Wonderstone!

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:30.650
And I'm Anton Marvelton!

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:32.293
But of course you already new that!

00:00:36.844 --> 00:00:38.077
Your ticket sales suck.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.598
What?

00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:43.602
Steve Gray, they're calling him
the future of magic.

00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:46.688
The guy is magician
and he doesn't even have a costume.

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:50.567
I'm sure you've seen people
walk on red hot coals.

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:54.405
But I doubt you've seen anyone
spend the night on red hot coal.

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:03.195
You need to do something fresh.

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:05.498
So, this is where
all entertainers go to die?

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:08.335
And some are not so old.

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.088
May I see that for a minute?
Watch this!

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.841
- What have you done?
- I'm a magician.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.301
They should have explained that
to you earlier.

00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:20.180
You're Rance Holloway.
I had your magic kit as a kid.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.307
I'll give you your money back.

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:26.854
What you're feeling right now.
That's why you became a magician.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.189
- How did you do that?
- It's partially deboned.

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.026
What you do is not magic.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.686
It's natural for a dying leaf
to be frighten by the autumn wind.

00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:37.072
Your skin makes me crack.

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:39.616
We need some sort
of grand illusion!

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:42.661
You and Burt Wonderstone
plan to stay in the box an entire week?

00:01:44.662 --> 00:01:47.124
- I can't breath!
- It's only been 20 minutes!

00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:50.544
This is the best trick ever!

00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:03.766
For twelve days

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:05.511
he's held his urine.

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:09.354
- What is going through your mind?
- I really have to pee, Richard.

00:02:12.273 --> 00:02:14.276
It's time
for my final disappearing act.

00:02:15.944 --> 00:02:18.781
- Where did he go?
- He has gone to a better place.

00:02:18.947 --> 00:02:19.990
Good bye, Rance.

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:21.867
- He's under the bed.
- I know.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.979
