00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.469
Today I'm gonna show you how to dry any car
faster and easier

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.500
using the brand new Chemical Guys After Wash.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.650
After Wash is a brand new product from us
that you can get

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.219
right now from our website:

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.759
ChemicalGuys.com

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.529
After Wash is the perfect way to dry any vehicle,

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.040
and it's an absolute must for any detailer
that needs

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.110
a product in their arsenal.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.000
After Wash is designed to do three things:

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.980
First, it releases water from the surface.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.980
So after you wash your car and it's completely
wet,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.950
spray After Wash on the surface.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.800
It uses hydrophobic technology to push water
off,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.800
release it from the surface,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.490
and dry your car faster than ever before.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.579
Plus it provides maximum lubrication when
drying.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.190
95% of swirl marks and scratches come from
improper washing and drying.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.140
If you're using a towel, you're actually creating
micro-scratches

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.470
on the surface from the friction of the towel.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.810
After Wash provides lubrication with a lubricating
agent that coats the surface

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.570
after it releases the water,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.880
and allows the towel to glide gently over
the surface.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170
That way you don't scratch your car when you
dry your car with After Wash.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.520
After Wash also does a third thing:

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.630
It uses optical gloss enhancers to enhance
the shine on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.939
any-colored vehicle.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.119
This works on white, black, red, it works
on all colors,

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.329
and we're gonna use it right now to dry off
this new

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:24.509
Porsche P-car.

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.450
This Porsche 911 is beautiful..

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.840
and After Wash will help us dry off the car,
and what's more fun

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.579
than drying off a Porsche?

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.759
I'm gonna use some microfiber towels.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.810
I'm gonna use a Cloud 9 microfiber drying
towel.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.029
This thing is huge as you can see.

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:40.159
It's the perfect size to dry any vehicle,

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.529
and I'll fold it up as we dry this side of
the car.

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:49.479
After I absorb all the water from the surface
using After Wash and a towel,

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.289
I'm gonna give it a once-over with an extra-soft
plush towel

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.249
to make sure I have a nice streak-free shine.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.469
The optical gloss enhancers need to be buffed
off using After Wash,

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.200
so it's best to use two drying towels to get
the best look.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.799
Let's use After Wash!

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.579
First thing you do: shake up the bottle.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.580
After you shake it up, turn on the sprayer,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.120
and spray it all over the car.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.420
Look how the water instantly starts dropping
off.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.689
You can see it all slipping off the bottom.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.170
That's because the optical gloss enhancers
and drying agents

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.769
use hydrophobic technology to release all
the water.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.879
I'll spray it over here, and look at all the
water fall right off.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.370
It's pretty cool!

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.260
Now that I have it sprayed on the entire door,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.829
I'm gonna take my first drying towel and gently
dry the surface.

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:40.829
I'm only going to drag in one direction to
make sure I dry fast and easy.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.540
This is giving maximum lubrication on the
surface

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.069
because when you use any towel,

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.810
whether that be a chamois, microfiber towel,
or any other drying towel,

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.930
You can actually cause micro-scratches on
the surface.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.290
If you use After Wash and a plush microfiber
towel,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.969
you're ensuring you have a scratch-free drying
experience.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.430
That way the car will not acquire any swirl
marks or scratches,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.549
because After Wash provides lubrication.

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.099
This works on glass as well, so if you spray
it on glass

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.510
you'll see it releases the water extremely
fast

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.170
and we can use our plush drying towel to dry
the glass too.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:25.859
My goal of using after wash is to get off
the majority of the water,

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.349
and then come back with a second microfiber
towel to

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.129
dry off the surface even better.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.150
You notice even wiping with one towel picks
up a lot of

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.530
water from the surface.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.930
Now I'll grab my second microfiber towel,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.590
and use this to buff off any streaks left
on the surface.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.189
This is the professional's trick:

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.939
use two microfiber towels,

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.760
and that way you get a smooth streak-free
shine!

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.140
There we go.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.019
Now look at that!

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.019
The metallic color of this Porsche is just
coming out,

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.480
and we have a nice smooth dry surface.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.819
Now this is the must-have way to dry any type
of vehicle.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.749
After Wash is the perfect way to release water
from the surface

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:14.650
using hydrophobic technology,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.120
and then enhance the gloss, while allowing
the towel to glide

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.450
gently over the surface to dry any vehicle.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.990
So it works on cars,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.190
trucks, RVs, and any other vehicle to get
the best results.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.200
