00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.580
So we're going to talk about sevillanas.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.359
This piece I was just playing right now is
a sevillanas.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.359
It's a style of flamenco.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.841
It's a very popular style, mainly because
of its dance.

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:27.359
The dance of sevillanas is a very big thing
in Spain, especially in the South of Spain.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.050
It's a very beautiful dance and it's accompanied
by guitar and singing and a lot of clapping.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.300
Sevillanas is a style of flamenco, so that
it's not played usually in the Phrygian mode.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.969
Meaning if I'm in the key of A Major or A
Minor, my next chord is not necessarily going

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.179
to be that B Flat sound.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:58.050
So sevillanas is a style that's in three meter
so it's in 3/4, and it features a two measure

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.050
cycle.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.620
There are many different sections to the song
or to the keys, but I'm going to show you

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.979
how to play the basic compas, and then you
can elaborate from there.

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.650
This is the intro to sevillanas and the basic
compas, so it's in three and the first measure

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.300
we're going to play in the tonic key.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.689
So I'm going to do sevillanas in A Major.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:32.570
First beat we're just going to do and indife
down, then I'm going to do two rasgueardos.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.310
For beat two and beat three.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.969
Here's our first measure.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.979
Notice this rasgueardo, the beat falls on
the index, leads to our pickup notes.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.649
These two are pickup notes using your annular
and middle finger.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.080
So we're going to go one, two, three.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.969
Okay, on beat three I'm going to bring my
index back in to give it a little more groove.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:08.590
So that's going to be our first measure, one,
two, three and.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.860
For measure two I'm going to move the five
chord, which is going to be in E Major or

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.860
in E 7.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.400
And I'm going to do the same thing I did with
on my right hand.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.470
Thumb down, rasgueardo on beat two, and rasgueardo
on beat three.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.170
But notice this is one of the characteristics
of sevillanas.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.720
On the beat three of the second measure I
go back to my tonic chord.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.890
So I don't wait for one to rasgueardo; I rasgueardo
on beat three.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.590
Sounds like this.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.000
Yeah, that's one of the main features of sevillanas.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.180
Now before the singer comes in or before the
dancers start dancing, because this is the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.200
part where everybody is preparing, there is
a section called a llamada, and that's when

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.000
we tell everybody when to get ready to start
singing or to start dancing.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.980
Because we can be jamming on this compas for
a while, but there comes a moment where everybody's

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.430
ready, so then you play this just a little
bit different, so everybody know when to come

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.430
in.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.950
And this is how you do it.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.620
You play beat one and beat two, and hold beat
two over beat three.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.510
So we don't play anything on beat three, so
three and then we switch the next measure,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:50.030
and we do the rasgueardo first on beat one,
rasgueardo, index down on beat two and we

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.520
resolve on beat three to the tonic and then
we play beat one and beat two, okay?

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.260
I'm going to do this again very slow.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.920
Three, one, two.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.040
After you play that beat two, then the singers
start, usually with a long phrase for about

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.570
two measures, and then you come back in.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.340
And the dance begins and everybody is having
a great time.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.340
Let's see how this sounds.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:37.970
I'm going to play two measures and then the
llamada.
