00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.930
Boston Logan International Airport officially
unveiled 3 new full body scanners on Friday

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.770
that it hopes will help TSA agents better
identify threats among air passengers. Made

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.160
notorious by privacy advocates for their somewhat
revealing body scans like the one seen here,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.749
the units use backscatter technology to project
low level X-ray beams over the body.

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:27.140
Imaging technology safely screens passengers
for metallic and non-metallic threats including

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.649
weapons, explosives and other objects concealed
under layers of clothing without physical

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.120
contact to help the TSA keep the traveling
public safe

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.699
While the advanced imaging technology or AIT
units will be used as a primary screening

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.490
method at Logan, passengers are not required
to use it and can request a pat-down and metal

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.600
detection instead.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.751
Once passengers step into the machine it takes
about 20 seconds to scan and review the image.

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:57.640
Kair said that privacy concerns were unfounded.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.280
The officer attending to the passenger will
not view the image. As an additional precaution

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.910
the officer viewing the image will be remotely
located and the image won't be stored, transmitted

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.680
or printed and will be deleted immediately
once viewed. In fact the machines have zero

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.890
storage capability. A privacy filter will
also be applied to the image.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.360
That means that faces of travelers will be
blurred out for image reviewers. He also said

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.280
that radiation exposure in the machine is
very low and equivalent to what a passenger

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.520
would experience in an aircraft for two minutes
at 30,000 feet.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.680
Logan Airport became one of the first eleven
airports in the country to receive (AIT) units

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.520
purchased with money from the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act which allots $1 billion

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.610
to the TSA for aviation security projects.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.160
This new backscatter x-ray technology machine
being installed in Boston Logan International

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.950
today is one of 450 going into use across
the country in 2010. All for the price of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.920
between $130,000 and $170,000 each. Reporting
