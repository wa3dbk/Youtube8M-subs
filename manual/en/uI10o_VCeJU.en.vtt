Hi, Doug here from Investing In Gold Advice
dot com.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.970
In this short video I’m going to give you
five reasons why gold investing makes so much

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.310
sense right now.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.160
Then at the end I’m going to reveal how
you can get started investing in gold straight

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.180
away.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.450
Reason number 1

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.080
Gold has increased in value for each of the
past 11 years and this bull run is showing

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.070
no signs of slowing down.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.140
Many insider experts are predicting that the
price of could will soar within the next few

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.060
years.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.119
Reason number 2

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.069
Governments and super wealthy individuals
all around the world are buying gold like

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.719
crazy at the moment.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.469
They wouldn’t be doing this without good
reason, and of course this demand is pushing

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.469
the price of gold up.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.920
Reason number 3

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.789
Gold has safe haven status and people run
to gold in times of economic turbulence and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.710
uncertainty, just like the times prevailing.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.359
This is because gold acts as a store of wealth
and holds its value, unlike paper currencies.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.309
You can preserve your wealth by gold investing.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.910
Reason number 4

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.330
Gold has what is known as ‘negative correlation’
with the value of the dollar, stocks and bonds.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.540
When these are performing badly, gold performs
well.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.050
So including gold in your investments is a
wise way to protect and hedge your portfolio.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.480
Reason number 5

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.780
Gold is a liquid asset unlike other forms
of investment such as real estate, for example.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.700
This is an advantage should you ever need
to cash in your investment in a hurry, and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.530
wherever you happen to be.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.740
Whether you're in the U.S, Europe, the Middle
East or Asia the price at which you can sell

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.560
your gold will always be the same.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.880
OK... so how can you start gold investing
straight away?
