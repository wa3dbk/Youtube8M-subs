00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.100
Some people suffer wounds
that just won't heal.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.200
To solve the problem,
doctors are going back

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.800
in time to find a solution
that helps heal everything

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from diabetic sores to
burns.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.900
But we want to warn you;
some of the images you
will see are pretty graphic.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:39.100
Josh Pennington has mowed
the lawn more times in his 
63 years than he can count.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
But the routine chore nearly
killed him when he hit

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.000
a stone that wounded his
leg.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
That wound just wouldn't
heal.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.000
I do a lot of hunting and
fishing outdoors where

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.000
I could possibly get it
infected or something,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.300
so that was always on my
mind.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.000
His wound was so deep it
exposed his bone and nothing

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.100
he tried for 3 years would
fix it.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.400
The doctors at Georgetown
University tried a new
bandage infused with honey.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.500
So long as it's clean,
and it's healthy, and it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
showing progress; I'm with
the program.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.200
Medihoney is a highly
absorbant seaweed-based

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.300
bandage soaked with a
special kind of honey

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.700
produced only in Australia
and New Zealand.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.400
The honey is concentrated
and provides an ideal

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.100
environment for wound
healing.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.600
It killed the bacteria
with some of the enzymes

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.300
that it's, that it has
within it.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.800
The acid in the bandage
also helps lower the pH

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.900
level in chronic wounds
for better healing.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.600
Unlike antibiotics, the
honey poses no toxic effects
or risks of resistance.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.500
We are starting to use
Medihoney as a first-line,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600
ah, drug as opposed to
waiting to see whether

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.000
other dressings work or
not because this, we've

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.100
had excellent success with
it.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.600
In just months, Joshs'
wound shrunk 95%.
Power to the bees.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.100
That's amazing stuff.
Doctors at Georgetown are

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.500
the first in the US to
use this Medihoney
treatment.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.100
But, using honey to heal
wounds really isn't a new
idea.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.900
Egyptians used it for wound
dressing and for embalming
4,000 years ago.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.700
Researchers believe the
bandage may also protect

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.700
wounds from infections
like MRSA.
