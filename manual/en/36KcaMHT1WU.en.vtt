00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:09.639
We asked the REI Matcher Phill Grove 'Which
Flipping Houses Books Do You Recommend?'

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:10.639
This was his response...

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.750
If you do a quick search for ‘Flipping Houses
Books’ on Amazon you will see that right

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.300
now there are 112 results that are returned.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.890
If you chose to read them all, you would never
do a deal yourself, you’d just be reading

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.730
from now until eternity.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.390
This is what I like to call ‘analysis paralysis’
so remember knowledge only becomes power when

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.110
you apply it.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.910
So reading books is great, and I recommend
it if you like to do it, but which flipping

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.900
houses books would I recommend?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.210
Before I give specific recommendations there
are a couple of things to look out for when

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.150
selecting flipping houses books to educate
yourself on the house flipping business.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.210
Newer is probably better – Although this
is not always the case, with real estate investing

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.940
things are constantly changing.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.830
Though some of the basic tenets will always
be the same, I’d propose that you select

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.100
a book that is 10 years or newer or at least
recently revised.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.570
Opt for reality vs. a fun read – An educational
read will provide a much better overview for

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.480
you than a cutesy book with a bunch of stories
and pictures.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.340
Okay, so that being said here are my Top 3
recommendations for Flipping Houses Books:
