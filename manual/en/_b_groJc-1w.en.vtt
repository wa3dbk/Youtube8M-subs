00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.930
The US city of Atlanta is situated in the
South-Eastern state of Georgia,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.680
near the Southern end of the Appalachian Mountains.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.119
Atlanta is the center of a sprawling metropolitan
area

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.290
of five and a half million people, and growing!

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.710
Atlanta's downtown is over there on the horizon,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.970
but the rest of the city is a little harder
to see.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.250
It's under all those trees!

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.750
Atlanta is blessed with such a thick, continuous
canopy of greenery,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.750
it's often referred to as, 'the city in a
forest!'

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.719
Journey through the city's past at the Atlanta
History Center;

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.929
from the city's beginnings as a railway terminal
in 1837,

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.850
and through the plantation era to the American
Civil War

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.489
when the city was almost completely burnt
to the ground.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.380
The museum holds one of the largest collections

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.920
of Civil War memorabilia in the country;

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310
but it's not all flags and cannons,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.200
many exhibits focus on the human cost of this
terrible conflict.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.000
Over time the city rebuilt, and boomed.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.579
First the freeways came,

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.750
and then the Civil Rights era

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.859
when Atlanta took the front seat in the drive
towards racial equality,

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:36.630
earning it the title, 'the city too busy to
hate'.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.420
In 1996 the city lit up again, this time for
the Centennial Olympic Games.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.259
Atlanta got all gussied-up and was presented
to the world,

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.259
and it just gets more graceful with every
passing season.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.140
Atlanta today is a dynamic centre of innovation
and investment.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.469
Two of its leading corporations are also major
tourist attractions.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.859
Go behind the scenes at CNN's global headquarters

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.899
by taking a guided tour through the television
network

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.190
which pioneered 24 hour news.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.230
Nearby, you can learn some ~ but not all ~ of
the secrets

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.540
behind another little home-grown product.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.250
At the World of Coca Cola,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.250
travel along a bottling-line and though the
125 year history

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.250
of a company that produces over a billion
gallons of cola every year.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.970
Right next door and containing 10 million
gallons of water,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.440
is the Georgia Aquarium ~ one of the world's
largest!

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.030
The aquarium features six exhibits,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.890
from cold-water displays featuring Beluga
Whales

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.670
to touch-tanks featuring rays, crabs and star
fish.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.760
But by far the biggest attraction is a massive
saltwater tank,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.140
the Ocean Voyager, where you can actually
swim with Whale Sharks.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.360
Atlanta is a city filled with architecture

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.650
synonymous with Southern style and grace,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.610
but for a taste of pure 1920s indulgence,
step into the Fabulous Fox!

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.380
Like a vision from Arabian Nights,

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.490
the Fox Theater features a ceiling embedded
with more stars

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.910
than a moonless night in Georgia.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.040
Atlanta has long been an arts-loving community.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.280
One of the world's greatest stories ~ Gone
With The Wind ~

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.980
was written and set here.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.400
Visit the humble apartment where novelist
Margaret Mitchell once lived

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.280
and worked before her Pulitzer Prize winning
novel set the world on fire.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.860
While Atlanta's favorite novelist dreamed
of bestsellers,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.570
one Atlanta son dared to voice the shared
dream

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.560
of millions of African Americans ~ equality!

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.090
The Martin Luther King Junior Historic Site

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.870
celebrates the journey of one of history's
most inspiring men.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.620
Visit the civil rights leader's humble birthplace,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.060
the museum dedicated to his achievements,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.800
and the Baptist Church where he once preached,
and now lays at eternal rest.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.549
Step a little further back in time

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.250
at the Fernburg Museum of Natural History

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.920
and the adjacent Science Center,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.400
which examines history and science from the
Big Bang

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.880
to more contemporary times.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.060
If you prefer your animals a little more active,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.850
head over to Zoo Atlanta where a fabulous
collection of Giant Pandas,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.690
Gorillas, Giraffes and Rhinos awaits.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.220
For a different kind of wildlife,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.760
spend an hour or two exploring the vintage
emporiums and bars

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.420
in Little Five Points, one of Atlanta's many
diverse neighborhoods.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.850
Atlanta wears its gracious parks like a Southern
Belle's ball-gown.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.090
Cool off in Centennial Olympic Park near the
city's downtown,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.540
or stretch out and rest awhile in midtown's
Piedmont Park.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.300
But for the best views of all, head East to
Stone Mountain Park.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.060
Take the scenic train around the 5-mile circumference

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.190
of the world's largest exposed granite monolith.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.130
Then mosey on up to the summit via the hiking
trail

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.460
or on the Summit Skyride cable car.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.460
There it is again, Atlanta, Georgia,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.800
sitting pretty under all those trees. Waiting,
to be discovered.
