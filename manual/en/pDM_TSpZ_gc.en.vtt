00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.940
Okay so the first thing you need to know when
you want to start playing the piano is just

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.450
the names of the notes. Okay? So I want to
give you an easy way to figure out what you're

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.959
looking at when you look down at a piano because
I know sometimes it can get kind of confusing

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.029
- there's this zebra of white and black notes.
So the first thing I want you to identify

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.961
is a group of black notes that there are two
of. So like these two, there are two here

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:29.749
- so you notice that the black notes group
into either groups of two or three. So two

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:35.120
three two three right? Three two. So what
I want you to do is find a group of two, and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.079
the first white note that's right to the left
of that group of two, right here - you see

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.100
how it's really really close right here - that's
the C and that's going to be true no matter

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.530
where you are on the piano. So here's a C,
C, C, C, all the way up and down the piano.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.480
Anytime you see a group of two black notes
the first note right to left is C. Now the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.660
reason I'm starting with C instead of like
A, which you might tihnk would be normal since

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.000
the alphabet starts at A, it's just because
when we start learning scales and other stuff,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.100
C is like the easiest scale and note to work
with so it makes sense as a logical starting

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.549
point. So anyway, all you really need to do
is find this C here and then, knowing that

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.360
the notes are labeled either A, well A through
G - only the white notes, A through G - if

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.390
this is C we can kind of figure out where
everything else is right? So if this is C,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.880
here's B and here's A. Right? So if we start
at A like where the alphabet starts and we

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:46.719
go up to G, we can find all the white notes.
So A B C D E F G and now we start back over

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.750
at A. So take a look at, for a second, we
started down here at this A and we got G and

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.500
we started back over at A, you'll see that
they look very similar relative to the groups

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.850
of black notes that they're in so if you look
at this group of three, the eight note is

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.850
the one that's sort of nested almost to the
right here. And that's also true up here,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.410
see? Group of three and this A note is here.
So I hope that makes sense to you. All the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.010
labels for the white notes are something either
A through G so A B C D E F G and then you

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.221
start over. If you think about the groups
of three black notes, the first note that

00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:27.190
is right to the left of that is F. So if you
want a quick way to quickly know just by looking

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.040
down at the piano what note you are playing,
you look and find a group of two - the first

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.540
note to the left is a C, and if you find a
group of three black notes the first note

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:44.020
to the left of that is F - the first white
note. Okay?So just as a quick review: C D

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:53.011
E F G A B and then C again. Alright? Now if
you want to play any of the black notes, all

00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:57.530
you have to do is name them relative to the
white notes. So take a look at this note right

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.670
here for example, since that is right in-between
an F and a G, we know we can call it something

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.220
that's either related to the F or the G. So
if you want to call it an F sharp, an F sharp

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.800
means it's a little bit higher - a little
bit more to the right - than an F. And so

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.790
this is the closest note that is to the right
of F, so we can call that an F sharp. Now

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.120
we can also call it a G flat or the note that's
a little bit further to the left from G. It's

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.060
not a straight-up G, it's like a little bit
less than a G, so that's what the flat means

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.080
- a little bit to the left, a little bit deeper.
So you could call this a G flat or an F sharp.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.970
So here's a little quiz I guess. What might
you be able to call this note? This is a D

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.210
and this is an E, so think about it for a
few seconds, what could we call this note?

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.620
Alright, I'm just gonna tell you, the answer
is: you could call it a D sharp or a little

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:02.140
bit to the right of D, or you could call it
an E flat - a little bit to the left of E.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.870
Okay? So that's pretty much how you can figure
out all the names of the notes here so we've

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:18.650
got C D E F G A B C and if we look at this
note we have C sharp or D flat. We have D

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:29.130
sharp or E flat. F sharp of G flat. G sharp
or A flat. And A sharp or B flat. And that's

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.810
it, those are the names of the notes. you
can do that in any octave, so C C C and all

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.210
the way up and all the way down, they'er labeled
in the exact same way. So hopefully now when

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.569
I'm referring to the notes, you know what
I'm talking about.
