00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.540
alright a little update to the crawfish

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.230
uh...

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.950
went ahead and got me this little stanley
room heater here and it's working pretty

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.849
good

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.499
its got adjustable fan settings 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.659
and adjustable temperature settings. and its keeping things alot

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.130
warmer

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.800
they had the uh...

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.890
the out side so i don't have any
problems

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.359
but i have any problems with freezing or
anything like that

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.519
great thing is when it reaches the
desired temprature level

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.580
which isn't numbered out by the way

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.780
which kinda irritates me a little bit but

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.510
well once again said that whatever dot
he set it at the heater just kinda

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.390
shuts down so

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.390
you don't have to worry about the place
turning into a sauna or 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.840
catching fire or anything like that

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.120
the other thing i like about it is like about it is

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.760
this things been on for the last three days straight  last three days
straight

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.230
and its  very cool of the touch

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.630
really it's uh...

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.960
back here it's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.680
wind here it's a lot cooler

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.670
on the bottom

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090
so this is a very safe

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.580
space heater

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.990
and uh... i did get the warranty on it
because

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.580
let's face it i'm abusing this thing

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.360
usually i don't spend the extra seven
bucks but the kids up and i know meant

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.720
to be using the shit out of the probably
get a fucked up

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.020
arm

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.070
there's no way they can tell that it

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.260
abused it

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.700
then

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.950
by usually go ahead and get the little
warranty on it

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.140
i got my turtle in here

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.560
that used to be his little aquarium

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.780
there would be called

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.100
with it getting cold i had to bring him inside anyway

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.659
lets check out the babies

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.639
well she was just in the egg stage where
um...

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.859
last time you saw her

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:23.859
the eggs are hatching and shes got

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.769
very small larvae

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.769
the rest these little guys

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:39.029
if i stir it up maybe i cant get these little guys to jump around a little bit

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.339
there eating right now so

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:45.029
they probably dont give a shit whatt i do 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.849
the rest of these guys are developing really well

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:58.179
in fact ill clean the lenses a little there maybe that will clear things up a bit.

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.199
uh...

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:12.759
standard shipping them with the mother's
of

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:18.619
just until i don't see them clinging

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.129
mothers in here until i don't see any
babies clung to have been more than a

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.559
then im going to reintroduce them back to the uh... population tank there
population take care

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:31.109
so these little guys are doing really well a
it's it turned out to be a really good

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.379
thing that ended up having to use this fish tank because i can monitor what

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.219
they're doing a lot easier than i can
add other nursery there've got set up

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.149
and i can also see that there eating the little pellets there

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.239
there seem to be clinging to that really well

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.499
they were before i stired them up

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:58.180
well happy about that

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.989
got a top fin  twenty gallon filter for
about five gallons of water

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.849
so thats

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.949
that filters enough to do one hell of a
job keeps water clean

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:13.469
and of course ive got this here

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.049
unfiltered uh...

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.560
this is where most of the babies

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.180
the flyer

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.720
or whatever the hell you call them

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.590
that all over the bottom there

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.879
everywhere all those little  specs
not that big brown mess in the middle

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.889
but all the specs there

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.770
kinda scattered sparsley throghout the bottom

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.720
ive been just using an airator pump and no filter and so far so good

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.199
too

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.870
uh... but they seem to be doing fine
with that

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.289
they shouldn't soil the water too quickly

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.639
i did put a filter in here. i probably 
will eventually as they get larger

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.280
and i'll probably introduce

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.180
those

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.090
over there to be
