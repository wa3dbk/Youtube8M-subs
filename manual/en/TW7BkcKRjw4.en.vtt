My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:11.150
use a George Foreman grill to make stuff besides
grilled cheese sandwiches and hot dogs. I'm

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.539
going to show you how to cook a nice piece
of skin on salmon. What I'm going to do is

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.039
I'm going to take this wonderful piece of
salmon, I'm going to brush it with some olive

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.170
oil. And I'm going to put the skin on the
bottom side of the grill. Reason why is the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.730
bottom side of these grills is the hotter
side. So what is going to happen is when we're

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.860
done, because you can't really chew through
salmon skin, you can cut through it just barely

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.960
with a knife. When we're done, what's going
to happen is we're going to salt and pepper

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.870
on this. When we're done, we're going to slide
it right off the skin, you'll see it's pretty

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:59.260
neat. SO let's just take our salmon. You'll
see the skin side right there. Skin side down,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.420
give it a nice little rinkish tilt. And this
is probably going to take, this is a pretty

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.100
decent sized piece of salmon, probably about
three mintues or so, for a nice medium, medium-rare.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.570
So we're going to close this down on there,
and come back and look at our wonderful piece

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.820
of salmon in about three minutes. Alright,
it's been about three minutes, and that piece

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.900
of salmon was a pretty small piece of salmon,
so we're going to go check on it. Look at

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.619
that. That is wonderful looking. Let's zoom
in a little bit. Notice the perfect grill

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.290
markings on top. The nice crisp brown glaze
there on the top. That's a beautiful looking

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.490
piece of fish. So what we can do, pan back
out, is at this point we'll see if I can get

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.900
the skin to come right off. It might just
stick to the grill. Nope, the nonstick on

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.939
this is a little too good, so what I can do,
if I choose to flip it over right now, grab

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.730
a hold of the corner, and you can see I can
peel it right off. I'm going to leave it on

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.130
there though because I'm going to serve it
with the skin on. Some people actually eat

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.500
it skin on. I'm one of those people. Alrighty.
