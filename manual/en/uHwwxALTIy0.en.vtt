00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.290
JR: Hi, I'm JR.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.379
Ken: And I'm Ken.

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.700
Today we're going to be talking about Alpine
V-Power amplifiers.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.450
These amps are a really good value for the
money.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.190
JR: Such a good value in fact they've become
our best selling line of amplifiers at Crutchfield.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.239
This MRP-F250, which is a 4-channel, 40-watt
x 4 amplifier, has become our best selling

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:20.239
amplifier.

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.300
Ken: Yeah, we get a lot of good reviews on
the V-Power series, and not just from people

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.369
who are buying an amp for the first time.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.689
We get people writing in who have had different
brands, stepped up to the V-Power series and

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:32.780
like what they hear.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.780
JR: Absolutely.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.180
Ken: We may be getting ahead of ourselves
just a little bit though, talking about how

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.469
great they are.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.829
Some people might want to know why they should
have an amp in their car in the first place.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.469
JR: You know, your car's stereo has an amp
but it's a little tiny IC.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.579
Ken: Integrated circuit?

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.579
JR: Exactly.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.039
Which, you know, it powers your speakers but
not like the circuitry in an amplifier with

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.800
much larger power supplies, better capacitors,
heat sinks to dissipate heat.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.679
It simply offers more control and detail.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.629
Ken: Control's an important point.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.559
You know a lot of people, I've talked to people,
who say "I don't need an amp, I'll blow out

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.559
my speakers."

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:06.559
JR: Right.

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:10.500
Ken: And actually there's more chance they're
gonna blow out the speakers if they've got

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.390
their speakers under powered and they're trying
to crank the volume up too far.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.950
If you've got an amp that's got power and
control you're gonna work the speaker properly

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.950
and get great sound.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.630
JR: Yeah, and with clean power you can hear
that detail not only at loud volumes, but

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.119
even at quiet passages you'll hear more of
your music.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.719
Ken: Yeah I like to listen to classical and
it's important to get the detail in the quiet

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.729
passages plus the loud stuff that I like too.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:35.729
JR: Absolutely.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.219
Ken: Yeah these V-Power amps have a lot of,
uh, features built into them too don't they?

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.939
JR: For example the variable high-pass and
low-pass crossover allows you to really dial

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.210
in with a knob exactly where you want to cross
the amplifier over.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.270
Ken: Yeah, in other words the high frequencies
go to the small speakers, the lows go to the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.799
low, big speakers.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.079
JR: Exactly.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.000
Ken: You know another feature these have that
I like is speaker level inputs.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
JR: Absolutely.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.049
Ken: If you have a factory stereo and want
to add an amp you've gotta have that.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:09.300
And all you do in this case is connect your
speaker leads from your car up to this plug,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.050
hook it into there, and your factory system
is gonna sound better than you ever dreamed

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.050
it would.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.050
JR: Looks pretty easy.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.770
You know, there's an Alpine V-Power amplifier
for just about any need.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.100
There's a 4-channel amplifier and a mono subwoofer
amplifier.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.410
Ken: Yeah, and different wattages too, for
different needs, depending on how much boost

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.410
you want.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.060
