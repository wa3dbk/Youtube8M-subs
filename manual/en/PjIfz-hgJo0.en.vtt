00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:09.960
-[homeowner] This is my desert tortoise habitat. This
is a desert tortoise, not native to this area.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.580
The California-Mexico desert area is
where they are from.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.660
They are on the endangered species list.
This turtle will live probably fifty-sixty years.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:30.940
Yeah. These turtles--the larger
ones, are probably six or seven years old.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.740
-[Curtis Smith] And they like to eat plants.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.180
-[homeowner] They do. And thus I have created a habitat for them.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.280
Ninety percent of
their diet should come from natural grasses.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.360
From--they like dandelions,
they'll eat the Mullein, I've planted

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.200
alfalfa which is a little bit high in
protein for them, but a little bit won't hurt them.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.059
And then I have--they're just
now coming up--I planted natural grasses

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.060
in this back area. So they'll have plenty
to eat without having to subsidize.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.640
I do subsidize their diet sometimes. I
will bring some lettuce, but I also add

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.480
the essential vitamins that they need
also, when I feed on other food.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.560
Who are you holding here?

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.020
Oh this is a
box turtle, very common in this area. This is a hatchling.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.120
This is what people would
have in their backyard to eat snails and slugs?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.880
Yes, very native to this area.
This is a western box turtle, and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.280
he's just about a year. He just hatched
last spring. And they are very hard to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.060
find at this size, they like to stay hidden. And so when you find one this tiny, it's kind of fun.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.940
So how did you get
into growing turtles?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.660
[laughs] As a small child, instead of a horse, I always wanted one of the giant tortoises

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.640
from the Galapagos Islands. So that's--it's
been like a lifelong thing, i've had turtles all of my life.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.000
So these are the
offspring from your originals?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.800
Yes, I had desert tortoises that were given to me.
Full-grown, probably thirty-forty year old

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.510
tortoises, that were large. Probably
some of the largest in captivity.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.500
And these are offspring. Those turtles since
then have passed on.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.400
But these are offspring which is very unusual to have
and have a clutch hatch here.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.920
Because this is not their natural
habitat, and the soil conditions have to be just right.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.580
It's just a nature thing. And this is not their habitat, so it's unusual.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.300
And around the corner here, you've got an example of how to build that habitat for them.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.100
Yes, it's really quite simple.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:46.140
These are PVC pipes. And I've just sliced them in half, buried them, and then made a burrow on top of it.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.880
And they love to
climb on, and they'll burrow down in this

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.080
and have a little clutch of
eggs and just the whole natural process.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.220
I never use any type of
pesticide back here. It's totally organic

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.620
back here because we don't want to harm
them in any way.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.180
Is there anything you should not feed the turtles?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.540
Well the best thing to let them eat is things that they would have in nature.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.760
They are natural, and that's why we created the habitat.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.720
But such things as apple seeds
are very poisonous, broccoli will cause a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.360
chemical reaction--there there's several
things--Irish rhizomes are not good for them.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.140
So, really when you when you plant a habitat

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.340
like this, the best thing is to plant the
things that they would find in nature.
