00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.000
The President:
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Welcome to the White House.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.500
On behalf of Sasha
and Malia and myself,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.533
we're thrilled to see you.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.400
I want to thank
Walter Pelletier,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.667
chairman of the National
Turkey Federation,

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.100
and Joel Brandenberger,
its president,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.533
for donating this year's turkey.

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:26.333
His name is "Courage," and he
traveled here from Goldsboro,

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:30.066
North Carolina, where he was
raised under Walter's

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.233
own precious care.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:32.734
(Turkey gobbles.)

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.266
The President:
There you go.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:41.633
(Laughter.) Now, the National
Turkey Federation has been

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:43.934
bringing its finest turkeys to
the White House for more

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:45.867
than 50 years.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:49.300
I'm told Presidents Eisenhower
and Johnson actually

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.767
ate their turkeys.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:55.533
You can't fault them for that;
that's a good-looking bird.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:01:01.333
(Laughter.) President Kennedy
was even given a turkey with a

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:06.600
sign around its neck that said,
"Good Eatin', Mr. President."

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.000
But he showed mercy and he
said, "Let's keep him going."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.066
And 20 years ago
this Thanksgiving,

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:17.567
the first President Bush issued
the first official presidential

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:23.300
pardon for a turkey. Today, I am
pleased to announce that thanks

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.800
to the interventions of Malia
and Sasha -- because I was

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.467
planning to eat this sucker --

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:29.934
(laughter)

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:34.700
-- "Courage" will also be spared
this terrible

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.300
and delicious fate.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.033
Later today, he'll
head to Disneyland,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.233
where he'll be grand marshal
of tomorrow's parade.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:45.300
And just in case "Courage" can't
fulfill his responsibilities,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.834
Walter brought along
another turkey,

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:52.700
"Carolina," as an alternate,
the stand-in. Now,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.200
later this afternoon,
Michelle, Malia,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.934
Sasha and I will take two of
their less fortunate brethren to

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:02.467
Martha's Table, an organization
that does extraordinary work to

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.533
help folks here in D.C.
who need it the most.

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:08.633
And I want to thank Jaindl's
Turkey Farm in Orefield,

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:12.567
Pennsylvania, for donating
those dressed birds for dinner.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:16.467
So today, all told, I believe
it's fair to say that we have

00:02:16.467 --> 00:02:18.734
saved or created four turkeys.

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:30.934
(Laughter.)You know, there are
certain days that remind me of

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:33.600
why I ran for this office.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.767
And then there are
moments like this --

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:36.000
(laughter)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.367
-- where I pardon a turkey
and send it to Disneyland.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:44.166
(Laughter.) But
every single day,

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:48.100
I am thankful for the
extraordinary responsibility

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.266
that the American people
have placed in me.

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:55.000
I am humbled by the privilege
that it is to serve them,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.900
and the tremendous honor it is
to serve as Commander-in-Chief

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.367
of the finest military in the
world -- and I want to wish a

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:04.667
Happy Thanksgiving to every
service member at home

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.233
or in harm's way.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:08.700
We're proud of you and we
are thinking of you and we're

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.066
praying for you. When my family
and I sit around the table

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:16.133
tomorrow, just like millions of
other families across America,

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:19.500
we'll take time to give our
thanks for many blessings.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.667
But we'll also remember this is
a time when so many members of

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:27.166
our American family are hurting.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:30.066
There's no question this has
been a tough year for America.

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:31.633
We're at war.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:34.567
Our economy is emerging from
an extraordinary

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:36.433
recession into recovery.

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:39.700
But there's a long way to go
and a lot of work to do. In more

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.867
tranquil times, it's easy to
notice our many blessings.

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:46.133
It's even easier to
take them for granted.

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:50.533
But in times like these, they
resonate a bit more powerfully.

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:54.667
When President Lincoln set aside
the National Day of Thanksgiving

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.533
for the first time -- to
celebrate America's "fruitful

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:01.700
fields," "healthful skies," and
the "strength and vigor" of the

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.033
American people -- it was in
the midst of the Civil War,

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:10.767
just when the future of our
very union was most in doubt.

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:12.166
So think about that.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:15.000
When times were darkest,
President Lincoln understood

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.166
that our American blessings
shined brighter than ever.

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:22.900
This is an era of new perils
and new hardships.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.133
But we are, as ever, a
people of endless compassion,

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:30.700
boundless ingenuity,
limitless strength.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.333
We're the heirs to a hard-earned
history and stewards of a land

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:38.500
of God-given beauty.
We are Americans.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500
And for all this, we give
our humble thanks -- to our

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.200
predecessors, to one another,
and to God. So on this

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.033
quintessentially
American holiday,

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:53.500
as we give thanks
for what we've got,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.266
let's also give back to
those who are less fortunate.

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:57.867
As we give thanks
for our loved ones,

00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:00.900
let us remember those
who can't be with us.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.567
And as we give thanks
for our security,

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:06.734
let's in turn thank those who've
sacrificed to make it possible,

00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:10.367
wherever they may be. Now, before this turkey gets too

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:16.166
nervous that Bo will escape and
screw up this pardon --

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.734
(laughter)

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:22.934
-- or before I change my mind, I
hereby pardon "Courage" so that

00:05:22.934 --> 00:05:27.667
he can live out the rest of his
days in peace and tranquility in

00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:31.400
Disneyland. And to every
American, I want to wish you,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.166
on behalf of myself,
Malia, Sasha, and Michelle,

00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:36.567
the happiest of Thanksgivings.

00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:37.633
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:43.367
(Applause.)

00:05:43.367 --> 00:07:45.934
(off mic conversation)
