00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.509
Interviewer: Still ahead, dare we say winter
weather is just around the corner.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.929
Well, we all know the weather is harsh on
our skin.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.180
Up ahead, some help to keep your skin looking
its best through the winter months.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.060
[guitar music]

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.810
Living in Pittsburgh, we already know the
winter weather hits us long before the calendar

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.980
says it should, and that harsh weather can
be brutal on your skin.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.180
But, not as brutal if you follow some simple
techniques to keep your skin looking its best.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.079
Here this morning with some winter protection
tips is Bridget Kelly with the Skin Center.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.079
Good morning.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.079
Bridget Kelly: Good morning.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.079
Interviewer: All right.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.289
So, let's talk about what we can do.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.320
Is it the cold weather; is it that heat that's
coming out?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.879
What's going on that makes it so rough?

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.879
Bridget Kelly: Right.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.301
Well, the way I like to explain it to my patients
when they come in, usually during the winter

00:00:55.301 --> 00:01:00.030
month's they're saying they're dry, they're
irritated, they can't maintain the products

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.229
that they have all year round.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.229
Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.650
Bridget Kelly: And basically, the skin is
made up of multiple layers, and the outer

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.229
most layer consists of dead skin cells and
your natural oil production.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.290
So basically, this outermost layer acts as
a Saran Wrap, if you will.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.290
Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.509
Bridget Kelly: To keep the moisture in and
to keep the elements out.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.509
Interviewer: Okay.

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.310
Bridget Kelly: So the main stay of your winter
treatment with the drier air outside and the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.479
dry forced heat inside, is to maintain the
hydration of the skin.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.479
And that's the biggest thing.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.479
Interviewer: Okay.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.010
So, the number one is moisturizing, and that
helps the hydration as well?

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.250
Bridget Kelly: Exactly.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.940
And the big thing I think in the winter time
is our bathing routine.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.940
Interviewer: Okay.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.539
Bridget Kelly: I mean it's always tempting
to take a nice, long, hot shower when it's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.539
cold outside.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.539
Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.200
Bridget Kelly: But that will actually decrease
the amount of natural oil on your skin.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.829
So, some of the things that you can do are
just shower once a day.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:58.829
Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.090
Bridget Kelly: Keep it to 10 minutes using
warm water rather than hot water.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.090
Interviewer: Okay.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.780
Bridget Kelly: And right after you get out
of the shower, rather than toweling dry, just

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.780
kind of pat dry.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.780
Interviewer: Okay.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.820
Bridget Kelly: And within the first three
minutes after showering, put on a heavier

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.080
moisturizer, and that helps to keep the water
inside the body.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.410
Interviewer: While your skin's still wet,
okay.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.600
Bridget Kelly: While your skin's still a little
bit damp, absolutely.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Interviewer: Okay, great.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.880
And then, I love your tips for hydrating.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880
You say use a humidifier.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.880
I never thought of that unless you're sick,
but you can use it all the time.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.880
Bridget Kelly: Absolutely.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.930
You can have a humidifier in your room, even
in your office at work where again, you have

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.400
that dry heat, and that helps with the skin
as well as your sinuses and everything else.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
Interviewer: Wonderful.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.890
And then drinking water and less caffeine
that can make a difference on your skin?

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.890
Bridget Kelly: Absolutely.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.110
I think that's something that we take for
granted in the summertime.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.830
I mean, of course you're drinking a lot of
water, but in the wintertime it's also very

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.890
important, especially when we're tempted to
drink those warmer caffeinated beverages.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.890
Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.980
Bridget Kelly: Something like an herbal tea
rather than coffee is going to be a lot better

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.200
for you, and it's good for your skin at the
same time.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.180
Interviewer: And people might forget sunscreen
in the winter, but there is some sun in Pittsburgh.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.290
Bridget Kelly: Absolutely.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.880
We don't see it very often but it's there.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.930
Sunscreen, yes.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.740
Very important, because not only are you getting
it outside but you're getting it even from

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.920
the fluorescent lighting and everything inside.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.400
And in the wintertime, it's actually interesting.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.900
You get 15% glare from sand and 80% from snow.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.900
Interviewer: Wow.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.840
Bridget Kelly: So, if you're out in the snow,
it's actually very important that you reapply

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.070
that sunscreen often, because you're actually
getting quite a bit of sun glare.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.430
Interviewer: Now, you do a lot of neat treatments
that really can help speed up the process.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.430
Is that right?

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.430
Tell me what kind of things you do offer.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.900
Bridget Kelly: One of the big things in the
wintertime is exfoliating the skin, because

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.380
you will get that buildup of dead skin or
dry skin, and your moisturizers aren't going

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.450
to penetrate as well.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.210
So, doing things like light chemical peels.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.210
Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.000
Bridget Kelly: Or even things like a DermaSweep
or microdermabrasion type of treatment to

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.310
remove that outer layer of dry skin so that
your products can penetrate deeper, is good

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.150
to do once every couple months or so.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.150
Interviewer: Okay.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.150
Bridget Kelly: Just for deeper exfoliation.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.690
Interviewer: And then, what's the laser treatment
do?

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.700
Bridget Kelly: The laser treatment's our key
in the winter time, just more for damage done

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.010
throughout the spring and summer months.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.310
So, it's a time where you don't have to worry
so much about sun exposure, so you can do

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.500
things like your resurfacing lasers, such
as Fraxel resurfacing, which help with fine

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.810
lines, wrinkles and sun damage, as well as
intense pulse light, broadband light, other

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.310
things that help with those age spots and
sun spots that you can get during the summer

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.310
time.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.310
Interviewer: Great.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.310
Bridget Kelly: Yeah.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.310
Interviewer: Well, thank you Bridgette for
all the good advice.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.310
Bridget Kelly: Absolutely, absolutely.
