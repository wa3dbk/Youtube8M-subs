[chopping]

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.400
Hi everybody! Today I'm going to make

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.650
Korean side dish, it's called "kkwarigochujjim."

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.860
Can you pronounce it? "Kkwarigochu" is Shishito.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.960
Green chili peppers. Mild taste, not very spicy.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.260
Lot of wrinkles,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.440
but also really thin skin and easily you can break.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.490
This is 300 grams. First, remove this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.620
stem part.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.890
Now we remved all the stems and I'm going to wash

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.070
them very -- because a lot of wrinkles so we have to wash very carefully.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.270
Slightly like rub with both hands...

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.480
like this remove all the dirty stuff.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.660
Strain them.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.040
Then I'm going to give a nice shower again.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.420
Then we have to steam.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.610
So one cup of water in the pot and...

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.710
steamer pot and I'm just boiling now over hight heat.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.900
Flour.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.080
... two...

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.290
... three...

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.500
and mix this well.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.700
Now this water is really boiling,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.930
we are going to steam this.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.170
Close the lid. Meanwhile I'm going to make really

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.290
delicious sauce. When this is heated,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.480
a little sesame oil or just vegetable oil and...

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.690
garlic...

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.880
[chopping]

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.090
Chopped garlic add here.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.280
Smells so good!

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.520
[chopping]

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.730
And then we need dried anchovies!

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.930
To make it really tasty, I always use dried anchovies.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.140
One to three four five, and six. So I will show you.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.360
Head get rid of this. So inside guts we removed.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.580
Like this. Really nice.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.820
Smells so good! Golden brown. And then I'm going to add around...

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.000
quarter cup water.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.220
And soy sauce, three tablespoons soy sauce.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.550
I'm going to start this cooking because if it's overcooked...

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.730
it will be mushy. We steamed really nicely. Five minutes steaming.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.930
Don't overcook. We are expecting some delicious taste from anchovy.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.070
So just lower the heat simmer.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.300
Around one minute.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.520
Let's put some sweet stuff, one teaspoon...

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.670
honey I added. And Almost done!

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.870
Hot pepper flakes three teaspoons.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.060
Let's put this all this here into...

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.240
this delicious sauce

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.890
Sometimes you see, after, you know, steaming, 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.100
there is still raw flour things. And at this time it's going...

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.140
to be cooked.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.250
Really good. Great! And then...

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.340
sesame oil! One teaspoon. Chopped green onion.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.550
Turn off the heat. That's it!

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.380
Sesame seeds. Roasted sesame seeds on top.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.450
When you serve, and serve with rice.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.660
We made kkwarigochujjim. So this is a really good side dish

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.850
and also a very good side dish for lunch box.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.070
"Doshirak." So I made this Korean doshirak. Rice.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.180
Rice made with green peas.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.330
Sunny side egg. And then this kkwarigochujjim.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.430

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.520
Dried anchovies you can add it, also you can eat it

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.700
This is Korean doshirak we made.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.930
And then...

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.140
