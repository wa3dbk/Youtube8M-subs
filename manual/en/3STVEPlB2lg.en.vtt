Here at Towson University we've really been
very fortunate in that the university

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.410
has made a large investment in nursing
simulation education

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.110
and with these resources we've been able
to increase simulation in our clinical

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.699
courses

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.430
to a greater extent each year. So what is
really great about the simulation now is

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.350
that

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.460
we can allow the students to do the
skills and interact with the mannequins

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.969
like they're real patients

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.809
so that learning becomes more of just
words in a book

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.470
or words that I might say as a faculty
member in a class

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.680
the words now, the learning becomes
live, it's a lived experience

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.680
that these students are now having.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.609
Lecture is definitely one thing, you read it from the book, you study it from the powerpoint

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:59.579
you take the test, but

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.269
simulation kind of ties all of what you learn
in lecture together

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.840
and you just have to do it in a certain
amount of time and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.240
it kind of helps you think on your feet and
first time I was really nervous going into it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.899
but as I

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.289
went on with the simulation I became more comfortable with it. Confidence,

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.600
it's the tool you need

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.620
in nursing. Confidence is something that you
must have so you can not walk in

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.250
and not have the needed tool.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.270
Simulation gives you that. Because it's not just textbook, you know.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.300
This simulation lab actually exposes you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.400
to the real world.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.910
I want all the students to get to witness different types of patients

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.940
so you all will get to see a heart patient,
someone with chest pain, or

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.280
someone with problems with their diabetes.
With sim,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.430
we now have been able to really
standardize the type of patients that the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.800
students are going to see

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.170
prior to going into their work setting. You
have to believe in yourself

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.520
and in each scenario you have to be ready for it. If you don't believe in yourself,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.190
you won't be the best nurse that you can be.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.340
Simulation allows you to practice your
skills and become more confident that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.670
you can do

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.680
what your professors have taught you, and
that you can

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.680
take these hands and be able to
help the person that you can.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.980
