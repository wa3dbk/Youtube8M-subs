Hello, welcome to Game on. I'm Simon... -And
I am Laurie.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.820
And this week we are going to be playing Insomniac's
brand new Xbox One exclusive, Sunset Overdrive.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.400
But in the interest of journalistic integrity
-And ethics and stuff. -Ethics. Not curtailing

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.090
to the man. We completely bypass PRs and all
that *EXPLETIVE*.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.190
To bring you this review. Let's do it. - Let's
play it.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:47.700
Okay, so next week I have the distinct honor,
pleasure... -Privilege. - Privilege to be going

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.710
to BlizzCon for a Metallica gig so looking
forward to that.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.260
There's other things at Blizz. There's other
things. You have to, as a reporter you should

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.169
mention the other things.

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:06.369
Okay, so the other things are... the support
act for Metallica?

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.819
Yeah, and why is everyone else there?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.080
Everyone else is there... Metallica.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.460
Obviously BlizzCon - I know BlizzCon. -You're
not philistine. -But I have genuinely never

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.920
played a Blizzard game.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.640
Right, okay. -So, odd choice to send me I'll
be honest.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.920
Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.580
So, you know a little bit. So, we're going
to play a little bit of World of Warcraft

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.060
and then we're going to be play some Hearthstone.
-We're going to play Hearthstone.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.610
Is is heart? -Hearth. -Oh, it is Hearth. -Hearthstone,
yeah.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.390
I thought you had a little... -Lisp.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.179
Crack on. -Crack on.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.699
Look at that mouse. That's how hard we're
trying.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.840
We are. We're adults.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.920
Okay. -Oh, would she try different clothes?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.240
I wanna be a wolf. -Right. Okay, so you're a wolf. We're a wolf.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:23.420
I'm gonna name her... -Hilda. -Dequief. I'm
a Worgen though. I should have called it Worgen Freman.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.400
Should have called it Worgen Freeman.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.500
And Worgen Freeman.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.620
Should have called it Worgen Freeman.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.500
This is very confusing.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.820
This literally chucks you in and is like "have
things. Have all of the menu."

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.100
Right. Okay, I understand that, that's fine.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.940
There we go. So you've got to hold right click
to strife.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.220
Right, cool.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.580
Why? Why is that?

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.220
That seems needless to me.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.000
What? Woah, Sexy clan girl.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.680
What is happening? -What does any of this
mean?

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.820
Oh, hold on.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.820
Boom! Have that you big wolf.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.720
I need to get my battle banter down a bit
better.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.680
Yeah!

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.820
No use hiding here, love.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.200
It's just a bag isn't it?

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.151
Goodbye.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.900
The thing is he won't get killed by the Worgens,
he's ginger though, he'll get killed by the

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.470
sun at some point.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.500
Oh look a fetch quest.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.840
This is a very MMOE thing to do. To pointless
make you gather items.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.760
Oh, look there's one over there. -Get it. Quick before anything exciting happens.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.300
None of things are attacking me though. Like
there's no jeopardy.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.120
So is this like the online poker of World
of Warcraft? -Yeah, exactly.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.760
Free cards! -Yeah, free cards!

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.020
That's you.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.240
How can I get I get them both... Oh, he's got to wait a turn hasn't he? -Yep.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.020
So the key is do you want to take 5 damage
from this thing by not killing it now?

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.289
Well, he'll kill either one of those.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.811
But you can kill it as well. You can stop
it attacking you by killing it now.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.880
How do I kill it now?

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.580
Well, with this because it's only got 2 health.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.820
You'll lose this. -Oh I thought they were
the wrong way round.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.300
You're going down.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.420
You do 6 damage and then if you swing with that you
win. -Boom!

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.500
I quite like that.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.200
It's really fun.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.300
That's quite fun. -It is really fun.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.840
It's especially fun with this car mouse. It's
the kind of game I can't see myself getting

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.220
massively into it but if I had that on an
iPad. -Which you can. -I'd play it everywhere.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:26.720
I'd probably play it on train journeys, car
journeys - not when I'm driving. That would

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.680
be dangerous. Or plane journeys. Again not
when I'm driving.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.360
Done that's Blizzard sorted. -Yep. You've
played the first two minutes of two of their

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.460
games. I think you're ready.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.820
I was dissatisfied with World of Warcraft
but I feel like I need to experience more

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.390
of it and maybe I would enjoy it. Try some
of the other wizards.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.280
Hearthstone is... -A very strong card game
and that's why it's been popular for a long

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.080
time. -It's a strong card game.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.680
Next time you see me I'll be at a Metallica
concert.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.940
I'll be here.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.320
He's not coming.
