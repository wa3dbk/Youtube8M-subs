00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.240
How to Feed Your Family Healthy Meals on a
Tight Budget.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.820
Sure, junk food offers lots of calories for
not much money.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.719
But you can create your own "happy" meals
that are tasty, nutritious, and inexpensive.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.970
You will need Oatmeal Evaporated or powdered
milk Frozen and canned vegetables Seasonal

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.480
fruits Bananas Apples Air popper and corn
kernels Nuts Inexpensive cuts of meat Peanut

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.579
butter Eggs Chunk light tuna Beans Brown rice
Baking skills and a crock-pot.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.579
Step 1.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.750
Start the day with a hot cereal; they’re
much cheaper than cold cereals.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.660
Oatmeal is a nutritional winner and very inexpensive
if you buy a container of plain, old-fashioned

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.660
oatmeal.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.660
Step 2.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.980
Stretch your milk dollars by diluting a can
of evaporated milk or some powdered milk with

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.879
water to create whole milk.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.039
Step 3.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.710
Stock up on frozen vegetables when they go
on sale.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.780
Unless your produce was just picked, it’s
just as healthy — or even more so — to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.690
eat the frozen stuff, which locks in the nutrients.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.210
Canned vegetables are another cheap alternative
to fresh, but rinse them before eating because

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.100
many are loaded with salt.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.159
Step 4.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.869
Limit your fruit purchases to whatever is
in season, the exception being bananas and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.869
apples.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.050
The former are relatively inexpensive year-round,
and the latter are low in calories, high in

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.010
fiber, and may reduce your risk of heart disease
and cancer.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.520
Step 5.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.399
Enjoy healthy snacks without spending a fortune
by air popping corn kernels and buying nutritious

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.500
nuts like almonds, walnuts, pecans, and peanuts.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.600
Buy in bulk.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.770
Step 6.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.799
Only eat meat two or three times a week, and
make cheap meats as tender and tasty as pricier

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.659
cuts by marinating them overnight or slow-cooking
them in a Crock-Pot.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:50.810
Step 7.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.649
Make the most of alternative sources of protein,
like peanut butter, eggs, chunk light tuna

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.469
(which is not only the cheapest kind of tuna,
but also contains the least mercury), and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.469
beans.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.380
Buy bagged beans in bulk -- the kind you soak
overnight.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.170
They’re cheaper and healthier than canned
beans, which are high in sodium.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.170
Step 8.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.170
Eat brown rice.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.090
It’s a bit pricier than white, but much
better for you and still a nutritional bargain.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.150
Step 9.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.440
Indulge in desserts by making them from scratch
using nutritious ingredients that you have

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.459
on hand.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.690
Bake your own oatmeal and peanut butter cookies;
mash and freeze overripe bananas for "ice

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.900
cream"; bake bruised apples with a little
honey.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.430
Did you know As of 2007, 8.5% of the American
household budget went to food eaten at home,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.219
down from 19% in 1960.
