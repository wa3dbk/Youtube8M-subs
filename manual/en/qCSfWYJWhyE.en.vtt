00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.690
I am always searching for tools that will
perform multiple jobs, tools that will do

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.460
jobs better or faster, things that can eliminate
or combine equipment.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.810
When I found the Kelly Kettle I thought found
something that just might fit the bill.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.289
While I guess Kelly Kettle might categorize
themselves in the cooking category of survival

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.289
gear this versatile piece of gear bleeds over
into many other areas, namely water storage

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.410
and purification, fire starting and gear storage.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.460
The Kelly Kettle is first and foremost a tool
to boil water but it does so in a unique way.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.190
It is designed to use any available fuel,
from pine needles, pine cones, twigs, leaves,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.780
to sticks.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.411
This means you never have to carry fuel with
you again and maybe more importantly, you

00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:53.809
never have to run out of fuel again.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.370
Pretty much anything that can burn will work.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.329
Fill the kettle with water Light a fire in
the fire base and the tapered chimney quickly

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.829
and efficiently transfers the heat energy
to the water.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.659
Since the kettle has no moving parts like
valves there is nothing to fail.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.740
As long as you don’t fire it without water
it should last a very long time.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.590
Since I can fire this thing indefinitely it
also means an indefinite supply of boiled

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.850
drinking water.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.240
The Kelly Kettle comes in three sizes, all
of which come in Aluminum and Stainless Steel.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.060
The Trekker, the Scout, and the Base camp.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.640
I chose the stainless steel Scout because
it filled a need in my survival system.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.810
I have traditionally used a propane stove
and I find myself having to do multiple firings

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.119
to cook for my family.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.070
I am a big fan of freeze dried meals and for
those not familiar with freeze dried meals

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.439
that means boiling water to cook them.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.830
The Scout can boil 37 ounces of water at once.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.960
This allows me to boil all of the water I
need at once.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.759
The Scout is 10.2 inches tall when packed,
7.3 inches in diameter and weighs 2.2lbs.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.600
A rudimentary calculation shows that it takes
up about 7 liters of space in your pack.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.320
That might sound like quite a bit for one
piece of gear, but keep in mind, out of that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.500
7 liters of space you are carrying 1 liter
of water, your cook stove and cook set, plus

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.670
your utensils and whatever else you can fit
in the inside of the kettle.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.169
For the minimalist consider the Trail version,
it only weighs 1.3lbs and take up 4 and a

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.230
half liters of space.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.389
Once you subtract the propane or fuel bottles
you would normally carry and account for the

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:33.689
water and gear stowage it is probably near
a wash, but Kelly will run indefinitely.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.029
For the first firing of the kettle I used
a bit of pine needles, a few dry leaves, and

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.029
some sticks.

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.909
I had filled the kettle to the brim as well.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.749
I lit the pine needles, put the kettle on
the firebase and dropped the sticks through

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:46.920
the top.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.100
I probably over fueled the stove a bit as
there was some thicker smoke coming out, but

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.799
nonetheless it boiled the kettle in just about
4 minutes.

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.290
I was really surprised as to just how little
fuel was needed to boil the water.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.639
Just a couple of sticks boiled over a liter
of water.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.069
4 minutes is about as fast as it would take
my high performance LP stove to boil the same

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.849
amount of water.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.029
It also has a leg up on your typical propane
stove in winter cooking.

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:19.760
I don’t know if any of you have ever tried
an LP stove when it was very cold outside

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.959
but in some cases the stove won’t work at
all and at the very least the stove will work

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.900
at level of severely reduced performance.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.809
Since you are relying on the BTU’s stored
in the wood itself and not pressurized gas

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:33.879
this is not a problem at all for the Kelly
Kettle.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.291
In addition to boiling water, you can also
use the kettle to cook directly, whether it

00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:44.819
be hot dogs on a family camping trip or even
small game.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.040
Because the Kelly Kettle is not an open fire
it can assist you in starting a larger fire

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.729
in a rain storm or overly wet conditions.

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:55.590
Just get some hot coals started in the kettle
and transfer them to a larger fire.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.590
Lastly, for air travelers, you don’t have
to even contemplate sourcing fuel at your

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.590
destination.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.590
Just bring the kettle along and burn whatever
you find at your destination.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.700
My biggest beef with the Kelly Kettle is not
really their fault but our wonderful litigious

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.209
societies.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.069
The kettle really should have a screw on type
lid instead of a stopper.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.299
Unfortunately, folks who should be Darwin
award recipients have forced the use of a

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.299
stopper.

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.349
It would be very unsafe to fire this kettle
with a cap that could hold pressure.

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.209
Since we have people in society who can’t
or won’t read directions and would blow

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.630
themselves up we are stuck with the stopper.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.659
While the stopper does a good enough job at
keeping the water in it can be a pain to remove.

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.360
My other suggestion would be for the cook
set to be stamped for the measurement of ounces

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360
and milliliters.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.300
As I mentioned, I chose the Scout because
my primary use is cooking for a rather large

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.479
family.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.900
My first choice for food on the run and camping
is Mountain House and they generally require

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.860
around 16 ounces per container.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.470
It isn’t a huge deal, I just measured out
16 ounces and marked it myself.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.909
All in all the Kelly Kettle has replaced LP
in my family bag.

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.960
It performs just as well as propane stoves
I am used to and I don’t have to carry or

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960
run out of fuel.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.550
It is a piece of gear that serves more than
just one purpose, and that is what I aim for

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.460
when considering survival gear.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.870
I also look forward to an upcoming ultra-light
version that might have a shot in my personal

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.669
bug out bag.
