00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.570
BETH HOYT: It's David
Cross, you guys.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.380
DAVID CROSS: Hello.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.680
BETH HOYT: David, thank you
so much for being here.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.460
DAVID CROSS: Sure.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.210
I like this place.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.640
It's adorable.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.410
BETH HOYT: Yeah, so cute.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.290
Now, everyone knows you from Mr.
Show with Bob &amp; Dave and

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.740
Arrested Development and The
Increasingly Poor Decisions of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.120
Todd Margaret.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.455
But I'm not here to talk about
questions and your stuff.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:18.340
We're here to just really--

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.770
DAVID CROSS: Why did
you put quotation

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.370
marks around questions?

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.860
Because it would be questions.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.680
BETH HOYT: I know, but it would
feel like that to me.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.870
That's just an ism of mine.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.680
DAVID CROSS: OK.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.150
It's almost like this part
of your hand is dancing.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.230
BETH HOYT: It's a
twitch I have.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.400
DAVID CROSS: Sorry then.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.800
I didn't mean to--

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.440
BETH HOYT: This isn't
about me.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.460
This isn't about me.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.370
I want to get to
what's in here.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.645
I just really want to
cut to the chase.

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:45.310
DAVID CROSS: All right.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.990
BETH HOYT: Yeah, so how much
cash you got in there?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.650
DAVID CROSS: No cash.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.710
I'd be a fool to
keep cash here.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.020
Some notes.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.030
Take my girlfriend
to Artisanal.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.550
BETH HOYT: Good note.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.370
Have you done it yet?

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.940
Is there--

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.125
DAVID CROSS: My car is parked
on John just passed J right

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:01.690
near Princeps Bianco.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.960
BETH HOYT: It's a red
Pontiac Sunfire?

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.349
DAVID CROSS: No.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.590
Also, the shirt I saw in North
Carolina the other day about

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.170
SkipSations, which is
a skip-roping thing.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.915
I assume it's gay.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:12.590
I don't know.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.060
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.410
Which you're fully
in support of.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.930
You heard him.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050
DAVID CROSS: Oh, the sign that
the guy in Georgia put up, my

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.500
home state, that said--

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.120
he owns a bar, and he put a sign
up that says, I do not

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.040
support that [BLEEP]

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.240
in the White House.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.360
That's my hometown,
my home folks.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.645
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:27.910
Holler to the hometown.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.035
So--

00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:30.320
DAVID CROSS: Wait,
there's more.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.540
BETH HOYT: Right.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.960
Oh, sure.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.050
I didn't mean to
interrupt you.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.880
DAVID CROSS: Raleigh, clear
the-- all right, that's it.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.530
BETH HOYT: Great.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.090
So underneath that pocket,
I believe there's

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.400
a heart back there.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.550
I want to get right into that,
and here's the deal.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.190
The way to just cut to the chase
of who you are inside is

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.370
to find a survey by
teenage girls.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.325
So we found this.

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:50.270
This is from my friend, Emily
the Brave's Tumblr.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.700
Everyone's passing it around and
reblogging their answers.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.065
DAVID CROSS: Is she really
your friend?

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:54.410
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.920
DAVID CROSS: She's
a good friend?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.680
BETH HOYT: She's
a good friend.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.730
DAVID CROSS: OK.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.940
BETH HOYT: I thought we should
just get in there and then

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.780
reblog this and reblog
your answers.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.540
I want to just warn you
that some of these

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.290
questions are intense.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.280
DAVID CROSS: How old is Emily?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.850
It doesn't matter.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.970
She's a teen.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.870
BETH HOYT: She's between
16 and 36.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.330
DAVID CROSS: OK.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.155
BETH HOYT: So the first
question-- we

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:18.010
just randomly chose.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.740
There's a list of
50 questions.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.600
Here we go.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.660
Have you ever been told
you were amazing?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.090
DAVID CROSS: Yes,
I have, yeah.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.230
BETH HOYT: That's so
great for you.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.890
DAVID CROSS: It was
a long time ago.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.025
I wasn't that cognizant.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:33.190
It was during my bris.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.060
And I believe I was
eight days old.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.630
But the mohel said that to me,
whispered it in my ear.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.670
BETH HOYT: And you have the
faint memory of it?

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.530
Or someone has told you this,
so this story's been passed

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.210
down to you?

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.060
DAVID CROSS: I'll be
honest with you.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.180
I do have a faint memory.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.270
And I don't know whether I've
conjured that or this thing

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.240
has been told to me
so many times.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.650
But I will say this also.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.330
I ride my bike through
Williamsburg sometimes.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.090
And other mohels at this age
have told me the same thing.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.530
BETH HOYT: Those
same two words.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.980
Yeah.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.240
So you protected yourself early
on with giving yourself

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.990
that vote of confidence with
projecting that memory, and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.200
now it's reaffirmed by
all of your fans.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.000
DAVID CROSS: Yeah, well, I can't
say that they're fans.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.050
Most of those guys don't
know my work and

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.070
speak broken English.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.500
But I assume--

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.380
BETH HOYT: They're fans.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.970
They are.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.290
DAVID CROSS: All right.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.440
Or fans in a different way--

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.130
BETH HOYT: Sure.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.950
DAVID CROSS: --of different
qualities that I have.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.300
BETH HOYT: Very positive
outlook.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.790
This is good.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.430
We're getting there.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.780
We might get dark in a second.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.800
DAVID CROSS: And you guys at
home should look up the word

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.260
"mohel," because then you'll
really have a good laugh.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.365
BETH HOYT: Yeah.

00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:48.140
You can do it right now, there
on the internet, or go to your

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.300
dictionary book.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.660
Next question, what's something
that bothers you

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.910
about girls?

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.170
DAVID CROSS: I guess they sound
dumber because their

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.340
voice is higher pitched.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.820
BETH HOYT: Yeah, I know
what you mean by that.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.950
DAVID CROSS: And so when a guy
says something stupid as

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.709
opposed to a girl, they could
both equally be inane comments

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.600
about mundane nothings, but the
girl will sound a little

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.300
dumber, especially if it's in
that sing-songy question up

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.520
lilt, up tilt thing.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.650
BETH HOYT: The tilt
up at the end?

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.030
What's that?

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.020
Yeah, that-- uh, you
know, that--

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.470
DAVID CROSS: The vocal umlaut.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.390
BETH HOYT: Mm.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.840
But also the same can be said
for the guys, and like

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.040
[DEEP VOICE]

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.935
you wouldn't like the stereotype
that if they say

00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:45.110
something like this, like
that that's always dumb.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.170
DAVID CROSS: It's always dumb.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.310
No, I'm saying they're
both dumb.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.680
It just sounds a
little dumber.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.326
It's unfortunate.

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:51.720
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.300
Talking like this and it sounds
more [SING-SONGY VOICE]

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.490
annoying?

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.460
That's more annoying and
[LOW-PITCHED VOICE]

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.310
that's kind of annoying.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.040
BETH HOYT: You kind of like
that guy a little more.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.830
DAVID CROSS: But that's
not as annoying.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.000
Yeah, you could hang with
that guy a little longer

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.210
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.260
than you can hang
with this one.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.510
BETH HOYT: And you could
probably tell the guy to shut

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.600
up, and he'd be,
like, whatever.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.370
And the girl would be like,
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.410
well, why?

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.920
DAVID CROSS: Yes.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.700
And you could give a warning
hit to the guy.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.050
And you can't do
that to a girl.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.835
BETH HOYT: Yeah, and if
you hit the girl--

00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:19.150
DAVID CROSS: No, no.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.940
--it's1 a whole thing.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.090
DAVID CROSS: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.040
BETH HOYT: Next question is,
where is the biggest

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.750
scar on your body?

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.050
DAVID CROSS: I'm going to guess
it's the liver just out

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.250
of the abuse of the
last 48 years.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.514
BETH HOYT: Sure.

00:05:33.514 --> 00:05:34.650
Yeah, an internal scar.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.450
DAVID CROSS: Yeah.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:42.360
The external, on the bottom of
my foot, I have some stitches

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.920
where I was in Hawaii, and there
was a red flag thing.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.210
And it's a long story.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.012
BETH HOYT: Not a figurative?

00:05:51.012 --> 00:05:52.430
DAVID CROSS: No, a
literal red flag.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.780
Like, you can't go.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.350
And I went out anyway.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.610
And it was one of very few times
I thought I might die.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.880
And I had time to think about
the possibility of dying.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.660
But anyway, I had gone way off
course, and I had to time my

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.900
way back onto shore.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.020
But it was all lava rock.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.000
There was no beach
or anything.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.140
And so I just went for it,
and I went flying.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.390
And I cut up the bottom of my
feet and my hands and stuff.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.975
And so that's probably the
biggest scar, is on the bottom

00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:30.572
of my left foot.

00:06:30.572 --> 00:06:31.055
Right foot.

00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:31.540
Left foot.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.020
BETH HOYT: Ouch.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.980
Good story.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.985
Intense, intense.

00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:35.015
DAVID CROSS: That's
the biggest scar.

00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:35.810
BETH HOYT: Near death.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.750
It's helpful when your
biggest scar story is

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.920
a near-death story.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.720
DAVID CROSS: It was
pretty crazy.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.925
It was nuts.

00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:44.050
BETH HOYT: Good Well done.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.350
Next question, who do
you think is the

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.330
most attractive actor?

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.580
DAVID CROSS: John Lithgow.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.140
BETH HOYT: Very affirmative.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.290
I mean, You knew exactly.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.330
DAVID CROSS: Oh, John
Lithgow, yeah.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.580
BETH HOYT: 100%.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.140
DAVID CROSS: Absolutely.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.730
BETH HOYT: I'm not going
to argue with that.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.400
Obviously, you have
your answer.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.820
DAVID CROSS: I would totes
make out with him.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.250
BETH HOYT: OK, I don't mean to
say this, but John Travolta

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.670
would've maybe been my answer.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.850
I don't mean to be topical, but
I did write him a letter,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.240
as I was saying,
in high school.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.810
Usually my go-to answer.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.160
DAVID CROSS: I don't think
you said high school.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.660
You said when I was
a kid back--

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.880
you just--

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.720
that's a little bit
more embarrassing.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.900
BETH HOYT: That's all the time
we have for that part of the

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.346
thing today.

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:26.080
DAVID CROSS: You said
when I was a kid.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.260
BETH HOYT: That's all
the time we have.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.040
DAVID CROSS: When I was a kid.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.784
You were in high school.

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:30.440
Come on.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.490
BETH HOYT: We're going to--

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.160
DAVID CROSS: For the record, I
wrote John Lithgow several

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.350
letters when I was
in high school.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.640
BETH HOYT: Thank you for putting
that out there, and

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.400
that's all the time we have.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.620
We have the Tumblr questions,
but don't worry, you guys.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.690
We're going to be retumbling
the answers

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.670
and paying that forward.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.680
And now, you've worked with a
lot of attractive actors as

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.050
well as probably
some ugly ones.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.750
And a bunch of them are in this
series which maybe some

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.720
people have never seen.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.360
It's called Pilot Season.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.760
It's one of my favorite
series on the My

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.680
Damn Channel archives.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.950
And we've got a clip from
your performance in it.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.030
We're going to check it
out when we get back.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.716
DAVID CROSS: How many series
on the archives are there?

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:08.540
BETH HOYT: There's like 30.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:08.750
DAVID CROSS: Really?

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.880
BETH HOYT: Yeah, check it out.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.970
When we come back, it's
time for internet Q&amp;A.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.070
