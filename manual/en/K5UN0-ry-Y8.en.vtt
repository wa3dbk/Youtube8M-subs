00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.449
So the first thing we need to do is
set-up our Hero

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.210
by doing that

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.929
we need to press the "MODE" a couple of times, until you see this icon. Select the top

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:28.970
select the bottom

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.470
select the top, and over here you will see the megapixels.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.350
again this is going to be your personal preference, so I will select 12MP

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.560
and we will go ahead and continue pressing the "MODE"

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.760
when you see this icon you press the top

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.590
and over here it tells you how many seconds

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.010
so I personally going to select the thirty
seconds

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.300
so again every thirty seconds there will
be a picture taken

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.750
so what we need to do is exit that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.480
press the top

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.730
and now we are going to

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.210
go to this icon right here

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.780
and now is ready to take a picture every thirty
second once you press the top

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.780
and as you can see there is the timer right there.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.180
so now what we need to do is create a folder, you can either do it on your desktop

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.610
in these case since I have an external
hard drive I'm going to go ahead and create that

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.140
on the hard drive itself so we are going to put

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.280
"GoPro"

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.980
close that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.600
we are going to connect

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.990
our Hero to the laptop

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.640
and this should open automatically

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.640
and over here you can actually select the folder

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.970
this is the hard drive

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.619
and here is the folder that we just create

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.799
so just

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.599
import all

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.969
and is going to take a couple minutes

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.869
depending on your

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.249
laptop or computer

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:26.599
now we are going to open Final Cut Pro X

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.719
do you guys want to hear something funny?

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.389
a bird just poo on me

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.349
while I was trying to record the tutorial, so I hope it was worth it

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:46.349
please make sure you guys give me "Thumbs Up"

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.189
we area going to select "File"

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:56.189
and create "new event"

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.809
we are going to put "time-lapse"

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:06.389
import media

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.359
and since it's on our hard drive

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.109
we are going to select this folder right here

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:22.109
Select "Import"

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:39.169
and as you can see all your media should be transferring right now

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:46.169
create "New Project"

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.419
and now

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.509
press "Command A"

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.019
this is

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.699
to select all of them

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.999
"Right" click

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:11.329
and we are going to created a "New Compound Clip"

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.659
I will not mess to much with this...

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.659
so just select 'OK"

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.610
ans as you can see it created an actual "video format"

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.520
in a way

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.460
grab and drop this

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.460
click on it, and press "Command R"

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:49.889
and we are going to fast forward to..lets do 20X

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.750
click here to make it "faster"

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.219
and right now it's rendering

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.680
and as you can see it looks really smooth

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.459
and at this point you can actually add titles if you want

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:14.080
or play with the "video effects"

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.289
since there is plenty to give it a "dramatic look"

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.250
just to give you an idea let go ahead

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.169
and select the first one

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:34.169
just drop it on top

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.139
alright, I hope I was able to help you guys out

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.300
