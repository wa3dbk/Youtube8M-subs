00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.270
“Here’s some of the stories trending This
Week at NASA!”

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.550
NASA and its international partners are making
changes to the International Space Station’s

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.940
schedule of arriving and departing spacecraft,
following the Russian Federal Space Agency's

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.470
preliminary findings on its recent loss of
the Progress 59 cargo craft.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.349
Exact dates will be announced in the coming
weeks, with a Roscosmos update about the Progress

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.229
59 investigation expected May 22.

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:32.079
The schedule adjustments mean NASA's Terry
Virts and Expedition 43 crewmates, Samantha

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.170
Cristoforetti of ESA and Russian cosmonaut
Anton Shkaplerov – now will return to Earth

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.710
in June instead of May – with NASA astronaut
Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonauts Mikhail

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.500
Kornienko and Gennady Padalka -- remaining
on the station to begin Expedition 44.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.800
NASA’s Kjell Lindgren, who is conducting
pre-flight training in Russia with the other

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.010
members of Expedition 44, now will launch
to the station in July.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.210
A draft Request for Proposal issued by NASA’s
Launch Services Program is seeking new commercial

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.460
Venture Class Launch Services (VCLS) to send
small satellites and experiments to space

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.280
using a smaller than currently available class
of rockets.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.030
Launch opportunities for small satellites
-- often called CubeSats or nanosatellites

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.909
are mostly limited to ride-sharing arrangements
on NASA and other launches.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.110
NASA anticipates a growing need for dedicated
launch capability for these smaller payloads,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.920
which could be used on future missions for
such things as improved weather prediction,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.719
broader Internet coverage and Earth observation.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.939
This closest-yet view of Ceres, captured by
NASA's Dawn spacecraft on May 3 and 4 is helping

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.649
scientists better resolve the mysterious bright
spots on the dwarf planet.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.820
The sequence of images, taken from a distance
of 8,400 miles, reveal that the brightest

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.270
spots within a crater in the northern hemisphere
are composed of many smaller spots.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.960
The exact nature of the spots remains unknown,
but scientists estimate the spots are caused

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.270
by the reflection of sunlight by highly reflective
material on the surface, possibly ice.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.300
NASA laboratory experiments suggests the dark
material coating some geological features

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.470
of Jupiter's moon Europa is likely sea salt
from a subsurface ocean, discolored by exposure

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.050
to radiation.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.110
The presence of sea salts on Europa's surface
would imply the ocean interacts with its rocky

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.420
seafloor -- an important consideration for
establishing whether the icy moon could support

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.720
life.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.610
A new NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory led study
finds the last remaining section of Antarctica's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.670
Larsen B Ice Shelf, which partially collapsed
in 2002, is quickly weakening and likely to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.720
disintegrate completely before the end of
the decade.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.890
Scientists found the shelf’s remnant, which
is about 625 square miles and at least 10,000

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.490
years old, is flowing faster, becoming increasingly
fragmented and developing large cracks.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.190
Ice shelves are the gatekeepers for glaciers
flowing from Antarctica toward the ocean.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.340
Without them, glacial ice enters the ocean
faster and accelerates the pace of global

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.260
sea level rise.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.060
A major hurricane has not made landfall in
the United States in a record nine years.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.040
That’s a rarity a new NASA study says likely
only happens once every 177 years.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.100
The study didn’t delve into the possible
meteorological causes of this hurricane drought,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.650
but researchers did say it could be just happenstance.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.630
And that’s what’s up this week @NASA …

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.190
