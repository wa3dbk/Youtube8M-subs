00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.220
The final World Marathon Majors race of the
year is right around the corner, bringing

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.150
a close to the 2009-2010 season and marking
the mid-point for the 2010-2011 season.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.179
The New York City Marathon is a very flat
course with the largest hills coming from

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.960
the bridges as you cross through the different
buroughs.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.730
Antonio Vega and Blake Russell have both dropped
out due to injury, but there's still a great

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.560
field that will be toeing the line by the
Verrazzano Narrows Bridge.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.710
Meb Keflezighi rarely gets any love from the
media but is the reigning champion and is

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.940
coming into the race in good shape. Injuries
kept him from racing over the Summer but he

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.750
posted a 61:45 San Jose Rock'N'Roll Half Marathon
a few weeks ago and is feeling about as fit

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.739
as he was last year.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.800
He won't have an easy win, though, as he'll
be facing off against some very talented competition.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.640
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia is the current
marathon world record holder, having run Berlin

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.220
in under 2 hours and 4 minutes. Kenya is well
represented by Robert Cheruiyot (The Elder)

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.990
is a 4 time Boston Marathon champion, and
Martin Lel who has won London 3 times and

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.590
New York City twice. James Kwambai is the
3rd fastest marathoner of all time and Abel

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.619
Kirui has run right around 2:05 before.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.720
Other former New York City champions that
have are running this year include Henrik

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.369
Ramaala of South Africa and Marilson Gomes
dos Santos of Brazil.

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.729
On the American front, look for strong performances
from Dathan Ritzenhein and Tim Nelson.

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.160
Since it is an off year with no Olympic Marathon
and no World Championships, both Kara Goucher

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.090
and Paula Radcliffe are taking a bye as they
start training again after having recently

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.350
had children.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.270
Shalane Flanagan is hoping to give us a good
show, however, as she moves up from a strong

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.490
10,000 meter and cross country career to run
her debut marathon.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.969
Former New York City champion Ludmila Petrova
of Russia and last year's winner Derartu Tulu

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.369
should give Shalane a good pack to work off
of early in the race, along with the reigning

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.580
World Half-Marathon champion Mary Keitany
of Kenya and Mara Yamauchi of Great Britain.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.610
Also keep an eye on Christelle Daunay, who
was 3rd last year in New York City and holds

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.160
the national marathon record in France.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.490
None of these women have a chance of catching
Lillya Shobukhova in the World Marathon Majors

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.330
this year, and the only way that Samuel Wanjiru
could lose would be if Tsegaye Kebede finished

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.940
in the top 2. Tsegaye did briefly consider
running but decided that he wouldn't be able

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.830
to recover in time and is going to concentrate
on next year instead.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.660
If you are going to be one of the roughly
40,000 runners in New York City this year,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.300
good luck to you and remember to have fun!
Once you get through the Bronx and find yourself

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.470
in the last few miles through Central Park
the crowd will give you plenty of energy to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:10.720
get to the finish line.
