00:00:00.631 --> 00:00:02.855
- Hi, I'm Kevin Nealon
and this is Laugh Lessons

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:05.624
where we try to teach
kids the art of comedy.

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:08.033
Now today my guest is a friend,

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:10.182
you know him from Saturday Night Live

00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:14.247
where he was Garth on Wayne's World, he--

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.872
- [Dana] Church Lady.
- Church Lady.

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:16.623
- Hanz and Franz.

00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:18.071
- He was part of Hanz and Franz.

00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:19.840
- HBO.
- [Kevin] He has HBO specials.

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:20.614
- [Dana] Master of Disguise.

00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:21.825
- Master of Disguise.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:23.107
Just a plethora of movies.

00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:24.546
- Dana Carvey.
- Dana Carvey.

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:25.729
- [Dana] Hi everybody.

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:26.306
How you doing?

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:27.420
That was good with the credits.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.040
- Yeah, thank you for
doing this, my friend.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.204
I cannot believe how
properly pumped up you are.

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:32.870
- Let me tell you
something, let me tell you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.766
the losers who get on
this and try to get their

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.549
abs all strong, guess what?

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:38.317
The abs will never get strong.

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:39.556
- Hear me now and believe me later,

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:40.481
if they take the belt off

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.064
they cause a flabulanche.

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:43.229
- Little baby abs

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.881
that should be put in a baby crib.

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:48.196
- [Kevin] Dana, you have two kids.

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:50.505
- Two kids that I know of. (laughing)

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:52.099
Yeah, they're both funny kids.

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:53.647
- Because they saw you doing stand up

00:00:53.647 --> 00:00:54.665
and they wanted to do it.

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:55.933
- You know, that's interesting, yeah.

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.479
I used to sit with my youngest son

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.785
and watch Saturday Night
Live and pause the sketches

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:01.866
and he would go, "Hey, how did that work

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.774
"and why is it working?"

00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:04.079
- Can you teach kids to be funny

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.732
or do they have to be born funny?

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.300
- Steve Allen famously said,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.806
"If you're not funny by the age of ten,

00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:09.765
"you'll never be funny."

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:10.957
- Oh wow.

00:01:10.957 --> 00:01:13.144
- My sister used to pay me her allowance

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:14.220
to make her laugh.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.458
And I would take a tennis racket

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:16.713
and just pretend I was Elvis.

00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:17.462
It was terrible.

00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:19.123
- I think that's what kids
can relate to the most,

00:01:19.123 --> 00:01:21.292
is just silliness and funny.

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:22.808
- Let me tell you something out there,

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:25.317
if you doubt us, whoever you are,

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:26.410
I could come to your house

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.304
and stretch the flab of your back

00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:30.287
into the shape of a rope ladder,

00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:33.006
which you could crawl
back down into a sewer

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:37.917
because that's where losers live.

00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:41.678
(upbeat jazzy music)

00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:43.066
Let's work on some accents.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.820
Sometimes a funny accent
makes people funny.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.840
Like if I say to you right now,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.072
"Hey Ellen, what's going on?

00:01:48.072 --> 00:01:49.002
"You know what I'm saying.

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:50.171
"You're really cool with everything

00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:51.226
"you're doing over there,

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:52.165
"you know what I'm doing?"

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:53.348
- Hello, governor.

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:55.927
- Jeeze louise, you are fast.

00:01:55.927 --> 00:01:56.952
Where'd you hear that?

00:01:56.952 --> 00:01:59.213
- I've practiced that
for a long time really.

00:01:59.213 --> 00:02:00.113
- Good for you.

00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:01.287
That's very good.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.247
You could say, "Top of the day, madam."

00:02:03.247 --> 00:02:05.136
- Hello governor.

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:07.000
- That's good. (laughing)

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.918
Just start with that and stay with that.

00:02:09.888 --> 00:02:11.520
So you guys wanna try some voices?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.897
Let's see if you could just
do kind of an older guy,

00:02:13.897 --> 00:02:16.073
like," Hey you kids get outta here."

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:17.825
- Hey kids, get out of here.

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:19.608
- [Dana] OK, a little demon character.

00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:21.282
I enjoyed it.

00:02:21.944 --> 00:02:23.830
Like I used to do one called Church Lady

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.016
and she talked sort of like this.

00:02:26.016 --> 00:02:28.409
"We like ourselves, don't we?"

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.562
This is kind of a funny voice, isn't it?

00:02:30.562 --> 00:02:31.562
- Yeah. (laughing)

00:02:31.562 --> 00:02:32.867
- [Dana] Let's do a little scene.

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:36.181
I'll substitute Al Pacino
with Scarface for Zorro.

00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.997
Oh, you don't know what
I talking about, man.

00:02:38.997 --> 00:02:40.266
You're a sea captain.

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:44.532
You, you're like a cowboy,
like a tough guy, right.

00:02:45.008 --> 00:02:45.856
Good boy.

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:47.797
You just crack your knuckles?

00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:49.451
(laughing) Real good,

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:51.643
but you don't know John Wayne, do you?

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:53.751
Well he used to talk like this,

00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:55.405
"Ya ha ha.

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:57.698
"Let's go over the ridge, ya ha."

00:02:57.698 --> 00:02:59.316
So kinda make your eyes kinda squinty

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:01.963
and go, "Yeah, let's go, ya ha."

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:03.475
- Let it go.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.035
- Good, a little similar
to the other voice,

00:03:05.035 --> 00:03:06.201
but I still see the difference.

00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:07.269
It's like a demonic cowboy.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.119
I like it.

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.579
Say hello to my little friend.

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.503
- OK.

00:03:12.503 --> 00:03:14.166
- OK, and scene.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:15.405
Excellent, gentlemen.

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:16.142
Really--

00:03:16.142 --> 00:03:17.544
- That was kinda tight.

00:03:17.544 --> 00:03:18.543
- That was kinda tight.

00:03:18.543 --> 00:03:20.024
So tight meaning good?

00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:21.290
- [boy in black shirt] Yeah.
- Ah, that's cool.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.782
I'm glad you enjoyed that.

00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:24.109
Give me a topic for a song

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.149
and I'll improvise it and
see if I can make it funny.

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:27.425
Yes, Ellen.
- Trouble.

00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:28.356
- I'll put trouble in it.

00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:31.023
Just give me a word, an
item, food item, a thing.

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:31.868
- Hot dogs.

00:03:31.868 --> 00:03:33.076
- [Dana] Trouble and hot dogs.

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:34.981
Let's see if we can come up with a song.

00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:39.520
♫ (lyrics) Trouble with the hot dogs ♫

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.526
- [kids] (laughing)

00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:46.081
♫ (lyrics) Got trouble with the hot dogs

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:49.102
♫ The hot dogs are overcooked

00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:50.948
♫ We boiled them too long

00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:53.448
♫ Now they're chewy

00:03:53.448 --> 00:03:57.168
♫ I Like my hot dogs soft in the bun ♫

00:03:57.168 --> 00:03:58.240
- [kids] (laughing)

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.694
♫ (lyrics) In the bun,
in the bun, in the bun ♫

00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:04.184
(laughing)

00:04:04.184 --> 00:04:07.606
(gentle guitar strumming)

00:04:07.606 --> 00:04:08.945
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Kevin] Yeah, baby.

00:04:08.945 --> 00:04:10.138
- That was fun. 
- [Kevin] You had me going.

00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:11.395
- Sweet kids, sweet kids.

00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:12.716
- I thought you gave us some good lessons.

00:04:12.716 --> 00:04:13.577
Those kids will never forget what

00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:14.630
they learned today, I'm sure.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.044
- It was a new experience.

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:17.266
I've never done anything like this.

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.280
I enjoyed it.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.355
The kids were sweet.

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:20.817
It was fun to make them laugh.

00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:22.139
- I'll see you next time, my friend.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.597
- Laugh Lessons in 38 territories.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.696
It's called syndication.

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:28.708
- Thank about that.

00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:30.483
- [Dana] (laughing)
