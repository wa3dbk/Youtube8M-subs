00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:32.079
I’m well aware that football is played everywhere,
from dirt patches, to abandoned lots, to often

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.240
being played just in the streets.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.680
But I never really saw the game as being very
“street.”

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.910
Freestyle Street Soccer attempts to take the
beautiful game and add a little more edge

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.289
than you would normally associate with it.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.379
The game takes place where all major arguments
are handled, in the streets.

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.390
From playground blacktops to empty parking
lots.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.969
Wherever the game can be played, it is.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:08.790
Goals are sometimes made from the environment,
like open garage doors and holes in the wall.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.930
The gameplay is fast and with a lot of style.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.600
You don’t want to just beat your opponent,
but to also embarrass them with mad tricks

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.570
and really fancy footwork.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:30.960
The controls for the game are simple and effective,
allowing you to look like Maradona with ease.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.380
The gameplay is easy to pick up and play.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.049
The pitch is completely enclosed, allowing
for some cool tricks off the wall.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.480
It all boils down to a simple mix of passing
and shooting.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.039
Doing little chips and one-twos to help move
past the defenders and give open shots.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.990
But the game also wants style, and when enough
style is earned, an area opens up that leads

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.030
to an unstoppable shot that also leaves your
opponent in awe.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.780
It is 4on4 football, with one player being
the keeper.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.680
You select from the multiple different teams,
all of them coming with a high level of, what

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.500
the kids these days call, edge and swag.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.400
Instead of real teams you are graced with
Skater Boys, Taggin Crew, Hardcore Honeys,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.640
and Low Riders.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.980
Each team has their own home court and play
style, displayed with their stats.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.400
The teams are judged by their speed, skill,
power and shooting.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.040
This allows you to choose either playing with
finesse, power, or speed.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.680
There are several different game modes to
play in.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.150
Home Turf has you traveling to different teams,
playing against them and winning to earn their

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.150
turf.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.659
It’s pretty dramatic.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.099
But there is also Challenge mode, Versus,
and Freestyle, where you can show off your

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.050
finely tuned skills that kill.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.709
Depending on how much style points you rack
up during a game also determines how many

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.099
upgrade points you earn that can increase
your team’s abilities, and give more incentive

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.690
to play well.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.650
The gameplay is simple but opens up as you
dig deeper.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.400
Moves are not overly complicated, and there
are plenty of game modes.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.860
The overall tone of the game is laughable
most of the time, but this is some pretty

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:25.349
entertaining street football.
