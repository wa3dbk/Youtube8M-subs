00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.340
Mold is a major health risk that

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.790
shouldn't be taken lightly. Beware;

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.300 position:58%
mold and mildew will develop quickly.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.250
In just 24-48 hours of water

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.520
exposure surfaces and materials can

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.960
become contaminated with mold.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.930 position:58%
In addition to heavily flooded areas,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.100
mold may pop up in some obvious

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.940
household places including damp

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.340
basements and moist areas resulting

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.770 position:59%
from plumbing problems or other leaks.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.910 position:58%
The bad news is mold will CONTINUE to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.540
feed on moisture and grow until the

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.480
proper steps are taken to eliminate

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.120
the source of moisture and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.020
effectively deal with the problem.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.850
The good news is that with a little

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.610 position:56%
elbow grease you can eradicate mold.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.290 position:59%
Here's a list of materials you'll need

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.990
to kill mold and mildew. The items

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.250
needed are inexpensive and readily

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.130
available at most grocery and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.830
hardware stores.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.130 position:59%
After putting on your mask and gloves,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.600
wash hard non-porous materials with

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.270 position:56%
non-ammonia detergent and hot water.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.570 position:63%
Use a stiff brush on rough surfaces such

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.430
as concrete.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.970 position:66%
Use your wet-dry vacuum to remove residue,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.620 position:64%
then wash areas or items with your bleach

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.580 position:63%
solution. Let the bleach solution remain

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.590 position:61%
on the surfaces for at least 10 minutes

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.750
before rinsing with clean water and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.930
allowing to dry.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.660 position:61%
On porous materials such as upholstered

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.520 position:66%
furniture, use extra caution when deciding

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.000 position:63%
whether to clean or discard the item. If

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.130 position:59%
the item has been wet for more than 48

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.460 position:67%
hours it should be discarded. When in doubt

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.940
throw it out!

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.410 position:66%
Remember, ALWAYS wear your mask and gloves

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.830 position:59%
while cleaning, NEVER mix ammonia with

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.450 position:63%
bleach and exercise EXTREME caution when

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.620 position:63%
discarding items contaminated with mold.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.450 position:66%
To avoid serious health problems resulting

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.520 position:66%
from mold exposure keep things clean, dry,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.260 position:63%
and act fast before mold has a chance to

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.850
make your life miserable!
