00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.910
If other things are
more important..

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.970
Daniel, pick up!

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.830
Everyone is forgetful
from time to time.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.870
Shit, its her birthday today!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.550
And don't forget to take
all the other stuff with you.

00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.251
And we think that everything else
in the whole world

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:30.552
is more important
than your friends.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.650
But, what would be,
if you couln't forget anymore?

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.490
Four, two, four, three,
one, six, seven

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.490
Every single sensory perceptions,
even the tiniest ones,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.870
which I have ever had in my whole life;
I can still reacall.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.809
I only remember, if I want to.
I can decide by myself.

00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:02.090
The memorising phase
starts in a few seconds

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.940
And the thoughts control you!

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.020
The human by itself is forgetful.
He wants to forget.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.880
He needs to forget. It is very important
for a human to be able to forget.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.950
Daniel? What's the matter?
Is everything alright? Are you fine?

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.670
Back off! Let me be!

00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:37.871
I canÂ´t control it anymore!

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.610
Hello, its your turn!

00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:10.311
