00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.988
ELMO: Ha, ha, ha.

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:03.479
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee.

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:04.810
ZOE: Hi, Elmo.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.315
ELMO: Oh, hi, Zoe.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:07.790
ZOE: Hi.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.750
Why are you laughing?

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.425
ELMO: Well, because Elmo
just learned a

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:13.640
funny, new game, Zoe.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.060
ZOE: Oh.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.444
ELMO: Yeah, it's called
the opposite game.

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:18.328
ZOE: Op--

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:19.660
op--

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.330
What?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.860
ELMO: "Op-a-sit."

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.944
ZOE: Oh, yeah, opposite!

00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:26.430
ELMO: Yeah!

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.060
If two things are opposite, that
means that they are very,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.967
very different.

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:32.374
ZOE: Oh.

00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:36.325
ELMO: Like hot is the
opposite of cold.

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:38.530
ZOE: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.785
I think I see.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:40.740
Um hmm.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.390
ELMO: Good.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.720
ZOE: No, no, I don't see.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.040
ELMO: Things that are
very different.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.180
Like the opposite of big is--

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.400
ZOE: Um, little?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.780
ELMO: Yeah.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.230
ZOE: Yay!

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.580
ELMO: It's little!

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.030
ZOE: Little.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.480
ELMO: Right.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.380
Bye.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.443
ZOE: Wait, Elmo.

00:00:57.443 --> 00:00:59.060
What's the game?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.770
ELMO: Oh, yeah, Elmo
forgot, sorry.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.308
The game is one person does
something, and the other

00:01:06.308 --> 00:01:08.284
person does the opposite.

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:09.270
ZOE: Oh, yeah.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.760
ELMO: Bye.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.800
ZOE: Wait, Elmo!

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.156
I want to play.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.292
ELMO: Oh, OK.

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.736
Elmo's in a hurry to go home,
but he can play for a minute.

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:18.228
ZOE: OK, good.

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:19.212
ELMO: OK, here goes.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.700
Ooh, [WHISPERING]it's
a good one.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.110
ZOE: I'm watching.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.360
ELMO: OK.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510
ZOE: Yeah, yeah, OK.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.030
Elmo is looking up.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.730
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.962
So I will look down.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:35.886
Right?

00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:38.658
ELMO AND ZOE: Opposite!

00:01:38.658 --> 00:01:40.044
ELMO: Ooh, Elmo has
another one.

00:01:40.044 --> 00:01:41.706
Here we go.

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:47.270
Now, Elmo is looking
this way--

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.556
ZOE: So, Zoe will look
the other way.

00:01:51.556 --> 00:01:52.806
ELMO AND ZOE: Opposite!

00:01:55.204 --> 00:01:56.230
ELMO: Here goes another one.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.660
ZOE: OK.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.420
ELMO: Let's see.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.860
Yes, this is a good one!

00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:05.161
[SINGING LOUDLY]La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la,

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.770
la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.322
ZOE: Elmo was very loud, so
Zoe will be very quiet.

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:21.480
[SINGING QUIETLY]La, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.860
ELMO AND ZOE: Opposite!

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.812
ELMO: Good, good, good.

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.990
ZOE: Elmo, I got one.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.902
Watch this.

00:02:28.902 --> 00:02:30.790
ELMO: OK.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.460
ZOE: [YAWNING SOUNDS]

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.030
[SNORING]

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.940
ELMO: You see that?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.490
See that?

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.712
Zoe is pretending to
be fast asleep.

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:46.410
So Elmo will be?

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.400
That's right.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.885
Elmo will be wide awake!

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:51.135
Like this.

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:55.352
ZOE: Opposite!

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:56.602
ELMO: Opposite!

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.630
ZOE: Come on, Elmo,
your turn again.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.450
I love this game!

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.530
ELMO: Maybe later, Zoe.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.220
Right now, Elmo has
to stop playing.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.108
Bye, bye.

00:03:07.108 --> 00:03:08.410
ZOE: Hello!

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.660
Opposite!

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.990
I will keep playing
all by myself.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.655
Um, let's see.

00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:21.840
Boo hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,
hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.840
Boo hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,
hoo, hoo, hoo.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.220
I'm crying.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.450
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.830
Now I'm laughing.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.826
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.076
Opposite!

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.050
Opposite!
