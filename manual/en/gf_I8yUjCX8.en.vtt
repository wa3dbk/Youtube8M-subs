00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.630
Hey check it out Acer sent me the
Ace 340 Network Attached Server,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.150
and we're going to take a look at 
it today so stay tuned. Be right back.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.850
Alright so here she is, 
it's the H340, from Acer.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.750
A very, very nice four bay, 
Windows home server based,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.370
network attached storage device,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.390
looks really, really, really nice.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.200
Great performance, 
I actually tested it,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.600
transferring 100 MB files, and it was getting
about 10.5 MB per second of throughput,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.500
so that's very fast, 
and that's over Gigabit Ethernet. 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.700
So it's a very quick 
network attached server. 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.440
It also has included in it, 
so you don't have to buy it,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.730
a one TB hard drive now, 
you see here, 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.170
this is a one TB, 
Western Digital green drive,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.870
 it's 5400 rpm, supposedly,
and has featured eight MB of cache,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.090
so you do already come free,
loaded with one TB of storage,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.430
but as you can see,
you have space for three more.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.200
Now they said four
TB is the maximum,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.840
but in reality if you were to
populate those bays with two TB drives,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.190
you'd have eight TB of storage, which in
turn you could make a mirror grade array,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.550
and actually have four TB
reduntantly backed up,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.540
and that would give you some really 
good assurance that your media stuff,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.280
your folders, your files,
your movies, your pictures,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.910
are not going to go anywhere, 
they're going to be there,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.880
and that's very important, when you're 
dealing with high end media stuff like this.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.360
You're backing up your TV 
shows that you're recording,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.240
your movies, your ripping Blu-rays, 
and DVDs, you're downloading movies,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.890
you have tons and 
tons of music,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.860
tons of photos, you're a photographer
and you have tons of raw images,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.000
and you need that 
stuff to be backed up, 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.690
and you want it to be backed up 
redundantly in case of drive failure,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.880
this will do it for you 
perfectly and very efficiently.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.310
It also has great software
included in the box

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.750
that will help 
you do all that.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.740
Including software that lets 
you pretty much backup 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.260
all the computers on 
your home network, 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.390
you could set it up, hey, 
once a day, image this drive.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.270
Twice a week I want you to take
all the images, movies, files and folders

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.990
from this machine and
copy them over.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.450
You also have very cool 
one touch USB download.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.940
Which is basically, you can 
plug in a USB right here.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.690
And actually have it back up pretty 
much take anything off that USB instantly 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.080
with a one button push.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.320
Put it in, and it's going to 
suck everything off of it,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.270
and put it into the NAS,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.890
so if someone comes over, 
let's say a flash drive full of movies,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.400
you don't have to plug it in
and drag and drop the files,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.580
you literally plug it in, 
push a button, and it goes.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.170
That's a very
interesting feature.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.810
Now let's talk a little about connectivity
and how everything works.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.850
This does use
UPMP to connect,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.270
to find, you know for the 
router to find the NAS.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.750
So make sure that your
router does support that.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.680
It would be necessary.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.890
If not, there's no way to manually
input a static guide piece.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.530
So you've got to make sure 
that your router supports that.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.130
Some of the older 
Linksys routers don't do it.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.800
Most of the new ones
will do it no problem.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.480
Now it also features DLNA, so you
can connect any other peripherals,

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.960
media extenders and 
stuff like that, 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.770
if you want to hook it up
with other computers,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.460
embeddable devices,
you can also use it to connect with

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.230
your XBOX 360, 
or your PS3, 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.040
or whatever other console you may 
use that also has internet connectivity.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.010
That's a good feature.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.140
It also features an iTunes server,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.290
so if you want to host 
an iTunes server on here,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.540
you can put all your
music on here,

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.860
and access it from any computer
on your home network,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.930
or of course you can always access 
all this stuff through the web.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.830
Which is to me, 
one of the best parts.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.640
I can listen to my 
music at home,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.760
you know through my house,
but from anywhere in the world.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.730
I can look at
my videos,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.210
if I want to show 
somebody a photo that I took,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.840
I don't have to carry it 
with me on my hard drive,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.110
on my netbook or 
on my laptop,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.440
I can literally just have the stuff 
that's important to me then, there,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.160
I can stream that 
all off the web,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.920
and all I need is an internet connection.
You can watch movies,

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.360
if you have a fast internet connection,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.370
you can even stream
an HD movie, through there,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.350
as long as you have fast enough upload speeds
to get it up to the web fast enough,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.390
and then download speeds 
to get it off the other end.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.430
So that's really cool 
as far as that goes. 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.530
There is a couple other 
things I want to show you.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.410
Look at these
lights right up here.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.180
These are obviously going to 
be your status indicator lights,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.330
they will light up red, if you have
an unformatted or unworking drive,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.910
a disabled drive.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.540
And they're blue 
if you're good to go, 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.880
and everything 
is formatted properly,

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.250
and you can record to it
or you know write data to it.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.530
Looking at the 
back over here, 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.990
you've got an 
interesting array of stuff. 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.980
You've got to remember,
inside this plate right here,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.960
right behind this plate, there are,
actually is an atom computer.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.880
It's an Atom N230, it's
got two GB of DDR2 memory.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.390
It's all in there, it's got an 
actual computer in there.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.020
So on the back,
you have quite a few things.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.390
Starting off from over here, 
this is your reset button,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.310
in case anything ever goes wrong you 
can reset it by throwing a pin in there.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.440
You have an 
E SATA port, 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.630
which is great, it means you 
can share an extra drive

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.930
over the network by 
plugging it in here,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.410
so if you've already 
filled up eight TB,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.080
you got another
two TB that you need,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.460
you can plug it in here,
or you can transfer files off of here.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.030
You also have
four USB 2.0 ports,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.630
again those can be used all 
again for the same thing.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.800
You can do print server sharing,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.960
you can also take files
and folders off here,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.810
you can add extra
 external storage.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.210
Pretty much up to you 
what you want to do. 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.920
And then finally this is your
10, 100, 1,100 Ethernet line,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.640
so you do have Gigabit Ethernet.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.080
And that will provide 1,000 
MB per second of throughput.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.610
Right over here 
is your power, 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.420
and then here is a 
little expansion slot, 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.050
I think what's in
that board is a PCI,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.690
so maybe you could add
something in there but honestly,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.670
I probably wouldn't recommend it.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.300
Maybe, maybe like a 
TV tuner capture card

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.900
 if you leave this next to your TV to 
capture videos straight directly to it.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.890
But to be honest,
with Windows Home Server,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.020
I wouldn't mess with it, 
just in case. 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.440
Now if you are a power user

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.770
and you're going to replace the 
operating system with Linux,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.340
and you're going to go crazy

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.670
and you want to mess 
around with this thing, 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.550
you can, feel free, if not,
the way it come set up is very, very good.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.700
And it works really, really good.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.610
Now, last thing I want 
to show you guys, 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.980
is nothing, because that's
absolutely it, I got it all.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.250
Really, really cool 
product here.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.660
It's the Acer Aspire H340,
Network Attached Server,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.930
up to eight TB, 
you could do Radar Race,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.320
you can check your files, folders, and
images from anywhere in the world,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.200
using the web, you can back up to 
it with its automatic [indiscernible].

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.200
Which is really, really 
intuitive, I might add.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.710
It works very well, it's going to 
save you a lot of trouble,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.650
and it's going to save you some space on
hard drives because it's going to be locally,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.980
everyone gets to share
the eight TB of space.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.600
You can say hey my
netbook's got eight TB,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.650
as long as it's connected 
to the internet of course.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.810
Or from the home network.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.920
But, really good stuff.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.320
If you have any 
other questions on it, 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.570
or how to configure
it or set it up, 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.470
feel free to email me
and I'll see you guys next time.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.570
