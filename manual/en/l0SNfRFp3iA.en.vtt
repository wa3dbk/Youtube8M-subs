00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.750
Happy Mother's Day!

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.030
The female manatee starts reproducing at 5
years of age.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.430
Pregnancy lasts over a year; 13 months and
they give birth every two to five years.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:36.610
The female art of breastfeeding is really
a gift from nature.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.081
Manatee calves nurse at the base of their
mother's flipper and depend on their mother's

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.060
milk for about two years.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.100
This mother is nursing both her youngest calf
and what could a calf she previously raised

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.670
or adopted into the family.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.399
We human mothers often share anecdotes about
the joys and challenges of breastfeeding and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.420
raising children.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.300
We should admire this manatee mother who makes
it seem almost easy to balance her as she

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.290
feeds her family while she goes up to the
surface for air.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.690
Accidents between watercrafts and manatees
are among the highest human related cause

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.770
of mortality for these animals.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.360
These accidents kill and may separate mother
and calf when the young still depend on their

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.630
mothers exclusively for nutrition and protection.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.360
Federally designated Manatee Protection Areas
(MPAs) are peaceful places for nursing and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.050
other basic needs of life.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.610
Marked speed limits, no wake zones, marked
navigation channels, and boat exclusions could

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.570
save manatees by preventing accidents and
strandings.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.330
These families of gentle giants need your
help.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.430
Please boat safely and remember what mothers
said...

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.959
"Be polite and when you are in someone else's
home, their rules apply."

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:21.710
