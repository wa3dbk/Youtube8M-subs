00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.469
Building a landscape wall in a weekend

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.919
Are you ready to make over your landscape?

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.829
Check out this weekend project from Allan Block

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.250
Today we're going to turn a small overgrown hillside into a beautiful

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.960
elevated garden using the Europa Collection from Allan Block.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.919
You can find installation instructions and the location of your nearest

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.270
Allan Block dealer by visiting us at allanblock.com

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.570
click on the videos and animations tab

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.130
and then on retaining walls to find this
weekend project

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.290
Tools you will need with include, shovels a hand compactor,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.200
a wheel barrow,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.990
measuring tape, a level a dead block hammer, a rake, a broom,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.600
safety glasses and work gloves

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.980
Allan Block Europa Collection has four basic block shapes

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.490
for this project will be working with
the AB Barcelona

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.820
the AB Palermo

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.170
and the AB Bordeaux blocks

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.120
using a two course abbey lite pattern

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.940
The first step is to make a simple plan

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.950
draw out the layout of the wall and determine its dimensions.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.900
Your local Allan Block dealer will help you get all the right amount of block and materials for the job.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.500
To begin we will clear the area of any surface vegetation and organic materials

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.770
Walls cannot be built on organic materials and they should not be used

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.290
as backfill

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.710
starting at the lowest elevation dig a base trench that is twelve inches

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.930
wide by six inches deep

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.210
along the length of the wall the scope
of this project allows us to use less

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.720
while rock in the base and behind the
wall than would be used in a standard

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.840
landscape wall

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.149
check the landscape walls guide for
details on the amount of wall rock you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.720
will need for your own project

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.840
If the base trench of your wall steps up a slope, see the landscape walls

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.500
guide for more information and instructions

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.090
check the trench for level making
adjustments as necessary

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.780
thoroughly compact the trench with a hand compactor

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.120
to build a quality wall use a clean granular rock underneath the base course

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.930
to create a firm foundation for your project

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.689
we call this wall rock

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.999
once the trench is ready

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.749
fill the trench with four inches of rock

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:24.509
after the rock is in place raked the
area soon

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:29.100
Wall rock is used as base material, within the block cores as well as behind the block

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.959
it must be a compatible aggregate
ranging in size from a quarter-inch to

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.009
one-and-a-half inches in diameter

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:40.049
this balanced mix of sizes allows for good
compaction

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.090
compact the wall rock thoroughly with a hand compactor

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.269
check the entire length for level

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.469
adjust as necessary making sure to re-compact any loose material

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.469
now it's time to install the first course of blocks

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.999
beginning at the lowest elevation

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:00.849
when using the abbey lite pattern

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.100
you can use the AB Barcelona for the base course.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.169
install the entire base course with the
raised front lip facing up and forward on

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.900
the base material near the front of the trench

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.800
check and adjust each block from side to side and front to back for level and alignment

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.279
on this project were starting with a curve.

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:26.019
to build smooth outside curves remove one or both of the wings from the back of the block to

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.859
tighten the radius of the curve

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.059
to obtain a clear break hit the back of
the wing with a hammer

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.849
check the entire base course for
alignment by spanning multiple blocks

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.179
with a level

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.739
Fill the area in front of the blocks with soil

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:47.739
this will keep the blocks in place while
filling in compacting

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.319
then fill the block cores and six to
twelve inches behind the block with wall rock

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.049
up to the top of the blocks

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.189
use the end of the shovel to consolidate the wall rock in the block cores

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.590
then compact behind the blocks with a
hand compactor

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:14.009
sweep the blocks clean to prepare a
smooth surface for the next course

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:18.290
then check for level adjusting as
necessary

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.049
stack the next course of blocks following
the pattern you've chosen or one on the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.220
Abbey Lite tech sheet

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.410
so that the vertical seams are offset
from the blocks below as much as possible

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.000
Fill the hollow cores and six inches behind the block with wall rock

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:38.599
fill and compact each course in no more
than eight inch lifts

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:45.580
Use approved on-site soils to backfill
behind the wall rock

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.300
on the last course you can fill the block cores and behind the block with on-site soils

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.110
to assist with any plantings above the
wall

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.229
finishing the wall is easy you can use AB Capstones or simply pull the

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.039
mulch right up to the raised front lip

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.729
and there you have it -  a beautiful landscape
wall in just one weekend

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.219
