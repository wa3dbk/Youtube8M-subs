00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.020
One woman is killed every week in Australia by an intimate partner

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.580
73 percent of intimate partner homicides are women

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.200
Personal safety surveys show us that 1 in 4 kids experience violence in the home firsthand

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.120
And the other 3 out of 4 kids, they're seeing it in the video games they play

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.820
in the movies they watch, in the porn they consume online as they get older

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.160
You can't have the statistics we know about without recognizing there are many people within the school community

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.740
that are going to be touched one way or another.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.220
When a person gets teased they feel a little bit sad

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.660
and might get their anger out.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.760
The bullies don't seem to really care about it. They think that because they have their own problems at home that they should take it out on other kids.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.480
As an ex-school teacher I've witnessed children on the playground, children in the classroom, children in social settings

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.780
expressing violence towards each other.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.400
We need to work with them to change what they see as that normal violent behaviour

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.700
into attitudes and behaviours of tolerance, acceptance, and respect.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:17.820
It's really important that we engage young people before their attitudes towards gender and relations and violence are set in stone.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.340
Boys can exercise power and authority very early on

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.140
and we need to role model that that's inappropriate.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.620
We need to break the silence.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.160
The Breaking the Silence program was developed by academic research in Victoria

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.060
piloted in the Sydney schools region, and supported by the director of the region, Dr Phil Lambert.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.900
During those early years it was funded through Suzanne Grae corporate sponsorship

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.920
and it's now being rolled out across New South Wales, supported by the Director-General of Education and private philanthropic funding.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.740
As Director-General of Education and Communities I'm incredibly proud about the Breaking the Silence program.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.520
2009 when the Sydney region joined with White Ribbon Australia to form up the program

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.440
it has been a wonderful innovation in our school environment.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.660
The schools clearly are an important place recognized by the broader society

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.740
of making a difference for our young people. Not only in terms of academic outcomes

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.600
but also social outcomes.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.900
Each school and school community

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.620
the leadership of the school contextualizes the program

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.520
relevant to that particular school.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:31.520
It might be that they embed it in drama classes, may embed it alongside their respectful relationship or social competencies program.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.480
About 75  to 85 percent of our kids are here under the talented sports program

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.340
the largest sport we have is rugby league

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.980
and we started because of some of the disrespectful behaviours

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.400
of some of the sports boys

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.840
in the school towards the women.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.140
First evidence we had were disrespectful comments

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.600
made of a sexist nature with girls walking through the program

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.280
And the other thing that we found was a problem was the girls were accepting of these comments

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.740
they didn't like them, but they just saw it as the way it was and so they didn't make much of a fuss.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.380
When you look at particular schools in particular contexts, such as a sporting high school

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.740
some of those students in the elite teams are our next sporting heroes in the broader sense

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.920
they have a role and responsibility attached to that

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.620
White Ribbon gives them the skills and the tools to play out that role in a very responsible way.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.260
The whole program we have here is hands-on, practical

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.980
and we talk about what it looks like, what a respectful school looks like

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920
how we should treat each other

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.360
boys and girls have a chance to say what they expect and it's very powerful for boys to hear from girls what they expect

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.760
I think we have those strategies implemented and just that everybody knows the values of this school

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.800
This school's more of a family now. Before it used to be like this is that group, that's that group. Now it's just everyone's together.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.900
There's nothing separating anyone anymore.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.780
The main countable change is the respect that is being shown.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.500
It is now no longer acceptable out on the playground to say the things that we used to hear.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.240
Since the program's been running we have seen as many different responses to the issue of violence

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.260
as there are schools themselves, something that we in the office could never have envisioned.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.860
We're able to review our policies, our anti-bullying policies, our student welfare policy

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.240
the key learning areas, and the teaching and learning.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.380
Students are able to express themselves on the concept of respect and violence and what it means to them.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.200
Teachers are involved, students are involved, parents are involved

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.200
and it's all driven by a principal so

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.600
the notion of respect and nonviolence is coming at those kids from many angles

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.220
If you were to sit down with a group of students from our school

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.580
they all know that this is about boys and men not hurting girls and women

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.420
they know that we don't accept domestic violence.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.280
If schools don't get involved then we are sweeping the White Ribbon content under the carpet

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.760
Most domestic violence is there and it's a primary prevention model. It's important that we address that.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.340
It is our core business as educators to ensure that we're focused on student well-being

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.460
and indeed a commitment to valuing respectful relationships.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.300
It really takes knowing individual kids and give them lessons

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:30.620
but it takes communities and reinforces those lessons with the behaviour and the attitude of the community.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.560
I was about to explain to the new committee what White Ribbon was all about

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.100
and the President said "Ray, if you don't mind, I'd like to explain that."

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.900
At that point I felt like we are really getting the message through if somebody else wanted to take that away from me.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.380
We are all of those people that are called the silent majority

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.640
and we're not going to be silent about this anymore

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.560
The Breaking the Silence schools program is an excellent tool and strategy

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.020
to work alongside all the other elements of school's work in the social change space.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.940
It provides them with tools and strategies that enable them to educate young people

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.280
to be much more responsible and to break the cycle of violence in Australia.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:17.300
If in 20 years time we have a generation of boys leaving school who intuitively understand that violence is wrong

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:24.520
in every situation, and who always reach for a nonviolent solution to their problem

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:33.300
and a generation of girls leaving school who know that they should expect respect in every circumstance of their lives

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.920
then that will be the first generation of its kind

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.500
not only in Australia, but at any time, anywhere, in the history of humanity

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.980
It is an exciting thing to be a part of that change.
