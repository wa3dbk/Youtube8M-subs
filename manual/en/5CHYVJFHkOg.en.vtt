00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.070
Volvo V60 is kind of an intruder in the Volvo
range, because it is a model invented at the

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.340
same time with the second-generation of S60 sedan.
So, V60 is a S60 wagon.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.470
Even if, by tradition, the wagons are not as attractive
or as sports as the cars from which they come from,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.660
Volvo V60 is here to prove otherwise.
The car offers a dramatic design,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.030
very sporty, but that can be soften by several
minuses that need to be taken into consideration

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.220
if you want to buy a premium compact estate.  

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.490
Volvo’s strategy for this model is very interesting:
it has the same dimensions as the sedan

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.310
and even the same price. So, choosing a V60 instead of a S60,
it is just a matter of taste

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.660
... and 50 liters extra capacity in the trunk.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.590
Along with the advantage of cost, keeping the
body configuration as closely to the original

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.420
brings a more flexible and dynamic design.
The car does not give the impression that

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.080
it was stretched or unnaturally converted into a wagon.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.960
Inside the car there are no dramatic changes.
The trunk has a capacity of 430 liters,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.460
like Audi A4 Avant, but is 30 liters smaller than
BMW 3 Series Touring and 70 liters smaller

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.450
compared to Mercedes-Benz C-Class Estate –
the segment leader from this point of view.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.470
Volvo V60 is built for extra urban escapades.
The seats are soft, but offer a very good lateral support

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.490
and the upholstery, in lighter colour,
give a special flavor to the comfort of this car.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.980
The design of the instrument cluster and the
center console is minimal and very pleasant.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.400
It looks like the office of a northern artist
with a clear mind.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.180
Just like any other modern Volvo, V60 has in
its standard configuration the CitySafety

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.730
automatic braking system that can get you rid
of accidents at low speed. 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.710
The road behavior is both a strong point and a
minus of this car. Volvo V60 is a proof of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.550
agility and precision. It is perhaps the
sportiest Volvo ever built,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.540
without even expressly aiming to be aggressive.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.400
The car is equipped with a system that brakes
the inside wheel when turning and transmits

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.010
more power to the outside one. Thus, every
movement of the steering wheel is translated

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.080
into a strong reaction of the front of the car.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.190
Volvo allows you to choose the type of
chassis, Sport or Comfort, and you do not

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.240
have to pay any extra money for it.
The car in the video is equipped with the Comfort one,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.740
and that's the problem!
If the front of this break makes you think that

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.680
the grip is unlimited, the rear is slightly playful
when cornering aggressively.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.880
So, the Sports suspension, which I tested it on S60 is more suitable.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.410
Briefly said, the Comfort settings bring more instability
when cornering than the awaited... comfort.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.520
The car in the video is equipped with the
new Volvo D3 engine. It is a 2-liter turbo diesel,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.070
with 5 cylinders, that develops 163
PS/HP. The engine is very lively,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.260
but unfortunately... either the level of noise, OR the
soundproofing, is lacking.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.480
The consumption is also a little high. The medium consumption
hardly decreases to less than 9 l/100 km.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.170
And no... It's not the transmission fault,
because this dual-clutch Powershift gearbox,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.640
with 6 gears, works flawlessly.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.880
At a price of slightly above 47,500 Euros with VAT,
Volvo V60 has by its side the most daring

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.690
and modern design from its class, plus a top safety!
But with the same money you can buy any of the three competing wagons:

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.780
3 Series, A4 or C-Klass.
Each has its advantages,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.310
from the ride to the interior space.
The battle is thus open and very balanced!
