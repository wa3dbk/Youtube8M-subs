00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.800
Civilization: Beyond Earth, Marty O'Donnell
parts with Bungie, World of Darkness cancelled

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.840
- all that and more coming up right now on
the Curse Weekly Roundup!

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.960
This week's Roundup has been sponsored by
Infinite Crisis.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.619
Hey guys it's Jess, and first up, at last
weekend's PAX East in Boston, 2k and Firaxis

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.820
announced Civilization: Beyond Earth.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.210
It's the latest title in the Sid Meier's Civilization
series, and is a continuation of the same

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.390
gameplay you loved from the franchise, but
this time it's in space!

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.000
The developers had to think outside the box
and come up with new planets, races, systems...it's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.560
a pretty ambitious project, and we grabbed
an interview with the producers at PAX East,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.050
we'll link that to you in the description
below.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.449
Marty O'Donnell, the composer known for his
iconic work with the Halo franchise, has been

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.910
let go from Bungie.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.190
No official reason has been given, with O'Donnell
simply tweeting that Bungie's board of directors

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.440
terminated him without cause on April 11th.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.980
To many, he was seen as an asset in the Halo
community, and had been most recently working

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.200
on the Destiny soundtrack, making this termination
all the more surprising.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.840
Once again, this episode of the Curse Weekly
Roundup has been sponsored by Infinite Crisis,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.880
and we've got a couple of founder's packs
to give away!

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.630
Each Founder's Pack contains 12 champions,
exclusive costumes for two of the champions,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.350
an exclusive Founder's Protector icon, and
8600 Crisis Coins, which is an $80 value!

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.750
We have five codes, to enter to win one just
leave a comment on this video and tell me

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.370
who is your favorite champion and why!

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.080
We'll pick five lucky commenters and give
them each a code - good luck!

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.130
CCP's next MMO World of Darkness has been
canceled, resulting in a layoff of 56 employees

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770
at their Atlanta office.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.780
The game had been a long time in the making,
first revealed 8 years ago, and CEO Hilmar

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.970
Veigar Petursson said in a prepared statement
that canceling the title was one of the hardest

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.009
decisions he's ever had to make.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.280
Following the cancellation, it was revealed
that CCP had recorded a loss of $21 million

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.899
during the 2013 financial year, and that the
primary reason for the company's drop in profit

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.229
was an increase in R&amp;D costs related to EVE
Valkyrie, Dust 514, and World of Darkness.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.640
Crystal Dynamics has posted some new job listings
to fill roles working on Tomb Raider 2 - and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.570
while we've known for a while that this sequel
to the franchise reboot was underway, we've

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.570
now been given a slight glimpse into some
of the gameplay elements.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.190
We now know that it will be cinematic heavy,
and like its predecessor will feature stealth

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.800
and RPG-lite elements, as well as an economy.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.840

if you want to view the Crystal Dynamics job

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.930
