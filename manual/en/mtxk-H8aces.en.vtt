00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.360
Welcome to InSite, a home for local living.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.510
We believe that a sustainable home is connected
to its place.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.920
When a home draws from local energy, architecture
and resources it creates a lifestyle that

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.210
keeps the community in site.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.510
Our home, InSite, is built for a family earning
$70,000 a year living in Middlebury, VT.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.250
It provides all the comforts of a modern home
while integrating into a traditional community.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.160
Large windows in the bedrooms bring in ample
natural light to brighten the rooms and welcome

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.710
the day.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.030
Our bedrooms are a cozy and functional retreat.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.080
Our expansive living space opens to the south.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.940
It houses the kitchen, dining area and living
room.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.120
InSite features local and durable materials
such as Vermont maple flooring and steel crafted

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.110
by a Middlebury artisan.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:15.210
Each material was chosen to limit environmental
impact.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.930
Our 954 square foot home was carefully designed
with storage in mind.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.320
All mechanical systems are built around a
centralized mechanical module.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.360
By locating our energy efficient appliances
and systems close together we conserve energy

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.350
and improve the performance of our systems.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.350
InSite utilizes the local climate with a passive
cooling system.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.370
An automated damper low on the north wall
draws fresh air in while dampers placed high

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.320
on the mechanical module release hot air,
naturally ventilating the home with a chimney

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.420
effect.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.100
Responding to varying Vermont temperatures,
InSite's 14-inch thick walls use recycled

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.729
cellulose insulation to reduce the need for
heating and cooling, reducing our energy load.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.920
Adding to the natural landscape, InSite will
feature a green roof that insulates our home,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.190
sequesters carbon, and manages storm water
runoff.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.000
InSite's public space is most prominent, while
the private space is set back from the street.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.600
The mechanical module rises at the center.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.050
High efficiency triple paned windows use the
southern walls as an overhang to shade the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.530
interiors from the summer sun.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.980
Our solar path features a 6.2-kilowatt photovoltaic
array.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.970
The simple open framed structure was designed
to reflect InSite and respond to its site

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.630
in Middlebury, but can also be integrated
into any community, enlivening sidewalks,

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.780
school campuses and public parks.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.989
The family can track their energy production
and use with a building management system

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:04.330
that also controls the homes passive and active
systems.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.930
Sustainability is about more than renewable
energy, it is about learning from the natural,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.040
social and built environment in order to connect
with the local community.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.530
When we live local we reduce consumption,
and increase connections, powering our communities

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.719
for a brighter future.
