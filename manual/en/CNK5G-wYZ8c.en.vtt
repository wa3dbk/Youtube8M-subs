Hi! In today’s video, I will show you a nail art that I have done three years ago, called Sexy Nail. 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.914
It was made of 4 stripes. 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.057
Today’s nail art is an improved and difficult version. 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.657
I hope that you will like this version. Let’s watch the video. 

00:00:24.828 --> 00:00:29.171
First I’ve applied a light blue from Essie. 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.142
Then I make a V shape French manicure. 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.714
It’s a very pronounced V shape. 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.457
I start quite at the top of the nail to make the V shape. 

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.857
If needed, apply two coats. 	

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:50.850
In my case, it is not necessary. 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.628
I’ve applied a very thick coat to make it appear well. 

00:00:53.971 --> 00:01:00.600
Then with a long liner brush and a dark purple acrylic paint. 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.657
I start drawing the cross lines. 

00:01:04.657 --> 00:01:09.114
Make sure that your V shape is well centered 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.571
or else your nail art will be shifted. 

00:01:12.914 --> 00:01:15.342
I make the lines very thin. 

00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:28.714
I draw at all 4 lines on each side of my nail. 

00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:52.371
Then I add small lines with the silver glitter liner brush 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.800
That I apply between the dark purple lines. 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800
To enhance the design. 

00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:06.685
And where the lines meet themselves, I add a drop of top coat and a rhinestone. 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.514
And then I apply the final top coat. 

00:02:20.628 --> 00:02:26.085
And now, I draw a lace design on the annular. 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.371
To do so, I use a detail brush. 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.085
And along the line, I draw several arcs as you can see here.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.171
And then, I will draw some more arcs inside the big arcs. 

00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:24.485
And now, I add some little drops between the arcs. 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.342
To do so, I incline my brush in the direction that I want to do the drop 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.657
And then I press lightly on the brush to obtain a tiny drop. 

00:03:36.114 --> 00:03:38.428
I hope that you like this nail art design. 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.800
I recommend to you the Essie nail polishes. 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.400
They are beautiful and of very good quality. 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.771
I hope that you liked this video. 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.914
See you soon for another tutorial. Bye!
