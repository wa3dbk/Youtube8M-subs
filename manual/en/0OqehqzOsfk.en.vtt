00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.410
Today on our 2006 Dodge Durango well be installing
the Curt hitch, part number 13072.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.540
This is what our hitch will look like once
its installed.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.200
Next well go ahead and give you a couple of
measurements to assist you with selecting

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.210
accessories for your new hitch such as a draw
bar, a bike rack, or a cargo carrier.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.520
The center of the hitch pin hole is even with
the outer most edge of the bumper and from

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.550
the top of the receiver tube to the ground
is 21 inches.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.850
Now lets go ahead with the installation.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.200
Note first before we can begin installing
the hitch well need to go ahead and lower

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200
and remove the spare tire which weve already
done.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.310
Next well go ahead and take the hitch and
center it on the rear bumper beam.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.239
This will allow us to take a paint marker
and mark the areas where the hitch will be

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.430
attached with U-bolts at the bumper beam.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.320
Now our marks will line up with the U-bolts
so well mark and cut away the Styrofoam plastic

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.220
fascia reinforcement.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.930
First Ill start with the utility knife to
score and cut away as much of the Styrofoam

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.910
as possible and then Im going to take a flat
blade screwdriver and hammer and knock out

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.970
the rest of the area.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:24.369
Before we slide our U-bolts into place were

00:01:24.369 --> 00:02:32.900
going 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:03:01.230
to remove 
the four fasteners securing 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:15.489
the rear bumper fascia.
