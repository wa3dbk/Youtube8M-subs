Hi, I'm Bobby crispy this video is part of my guitar lesson series

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.850
So today, I'll show how to play

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.849
The Solo from what is and what shall never be by Led zeppelin. It's an easy solo

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.409
So I'll play it first. I'll show us play note from using tabs

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.830
Okay, the first part is this fourth string 9th fret

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.099
Third string nice. I love it. Bend up bend up again

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.569
Lovitz yeah, just regular slide down to sixth fret

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.110
Next part is this

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.670
so third string fourth fret

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.520
again six fret second string fifth fret

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.550
And the second and third strings slide up to the ninth fret play it again

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.679
So again the third string is seventh fret

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.150
So I can sit there strings slide down into the second fret

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.900
is this

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.220
second string Twelfth fret

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.480
first string Twelfth fret

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.170
of the second string Twelve

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.320
first string Twelve

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.849
to threat

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.970
2nd string 10th fret and up

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.249
bend it up again twice more and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.579
back down to normal dead front slide up to the 14th fret

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.420
Next part is this

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.359
second string 12th fret 1st string 14th, benda

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.519
first string 12

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500
Second-string 12

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.479
again tough again slide down to 10th

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.550
for stringed a threat

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.200
Expert is this

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.310
So that's enough play it on the fourth and second strings

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.450
Just slide up to the 14th fret fourth string

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.949
The 14th fret of the second string is pick it with your finger twice

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.680
Do that six times?

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.739
And do the exact same thing at the 16th fret position

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.289
So fourth string 16th fret slide up to it

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:33.169
And the same thing on the second string 16th fret pick it with your finger twice. That's three times

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.240
second string 16th fret uh-huh

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.920

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.080
slowly

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.090
and

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.339
yes know this the soul was originally played with a slide, but I

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.480
Transcribed it so you can play it with your fingers. It's a great solo

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:10.199
