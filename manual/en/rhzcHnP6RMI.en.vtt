00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.369
&gt;&gt;Clare Balding: In terms of dealing with
your situation as an individual but also as

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:19.420
part of this extraordinary team, let's talk
about teamwork first off and how you fit into

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.930
it and then how you lead a team.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.300
&gt;&gt;John Eales: It's really important because
I think any team, whether it be business or

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.420
sport, you have this -- you have this balance
and you want this balance between -- you have

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.220
all these people, in particularly at the elite
level of sportal business, you have these

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.140
people that are there for their own selfish
reasons.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.890
And you can't get away from them.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.949
Everyone in the room has their selfish motivations.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.069
And, actually, you want that because you want
them to have that ambition to be singularly

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.210
focused on something they desperately want
to achieve.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.159
But at the same time, they need to be able
to subjugate their personal ambition for the

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.190
sake of the team and getting that balance.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.260
It is just balance between selfishness and
selflessness.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.500
If the selfishness overcomes the selflessness
you need to be a part of the a team, actually

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.659
you don't have a team.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.220
Being able to somehow -- I think that's the
trickiest balance in getting a team right

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.720
is being able to balance individual ambition
with team ambition.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.850
&gt;&gt;Clare Balding: And how -- let's say you
have a member of your team of Australia who

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.770
is incredibly egotistical and gets an awful
lot of attention -- and for Rugby fans, David

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.160
Campese, I'm thinking of -- how do you manage
that person?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.330
And do you sometimes have to think, Well,
yes, he gives off this air of supreme confidence

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.790
but actually once in a while, he probably
needs an arm around his shoulder, metaphorically

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.790
speaking.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.690
&gt;&gt;John Eales: I think it's about understanding
them is the number one thing, understanding

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.060
what makes this person tick, why they are
like they are.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.500
You don't want to -- you don't want to really
cut off their ambition because that's part

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.350
of what gives them the confidence to perform.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.320
But you also want to make sure it's curtailed
and it is not going to distract the team.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.120
So I think getting that balance is -- you
know, it's never particularly easy, but I

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.600
think it starts from understanding the person.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.340
And to really get the best out of a team,
it's about -- you often talk about composure,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.770
composure both at an individual level but
also at a team level.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.580
Composure is about faith, not an evangelical
style of faith or anything but just some basic

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.850
grounded sense of faith, firstly, in yourself.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.841
Like, you know, you have worked as hard as
you can to be as good as you can in what you

00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:34.450
are and you have got that faith, that confidence
when you get on the line.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.570
Secondly, it is about faith in your teammates
around you.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.700
That faith means -- it doesn't mean you look
across the huddle and you think they're the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.370
best player in the world within their position.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.720
But it means you actually know them.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.360
You know them for their strengths, and you
know them for their weaknesses.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.770
Part of that is then you can support them
where they are weak.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.250
David Campese was the best player in the world
in his day.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.020
He was a big reason we won the '90-'91 World
Cup.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.030
He was the greatest attacking player in the
world.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.680
He probably wouldn't have been in the top
50 defenders in this room.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.050
It just wasn't his strength, but we knew that.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.470
So we could support him where he wasn't particularly
strong.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.930
&gt;&gt;Clare Balding: It is interesting because
it seems you define a difference between liking

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.310
somebody and trusting somebody.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.920
And the important thing is in a team you trust
each other.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.450
You don't actually have to like each other.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.520
&gt;&gt;John Eales: I think in any group of people
-- We would often travel to a World Cup, we

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.420
would travel with 30 people in a squad.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.130
And it is like any business group.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.380
Like, you are not going to love everyone you're
with in that team environment.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.060
But the trust and more importantly probably
the respect you have and the respect that

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.630
you develop over time with that person.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.010
I think it really comes back to in sport -- sport
compared to business, sport has some great

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.780
transparent moments where you can see the
effort someone is putting in.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.910
You can see the commitment which I think is
a lot harder to discern as quickly in business.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.040
Someone can be saying something in business
and telling you what they intend to do or

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.700
how they're going, and the results tend to
lag a bit.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.259
Whereas, in sport, the performance is right
there in front of you and they can't hide

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.259
from it.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.490
So I think sport, you have these great moments
of honesty.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.050
And I often think about a World Cup final
or I imagine, Steve, just before you are about

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.770
to go out and row the final, like in Rugby,
you pull it into a huddle and there is 14

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.710
other guys in that huddle.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.900
That's a really important moment of honesty.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.680
You can look around every set of eyes in that
huddle and you know that you've got the faith

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.260
in them that they have in you.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.660
But it is also you're charging them with that
commitment of what they have to do out there

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.660
on the field that day.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.810
The second moment of honesty that's really
important is after whatever happens on the

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.970
field, win, lose or draw, you come back into
that change room and you're able to look your

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.600
mate in the eye and to know that moment of
honesty, to know that there wasn't more that

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.940
you could have done, that you didn't let your
mate down, not because of ability but because

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.400
of effort and focus and stuff like that.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.560
I think that's really important.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.000
&gt;&gt;Clare Balding: When you, then, leave that
changing room and you're having to deal with

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.691
the consequences of what has happened on the
pitch, be it success or be it failure, how

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:25.010
do you handle that?

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.550
Did you have any tricks that would help you
through?

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.960
&gt;&gt;John Eales: I think the analysis is really
important, understanding why you succeeded

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.210
or why you failed.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.240
A lot of the time it is easier -- A lot of
people say this.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.229
When you are successful, you probably don't
look at why you are successful as much as

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.449
when you failed, you are desperately digging
into why you failed.

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:52.820
And I think success can create short memories
-- short-term memory loss in a lot of people.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.170
I remember learning really early in my career,
there was an Australian swimming coach actually.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.870
I couldn't hardly swim across the pool, let
alone the length of the pool.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.300
It was a guy by the name of Don Talbot.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.570
I think he ended up coming over here and doing
some work with the British squad.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.710
I remember talking to him about an athlete
that was making a come-back -- an Olympic

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.710
come-back.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.800
I was really surprised by his response.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.350
I said, How will he go in his come-back?

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.759
He said, He will fail.

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.110
He was as blunt as that.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.110
He said, He'll fail.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.110
I said, How can you say that so quickly?

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.720
He said, He will fail because most come-backs
fail.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.790
He said, Most come-backs fail because people
forget how hard they had to work in the first

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.650
place to achieve what they achieved and they
actually never work that hard again.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.470
And I think when you fail, being able to have
that -- another moment of honesty with yourself,

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.430
to look at why you failed, it was a bit because
you didn't do enough work.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.910
Was it because you didn't concentrate?

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.790
Was it because you let someone down or whatever
it was.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:58.060
But be really honest with you self at that
moment, like that person who is making a come-back

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.060
needs to be honest with himself.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.009
Steve was honest with himself five times in
a row.

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.439
That's an extraordinary achievement.
