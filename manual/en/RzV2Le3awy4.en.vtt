00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.269
Now we didn't plan this, we were
shooting video of me and then it

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.589
happened there was a guy in the background.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.029
Who is in there and allows you to kind
of get a sense

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.689
what you saw from above in rough water,
underwater it looks like this

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.230
even in rough water 'cause this

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.420
the turbulence is all on the surface. So as
long as I do these things that you see

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.100
me do here.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.369
So as you watch my right hand
go in here,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.829
what you're going to see me do with the
right hand

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.589
is separate water molecules and then line
up the right side of my body

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.080
to fit through the hole I make with my
right arm.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.140
The guy next to me is never making that
hole, his hand goes in the water and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.980
starts pulling. He's doing human
swimming,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.320
he's pulling and kicking and
all he's thinking about is pulling and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.989
kicking. Whereas I'm thinking about my
right hand got to go in,

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.340
separate molecules and then I'm going to line up the rest of my body

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.180
to fit through that hole that my right arm cuts.
And then you watch the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.380
left arm, also notice the difference in
bubbles.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.190
Right arm slides through, body follows
it through that line. Left arm cuts through, left side

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.880
follows it through. And you see the path
that his hands follow, there's no cutting of a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.650
path.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.010
I could see me lengthen the body, keep
the body long streamlined and balanced

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.140
legs are streamlined.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.850
Hand is patient about finding the grip,
the palm is always back.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.310
The fingers are always down, lets back it up again,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.900
back it up a little bit so we can watch

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.650
in particular

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.600
what the palm does.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.940
And this is just one of those things,
there's never a time

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.180
that my hand this in the water were palms
not facing back.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.650
From the moment the hand goes in,the fingers are down, and the palm is backed.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.700
Because as long as the palm back if
I apply  any pressure,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.190
the result and force moves me forward.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.149
If you look at other people there is

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.350
tremendous amount of time where the hand is
going back

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.139
with palm facing somewhere other than
back,

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.369
so it's an idea of one of those
consequential things.

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.989
And this is a group of the TI coaches
swimming in a what we call a swimming

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.149
pelathon,

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:23.279
and this is the kind of thing that
causes a lot of distraction,

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.639
anxiety and so on for people when
they're in this kind of a

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.179
crowd. And what we're showing
here is, we spend a lot of time... that's me

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.969
second from the left over here, but
they're all coaches my two daughters are

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.879
getting squeezed up by me there.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.180
And this is with two of my training partners, also the TI Coaches. And again you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.419
could see what I showed you with Shinji
that there's a form. This is a stroke

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.689
that's been arrived out through a lot of thought

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.430
and analysis

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.069
of how to be efficient. Another
group of the people I swim with up in New

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.389
Paltz,

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.260
they're not all

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.099
TI Coaches but you can see that
they all

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.119
have the same stroke.

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.139
The guys in the middle are both TI Coaches

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.279
but the two on the outside are not.

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.489
And you know this is just a group of
people at one of our camps in the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.909
Bahamas, but you can see an absence of
the kind of stuff you usually see in a

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.170
Triathlon field, which is a lot of
splashing,

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.170
lot of  churning. They're just people practicing calm swimming

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.629
and swimming together.
