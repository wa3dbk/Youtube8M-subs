Hi! My name is Scott Rio and on behalf of
Expert Village, I would like to talk to you

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.750
about container gardening. Watering containers
is always an important thing to think about.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.150
If you’ve done a good job of constructing
your soil, it is already going to hold a lot

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.740
of moisture. Things like peat, things like
humus are going to hold water in the container

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.740
and make it available to your plants on a
regular basis. If your plants are really going

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.680
to be in a hot hot dry area, there are water
crystals out there that are available that

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.050
expand and hold up to 10 times their water.
It’s a great way to stretch the water in

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.769
your container. But remember to soak those
crystals first before you mix them into your

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.379
potting mix or the next thing you know, it
is pushing your plants up and out of the container.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.819
For shady area like this, one of the easiest
ways to come and do your watering is to simply

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:57.620
turn the hose on them. Even in the middle
of the day in a shady area like this, it is

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.529
going to provide nice soft gentle water. It
is going to wash the dirt and debris off of

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:08.920
the leaves and any pollutants that might be
in the air that have also washed under the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.939
leaves, it will help cool your plants down
and get them into a nice temperature where

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.729
they can grow happily. Now remember the smaller
the plant and the smaller the container, the

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.610
quicker that that plant is going to use the
available water in the container. So your

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.450
smaller containers are probably going to need
a little more water than some of your other

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.170
ones. Shallow containers like on this bone
side also dry out a lot quicker so that is

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.499
another one to consider and real thirsty plants
like this banyan tree, I actually keep a container

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.260
underneath it to catch water. It will actually
suck water right up out of that pot once it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:56.189
is full. So considering your containers, considering
the plants that are in them, it is the most

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.100
important thing to think about when you are
watering your plants but remember, no matter

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.670
how much that plant likes hot dry sunny conditions,
they all need water. So above all else, don’t

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.970
skimp on the watering. Your plants will appreciate
it.
