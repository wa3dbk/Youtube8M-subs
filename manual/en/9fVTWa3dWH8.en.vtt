00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.570
hello everyone please welcome and join

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:17.550
me easy steps auto repair and upgrade

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:22.240
I'm going to replace my stock 4,300 K

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.150
lights for Mercedes ML 500 year model

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.030
2006 and I'm going to replace with the

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.380
8,000 K which is a way it's going to

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.380
look if I can close in

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.600
and what I will do I'm going to take

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.640
these out how do I do it I'll show you

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.489
look this is how light looks

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.979
at this moment so once we going to

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:01.040
replace the bulb it's going to be really

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:06.050
cool so now we're going to open the hood

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:10.630
and work on it first thing you need to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.670
do you have to go and open the cap you

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.630
have to twist around these are the heads

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.399
are locking in there so once you open

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.429
now I'm going to put insert my hand in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.759
there this one has a locking system and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.909
you have to make sure you press it and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:35.840
then you pull it it's not enough room in

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:38.899
there to pull these lights this kind of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.450
really tricky it's a hard to work I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:47.330
able to remove it you need to basically

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.190
it's a harder to put your hand in there

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.989
you have to make sure you play around

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.509
but very carefully you have to make sure

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:59.390
that how it rotates once it so rotates

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.149
then it pulls it out see if I able to

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.209
show you then the wire is connected is

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.720
small if it can zoom in I'm going to pull

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.340
this wire out so now this bulb is out so

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.390
we're going to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.310
this is the original stock item bulb as

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.000
I say I let me put it here

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.950
it's a 4300 and I'm going to bring the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.810
other one and this is the comparison of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:35.300
this is 8,000 so I'm going to do 8,000

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.670
I don't know if we can zoom in this is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.459
the way it says or open this way and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.080
close this way so what it will do that

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.230
I'm going to insert as this is straight

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.970
then I'm going to turn the round and the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.030
problem is it's hard to put your hands

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.480
inside so you close it this way open

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.030
that way so I'm going to go slowly see

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.830
my hand don't fit so I'll just have

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.920
to make sure so these are the two stock

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.630
bulbs we took it out to 4300 and now we

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:16.280
replace with the hid look at how

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.650
powerful bright blue light and this

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.450
moment is a really bright outside so you

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.650
probably don't see the difference but at

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.989
nighttime it will you know shows the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.500
difference so thank you for joining the

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.440
easy steps please I'll shoot any

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.260
questions and it's a really easy to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.200
change only the problem is it's hard to

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:45.049
you know figure out how to open it as I

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.299
show you on the knob at the center if

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.970
you turn around on the left side it's

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.060
open if you turn the right side it's

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.670
closes so then you pull it out and that

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.340
one you pull it out that is important

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.930
part there is two retainer Clips you

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.570
need to press little bit down then you turn

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.450
it up on a sideways then the clip opens

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.070
then they will releases the bulb

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.269
basically what it does I bring a

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.459
close there is a two retainer clip so

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.260
they sit right on top of the side edges

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.890
and that holds this bulb

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.530
in a place so that's a little and please

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.600
all let me know and if you like it if

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.180
