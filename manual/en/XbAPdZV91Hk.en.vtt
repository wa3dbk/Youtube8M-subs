00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.020
This video will walk you through pressurized transfers using your Chronical series fermenter.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.260
Transferring beer with CO2 is fast and efficient

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.000
but proper setup is and operation is critical for successful transfers and for safety

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.640
You'll need the following components

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240
to assemble your low pressure beer pushing system

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.960
a 1/4" NPT brass T fitting

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.740
a 1/4" NPT to 1/4" hose barb

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.920
a 1-1/2" tri-clamp to 1/4" male NPT fitting

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.660
a low pressure gauge

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.560
either digital or analog will work

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.780
about 4 feet of gas hose

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.900
and a couple worm clamps or oetiker clamps.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.700
It is important to note that you cannot

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.220
accurately determine the pushing pressure with

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.600
a gauge that has a 60psi maximum reading.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.020
Once you have all your components

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.980
wrap the male ends of your 1/4" fittings with teflon tape.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.820
Next, assemble the T by installing the hose barb,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.740
the tri-clamp fitting and your pressure gauge.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.420
Once your T with the low pressure gauge is assembled

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.140
we can get the hose ready to attach.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.200
On one end, we connected a barbed swivel nut.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.560
This will allow us to connect to our current 0 to 60 psi regulator

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.740
On the other end, we clamped our new T assembly with our low pressure gauge.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.240
This completes the build of our low pressure

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.120
beer pushing system.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.220
Next, we'll walk through installing and using it.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.180
Begin by taking the swivel nut end of the hose

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.140
and attaching it to your regulator.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.120
Once attached, turn on the CO2 and set the pressure

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.620
disconnected from your fermenter.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.180
With the CO2 line disconnected from the Chronical

00:02:02.534 --> 00:02:04.854
use your finger to plug the outlet.

00:02:04.854 --> 00:02:08.034
With the outlet plugged, carefully adjust the regulator

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.840
as close to 2psi as possible.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.080
Release some CO2 the replug it again.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.340
Do this several times to confirm the pressure gauge returns to 2psi.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.620
Please note that if you pressure the fermenter beyond 5psi

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.580
you will damage the unit

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.960
and possibly create an unsafe situation.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.400
When filming this video

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.274
we found that pushing beer at 1.3psi was plenty.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.680
