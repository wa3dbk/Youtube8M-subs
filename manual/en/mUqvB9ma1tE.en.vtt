00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:24.420
Kind of funny how this game is called Smashing
Planets, but you’re actually trying to prevent

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.420
that from happening.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.420
I mean, that’s almost like rain on your
wedding day.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.079
Someone call Alanis!

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.049
Just released to the App Store, Smashing Planets
comes from the British studio AppCrowd.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:44.469
They’ve actually done several games for
both iOS and Android devices,

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.769
and that development experience shows here.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.600
Smashing Planets is a polished little game
with solid gameplay and a slick look.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.460
And frankly, that makes my lukewarm reaction
to it all the more confusing.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.329
So the game puts you in charge of the safety
of planet Earth.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.940
All these crazy alien weapons and spacecraft
are attacking, but since our planet cannot

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.460
move—come on, just go with it, science nerds—you
have to make a stand.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.520
And you do that by firing a bunch of intergalactic
missiles...with your finger.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.560
Like I said, suspend your disbelief.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.710
Don’t be a dick about this.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.979
Now, you actually guide the missiles by drawing
a line.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.380
They follow said line, so you want to lead
them a little bit ahead of moving enemies.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.789
And speaking of which, those enemies can be
a real pain sometimes.

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.200
Some of them shove asteroids toward Earth,
some of them have force fields, some repel

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.140
your attacks with magnets...most of the enemies
require some kind of special approach to bring

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.140
down.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.719
Of course, the thing with all this is that...the
game deducts points at the end of each level

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.530
if you’ve shot too many missiles.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.009
So you’re encouraged to be accurate and
use fewer missiles, but that’s kind of tough

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.539
when you also have to be fast.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:15.150
If you’re not a maniac with your missiles,
your planet blows up before you know it.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.470
So it’s a really challenging game, and to
be honest, I just wasn’t all that into it.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.360
I do realize this is a solid game, there’s
nothing wrong with it at all...it just wasn’t

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360
for me.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.090
Maybe it’s because I’m also terrible at
it...I don’t know.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.909
Consider this a subjective criticism, but
I found Smashing Planets more frustrating

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:37.909
than enjoyable.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.810
Still, I’m inclined to think a lot of people
would disagree with me on this, because again...this

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.920
isn’t a bad game at all.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.610
Plus, it’s only 99 cents.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.629
So if you’re into defense games, Smashing
Planets is worth a look.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:03:07.030
Hopefully, you’re better at it than I am.
