00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.690
The video that you're about to watch contains
important information about your discharge.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.879
It also highlights questions that you may
want to discuss with the health care team

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.760
as they work with you towards planning your
discharge home.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.119
Susan: Hi Eileen.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.449
I'm really glad to hear that you're starting
to think about your discharge home from the

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.449
hospital.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.890
It's important that we talk about things ahead
of time so that you know what to expect, and

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.990
that will help you with your recovery when
you are at home.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990
Eileen: Hi Susan.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.560
Thanks for coming in to see me.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.200
I am a little scared about going home and
I would like to know what kinds of things

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.080
i need to worry about or ask.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.909
S: So, there are certain things that we really
need to talk about that you need to be

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:24.909
aware of.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.280
Things like who to call if you have any questions,
medications, pain control, signs and symptoms

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.630
of an infection, and there's also things that
you will and will be able to, or can and can’t

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.630
do
when you get home.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.630
E: Ok.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.789
What do you mean by can and can’t do?

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.200
S: Well, there may be some limitations to
activity, or you may need to change some lifestyle

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.450
things when you get home.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.130
Those changes may be just temporary as you
recover from the illness, or you may need

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.640
to make some permanent changes.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.080
Why don’t we go over everything one at a
time in more detail and then you can ask questions

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.459
as we go.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.369
Remember that at the most of the information
that we're going to discuss here is in the

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.099
information package that you received, either
during your pre-admission visit or from the

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:03.170
doctor's office.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.190
E: Okay, that's great.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.920
So, what kind of things do I need to know?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.519
S: Let's start with talking about why you
were in the hospital.

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.240
It's really important that you know exactly
why you were here, and if you had surgery,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.800
what the operation was that you had done.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.959
So, you and your family need talk about that.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.069
When you ask the health care team, if you
don't understand their explanation, please

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.599
ask repeated again and explain it differently.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.090
Sometimes, we tend to forget and use technical
terms, so it’s okay to remind us to speak

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.250
in plain English and simpler language.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.340
E: Okay, that makes sense.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.170
So, let's start with whatever you’d like
to start with.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.379
S: Okay, how about medications; they are really
important.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.629
You may have been started on some new medications
when you came into hospital here, or you may

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.959
well have been on medications before and we’ve
either changed or discontinued those medications.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.329
So, that’s important to talk about.

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.909
Ask your health care team whether or not the
medications you were on before should be continued

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.829
when you do get home, and certainly, if you
have any questions about your medications,

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.159
ask to speak
with our pharmacist.

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.409
They’ll come in, go over the medications
with you; what they’re for, possible side

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.129
effects… they’ll be able to give you written
information and that sort of thing.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.379
So, certainly ask.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.560
Do you know if you have any drug coverage?

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.889
E: I'm not too sure what you mean.

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.670
S: Well, certain people have drug coverage
through their benefits of work, and that covers

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.530
the cost of medications.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.530
Some people have private insurance for that,
or they may be under a government drug benefit

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.530
program.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.560
It’s important that if you're not sure if
you have drug coverage that you ask to speak

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.280
with a social worker before your discharge
from the hospital.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.840
E: Okay, what about pain medications?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.790
Because I've been taking a lot of that since
I’ve been here.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.790
S: Okay.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.790
That's really important as well.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.930
For anybody who's the started on pain medication.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.609
Pain control’s an extremely important part
of your recovery.

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.379
Certainly ask about your pain medication;
you can ask any of the health care team.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.709
The doctors, nurses and pharmacists will all
be able to explain your pain medication to

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.359
you - the possible side effects, the dosages,
and those types of things.

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.329
Remember, one of the main side-effect of pain
medication is constipation, so you need to

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.549
be aware of that and stay on top of that.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.919
When the doctors give you the prescriptions
for the pain medications, you may want to

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.430
get them filled at the pharmacy downstairs
here before you even leave the hospital.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.709
That way, you’ve got your meds ready to
go as soon as you get home.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.709
E: Okay.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.639
Is pain the only thing I need to worry about
when I go home?

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.639
S: Well, no.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.320
There are several other things that you need
to know about.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.100
What you need to be aware of will be aware
of will be determined by either the surgery

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.900
that you've had done or the illness that you
were hospitalized for.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.650
You need to ask the team what specific things
you need to be aware of.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.190
Let’s say you have been in for surgery:
we would ask you to monitor your incision

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.010
for signs and symptoms of an infection.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.190
So, you need to look for things like redness
at the incision, a sudden increase in swelling,

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.330
if there is any increase in the pain at the
incision, if there's any drainage of pus or

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.880
discharge coming out of it, that's really
important.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.139
You also need to be aware if you've got a
fever, you need to let us know that, and finally

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.930
if you start to cough up any yellow or green
mucus, that could be indicative that you're

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.180
starting with a respiratory infection we need
to know about that as well.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.270
Make sure you ask the health care team before
you leave the hospital what specific things

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.569
you need to keep an eye on when you get home.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.669
E: Okay, and how do I know if there's something
going on, and when should I start to be concerned?

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.349
S: Well, most people recover fairly easily
and smoothly and problems don't come up, but

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.190
it does important that you know who to contact
should a problem arise.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.889
Sometimes they'll ask you to contact the doctor's
office directly, so it's important that you

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.539
have that number.

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.650
Sometimes it'll be your family doctor, or
sometimes it would be, like myself, a nurse

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.690
practitioner that they would ask you to contact.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.840
It's important for you to ask you team who
they want you to contact in case there's a

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.699
problem, and that you know how to reach them.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:40.919
E: Okay.

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.910
I definitely hope that I don’t have any
emergencies or concerns when I go home, so

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.680
how do I avoid any complications from happening?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.289
S: That's an important thing to talk about
as well.

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.290
When you're ready to go home, there may be
certain limitations or restrictions to activities

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.290
when you go home.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.470
We talk about safety precautions; we want
you up and about as much as possible, but

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.240
there may be some limitations to that.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.479
You need to talk to the team about going back
to work.

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.210
Obviously depending on why you were in the
hospital is going to determine how quickly

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.139
you can go back to work.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.509
If you've got a really physical job - like
a construction worker, nurse, somebody doing

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.970
heavy lifting and that type of thing - and
you've had surgery, you're going to be off

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.520
work a lot longer than somebody who's got
a desk job.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.210
So, ask your doctors what limitations there
are to you.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.280
Remember that if you've had surgery and you've
got an incision, there are usually limitations

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.280
to lifting.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.699
We ask you not to lift anything heavier than
ten pounds for about four to six weeks after

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.270
surgery.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.910
We also don't want just pulling you're pushing
things, so no shoveling snow, mowing the lawn,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.470
those types of things.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.939
Now, remember that I said we want you up an
about as much as possible.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.470
So, going out to the store to do the grocery
shopping to really important, but we don't

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.660
want you pushing the heavy grocery cart or
to be the one who's carrying heavy grocery

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.110
bags back to the car.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.110
Okay?

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.113
Part 1 ends
