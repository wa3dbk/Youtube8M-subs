00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.570
[Karl:] Uuuuugh.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.290
Karl hates hangovers.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.730
Your head is poundin'.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.500
You're sick to your stomach.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.720
You spend all day either on the toilet

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.070
or in front of it.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.630
*gulp gulp*

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.660
Aaah.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.200
I'm a new man!

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.370
Lucky for you, I'm a certified hangover scientist
and I know my shit.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.980
So here's

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.440
During a hangover,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.810
your body is dangerously low 
on fried vitamins, or,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.970
that keep you sleepy,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.190
fat, and happy.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.440
So the first thing you gotta do 
is start inhaling that fried chicken,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.420
fried pizza,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.250
and twice fried french fry fried cake.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.880
Once the crispy brown coma kicks in,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.800
the fridamins get to work and start 
absorbing up all the alcohol in your system.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.820
Now that the fridamins are good and hammered,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.420
they party 'till they puke,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.290
which forces the fridamins out of your body

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.720
and you wake up good as new,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.210
covered in fried alcohol vomit
and ready to attack the day!

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.200
Wanna make that hangover feel better?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.640
Well then it's time to make your body feel worse.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.700
I know it sounds crazy,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.900
but stick with me here.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.410
Start off by eating a raw chicken out of a toilet.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.830
Then go run a half marathon,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.070
piss off a horse so he kicks you in the spine,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.530
throw in a Norwegian skin removal,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.210
and finally, get a root canal while 
watching a porno with your parents.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.330
That hangover doesn't 
seem so bad now, does it.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.460
You're welcome.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.790
Here's a rapid-fire blast of 
hangover cures from around the world!

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.420
Chug a gallon of maple syrup and 
get cross-checked by a moose!

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.070
Eat sixty pounds of sushi,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.810
wash it down with godzilla piss.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.810
Mix snowman blood and penguin farts 
together to warm you right up.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.540
And finally,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.430
... I dunno. 
Just sit on the beach and stare at thongs all day.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.640
That one's pretty easy.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.480
Sure these tips'll get you back on your feet.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.040
But nothin' beats hair o' the dog!

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.400
Hehah hah hah.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.820
I'm drunk.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.770
Karl's bonus lesson... thing!

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.250
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.840
Unless that trick is poopin' in your friend's bed.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.640
Old dogs are pretty good at that.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.530
Tweet your questions at ASKKFK,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.380
and I'll answer the hell out of it.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.460
Or just ignore it.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.900
It's question time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.610
You an' me spend all night poundin' Insano sauce,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.320
and now you wake up the next morning 
feelin' like microwaved donkey shit.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.830
So how do you cure a hangover?
