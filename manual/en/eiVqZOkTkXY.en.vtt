00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.180
Congratulations,
This is your week

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.280
You are off to great learnings
And enjoy the thrill of speed

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.380
You have skills in your hands
You have knowledge in your brain

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.200
You have energy for hundreds
Everything you do, is a gain

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.600
You are part of a team.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.230
And you all know what you can do
The Sky is the limit with this team of the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.119
others and you
You have looked left and right, for a challenge,

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.660
not a fight
Although to some you have said: we don't think

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.660
you are right!

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.710
With your skills in your hands and knowledge
in your brain

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.170
You are so madly enthusiastic, you need a
special game

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.989
Formula Student Germany or FSG they call it
That competition that hit you like a bullet

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.239
The FSG that is like open space
And it has the thrill of the closest race

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.839
You decided to join this world and accept
No pain no gain

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.420
as its underlying concept
And you start to imagine the unimaginable

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.180
To build and drive you own race vehicle
In hours and hours of sleepless nights

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.270
against many and difficult strikes
with your hands and brains you did succeed

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.190
You created something made of Speed
It has four wheels and it makes your heart

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.250
beat high
You love it, you name it, it gives you pride

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.440
Now you come here to prove and show
What kind of team you are, what all you know

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.190
The Scrutineers drive you crazy
Never ever they are lazy

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.050
To pass Tech Inspection is a victory as such
The stickers give your darling its final touch

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.670
But some of the beauties do not get those
That sentence makes tears run down your nose.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.740
The ones who have are ready to run
To perform and have all the fun

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.930
The presentation design and cost
Every single one hurts - of the points you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.890
lost
You are exhausted and wet

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.500
You still are to drive Skid Pad yet!

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.000
Then you look carefully left and right
And see all others continue to fight

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.940
You do what you do and stir up the team
And live your own personal dream

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.310
Acceleration is suddenly done
In the spirit of Formula One

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.840
You pushed the pedal
Right to the metal

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.170
Autocross you passed
Now Endurance comes up fast

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.730
Sunday is terror
Only the slightest error

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.790
Before or after the start
Might ruin your dream

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.329
And cost the team
All it had worked for so hard

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:28.689
To finish first you need to finish first
Once you do, you scream, you burst

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.689
This is it.

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.959
The moment of pure ecstasy
It is better than your wildest fantasy

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.970
Besides the high there is the low
Fastest lap times and then -Nnnooo

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.180
Perfect devastation
In this situation

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.239
But why?

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.730
In the end you gave all you can
under the German Autobahn

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.980
You did hardly rest and sleep
The rings under the eyes are deep

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.590
But now it is done
Award ceremony is on

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.959
You might take home the cup
More likely not, - but no matter what

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:10.859
You - all of you are winners
of hearts, of friends, of experience

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.540
This was your week This was your start
Now lets celebrate before we part
