Howdy folks how's it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen today's video is a cross-breed between

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:14.600
candy corn and battenberg cake - ooh.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.080
Looks really good right and you can probably
hear i'm not very well i'm actually dosed

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.680
up with drugs so probably really shouldn't
be doing a video but anyhow I had this idea

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.410
of merging together two things - candy corn
which i've never heard of before but is so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.852
popular in America and battenberg which is
a traditional British cake so thought I would

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:37.190
fuse them together to make a candy corn style
battenbery, um i'm not gonna talk anymore

00:00:37.190 --> 00:01:56.060
so this is how I did it and I hop you give
it 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.470
a go.
