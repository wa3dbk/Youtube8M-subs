00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.280
On Christmas Eve. Many years ago

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.660
I laid quietly in my bed.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.980
I did not rustle the sheets.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.660
I was listening for a sound.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.420
A sound I was afraid I'd never hear.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420
Well, are you coming?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.840
Where?

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.960
Why, to the North Pole. Of course!

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.280
This is the Polar Express!

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.520
[Music]

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.020
All aboard!
