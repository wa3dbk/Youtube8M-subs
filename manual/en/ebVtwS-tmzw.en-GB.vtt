00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.720
Hello, there we are again

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.840
Today, we will be talking about the functioning of the eye

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.760
Robert, what are you doing? We’re trying to make a movie here

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.200
Oh, sorry! I just think it’s so interesting to see how the image changes when the focus is near or distant

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.540
Hey, but seriously, this is quite interesting!

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.020
I already know the anatomy of the eye, but how come you can focus at something far away, or something close, but never at the same time?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.440
 Oh, that is called accommodation! I will explain it; it’s quite easy.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.720
I told you that it was interesting!

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.920
Ok boys and girls, so this video is actually about accommodation, I will be explaining it to you

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.580
But first, we will look at parts of the eye

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.380
You can see the outside of the eye here

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.660
With the eyebrows and lashes that protect us from dust and dirt

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.680
The sclera, the beautifully coloured iris, and the pupil are also visible

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.020
These parts are definitely really important,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.680
but for knowing more about maintaining a clear focus on an object, we will need to have a closer look at the eye

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.860
This is a schematic diagram of a cross section of the eye

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.040
The extra ocular muscles that are depicted above and under the eye facilitate eye movement

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.860
Furthermore, from the outside to the inside we see the sclera, 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.020
the cornea,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580
the choroid,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.620
and the retina.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.660
The retina is a light sensitive layer of the eye.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.200
We see the vitreous humour,  

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.320
the optic nerve,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.960
 the iris

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.740
and the pupil. 

00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:04.033
For being able to focus, the front of the eye is of big importance.  

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.260
The lens actually has to be made rounder, or flatter.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:19.520
This happens because the ciliary body, the lens, and the zonules work together.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.120
The ciliary body is joined to the choroid and is strongly connected to the sclera.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.520
The ciliary muscle is located inside the ciliary body. 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.000
This muscle can be tensioned or relaxed.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.720
Look, this is a model of the parts of the eye that take care of accommodation.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.400
The lens is in the middle. 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.140
The lens is connected to the ciliary body by the zonules. 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.460
Originally, the lens has a convec shape.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.000
Let’s first focus on an image in the distance. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.440
Looking at something in the distance? Let’s think..

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.340
I learned that in that case, you need a flat lens.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.800
That’s completely right!

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.860
For example, if you focus on the active board at school, the ciliary body relaxes. 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.600
This makes that it automatically goes back to its original shape.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.240
In this shape, the ciliary muscle in the ciliary body is thin and not contracted.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.260
I see! The lens is pulled flat by the zonules, 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.120
so the muscles in the ciliary body are relaxed, which causes tension on the zonules.  

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.060
That’s clear! Now, for looking at something that’s close

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.000
If you want to look at something that’s close, your eyes have to put in more effort

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.400
The lens has to be made round

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.380
The muscles in the ciliary body contract,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.640
this relieves the tension on the zonules.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.960
The lens takes its natural shape.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:58.800
Let me think. So when I’m reading, the ciliary body has to constantly be tense?

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.280
Indeed! Far vision doesn’t cost energy, because the muscles are relaxed.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.020
Near vision costs a lot of energy, because the muscles are tense al the time. Get it?

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.600
Yes, that wasn’t that hard at all!

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.540
You know what? We will show the animation one more time.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.280
Thanks for the clear explanation ladies, now watch it!
