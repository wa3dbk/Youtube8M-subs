I am Carl Shepard, professional bass instructor
and here I am going to explain some reasons

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.450
behind different techniques. Slapping is something
that is kind of percussive and when you do

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.060
that in addition to having a drummer with
you, you can add to a percussive field, lot

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:28.360
of disco songs use slapping. There are different
funk bands that use it and really when you

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:37.520
switch from just using your fingers to using
your thumb, it gives you more of a presence

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:47.320
and more of a treble gain to the notes. There
are things you can do with you fingers that

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.950
you can’t do with your thumb however and
a lot of that comes with grooving with your

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.780
drummer and being able to find places where
you can mute and use the mute technique to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:12.399
really start to add to what the drummer is
doing. The slap and plucking sound can be

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:18.680
mimicked as a bass hit and a snare hit, so
when your drummer is using the bass the kick

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.439
drum, you know you want to slap on that and
then pluck where the snare is coming in, a

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:33.409
lot other things you can do with picking come
with mute.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:46.560
You can get a sound in there that almost mimics
the bass drum, so in between notes you can

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.219
use a little bit of mute to get more of a
groove and help the drummer out and he’ll

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.200
be feeling you better too.
