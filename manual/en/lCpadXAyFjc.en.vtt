00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.169
Hi this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:10.150
On today's episode let's take a look at how
to control your Mac using only your keyboard.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.320
So if you prefer using your keyboard as much
as possible and your mouse as little as possible

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.789
well there is a lot you can do with your Mac
if you know the proper key combinations.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.720
The first thing you want to do is to go to
System Preferences and under system preferences

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.089
go to Keyboard.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:29.300
Then make sure you have this checked (Use
all F1, F2, etc) as standard function keys.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.190
If you don't have it checked that means that
they will be used for things such as playing

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.050
on iTunes, volume control, brightness control
and things like that.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.550
You have to press the fn key to do the opposite.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.810
To make things simpler here you want to have
that checked so that pressing F1 means pressing

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.789
F1 not lowering the brightness.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.310
Now once we have that we go over to Keyboard
shortcuts.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.629
Here is a bunch of different categories.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.151
But we are going to look today in the Keyboard
and Text Input category.

00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:55.609
You can see there is lots of cool things here.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.219
These are all the defaults.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.710
Yours may be different if you changed them.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.570
So it is important to check what yours is
so you can see before you try some of these

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.570
out.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.100
So for instance one of the ones here is to
Move focus to the Menu Bar.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.780
You can see this is "Control" F2 not command
key Not the key with the apple on it but Control.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.430
So you want to go and hit Control and F2 and
you can see now that the Apple Menu got highlighted

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.680
on the top left hand corner.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.520
I can use my arrow keys now to move through
the menus and if I want the down arrow to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.310
move down in there and hit the space or return
to actually activate something.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.180
So for instance we can go under About System
Preferences, go down here, I'll hit return

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.130
and I'll get the About System Preferences
box.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.380
So that is how you navigate to the Menu Bar
with just the keyboard and activate a menu

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.380
there.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.380
You can do the same thing with the Dock.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.990
You can see here we've got Move focus to the
Dock with "Control" and F3.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.649
This brings up the Dock and I can use the
arrows to move left to right and even the

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.740
up arrow to move up and see what's available
there.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.842
In this case Recent Documents, all sorts of
things, and I can navigate using the arrow

00:02:07.842 --> 00:02:09.600
keys and actually select something.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.950
So if I wanted to open up a document I could.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.870
So you can see here we've got some other ones.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.100
"Control" F4 to Move to the next window.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.601
So you can move through all the different
windows through all the apps using Control

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:21.870
F4.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.080
Then if you wanted to go and use something
in the Toolbar of a window you can use "Control"

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.080
F5.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.960
For instance let's do Control F4 and move
to a next window which is a finder window

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.960
here.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.300
We do Control F5 and we can see that now the
Back button at the top there has a highlight

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.280
and I can actually activate by hitting the
spacebar or move down arrow to actually activate

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.230
what is on that menu.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.760
Now this is less than perfect because if I
go to the right I can't.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.360
The next item there, the forward button, is
inactive and for some reason doesn't let you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.890
go forward anymore.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.502
If I go back there, now I have both forward
and back button, so I can do Control F5 and

00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:08.340
I can move between those back and forth.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.410
So it is just going to allow me to do those.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.700
I won't allow me to do the other items here
at the top of the screen unfortunately.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.920
You have tons of other keyboard shortcuts
that are included in here and the keyboard

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.920
shortcuts in Menus.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.280
So it is important to know those if you are
going to control everything.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.310
For instance if you go to the Finder here
you can use the Go menu and you can see there

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.110
are tons of keyboard shortcuts here for going
quickly to different folders.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.160
For instance the Download folder, the Desktop
folder.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.750
So if you are on all those it is much easier
to get around with than to just actually always

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.700
going to the menu or the Dock.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.000
So one of the things that a lot of people
find surprising is to do Control F4 to get

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.100
all the way to the Safari window here.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.900
In Safari, of course, there is a lot of keyboard
shortcuts here at the top that you can get

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.900
to know.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.980
But a lot of people don't realize some very
simple things.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.811
For instance right here without any modification
I can choose the up and down arrow keys to

00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:01.290
actually scroll through this page.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.690
It is very easy to scroll through a webpage.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.260
Sometimes easier than using the mouse especially
since the scroll bar isn't always there.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.720
It is only there when you are actually actively
scrolling.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.740
Sometimes it is hard to grab onto.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.730
One final setting to look at is the setting
that is here where you can change how keyboard

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.730
access works.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.250
Either to only go to Text boxes and lists
only or to All controls.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.770
You can see "Control" F7 will actually let
you change that.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.130
It is the first item up here.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:36.680
For instance, let's go to the Finder here
and in the Finder I will use Control F5 and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.820
I will go back and forth you can see between
selecting something in the Finder here and

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.210
Control F5 will then go up to the search bar.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.040
If I go into Control F7 to change how that
works I now find that Control F5 goes between

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.280
the Tool Bar at the top and the items there
in the window.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.520
Now the last part is a little tricky.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.290
You will find that different apps work differently
depending upon whether you have Control F7

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.330
turned on or off and what other types of controls
you are trying to use.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.930
So try it out with your favorite apps.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.000
Try it out with that turned on and that turned
off and see exactly how it works.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.720
After a while you will get used to having
your favorite apps work with these keyboard

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.790
commands if you decide you want to use them.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.710
Hope you found this useful.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:40.830
