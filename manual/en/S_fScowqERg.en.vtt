00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.591
Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
this is my breakdown of Eibach's Pro System

00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:10.120
Plus suspension kit, fitting all 2005-2010
Mustang GTs.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.669
If you've been modifying cars for any duration
of time, then you're probably familiar with

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.669
the name Eibach.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.920
Eibach is without a doubt one of the biggest
and trusted names in aftermarket suspension,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.019
outfitting everything from F1 and NASCAR,
to the daily driven Mustang sitting in your

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.019
driveway.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.300
The Pro system Plus is Eibach's total package
for a complete and better handling, more responsive

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.090
car, with an improved stance to top it all
off.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.620
As you can see this package does include a
few different components, so let's check them

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.620
out.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.770
The Pro System Plus is built around Eibach's
Pro kit springs and pro damper shocks and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.770
struts.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.970
These impressive rate springs will lower the
car a slightly conservative 1.3" up front,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.290
and 1.5" in the rear.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.300
Of course if you're looking for a bigger drop
then you might want to check out Eibach's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.640
sport system plus, which is essentially the
same kit I have here but offers a larger drop

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.360
thanks to different springs.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.670
Of course any time you lower the car, you're
not only lowering your center of gravity,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.780
but you're also improving that stance thanks
to eliminating some of that wheel gap.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.810
These are not some generic off the shelf dampers
here either.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.790
The Pro System dampers have been setup specifically
to compliment the pro kit springs, basically

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.490
what this means is these dampers have been
valved or tuned to perform at their best with

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.330
the stiffer spring rates whilst still maintaining
an excellent ride quality.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.460
The second player in the pro system is the
addition of Eibach's anti roll sway bar kit,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.170
this kit consists of Eibach's 3 way adjustable
35mm front bar, and a solid 22mm rear bar.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.530
If you didn't already know, sway bars are
without a doubt one of the biggest tools in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.170
reducing your cars body roll, and improving
turning response, ultimately making your car

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.720
more predictable when pushed to the limits,
and even with something as simple as a high

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.930
speed lane change.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.030
To tie everything together, Eibach has included
some very nice quality hardware.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.990
We're looking at high performance polyurethane
bushings all around, including grease fittings

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.159
for the bushings at the sway bar, which is
going to keep the noise level down and ultimately

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.180
prolong the life of the bushings themselves.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.921
Finally, Eibach has included some solid Billet
M links, which is a huge improvement over

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:10.921
the factory links.

00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:15.489
Since you are replacing a good part of your
cars suspension, be ready to set aside a full

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.599
day in the garage to tackle this install.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.040
And keep in mind whenever you tweak this much
of your cars suspension, you may end up throwing

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.709
your alignment out of whack, so you notice
anything out of the ordinary on your test

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.870
drive after the install, don't hesitate to
give your local alignment shop a call, just

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.620
to get everything checked out.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.590
So that wraps up our break down of Eibach's
Pro System Plus for your GT, to recap the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.810
kit you can expect a huge change in the everyday
handling and drivability of your car, thanks

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.010
to all the different components used for this
kit.
