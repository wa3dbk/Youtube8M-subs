&gt;&gt; CLANCY TERRILL AND HIS

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.467
FRIEND, RICHARD BURRAGE,...

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:08.266
&gt;&gt; NOT FINDING ANY?

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.734
&gt;&gt; ...ARE CHASING CATS--

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:10.533
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.800
&gt;&gt; CATFISH, THAT IS.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.233
ALL AROUND LAKE BUCHANAN.

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:16.767
(crickets chirping)

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:17.834
THOUGH THEIR DAY BEGAN

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:18.800
AWFULLY EARLY...

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.233
&gt;&gt; WATCH YOUR HEAD.

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.166
&gt;&gt; ...IT ALSO STARTED SLOWLY.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.800
&gt;&gt; C'MON FISH.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.533
&gt;&gt; THERE HAS BEEN A

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.467
BITE OR TWO.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:28.367
&gt;&gt; THERE HE IS.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.467
&gt;&gt; AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:30.800
GOOD-NATURED RIBBING...

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.066
&gt;&gt; YOU JERKED IT LIKE A GIRL!

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.166
&gt;&gt; NO!

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.133
&gt;&gt; ...BUT SO FAR THERE

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.433
HAVEN'T BEEN MANY CATFISH.

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:37.700
&gt;&gt; HE'S TALKING TO YOU.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.600
&gt;&gt; NICE LITTLE BLUE.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.667
SEE HOW PRETTY THEY ARE?

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.133
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE BIG ONES

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.133
THAT CLANCY IS KNOWN

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.967

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:47.233
&gt;&gt; I GUIDE FOR TROPHY CATFISH.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.100

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.800
&gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.233

&gt;&gt; ANCHORS AWEIGH.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.567

CLANCY AND RICHARD SERVE UP A

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.934
VARIETY OF SMELLY BAITS.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:00.066
&gt;&gt; MY WIFE SAYS I CAN TELL

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.066
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN CATFISHING.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.467
(chuckles)

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:04.400
(reel whirring)

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.133
&gt;&gt; ALRIGHT. THERE'S ONE.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.633

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:11.734
&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S A STRIPER.

&gt;&gt; CLANCY GUIDES FOR

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.200
STRIPED BASS AS WELL.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.667
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD, RICHARD.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:17.734
THAT'S ABOUT A THREE TO

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.133
FOUR YEAR STRIPER.

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.166
IF YOU CAN GET THE STRIPERS

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.166
OUT OF YOUR WAY, YOU'LL

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.500
PROBABLY CATCH SOME CATFISH.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.300
&gt;&gt; CATFISH ARE GOING TO BE NEXT.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.400
&gt;&gt; GET HIM, RICHARD.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.934
&gt;&gt; WITH SOME PERSISTENCE,

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:30.367
CLANCY AND RICHARD FIND WHAT

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:31.633
THEY'VE BEEN FISHING FOR.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.000
&gt;&gt; CATFISH!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.400

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:37.767
(music)

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:38.734
&gt;&gt; WOOHOO!

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:39.567
IT AIN'T BIG FISH,

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.567
BUT IT'S SOMETHING.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.033
&gt;&gt; AND THEY'LL BE BACK TO CATCH

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:46.934
THE BIG ONE ANOTHER DAY.

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:51.133
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST A LOT OF FUN.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.934
&gt;&gt; ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A BIG ONE.

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:56.967
&gt;&gt; WHILE SOME FOLKS JUST

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.066
ENJOY CATCHING CATFISH,

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.367
OTHERS WILL LITERALLY

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:01.767
LINE UP TO EAT THEM.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:02.633
&gt;&gt; WE GOT THE CATFISH.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:03.433
I THINK IT'S WORTH THE WAIT.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:06.300
LET'S SEE...

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.333

&gt;&gt; MMMM. THAT'S GOOD.

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:16.800

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:18.266
&gt;&gt; ONE WEEKEND EACH FALL,

&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW, WELL YOU KNOW,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.734
CATFISH IS A YEAR-ROUND THING.

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:46.066
&gt;&gt; THE FESTIVAL IS ALSO A

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.200
CHANCE FOR LOCAL FISHING

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.700
GUIDES, LIKE CARL BOSTICK,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.867
TO MEET A FEW NEW CUSTOMERS,

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:54.500
AND SHOW OFF SOME LAKE

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.100
CONROE CATFISH.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.834
&gt;&gt; WE GET ASKED EVERY YEAR TO

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:57.934
COME IN AND BRING SOME FISH

00:02:57.934 --> 00:02:59.567
AND THE KIDS LOVE IT.

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:00.567
YOU CAN'T KEEP THEIR HANDS OUT

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:01.967
OF THE WATER WHERE THE FISH ARE.

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.567
&gt;&gt; WHOA!

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.567
THAT SCARED ME...

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.834
&gt;&gt; SOON AFTER THE FESTIVAL,

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:12.300
CARL IS BACK ON LAKE CONROE...

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.066
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S THE BEST

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.533
CATFISH LAKE IN THE STATE.

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:15.600
&gt;&gt; ...NOT WITH CLIENTS

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.166
BUT WITH FRIENDS.

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:17.800
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I DO ON

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.066
MY DAYS OFF.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:20.066
&gt;&gt; THE TWO BOATS ARE OUT FOR

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.500
AN EVENING OF JUG FISHING.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.600
&gt;&gt; JUGGING, YOU'RE INCREASING

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.800
YOUR ODDS A WHOLE LOT BECAUSE

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.033
YOU CAN PUT UP TO FIVE HOOKS

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.567
ON A JUG, AND, DEPENDING ON

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:28.600
HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE OUT

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.767
THERE, YOU COULD HAVE HUNDREDS

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:32.000
OF HOOKS WORK AN AREA.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.700
&gt;&gt; FISH IT.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.734
&gt;&gt; THE GPS IS REALLY NICE;

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.066
GREAT LITTLE TOOL FOR US TO

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:41.166
TRACK WHERE WE PUT THEM,

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:44.233
AND FIND EACH JUG.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:46.033
&gt;&gt; EVEN THE JUGS THEMSELVES

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:47.600
HAVE GONE HIGH TECH.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.433
&gt;&gt; THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:50.033
FLAGGING JUGS.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.200
WHENEVER A FISH PULLS ON THE

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.467
LINE, HE'LL SLIDE THE

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.433
COUNTER-WEIGHT TO THE BOTTOM,

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:56.433
AND THEN WE KNOW IT HAS A FISH

00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:58.400
ON IT OR SOMETHING'S HIT IT.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.867
&gt;&gt; TOSS IT, STEVEN.

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:00.834
&gt;&gt; BY THE TIME THE BOATS HAVE

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:01.867
ANCHORED ALL THEIR HOOKS

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.233
IN THE WATER...

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:04.400
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL OF THEM.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400
&gt;&gt; SOME OF THE JUGS HAVE

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.834
ALREADY FLAGGED.

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:10.000
&gt;&gt; THERE'S ONE BACK TO OUR LEFT.

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:14.133
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE'S ON HERE.

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:14.934
&gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO.

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.066
&gt;&gt; NICE LITTLE BLUE CAT.

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:17.967
&gt;&gt; CATFISH ARE CAUGHT...

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:19.533
HOOKS ARE RE-BAITED...

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:20.567
&gt;&gt; FISH IT.

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.767
&gt;&gt; ...AND JUGS ARE RETURNED.

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:23.834
THE CIRCUIT CONTINUES

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:25.367
NON-STOP.

00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:27.000
AND AS NIGHT FALLS,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.166
THE ICE CHEST FILLS.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:40.333
(music)

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:40.967
&gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:41.767
FISH HAUL, JUGGING'S A

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:43.066
WAY OF DOING IT.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:44.166
&gt;&gt; JUGGING IS ALSO A GOOD

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:46.900
WAY TO FIND THE BIG CATS.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.767
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE HAVE A DECENT

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:51.333
FISH COMING UP HERE.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:52.900
&gt;&gt; PULLING IN A LARGE CATFISH

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.166
CAN REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:55.633
OF TEAMWORK.

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:56.600
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT ABOUT A

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.433
20-POUNDER, COMING UP.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.500
THAT'S IT.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.667
(man struggles and groans)

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:08.166
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST FUN TO COME OUT

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:09.100
AND SEE HOW MANY OF THE BIG

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.433
ONES YOU CAN CATCH.

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:11.166
&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH DOES HE WEIGH,

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:12.467
GEORGE?

00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:14.333
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.400
&gt;&gt; WE REALLY ENJOY IT.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400
&gt;&gt; THE THRILL OF CATCHING

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.667
A TROPHY FISH...

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.934
DOES NOT REQUIRE KEEPING IT.

00:05:22.934 --> 00:05:25.333
&gt;&gt; 26-4.

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:26.266
&gt;&gt; TAKE A PICTURE OF HIM

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:28.100
AND TURN HIM LOOSE.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.433
LET HIM GROW.

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:30.300
MAYBE NEXT YEAR HE'LL

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.867
WEIGH FIVE MORE POUNDS.

00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:33.600
&gt;&gt; SO MORRIS, WAYNE AND GEORGE

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.734
HAVE THEIR OWN POLICY

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:35.967
REGARDING THESE BIG

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:39.300
AND MOST-PRODUCTIVE FISH.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.867
&gt;&gt; THEY KEEP ONLY A PHOTO...

00:05:40.867 --> 00:05:42.600
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.734
(straining and laughter)

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:45.800
&gt;&gt; AND THEY KEEP A

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.934
GOOD STORY, TOO.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.734
&gt;&gt; WELL THAT'S A GOOD START

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:54.567
FOR THE EVENING.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:57.433
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:57.433 --> 00:05:58.600
&gt;&gt; INCREASING INTEREST IN

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.400
CATCHING CATFISH IN LARGE

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.834
NUMBERS OR SIZES HAS ALSO

00:06:02.834 --> 00:06:04.433
INCREASED THE NEED FOR

00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:06.333
STUDYING CATFISH.

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:07.233
&gt;&gt; AS THE INTERESTS CHANGE,

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:08.100
OBVIOUSLY THE MANAGEMENT

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.100
HAS TO CHANGE.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.066
&gt;&gt; C'MON FISHIES.

00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:12.533
&gt;&gt; NEARBY ON LAKE LIVINGSTON,

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:13.667
BIOLOGISTS ARE LEARNING

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:15.533
HOW TO MEASURE POPULATIONS

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:17.567
OF CATFISH SPECIES,

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:18.333
MORE ACCURATELY.

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:19.066
&gt;&gt; IT DOES GET

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:20.166
FAIRLY FAST-PACED.

00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:20.967
I'VE FREQUENTLY HEARD IT

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:22.400
REFERRED TO AS A RODEO

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.100
KIND OF COLLECTION.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.633
&gt;&gt; UP FRONT, FRONT RIGHT, DAVE.

00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:26.633
&gt;&gt; IF YOU PUMP ELECTRICITY

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:27.467
INTO THE WATER,

00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:28.900
IT ENDS UP STUNNING FISH.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.600
THIS HAS BEEN KNOWN

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.467
FOR A LONG TIME,

00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:31.867
POACHERS DID IT IN THE PAST.

00:06:31.867 --> 00:06:33.200
WE CAN DO IT LEGALLY,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.400
WHEREAS OTHERS CAN'T.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.600
IT'S A VERY EFFICIENT METHOD.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.934
WE NEEDED THOUSANDS OF FISH TO

00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:39.734
BE COLLECTED, TAGGED,

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:40.967
AND THEN RELEASED TO GET THE

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:43.333
ANSWERS WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:44.667
&gt;&gt; THREE NINETY-NINE.

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:45.600
&gt;&gt; GOT IT.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.000
&gt;&gt; THE MARKING WAS SPECIFIC TO

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.433
CERTAIN FIN CLIP COMBINATIONS,

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:49.667
SO WHEN WE RECAPTURED THE FISH

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:50.567
WE COULD TELL WHERE THAT

00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:51.900
FISH CAME FROM.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.767
A FEW FISH WERE KEPT FOR

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.333
SOME OTHER SAMPLES, FOR AGING

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:55.367
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:56.400
&gt;&gt; SEVEN NINETY-EIGHT.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.367
&gt;&gt; ULTIMATELY STANDARD

00:06:57.367 --> 00:06:58.266
SAMPLING PROTOCOLS WILL

00:06:58.266 --> 00:07:01.767
BE DEVELOPED FROM THAT.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.266
&gt;&gt; AS BIOLOGISTS GET A BETTER

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:05.333
PICTURE OF CATFISH POPULATIONS

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:07.133
IN RESERVOIRS AND RIVERS,

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.633
THEY CAN BETTER KEEP CATFISH

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:11.834
HEALTHY, AND ANGLERS HAPPY.

00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:12.900
&gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU WANT TO TAKE

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.000
SOME FISH HOME TO EAT

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.834
OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO TRY

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.500
AND CATCH A TROPHY,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.734
THAT'S KIND OF THE GOAL IN ALL

00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:18.934
OF IT IS TO MAKE SURE THOSE

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:20.033
OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE FOR

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:22.800
EVERYONE, ACROSS THE STATE.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.600
&gt;&gt; MINE'S BIGGER.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.467
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, MINE'S BIGGER.

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:25.600
&gt;&gt; THAT MEANS CARL AND HIS

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.567
FRIENDS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE

00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:29.133
TO GO FISHING FOR CATS.

00:07:29.133 --> 00:07:29.967
&gt;&gt; WE GOT US A CAT FIGHT

00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:32.166
GOING ON!

00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:33.000
&gt;&gt; IF I CAN BE ON THIS WATER,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.934
I'M GONNA BE ON THIS WATER,

00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:35.033
WHETHER IT'S A JOB OR NOT,

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:36.233
I'M GONNA BE FISHING.

00:07:36.233 --> 00:07:37.300
&gt;&gt; OOOH BOY.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.900
YOU GOT ANOTHER NICE ONE.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.333
&gt;&gt; WHETHER ON A HOOK...

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:43.667
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT OF A WORKOUT.

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:44.700
&gt;&gt; ON THE MENU,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.166
OR ON THEIR OWN.

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:47.233
THERE IS JUST SOMETHING

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.133
FUN ABOUT CATFISH.

00:07:49.133 --> 00:07:49.800
&gt;&gt; I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.700
CATFISHERMAN.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.633
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY WE'RE

00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:52.700
A BREED OF OUR OWN,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.867
AND EVERYBODY HAS THEIR

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:54.700
FAVORITES, BUT ON THIS LAKE

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.500
THAT WOULD BE MINE.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.233
&gt;&gt; HE'S NOT VERY HAPPY

00:07:56.233 --> 00:07:58.633
ABOUT ALL THIS.

00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:01.300
&gt;&gt; THIRTY-FIVE?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.233
THAT'S A PRETTY ONE.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.233
OKAY.

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:07.400
&gt;&gt; I LOVE IT.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.367
