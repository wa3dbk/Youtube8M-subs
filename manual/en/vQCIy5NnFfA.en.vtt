00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:23.360
Well, it's a twin-stick shooter with no sticks
and, at times, it runs at about five frames

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.710
a second.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.610
You can reach your own conclusions about that.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.800
I'm just throwing it out there.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.100
It's Loaded for the original PlayStation.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.820
So this is a game from the mid-nineties, and
you can tell.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.719
Not only in terms of the graphics and controls,
but...just in the way it revels in violence.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.409
See, back then, this whole notion of violent
video games was kind of a new thing.

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.280
There'd never been anything like Mortal Kombat,
anything so unabashedly gory.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.000
And so in its wake, lots of games did the
same thing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.980
Loaded is obviously one of those games.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:23.250
The thing is, though, it's also not a very
good game.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.180
I mean, Loaded certainly has its moments,
thanks to some surprisingly solid gameplay...but

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.140
the rest of the game doesn't fare quite as
well.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.430
As a result...when you play it, it feels even
more dated.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.390
Because you get that mid-nineties gore obsession,
along with lots of the bad parts of mid-nineties

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.390
game design.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.180
Things like, "Wait, light?

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.290
What do mean light?"

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.770
"It's the nineties, man!

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.080
We don't need no stinking light."

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:59.860
So let's start there, with visibility.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.050
Because there f*cking isn't any, in Loaded.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.730
It's the same as driving down the road in
the winter time, but only scraping, like...half

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.730
the ice off your window.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.780
I know what you're thinking.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.590
"Oh, it's just gonna melt off, anyway."

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.800
But oh, then you crash into a little old lady
on her way to buy moth balls.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.510
Only you're the little old lady, Loaded is
the car...and the moth balls are irrelevant.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.329
Forget the goddamn moth balls.

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:34.569
Alright, so maybe it's not literally as bad
as being hit by car.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.890
The point is, there's too much wrong with
this game to enjoy the right.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.719
And to be fair, the biggest problem is one
you can't really blame on the game.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.850
It's the fact that Loaded is a top-down shooter...you
play with a d-pad.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.750
That just sounds problematic.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.750
Turns out it is.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.810
And I mean, the game does what it can with
it, but...it's really just a bad setup from

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.139
the get go.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.319
So you have to press a button to shoot, and
you always shoot forward, so...you're aiming

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.980
and walking simultaneously.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.010
In four directions.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.139
See the problem?

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.950
It's never as simple as, "Aim at the bad guys."

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.150
There are times you just can't aim at the
bad guys without moving into position.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.659
And when those bad guys are this fast?

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.250
Problems on top of...moth balls.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.400
Now, I will say this.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.209
These kinds of top-down shooters are inherently
fun.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.480
So there's definitely some redeeming qualities
to Loaded.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.400
I mean, it looks awful, but...it has some
fun themes.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.099
Psychopaths tied up in straightjackets burst
from rubber rooms and try to head-butt you

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.599
to death; you can into these sewers that are
just crawling with these monsters...I mean,

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.230
the gameplay and levels are be repetitive,
but the themes are interesting enough.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:57.849
And of course, there's local multiplayer,
which is always great.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.269
Loaded is one of those games that's really
a victim of its own age.

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.680
A lot of games from this time period have
aged well, but this is not one of them.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.980
It can be fun in short bursts, but anything
more than that...and Loaded starts firing

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980
blanks.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.799
Big thanks to our friend Thor from Birmingham,
England—the birthplace of heavy metal—for

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:16.889
sending it in.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.500
Actually, if you play this while listening
to Black Sabbath, it's a lot better.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.240
Then again, so are most things.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.080
War Pigs, Luke's Moth Balls.
