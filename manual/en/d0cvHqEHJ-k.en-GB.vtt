00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.110
It's always been a part of me. I started very
young and there was no question whether I

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:07.110
wanted to something else. I stayed in Kosovo
during the war but we moved to my aunt's because

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.690
my house wasn't safe. My dad made an effort
and would take me home every day just to practice

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.649
a bit. There was always a piece that I wanted
to learn and it was always more difficult

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:28.070
than I could play at the time. So it was just
climbing to the next level. Piano is my number

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:37.330
one obviously but I do also run and I do it
quite passionately. I find running a marathon

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.789
and doing a concert very similar. Not only
in the preparation but also mentally because

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.000
when you do a concert, you think in stages.
You think this piece, then that piece and

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.600
then that piece. You don't think from the
beginning to the end. And that's how I approached

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.229
my very first marathon. I approached it in
that way - my first five miles and then I'll

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.539
think about the next ones. Whatever piece
I'm working on at that moment will be playing

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.360
in my head all the time. Most of the time
it's involuntary but sometimes I purposely

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.750
go through it in my head as I'm running. Because
you're, for those how ever many hours, just

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:32.360
yourself and your thoughts. Sometimes I think
I'm running away from myself as well. I think I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.349
started running just to get fitter and to
feel better. And I did find loads of parallels

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.340
between running and piano playing. You just
don't give yourself the option of stopping.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:03:02.060
It's out of the question. You can't stop in
a concert, you're not going to stop in a race.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.989
That's it.
