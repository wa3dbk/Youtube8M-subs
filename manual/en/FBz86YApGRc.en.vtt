Mrs. Obama:
So, we're going to
put you to work.

00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.333
Well, welcome.

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.934
This is the fifth planting of
the White House Kitchen Garden.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:06.166
Are you guys excited?

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.233
Children:
Yes.

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:09.667
Mrs. Obama:
So that we know who is here, I
want to make sure that all these

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:11.500
wonderful people with
their cameras know which

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.500
schools are here.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
So when I say your school
name, raise your hand,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.200
or scream or
something like that.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.367
Milton Elementary School
from Milton, Vermont.

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:24.133
Woo-hoo!

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.900
Yes, is that the principal?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.667
It's like woo-hoo, party on.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:32.700
Sarah Moore Greene Magnet
Technology Academy in Knox

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.700
County, Tennessee.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.000
Woo-hoo!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.400
(applause)

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.867
Arthur D. Healey School,
Somerville Public Schools in

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:41.367
Somerville, Massachusetts.

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:42.500
Woo-hoo!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.533
(applause)

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.734
Benjamin David Gullett
Elementary School in

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:48.767
Bradenton, Florida.

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:50.300
Yes, that was it.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.633
That was it.

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.600
I know you all are cold,
coming from Florida.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.333
And then we have our partners
from many, many, many years --

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.066
Bancroft Elementary School.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:00.734
(applause)

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:02.166
There we go.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.000
See, they're comfortable
yelling in the White House.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.166
(laughter)

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.333
And then we have the
Harriet Tubman Elementary

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.567
School students.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:09.300
(applause)

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.700
Yeah!

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.667
So it's great to
have you guys here.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.266
Are you ready to go?

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.767
One of the reasons we
invited these schools --

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:21.333
Harriet Tubman
School and Bancroft,

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.100
they have been our
partners for years.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.033
But the schools from across
the country who have come,

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:29.066
you guys are here because you
are doing such wonderful things

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.200
to implement the new school
nutrition standards at

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
your school.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.467
So do you like your
school lunches?

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:38.200
They are healthy
and they are good?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.200
And you're eating
your vegetables?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.800
And many of you have
gardens of your own?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.800
Awesome.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.834
So you know what
to do here, right?

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:47.333
Are you ready to plant?

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.100
All right, let's get going.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.133
Let's do it!

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.500
Speaker:
Come on, guys!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.834
Mrs. Obama:
Thank you, sir.

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.033
Speaker:
You're welcome.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:56.000
Mrs. Obama:
Are those mine?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.700
Speaker:
These are your gloves.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:12.166
(cross-talk)

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.433
Speaker:
You guys are too good.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.867
Speaker:
You're on a roll, I'll tell you.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:18.166
Speaker:
We're basically done.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:24.467
You guys are just super fast.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:25.900
Speaker:
There you go.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.400
That's fine.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.467
You know what, sometimes when
you're doing this -- exactly.

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:30.033
Look, look.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:33.834
If you do that, then you get
a big pile (inaudible) and

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.600
sprinkle it on through.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.600
You never got to worry about it.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.233
Yeah, we'll close
them up in a second.

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:43.500
You all need anymore?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.433
Here, I'll tell you what.

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:50.367
We'll use all the
seeds we've got.

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:53.533
I would rather it be where
we got too many plants.

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.066
And we'll just go through and
thin them where they got a

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:59.066
good spacing.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:00.166
Okay.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:01.934
So to close them up,
that's all you got to do,

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:08.900
just take your hand
and be right there.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.200
Speaker:
Does anyone want to come
plant some potatoes?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.433
Speaker:
Sure.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:13.500
Speaker:
You want to bring your group?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.567
Speaker:
Yeah.

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:18.233
Speaker:
When you do that, you don't
want to do it too hard.

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:19.467
You don't want to bunch them up.

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:25.433
We know we got them nice and
spread out in the bed there.

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:28.266
Now, when you stuff direct seed
like this, you plant something,

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:31.100
you water it in, pretty much
you know it's going to be good.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.233
But these, you got to watch
them because the seeds,

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.667
when they're really young and
they first start to sprout,

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:38.133
you got to make sure then
they really don't dry out.

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.000
Because if they dry out when
they're real young like and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.333
sprouted, then they'll die.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.400
You got to take a little
extra care and check them a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.300
little bit more.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:55.300
(cross-talk)

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.433
You always want to water
things really good.

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:00.867
If you just water the
little bit of it --

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:02.834
you all know how water does?

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:08.300
It moves to the drier spots
until equilibrium is reached

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.467
where everything is the
same amount of moisture.

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:13.367
So you want it a little
bit on the wet side.

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:19.300
(cross-talk)

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.200
Student:
There's one more bag over there.
