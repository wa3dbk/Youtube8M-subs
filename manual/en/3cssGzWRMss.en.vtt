00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.910
Today on this Ford F150 we are going to be
installing the Power Tailgate Lock from Pop

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.059
&amp; Lock, part number pal8250.

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.330
To start our installation off we are going
to go ahead and lower down the tailgate, and

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.309
on the back side here we got the access panels
that is covering the innards of our locking

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.309
mechanism.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:20.870
You want to go ahead and remove that first,
and there are 8 tork head screws that we have

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:27.450
to remove to get it off the tailgate.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:39.230
We will next go ahead and release the rod
ends from the scissor links, and to do that

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.600
these little green clips here actually just
flip up.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.309
Take a screw driver 
and then next we will take and remove the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.590
two 10 mm nuts that are holding the scissor
bracket to the handle, and then we will go

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.839
ahead and take it out.

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:17.800
Okay what we are going to do is go ahead and
do a quick test fit of the components here

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.510
and make sure everything is working before
we actually install it on the vehicle.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.320
So we will go ahead and put the scissor link
bracket back onto the handle here, and we

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.510
will go ahead and take our power lock, see
its go the actuator, the actuator is right

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.520
here and this bracket right here is going
to mount over the stud here on the passengers

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520
side.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.950
Lets go ahead and put the nut on there just
to hold it in place for the time being.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.650
You want to make sure that the two crank arms
on our power lock are straddling the toggle

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.460
link here on the scissor link bracket.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.070
Okay we will next go ahead and take the wiring
harness and plug it into our power lock.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:21.540
We will start with the short 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:03:02.739
lead of 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:04:10.329
wire 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:23.850
with 
the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:05:21.060
two bullet 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:56.600
connectors on it.
