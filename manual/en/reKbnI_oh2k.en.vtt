00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.870
Hello, folks. My name is Mark McKinney.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.710
I'm a sales associate here at Ken Wilson Ford,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.440
Today, I'm going to be going over some safety features

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.890
and features and benefits of the new 2014 Ford Explorer.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.520
In front of me right here, I have a vehicle that has

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.740
lane-sensing capability, and also Park Assist.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.400
With this on, it actually will move the vehicle

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.240
back into the lane that you're in,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.640
and also, if you try to cross that lane, it will warn you

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.610
by shaking the steering wheel and giving you forewarning either way.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.240
It also, if you signal, will let you change lanes with

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.440
no further problem, but it basically does that.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.390
It also is equipped with what is called cruise control -

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.130
Adaptive cruise control. What that does is,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.140
you can stay anywhere from four, three or two car lengths

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.270
behind the vehicle in front of you.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.970
Its really nice. When you're going down the road,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.210
if someone pulls over in front of you and slows down,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.110
you have to brake and reset. With this,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.540
it takes care of that problem for you.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.090
What it does is it gives you the opportunity to slow down,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.980
and when the car in front of you moves out of the way,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.640
or you change lanes, it actually picks up and goes to the speed

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.740
that you have your car set on. That is a nice feature.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.090
Another feature that this vehicle is equipped with is called

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.140
Blind Spot mirrors, better known as BLIS.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.370
It warns you when a car comes into your blind spot 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.600
that its there, so that you have little bit of help and knowledge

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.440
of knowing that its there.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.040
It will flash a light in the mirror and let you know that its there.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.080
It does that on the other side of the vehicle also.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.620
That is another safety feature and benefit that you have,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.640
to try to keep cars off of you.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.490
It also has - is equipped with - if you start to have an accident,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.000
it senses that there is a vehicle too close to you, in front,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.740
a sensor right here that flashes a light

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.370
to let you know that you're coming up on a vehicle too quickly

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.610
or that there's a problem. It does that, and it senses that, with a camera

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.140
mounted in there by the mirror also.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.040
Another feature that this vehicle has is keyless entry, 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.820
which is a nice feature. You also have, when you've got the feature

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.540
with the fob, you can actually lock the doors from here,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.370
and you can actually open the doors from here,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.210
without ever taking your key, either from your pocket 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.810
or from your purse.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.540
It does give you the benefit of being able to do that.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.680
Those are some nice features. This is a Ford-only feature, 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.010
which is the keyless entry.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.030
Another thing too, that you have, is the back-up camera in the rear.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.690
It gives you plenty of ability to be able to see.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.940
That's very key. You don't want to have anything that you could back up over.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.970
Now, moving to the interior of the 2014 Ford Explorer,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.310
we'll show you some of the features and benefits in this vehicle also.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.840
One thing that is great is that you have what is called SYNC.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.650
That's touchless telephone bluetooth in your vehicle.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.380
You also have speak-to navigation, where you don't have 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.920
your hands all over something, trying to find out or figure out

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.940
where you're going. It actually is easy; it talks back with you,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.300
and you put information in that will help you in your driving ease.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.340
It also has everything at hand. You also have six airbags in this vehicle.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.580
You have a curtain airbag, two front airbags, and two side airbags.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:13.640
And, you also have airbags that are in the seatbelts in the rear.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.090
What that does is, none of these all go off at the same time.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:27.240
Let's say you have a child in the back seat - it won't just strangle them

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.170
or completely cut them off, but it will actually protect them safely in this vehicle.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.070
That's a Ford first also.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.440
You also have - you can see well with your blind spot mirrors,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.180
you have all access as far as guages are concerned in this vehicle,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.690
they're all at ease to be able to find.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.720
You have an adjustable steering wheel that comes out and also down.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.540
And its all offset, so if you take a front end impact,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.670
it won't just completely mash you in the front,

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.990
it actually goes to the side.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.700
This vehicle is also equipped with the fact that if 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.540
any airbag in this vehicle goes off, 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.670
the first phone call will be that 911 will call your phone,

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.070
and if you don't answer, they're on their way.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.820
They know where your vehicle is, and also, the vehicle

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.440
will start flashing the lights, blowing the horn, and 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.040
opens all the doors so that when someone gets to you,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.500
they can get you out and get you to safety.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.090
These are some features that are very, very important

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.140
in any vehicle that you purchase. They're all standard on 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.960
a Ford with SYNC.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.700
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining me today,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.040
about the safety features of the 2014 Ford Explorer.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.140
You can come out and see me at Ken Wilson Ford.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.880
My name's Mark McKinney, and I'd be glad to go over anything we could

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.850
to show you how great this vehicle is.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.160
If you could, give us a call, and we'll take a test drive.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Thanks.
