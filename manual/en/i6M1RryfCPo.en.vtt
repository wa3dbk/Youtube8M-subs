00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.150
This is Hitman: Codename 47.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.720
I have no context or backstory because I have
never played a Hitman game and I know next

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.750
to nothing about any of them.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.020
Luckily, Codename 47 fits the entry level
bill considering it was the first installment

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.020
in the fairly popular Hitman series.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.390
Unlike the sequels to come, Codename 47 was
a PC exclusive, although some of its missions

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.780
would be incorporated into later games, and
was developed by Io Interactive and published

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.080
by Eidos.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.320
No questionable Square Enix marketing campaigns
in sight.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.340
And maybe it’s because I’m not one of
those longtime Hitman fans, but Codename 47

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.030
initially elicited a lukewarm reaction.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.550
Playing through the entire game did end up
changing my original thoughts, but Hitman:

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.650
Codename 47, for all it does right in principle,
unfortunately falls prey to flaws only emphasized

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.290
by time.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.730
So what are those flaws?

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.880
Well, the game came out in 2000, a time when
3D gaming was still in its awkward teenage

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.149
years.

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.080
Polygons abound in Hitman: Codename 47!

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.850
But beyond rough graphics and a draw distance
that is a little disappointing even among

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.390
its contemporaries, Codename 47’s looks
aren’t anything despicable or tremendously

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.390
bad.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.720
And in fact, the rest of the presentation
is pretty solid.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.820
Well, except for the stereotyped voice acting.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.560
Music isn’t anything you’ll have caught
in your head, but it does set the tone for

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.790
the smooth stealth and fatal action the plot
and game would have you take part in.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.130
An apparently manufactured killer of a scientist
of some kind, Agent 47 enters the world of

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.549
the Agency, an organization invested in the
killing of others, after he completes his

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.110
extremely short combat training.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.250
It’s like he was made for this stuff, or,
uh, something.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.690
Remember how I mentioned that smooth stealth
and fatal action?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.090
Well, yeah, the pre-mission debriefings and
air of murderous intrigue definitely create

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.729
a fantastic atmosphere surrounding the core
gameplay.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.590
Problem is, that gameplay can get a little...rough.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.619
But, again, Codename 47 does a lot right.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.440
I guess I’ve waited a little too long to
state the game’s genre, but here it is anyways:

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.760
Hitman: Codename 47 is an action-stealth game,
emphasis on the stealth.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.370
However, one of Codename 47’s biggest appeals
is its ability to provide a few scenarios

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.549
for each mission.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.940
Upon entering the next open area, Agent 47’s
means of completing his objectives seem limitless,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.030
apparently ranging from open, action-packed
shootouts to disguised infiltration.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.140
But, well, those means aren’t really that
limitless, or even widely varied.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.000
It’s not a drastic change between different
scenarios surrounding the same mission, and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.010
in fact some missions are pretty much impossible
without stealthily completing certain objectives.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.440
Again, in principle, Codename 47’s draw
of possibilities looks awesome from a distance,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.410
but moment-to-moment gameplay isn’t drastically
affected.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.920
And for a stealth game, Codename 47’s AI
is frustratingly inconsistent.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.910
What works for one attempt of completing a
mission unreasonably does not on the next

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.910
try.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.260
And, ya know, it’s very possible that I
suck at the game, but on normal difficulty

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.380
and with Agent 47’s
apparent allergy to a few bullets, Codename

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.750
47 can get really frustrating really fast,
also taking into account the checkpoint system

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.200
that doesn’t reset enemy awareness of your
identity.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.760
I know I’ve mentioned Codename 47 does stuff
right, and it seems like I’ve neglected

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.340
that side of the game in favor of the sometimes
more glaring negatives.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.630
But despite some technical missteps in the
context of modern stealth games and some possibly

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.000
personal gripes aside, it’s a very competent
and fun stealth game.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.340
There’s a feeling of satisfaction associated
with completing a long mission, taking out

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.290
a guard undetected, stealing his clothes,
and dragging his body to a nearby hiding place,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.400
getting that stealthy headshot with a silenced
pistol, and the confusingly satisfying narrative

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.650
payoff.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.590
All of these factors, among smaller, less
noticeable ones, make up for many of the problems

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.160
associated with a lot of games at the time
of its release.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.060
Anyone looking for a good stealth game, the
roots of a long-running series, or a back-of-the-

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.940
head-barcode-simulator could do a lot worse
than Hitman: Codename 47.
