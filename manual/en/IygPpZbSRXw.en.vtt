00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.630
Data is the fuel of programmatic marketing.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.610
On the one hand, every transaction is informed
by it, and on the other, every transaction

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.290
creates even more of it.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.500
So the ability to take all of that data from
both sides and make sense of it is an enormous

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.510
competitive advantage.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.860
Metamarkets helps the world's top programmatic
exchanges and buyers make sense of all of

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.860
that data.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.369
More than 100 billion events every single
day.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.370
It's a full stack, SaaS solution that's optimized
for speed.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.000
Unlike standard reporting systems that only
deliver static results, Metamarkets helps

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.980
you understand what's happening right now,
and why it's happening.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.840
Our real-time, exploratory approach also means
that anyone on your team can answer questions,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.260
not just data analysts.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.120
For example, executives at exchanges use our
platform to track up-to-the-second marketplace

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.180
trends, and then account managers at those
same exchanges use Metamarkets to drive liquidity

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.180
by analyzing their clients' bidding and floor
strategies.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.850
And on the demand side, buyers use Metamarkets
to more efficiently plan and forecast, to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.270
uncover valuable pockets of inventory and
to optimize campaigns even while they're in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.270
flight.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240
The platform is also designed for collaboration.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.819
It empowers teams to make smarter, faster
decisions by giving them a shared view of

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.360
what's happening, and what needs to be done.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.670
And it helps drive engagement with external
partners by making it easy to distribute avails

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.259
and performance reports.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.369
Twitter, Millennial, and more than a dozen
others provide visibility to their partners

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.070
in this way.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.470
Simply put, our mission is to help our clients
stay agile: agile in their technology, agile

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.710
in their decision-making, and agile in how
they function as an organization.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.700
In a space where opportunities can come and
go in seconds, nothing's more important than

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.240
that kind of access to your data.
