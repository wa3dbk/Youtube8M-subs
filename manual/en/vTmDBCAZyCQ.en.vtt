00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.640
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to remove, inspect

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.719
and overhaul your vehicle's alternator. In
this step we're going to talk about the proper

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.810
service procedure for un-mounting our vehicle's
alternator, and disconnecting the last two

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.279
electrical components. What I'm going to do
is take a small screwdriver and release the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.060
retaining clip on this wire here. This is
a secondary ground wire, and just wiggle out

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.060
of place. From here, I'm going to take my
three eighths socket wrench, I have a deep

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.860
extension and a thirteen millimeter socket.
Got one bolt here to deal with and two down

00:00:41.860 --> 00:01:36.030
lower. Go ahead and set them aside for later
re-installation. Put this one aside, and set

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:57.470
this one aside, right there. That's the proper
way to dismount the alternator. But we still

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.240
have that one heavy connector left to deal
with. Take a small screwdriver and push the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.450
protective boot out of the way, just like
so. That's going to expose the nut, and then

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:32.730
we're going to go ahead and take that off
right now. And there you go, going to take

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:42.130
and set that nut aside, it is a special nut.
Take and slip off the wiring connector, just

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.620
like so. That is the proper way to remove
your vehicle's mounting bolts, and remove

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.629
the last few electrical connections.
