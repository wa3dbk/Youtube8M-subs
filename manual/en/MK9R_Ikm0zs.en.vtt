00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:10.743
Can you tell me why Unix is better than Windows?

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:15.593
Fewer security holes due to a complicated
and cluttered operating system.

00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:19.083
I'm sure there are still viruses and malware
for it.

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:23.143
Both Unix and Linux have far better security
than Windows.

00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:28.793
Between Unix and Linux, there are perhaps
200 to 300 viruses overall whereas Windows

00:00:28.793 --> 00:00:31.603
sees that many new viruses a year.

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:36.813
So it is not big enough to attract malware
makers, like Apple used to be.

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:39.113
How reliable is Unix?

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:42.482
Unix is far more reliable than Windows.

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:45.642
Crashing one application won't give you a
blue screen of death.

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:49.383
How good are they at fixing the problems they
find?

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:54.833
If a security hole is found in Linux, several
developers start working on a solution immediately

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:57.653
to get fame for being the first to fix it.

00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:03.052
Bug fixing is slower in proprietary Unix systems
than Linux, but it is faster than begging

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:05.802
Microsoft to fix something.

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:08.083
Security is high for Apple, too.

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:10.343
Why else is Unix better than Windows?

00:01:10.343 --> 00:01:14.382
Linux is popular because there are free versions.

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:19.513
Unix variations supported by different companies
is still cheaper than Windows.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:21.713
Cheap is certainly attractive.

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:26.982
But what about all the MS Office applications
and others people can't live without?

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:31.412
There are Unix based office applications for
everything from photo editing to spreadsheets

00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:33.853
to data modeling software.

00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:37.662
The only thing worse than trying to learn
a new application is trying to figure out

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:41.223
how to share the files with others who have
not heard of it.

00:01:41.223 --> 00:01:46.052
If it cannot run without Microsoft Windows,
you can still set up a virtual environment

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:51.223
on the Unix machine with Windows and run the
application in that contained environment.

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.302
That definitely makes Windows better than
Unix.

00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:59.223
Your little snow globe filled with Microsoft
can crash and the rest of the system operates

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:00.223
perfectly.

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:05.863
A blue screen of death I can close and ignore
with impunity is a dramatic improvement.

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:11.423
That's why Unix and Linux have moved off mainframe
servers and increasingly to personal computers.
