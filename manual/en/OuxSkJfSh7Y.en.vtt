00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.500
Hi~≡

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.900
Until the day my bones are buried in Mnet

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I will put my body on the line to create content 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.999
But what kind of program is this?

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.000
But what is this??? M COUNTDOWN?
Nope~↓

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.800
I can do this! Let's go Kibum!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.999
Uh...it's not here

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm going to wear this and hear that I look like a kid!!!

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Hoo hoo hoot~‖

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
Employee's card

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Apple Watch, what's the fuss about?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.899
Huh...crazy
This is what the world has come to?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're on our way to work

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.300
I'm going to pick out my clothes

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm going to go meet someone

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.000
Someone in the fashion world so.. woohoot

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.999
Shall I try on my rehearsal outfit?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I need to be comfortable when I'm practicing

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.000
If you're going to wear a shirt that goes past your belt, wear a jacket like this

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.999
Or wear something that's longer than the shirt

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Because I have thighs

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800
The proportions didn't look good, but if you wear something long like this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.500
It's a little thin, so it looks a little better

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm going to wear this for Music Bank

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.000
I need to wear something for my way to work

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.000
I will reveal today's going to work outfit

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.000
Going with all black

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.000
All black with walkers

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Oh, looks good, summer boy

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.000
I want to wear this poncho

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.899
Because it's monsoon season

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.999
Jeremy Scott rain coat

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's cute

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's cute

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.500
There's a backstory to these shorts

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.000
Was it two years ago? Minho wore these when he was shooting for Nylon

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.700
I thought it was so pretty, so I hurried over to the store and bought it right away

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.500
If it rains tomorrow, I will wear this
If it doesn't rain, I will leave the rain coat out

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.999
I wore this haha

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.500
Do I look like some sort of trench coat man?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It really looks like some sort of dress

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It still looks good like this though

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.800
What should I do?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.900
Pink rain coat) When it rains, the three-striped slippers

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Pink rain coat) Monsoon fashion complete

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.000
The time is 5:48 right now

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.800
With the passion I have to buy the Apple Watch

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Crazy, seriously crazy

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.000
Good Morning Baltimore will start off the morning

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Good Morning Baltimore, my throat is closed up

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.999
I need to put makeup on

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.000
The clothes I'm going to wear on my way to work

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.000
If I wear what I was going to wear yesterday for my bottoms, I'm going to freeze to death

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.999
Bye

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.000
I will show you how I do my makeup when I go to work for Music Bank

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.800
Wipe with a toner
Wipe the back of your neck too

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.000
Squeeze the sunscreen out in a smiley face shape

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.300
I'm going to put on BB cream right away

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.000
From the areas on my skin that need to be brightened

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.000
Just dot it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.500
Spray some mist

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.999
So it's dewy

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.000
This is what you use to scoop it

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.000
Average man 2) I think it's going to cake up

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.800
Average man 3) I think dividing the BB cream helps cover everywhere

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.999
On days you go for a more natural look

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.999
Especially because it gets thick when you use your hands

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
If you use this, it looks much more natural

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.899
After this
Use the towel you have left over

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.899
Wipe your lips

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.999
Wipe the bridge of your nose

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.899
Wipe your eyes

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.000
Your skin is darker than you think

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.999
I'm the same as well

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.000
I think it's going to be too cold, so first I wore shorts 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.000
Then changed into black pants

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.500
I think it looks okay

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Okay then, shall we go?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
If there's anything I'm going to forget on my way out

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.999
I leave it all out front

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.700
Car keys, cologne, office card, employee card

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.000
Commes des, Garcons come here, Garcons bye

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.800
Yeah, with the wind blowing like this

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
If I wore shorts, I would've been in big trouble

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.000
Oh? There are people here already

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
This is not what I expected

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Oh, daebak

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.000
Everyone is fussing over the Apple Watch

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.000
The line behind me is long too

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.999
I can't film right now

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I'll give you a peek

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.999
Like that

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
How great our fans' passion is

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.999
I felt it myself while standing in line

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.000
Everyone, standing in line

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.999
Hello

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.999
This is cute too, the black one
Woman) The black one is pretty too

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.999
Woman) It latches on 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It's mine

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.000
When you're buying something that you want

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.000
Rather than an exact time

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.999
I think going as quickly as you can is my know-how. Yes

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Success!

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.900
Now I can go to Music Bank with comfortably
