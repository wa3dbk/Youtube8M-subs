00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.070
Okay folks. In this clip, I'm going to teach
you how to draw pretty girls. Now pretty girls,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.500
I'm going to not lie to you, are not the easiest
things to draw. They are quite difficult,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.250
to tell you the truth. Why are they so difficult?
That is a very, very good question. We start

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.820
up here with the head and we're going to kind
of come down. One reason is the female body

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.529
is obviously a work of art, which means that
if you're going to create a work of art, you'd

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.450
better take your time and you'd better do
it right. We come up here, and we're going

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:44.760
to draw the head first. The trickiest part
will be the face, by far. If you get a face

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.821
that isn't remotely attractive to look at,
you might as well just start over. So here,

00:00:52.821 --> 00:01:03.190
you'll have the eyes. That's usually a really
good place to start. And then, one thing you're

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:11.060
not going to want to do is call a lot of attention
to the nose. The nose is not a good area to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.700
call attention to when you're drawing pretty
girls. If you draw attention to someone's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.859
nose, for whatever reason, especially in drawings,
it makes them look not as attractive, for

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.689
some reason. I'm not exactly sure why. Except
for I think in society today, it's just kind

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:35.990
of understood that, I don't know, large noses
are not as desirable as smaller ones. It's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.530
an unfair system, but you know I don't make
the rules. That's just the way it is. So we're

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.310
going to come up here, and we're going to
draw the hair. I'm going to give her sort

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:54.420
of a pulled back ponytail look, like that.
And we're going to come down, and we're going

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.329
to draw her neck. This is where it's going
to get kind of tricky. You're going to really

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.570
want to be paying attention to what you're
doing. I'm going to draw her in a very feminine

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.509
pose. The pose is going to be one of the most
important things about drawing a pretty girl.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:19.180
That and proportion, making sure you don't
exaggerate the wrong areas or understate,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.230
I guess, the wrong areas, but basically doing
everything exactly the right way, which is

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:37.129
often not easy. I'm drawing the arm in a bit
of a hand on hip sort of pose there. Thumb

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.140
there, hips we'll draw in a second. The other
arm, I think I'm just going to kind of bring

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:54.590
down and have it hang sort of down this way,
just kind of like that. Now for the sake of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:05.090
this drawing, I'm going to come in here and
give her some tank top situation.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.950
Now we're going to draw the hips, also a very
important part. I think this will actually

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.390
end up being sort of an evening gown. One
important thing about drawing the legs on

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.069
a woman is you want to make sure that they're
clearly, clearly in a, for lack of a better

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.540
word, feminine pose. You do not want to make
them too big. You do not want to make them

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.930
too small. Essentially, you want to make them
just right. And that, often times, can be

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.299
easier said than done. What I'm doing here
is I'm kind of drawing one a little bit more

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.541
behind the other. This one is a little behind.
This one is more out in front. And this is

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:54.640
just basically your standard pose, which you
know works well for many, many different looks

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.510
for girls. But I would say it's a good starting
point, especially if you're kind of creating

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.460
this character from scratch. Then I'd come
in and draw maybe a bit definition here. I

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.719
might be going a little overboard here with
some of this sexy girl look. But we're learning

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:18.500
how to draw pretty girls and in the drawing
world, you're allowed to take some creative

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:28.680
license, I suppose. So yeah, basically, that's
a good place to start. Again, the biggest

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.500
key is to make sure you draw everything in
the proportions that you want- head, shoulders,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.970
bust line, waist, hips- everything needs to
be proportioned. Everything needs to be curvy,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.370
feminine, and yeah, at the end of the day,
it should look like a work of art because

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.840
the female body is a work of art. So there
you go.
