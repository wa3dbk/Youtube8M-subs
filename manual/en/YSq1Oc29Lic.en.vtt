... belong to you?

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.569
no it's not

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.823
I'll be back in just a moment.

00:00:07.823 --> 00:00:08.380
Yeah.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.797
Look at Alice run!

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.208
Alice is running...

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:14.241
Run, run!

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:15.209
I love it!

00:00:15.226 --> 00:00:16.353
Where'd Alice go?

00:00:16.358 --> 00:00:18.028
I love it!

00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:22.991
Uh oh...

00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:23.752
Ah!

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:24.272
(laughing)

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:26.580
Alice gets the quad workout!

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.333
He came all the way from over there!

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:34.613
Over here!

00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:39.252
Let him have his private moment

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.408
(bells jingling)

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:40.972
Okay

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:44.969
The highlight of my trip, was...

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:46.461
was me sneaking up on her...

00:00:46.888 --> 00:00:47.839
It scared me!

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:49.092
(gasp)

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.217
Oh no!

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:50.443
I blame her

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.121
You blame her?

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:52.354
She's the one that left her bag

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:54.354
I blame myself!

00:00:54.383 --> 00:00:55.357
Oh!

00:00:55.357 --> 00:00:56.736
Well they left their bag...

00:00:57.175 --> 00:00:57.429
Oh...

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.257
And I was, said... 'over here'

00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:00.164
I said, 'come get it!'

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:00.827
I was just uber...

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:04.318
And if she didn't forget her bag, well 
 that never would have happened would it?

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.770
No.

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:05.817
I'm sorry...

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:09.569
But I was impressed that's you go... you ran in your 
 dress all the way over there, that was impressive!

00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:10.884
... so lady like!

00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:11.930
(whispering)
... he's easily impressed!

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:12.915
(laughing)

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:14.445
I am wearing high heels!

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:16.118
Did you get it?!?

00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:15.465
Yes.

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:16.762
(laughing)

00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:17.934
Big girl shoes, right?

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:18.550
Yes.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.227
(laughing)

00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:20.656
I can be even bigger though!

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.733
I can eat a piece of mushroom and be a mile high!

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:23.611
Yes!

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:25.821
Then I'd have really big girl shoes!

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:27.842
And then you eat that other stuff and you get tiny.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.935
Or just the other side of the mushroom.

00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:33.013
Yes, you wanna get a picture?

00:01:33.013 --> 00:01:33.863
Where's your book?

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:34.525
I'm fine...

00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:35.085
Where's your book?

00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:36.393
You don't want... oh, his book!

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:37.446
Have her sign the book!

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:39.160
He's just too enthralled...

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.420
Yes, yes he is...

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:41.900
I'm done, I'm done...

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:42.940
She slugged you!

00:01:42.975 --> 00:01:45.670
I pointed... into your face!

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:47.370
Let's go with that!

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:47.960
... stop it!

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:50.590
(giggles)
I'm really sorry.

00:01:50.592 --> 00:01:52.520
I.. I'm pretty sure I caught that.

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:53.960
I bet you would

00:01:53.974 --> 00:01:55.050
I didn't mean to!

00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:55.660
(laughing)

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.660
Stop, stop, stop!

00:01:57.708 --> 00:01:58.700
The highlight...

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.400
Stop!

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
It was good... it was good...

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:03.870
Are we gonna photo up?

00:02:04.498 --> 00:02:05.540
Yeah, I'm sure

00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:06.690
I feel really bad about it...

00:02:06.687 --> 00:02:07.040
No!

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:08.280
But I do!

00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:09.430
Stop, I know, it was good...

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.470
It was good, it was good...

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.650
He even let me sign his book after all that!

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:14.280
Yes!

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:15.430
(giggles)

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:18.040
Well do I get to take a picture with you now?

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.340
Yeah.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:18.900
Yes?

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:20.470
Where would you like to stand?

00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:21.540
By Mister Rabbit?

00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:23.350
I'll keep my hands right here...

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:24.870
(laughing)

00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:25.980
He's afraid of me now...

00:02:26.808 --> 00:02:27.480
(laughing)

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.270
He's gonna stand by the right... 

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:29.670
right...

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:30.730
Ah!

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:42.780
We're good, we're good?

00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:43.740
Awesome.

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:45.740
Thank you!

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:47.670
Do you forgive me?

00:02:47.674 --> 00:02:48.590
Stop!

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:51.200
(stifled giggle)

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:54.120
so, so soft, it says...

00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:55.860
What?

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:57.450
What are you pointing at?

00:02:57.975 --> 00:02:59.080
College kids!

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:02.710
Alice hit him in the face!

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.180
Huh?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.390
Alice went and... backhanded him!

00:03:05.387 --> 00:03:07.390
Well, he's giving everybody the wrong idea...

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:08.280
Okay...

00:03:08.308 --> 00:03:10.310
What happened was...

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.160
somebody, somebody... you really like those, don't you?

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:12.620
I really...

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.880
See...

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:14.720
Okay...

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:16.450
Oh...

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:17.640
Tinker talent!

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:20.330
What happened was... somebody left their bag, before meeting

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:20.920
Sure.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:25.520
Before meeting Alice, she went over to a whole bunch 
 of college kids who were taking a another picture...

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:25.940
Uh huh...?

00:03:25.992 --> 00:03:29.960
And then I snuck up behind her, and she didn't 
 know I was there, so she was like...

00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:30.880
... and then she hit me.

00:03:30.908 --> 00:03:32.740
Oh, well then you snuck up on her!

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.560
Well, I... snuck... she didn't know I was there...

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:35.880
Right...

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:36.540
So...

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.040
Yeah...

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.700
But to those college kids, he is now forever known as... 

00:03:40.697 --> 00:03:41.800
The guy that Alice hit, so...

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:45.640
But then, we were in line for Big 
 Thunder Railroad!
And then, they were literally like...

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:51.370
'Hey! Aren't you the kid who literally got like... 
 like, like decked, from, from... by Alice?'

00:03:51.683 --> 00:03:52.290
And I'm like...

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:54.370
Yeah... that's, that's me...

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:57.570
Woah... sounds like it was an interesting day...

00:03:57.608 --> 00:03:58.580
Yeah, it was an interesting day for him...

00:03:58.575 --> 00:03:59.030
Yeah!

00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:20.210
Alice hit you in the face?

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:21.070
We saw Alice...

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:23.070
It was accidentally, but...
