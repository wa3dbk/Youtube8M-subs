This is one of my favorite casual hair styles

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.020
at the moment because it's quick, easy and
kind of looks like kitty ears.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.480
Start by brushing and dividing your hair into
two sections.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.220
Take a small section of hair above your ear
on one side and brush it upwards.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.890
Twist it slightly towards the middle like
this.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.090
Fold it backwards so the twist sits on your
head.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.500
The more you twist the more the top will point
into a little triangle ear shape.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.100
It helps to have slightly dirty hair so it
has texture to hold the shape.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.670
Pin it in place with one bobby pin pushed
up the middle back to front and one horizontal

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:20.050
so they form an X shape.
Repeat on the other side.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:33.549
Twist into the middle again so it's the opposite
of 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:41.619
the first one.
Give them a good spray so they stay in place

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:58.900
and you're all finished.
So cute and it only takes around 5 minutes.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.420
Now release your inner kitty.
I hope this was a useful video, please check

Bye!
