Hello! My name is Grady Johnson and I'm a
professional painter, and today I represent

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.110
expertvillage.com. Now we're going to talk
a little bit about the tools you're going

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.539
to need to paint the exterior eaves on your
house. Now, 3 tools you always need when you're

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.240
painting are a duster, a 5 in 1 tool or putty
knife, and a rag. Now, this is what we use

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.949
to open our cans to dust off the area and
to clean up any paint that are out there.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.410
This right here, these 3 tools right here,
always have to be on you at all times when

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.590
you're a painter. You may drop is periodically.
Just be sure you're always keeping those in

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.420
your pocket. That's what you're keeping in
your pocket, but there are some other prep

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.080
tools we are going to need. For instance,
we're going to need a flex blade to apply

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.980
our spackling and you'll find that right here.
That flex blade is going to give a little

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.190
bit and it's easier to flatten everything
out. You don't have to do a lot of extra sanding.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
And we're going to need a caulking gun to
put the caulking on. Now, whenever you're

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.660
getting caulking gun, just choose something
that has a good action in it and it's always

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.360
good to find one that has the caulker attached.
If it doesn't, then you need to keep some

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.140
kind of a stick or something long enough to
poke through the diaphragm on the caulking

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.720
tube whenever you're making it come up to
the top. Once everything dries up and our

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.390
prep work is all done, we're going to sand
that all down as smooth as we can get it with

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.080
a good 220 grit sand paper, which you're going
to find here. I always use 220. It doesn't

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
fill too fast and it's going to give you a
nice smooth surface without tearing it all

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.909
up. Now, when you're doing your priming you
want to use a brush of course and a cut pot.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.760
Remember we're priming today, so we're going
to use a priming cut pot and then another

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.010
cut pot for our finish paint. You'll see 2
of them here. Once kind of an old can I cut

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.990
out and then this is one that I got form the
paint store. A few brushes to work with. Use

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.270
your rounded brushes for your priming, and
for your finish cutting, for the real sharp

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.430
lines, use the best brush that you have like
you find here. Now, whenever you're painting,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.960
you need to drop everything off to be sure
that none of that paint gets on the surface

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.260
underneath you. So you need a few drop cloths.
I've got a runner here and I've got a big

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.450
one. Just fold those up. We'll show you how
to do that later. Finally, at the end of the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.569
day we are going to clean up these brushes
so that they will last. Therefore, I always

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.580
have a wire brush to do my clean up with.
These are the tools you're going to need to

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.619
paint the exterior eaves on your house.
