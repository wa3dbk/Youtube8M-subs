00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
During the 50s which was known as the austere years after the warÖ

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it was very hard to get people to spend a lot of money on glasses so my father realised that he had to something unusual

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to get them to go and buy something and he created this particular design,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which as you can see is fitted with bamboo or malacca cane as its real name is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and this was featured in Vogue magazine and was very, very successful

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the only thing you had to be careful of was not to get the bamboo wet because it might sprout.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I started designing in 1964-65 andÖ my very first design that was aloud to be put into production

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
was this design which I called ëRipí, R,I,P. The unusual feature about the design is that in the nose piece here is flat

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where as normal frames would have an outward bump hereÖ so this was on display and we had...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
...the bell rang at the showroom and my Father went to answer the door

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and standing there was Arthur Askey who was a comedian and Lord Snowdon who had recently married Princess Margret

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and my father askedÖ ëwhoís firstíÖ and Arther Askey said ëhis lordshipís first stupid, whoíd you thinkí

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and so my father obviously saw to Lord Snowdon first and he was looking for new spectacles

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and he came across this pair which was on display, tried it on, loved it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and he had this made up for his prescription. He was subsequently photographed at aÖ

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
...judging entries for a glass-wear show, not an optical show, but a glass wear for vases etc

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
andÖ this was a great feeling for me to see my first, my very first production design 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
being worn by a celebrity such as Lord Snowdon.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
1974Ö was the year of the ëpunkí and weÖ wanted to get in on the act,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so my father and I started rummaging around in the drawers to see what we could actually adorn the frames

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
with to make them look like punk glasses. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So we found various items like paper clipís, bits of chains, studs and various things

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and we put these onto the sunglasses, showed it to Vogue, and Vogue said ëwow, we have got to use thisí

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and they did. Then it snowballed on because we found that our customers such as Harrods, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
were asking us ëcan we have themí because we have got customers coming in asking for them,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
especially the ëSloaneyí set who want to imitate anything which is fashionable at the time.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So we had to really dig deep into every draw we could find and get all our staff to look in their drawers to find

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
what they see we could use to adorn these glasses and they proved to be very popular as a sunglass.
