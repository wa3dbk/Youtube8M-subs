00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.900
I told you he would come!

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.420
(wait!)

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.820
You could die!

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.000
At least tell me your name.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.540
It's not who I am underneath.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.820
But what I do that defines me.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.440
Bruce?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.980
No.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.840
Oh my god, you totally are Bruce.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.520
What?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.520
No way.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.760
Okay, well that whole "what I do that defines me" thing,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.120
I said that to Bruce three days ago and told no one else, so...

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.740
That would mean you're Bruce.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.080
You're being crazy.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.140
How could I be Bruce Wayne?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.620
See, I didn't even say Wayne.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.340
I-I just said Bruce.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.740
Oh, I saw Bruce... Wayne at the bank.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.300
And he told me about your conversation.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.500
Oh, you guys hang out?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.220
Yeah.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.100
Bruce Wayne is... kinda the coolest.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.820
Oh really?

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.600
You should go out with him. He's free Friday--

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.080
[Commissioner] Ms. Dawes, thank god you're safe.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.940
Commissioner, you're not gonna believe this.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.980
What, Bruce Wayne is Batman?

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.780
What?!

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.900
Come on!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.960
Wait, you knew that?

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760
It's, like, super obvious.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.120
Disappears for a bunch of years, comes back, he's in incredible shape.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.300
Well that totally makes sense, because one time when we were kids

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.320
I saw him get thrashed by bats.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.900
No.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.540
Get this, I was just driving in the Batmobile, like, tank thing? (Yeah?)

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.820
I look in the glovebox, and it's registered to Bruce Wayne! [laughs]

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.400
That is baloney!

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.240
Batman gave me a periscope the other night and it said "Wayne Enterprises" on it.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.540
[both laugh and talk at same time] I mean... what is that? Hello? I mean, hello?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.260
Oh!

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.400
This'll...

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.960
This'll clear things up!

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.860
There's Bruce Wayne, just behind you!

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.440
Turn, and let's put this paranoia to rest.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.040
Just... turn around?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.080
[both] Okay. Okay.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.900
[Commisioner] Yup. Don't see him. Guess we'll just turn back around.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.900
[Batman] Don't turn around!

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.020
Wait! Wait!

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.180
(let me know!) Don't turn!

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.260
Okay, now you can!

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.400
[Normal voice] Hi.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.860
Rachel, Commissioner Gordon.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.780
I was just...

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.760
Water skiing.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.100
From a hovercraft.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.840
You know, doing reckless, billionare type stuff like I do--

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.920
Still have your eye makeup on.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.740
Hm?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.660
No.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.660
This... I was...

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.080
I was... uh, hit.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.040
In the face.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.060
These are black eyes.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.820
I've been fighting crime--no.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.440
Not... that.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.820
Irregardless.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.240
Rachel, my childhood friend, and... Gordon?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.740
Is that it? For we've never once met?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.000
I'm not the Batman.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.640
I'm Bruce Wayne.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.960
So, the city's being sprayed with fear gas and you came here just to tell us you're not Batman.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.700
That's perfect.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.080
That is perfectly put. And you-- and you know who can confirm it?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.320
Oh, right-- right there!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
Right-- right behind you, it's Batman!

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.900
[still normal voice] Bruce Wayne is right guys.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.100
He's NOT Batman.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.740
Wrong voice.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.120
[Batman voice] My mistake!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.180
[Batman voice] I don't know what I have to do to prove to you that I'm not--

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.020
Wearing the tux.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.620
[normal voice] Shit.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920
[normal voice] I can see how you might think we're the same person, but... [laughs nervously]

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.600
I'm wearing the cape, aren't I?

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.380
Yes.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.640
[normal voice] Look! Here we are! Two completely separate people!

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.560
Hey Batman!

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.000
[Batman voice] Hey, how's it going?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.120
[normal voice] Ha ha ha!

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.480
How are you, Batman?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.940
[Batman voice] I'm doing real good.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.780
Just spending my day...

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.260
Not being Bruce Wayne.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.080
[sarcastically] Well.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.200
I'm convinced.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.520
[normal voice] If we were the same person, could I do this?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.880
Hey Batman, how was your day?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.140
[Batman voice] Pretty good. I was at-- [gurgling noises]

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.640
[coughs]

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.940
[Batman voice] I was down, just at-- [gurgling noises]

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.320
[Batman voice] And then the Riddler, he came in and-- [gurgling noises]

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.120
[Batman voice] Clayface.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.220
Admit it, you're Batman.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.100
Look, we can go on and on about who or who isn't the vigilante Batman,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.640
but I think it's about time we considered the fact that the Batman

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.780
is actually a half-man, half-bat who doesn't even have a secret identity.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.760
Batman...

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.680
gave this glove to me.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.160
Because you guys hang out?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.180
Yes we do.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.540
He's kinda the coolest.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.380
He said we should go out sometime!
