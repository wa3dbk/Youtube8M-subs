Okay, so we just finished priming the wall
and we are going to let that dry for about

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.960
an hour and in the meantime our next step
in our bedroom project is to do some caulking.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.690
Now there are several types of caulk on the
market and you want to make sure you get he

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.730
painter's caulk. Some of the other brands
you won't be able to paint over them so make

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:39.210
sure you get the right one. You want to make
the cut on an angle just like that. Okay,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.700
I have also got a bucket of water and a sponge
here and I will show you what that is for

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.790
in a second. So we are just going to go around
the room and a lot of times where the paint

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.990
meets the wall there is going to be a noticeable
crack and you want to fill those cracks and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.239
we want to fill those cracks and make it nice
and smooth. Just draw a bead right down that

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:50.950
crack just like that.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.369
So again just run your finger down the line
and that will smooth it out real nice. You

00:01:58.369 --> 00:03:08.590
can even use the sponge for that.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:18.180
Okay,
now I have quite a bit of caulk left here

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.920
so for the next time you want to use it I
am going to put a little nail in the head

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.280
of it and that way it will stay nice and fresh.
