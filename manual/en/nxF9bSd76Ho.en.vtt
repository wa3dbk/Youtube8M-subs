00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:17.520
Hello there and welcome to a special TSAtv
Newsdesk for the reveal of Microsoft's new

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.480
Xbox One.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.460
The biggest news is naturally the console
itself, which comes in a shiny black box,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.440
complete with eight gigabytes of memory, an
eight-core processor, as well as the latest

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.529
versions of HDMI and Wi-Fi.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.900
It will come with a new version of the company's
Kinect camera, which has enhanced sensors

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.160
and the ability to record video at up to 30
frames per second at 1080p, and the controller

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.290
has also gotten a facelift, now running over
Wi-Fi and with an integrated battery.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.869
Launching alongside the Xbox One is a new
version of Xbox Live, with new dynamic achievements,

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:57.410
as well as the ability to capture, edit and
upload gameplay to share with others.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.850
Elsewhere on Live, Steven Spielberg is working
on a Halo live-action series, and video-calling

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.379
app Skype will also be coming to the console.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.500
There was also a heavy emphasis on new television
capabilities, which will allow you to switch

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.750
between streaming and on-demand video with
natural voice commands, as well as pin the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.310
feed to one side of the screen while browsing
the web on the other.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.860
The first gaming announcement was that the
next versions of EA Sports' FIFA, NBA, Madden

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.060
and UFC franchises would arrive on the Xbox
One in the first year, complete with the new

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.450
Ignite engine, which focuses on player motion
and intelligence, as well as adding 3D crowds

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.700
and constant updates to the games' content.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.550
There will also be some additional content
in FIFA 14's Ultimate Team mode exclusive

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.630
to the Xbox One.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.550
Also announced was Forza Motorsport 5, and
a mysterious new game called Quantum Break

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.770
from the team behind Alan Wake in which your
play will affect the development of the plot.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.479
In total, Microsoft say they have fifteen
exclusive titles in development for the first

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.030
year of the Xbox One, with eight of those
being new franchises.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.700
Wrapping up the reveals was Call of Duty:
Ghosts and Activision's next-generation engine

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.710
for the series.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.380
Ghosts is being written by Traffic's Stephen
Gaghan, developed by Infinity Ward, Neversoft

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.920
and Raven, and runs on a shiny new engine
that includes more detailed character models

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.750
and a clever level-of-detail technology called
Sub-D that makes things in-game look better

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.340
the closer you get.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.251
The game itself is set in a new timeline,
with events kicking off ten years after an

00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:26.220
event that has left the world in disarray,
and adds intelligent dogs to your squad, as

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.590
well as enabling voice commands via Kinect
and second-screen features via phones and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.590
tablets.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.140
The multiplayer will also build on the dynamic
maps found in last year's Black Ops 2, adding

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.170
character customisation, and what Activision
described as 'new co-op ideas'.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.120
Also confirmed for the Xbox One are Destiny
from Activision and Bungie, as well as Watch

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.780
Dogs and Assassin's Creed 4 from Ubisoft.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.730
The Xbox One itself will be released around
the world later in the year, and will require

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.520
an internet connection of some kind, even
if it doesn't need to be connected all the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520
time.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.700
It will also have some restrictions on pre-owned
games, requiring games to be installed and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.890
activated on a console, with a further fee
needing to be paid to activate again on another.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.400
Microsoft says to expect more on the consoles
games and services at E3 in a couple of weeks.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.110
