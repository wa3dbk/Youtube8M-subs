00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.310
LG BL40 Chocolate Preview.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:15.500
LG are teasing yet again with some basic specifications
and photos of the new "Chocolate" phone, the

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.860
LG BL40.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.349
We first had a glimpse of this handset three
weeks ago, but now we have a few more details.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:31.960
The main thing to notice is the BL40's screen
- it's a huge 4" 800 x 345 pixel panel, almost

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.910
identical in terms of size and resolution
to the Nokia E90.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.539
On the back is a 5 megapixel camera with flash
and Schneider-Kreuznach optics.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.070
The front-facing camera on the BL40 indicates
that it's a 3G phone, and a close look at

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.281
the icons indicate the probable presence of
WiFi and an FM radio in addition to all the

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.010
usual features.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.309
The LG BL40's on-screen buttons indicate that
this is a touchscreen device, and it works

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.220
in both wide and tall orientations.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.570
It's an unusually tall phone, looking rather
like.. well, rather like a bar of chocolate.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.439
LG didn't specify the exact size, but we think
that it comes out at something like 128 x

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:27.280
52 x 11mm.. again, not far off the size of
the E90 but about half the thickness.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.460
The 800 pixel wide 12:9 ratio screen is definitely
a huge advantage when it comes to web surfing,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.970
but LG's "Real VGA" technology promises to
deliver bright, sharp video playback too.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.590
LG also say that the BL40 comes with a "Dual
Screen UI" which allows it to display two

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.289
different types of content at the same time.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.350
LG say that the BL40 should be available during
Q3 2009 in 54 countries.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.150
There's no word on pricing at the moment,
but we would guess it will be expensive.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.840
Presumably LG will give more details closer
to the launch date.
