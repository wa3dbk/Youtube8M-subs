00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.757
- First of all, not a real tattoo.

00:00:02.757 --> 00:00:05.032
It's a temporary spray on one that I got

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:06.258
at a festival with Dodie.

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:08.515
It's the right way up
when I'm looking at it,

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:10.801
but it's a dinosaur.

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.134
So I love Disney films, but we all know

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:15.779
that that's somewhat problematic.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.535
They're getting better, but you know,

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:19.195
there's still issues.

00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:20.438
I want to talk about The Little Mermaid

00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:22.899
because I feel like it gets a bad rap.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:24.640
A lot of people are hating on Ariel.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.858
Like a lot of other Disney
films people criticize it

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:30.051
for being antifeminist,
but as a feminist myself,

00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:33.858
I'm here to defend Ariel to an extent.

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:35.820
She still does some
pretty messed up things.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.411
So why do people think
that The Little Mermaid

00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:39.325
is antifeminist in the first place?

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:40.975
Ariel changes for a man.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:42.878
She sacrifices her voice for a man.

00:00:42.878 --> 00:00:45.955
She puts her own life and
her family's lives in danger

00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:48.753
because of a man and she
doesn't even know him.

00:00:48.753 --> 00:00:53.205
Okay, okay, I kind of see
where you're coming from,

00:00:53.205 --> 00:00:54.228
but not really.

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:56.527
Changing or doing
something for someone else

00:00:56.527 --> 00:00:58.327
that you are interested in romantically

00:00:58.327 --> 00:01:00.301
is not necessarily a bad thing.

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.065
People change all the
time and we have different

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:03.121
motivations for it.

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:05.187
Sometimes the motivation comes from within

00:01:05.187 --> 00:01:08.542
and sometimes the motivation
comes from other people

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:11.492
and it doesn't necessarily
have to be an evil thing.

00:01:11.492 --> 00:01:14.150
But it's always good to be
aware of the reasons why

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.149
you want to change.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.786
For Ariel, a lot of people
think that the reason

00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:19.851
why she she changed was for Prince Eric,

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:22.000
but I cannot stress this enough.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.146
It is not about Prince Eric.

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:26.734
Ariel is already in love
with the human world

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:29.403
before she even knows that he exists.

00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:30.868
You know that famous song that she sings

00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:32.763
before she's met him?

00:01:32.763 --> 00:01:36.626
Part of that world, yeah, that world.

00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:39.618
Not your world, not his world, that world.

00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:42.175
♫ Bright young women, sick of swimming

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:44.584
♫ Ready to stand ♫

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:47.363
That whole song is about
curiousity and learning,

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:51.058
fascination, an adventure,
happiness, and independence

00:01:51.058 --> 00:01:53.400
all good things to be
teaching young women.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.498
I don't think the moral of the
film is to change for a man

00:01:56.498 --> 00:01:58.752
or risk everything for a man.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.399
I think the moral is to
fight for what you love.

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.280
If you're unhappy in
your current situation

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.462
and you can change it, change it.

00:02:05.462 --> 00:02:09.070
Of course Ariel is still a
self centered 16-year-old.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.946
There's no denying that.

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:12.277
She gets into arguments with her dad.

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.797
You don't understand me.

00:02:14.797 --> 00:02:17.727
She doesn't turn up to her
own coming of age ceremony.

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:19.463
She runs away from home.

00:02:19.463 --> 00:02:21.250
She's reckless and impulsive.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.526
She signs an illegal document
because she's technically

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:24.367
a minor.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.569
These things are pretty shitty,

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.138
but they don't make her
or the film antifeminist.

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.725
Everyone makes mistakes, yo.

00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:33.662
I just said yo, but that was a mistake.

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:35.308
It gets to me when
people say that the film

00:02:35.308 --> 00:02:36.970
is antifeminist and not
just for the reasons

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.237
that I have mentioned, but
because it feels personal to me.

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:41.985
Growing up I always wanted to be smart

00:02:41.985 --> 00:02:44.835
and beautiful like Bell
or wild and independent

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:48.649
like Jasmine, but I always
felt like I was Ariel.

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:49.830
I was a daydreamer.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.051
The grass was always
greener on the other side

00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:55.888
and I was never 100% content
in my current situation.

00:02:55.888 --> 00:02:57.213
And I would change myself.

00:02:57.213 --> 00:02:58.130
I would do different things.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.777
I would work hard in order to get to where

00:03:00.777 --> 00:03:01.811
I wanted to be.

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:03.831
So just a warning, if you insult Ariel

00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:06.151
I will take it as a personal offense.

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:08.717
Or at least teenage (mumbles).

00:03:08.717 --> 00:03:10.199
I think I'm more like Jasmine now.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.826
That'd be cool.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:13.820
I like to think I am, hopefully.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.005
Those are just my thoughts on

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:16.747
The Little Mermaid and feminism.

00:03:16.747 --> 00:03:18.464
Please let me know in the comments

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:20.731
if you agree with me or if
you think any differently

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:23.941
or maybe you have some thoughts
about other Disney films,

00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:26.703
it'd be really cool to chat
about feminism and Disney

00:03:26.703 --> 00:03:28.859
because I like talking about that a lot.

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.991
Please give the video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:32.391
and I'll see you guys soon.

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:33.123
Bye.

00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:36.868
(upbeat music)
