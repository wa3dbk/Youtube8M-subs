ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): And the
Streamy goes to Reese!

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.830
-You're probably wondering
how we got here.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.990
-You're probably wondering
how we got here.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.250
-Dude, I'm doing
the voiceover.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.120
-I wanted to do the-- ow.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.610
-Anyway, you probably
wouldn't believe it

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.029
even if we told you.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.400
But I'm gonna tell you anyway.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.520
-Really?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.803
That's your great opening?

00:00:28.803 --> 00:00:30.053
Ow.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:39.649
-Yes.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.680
Laundry is all done, great.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.500
All right.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.140
-What's left on the
to-do list?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.310
-Let's see, it says
get famous.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.570
-Oh, yeah.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.773
We keep putting that off.

00:00:49.773 --> 00:00:51.610
-For some reason, I can't really
see how that's even

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.210
possible to do.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.920
-We should put your nephew
in a hot air balloon?

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.090
-I don't have a hot
air balloon.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.516
Or a nephew.

00:00:57.516 --> 00:00:59.410
-You make some good points.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.130
-Oh.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.450
We could make a web series.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.450
Everybody seems to be making--

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.960
-Oh.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.810
We could do a web series.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.770
-Great idea.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.020
-We're going to make a greatest
web series web show

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.835
that's ever been on
the web computer.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.600
-Who are you talking to?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.980
-This is my thinking place.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.500
We should put a poster here.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.750
A long one.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.530
China.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.780
-I got it.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.080
Oh, crap.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.955
I'm stuck inside this
video game.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:39.550
-I'm Elder Man, your mentor.

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:43.022
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Boom!

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:45.390
-He-- hello.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.770
-Right?

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.530
-No, dude.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.880
That's just like "Legend
of Neil."

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.080
-Well, fine.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.650
OK?

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.490
You wanted something so
original, you come up with it.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.520
-I've got it.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.630
Lost it.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.236
Got it.

00:01:57.236 --> 00:01:58.655
I'm a con artist.

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:00.900
A thief, my dad's a cop.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.850
My uncle's a mob boss.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.890
Sometimes I talk to
my mom's ghost.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.560
Right?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.830
-No.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.130
-Huh?

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.910
-No.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.705
That idea's been taken, too.

00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:27.320
Why do I have to be the girl?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.570
-You have soft features.

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.846
Welcome to a query.

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:39.580
A mercenary popularized
in feudal Japan.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.210
Uh, uh, oh.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.060
Hey.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.880
Come on.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.570
We're in love with each other,
and you know it.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.822
-Stop hitting on me, Shmabu.

00:02:48.822 --> 00:02:51.840
We need to focus on playing
this computer game.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.690
-You're right, Schmodex.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.210
And it's called "The

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.070
Schmild." -I got it.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.801
(SINGING) I'm singing my blog!

00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:03.960
You know?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.210
You make some good points.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:11.530
We wrote the crap out
of that script.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.014
-Freeze frame high five.

00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:16.130
You know who we need, though?

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.550
Felicia Day.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.200
-Oh, totally.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.130
She's web gold.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.440
Plus I'm in love with her.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.190
-Obsessed with her.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.750
-Right.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.290
-Here's the thing.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.360
Is there a way to find out what
she's doing right now?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.520
Streamy Awards start
in five hours.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.090
-Hope to see you there, XOXO.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.160
-That means she wants to kiss
and hug me, and then kiss and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.800
hug me again.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.022
-Are you thinking what
I'm thinking?

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:34.856
Road trip!

00:03:34.856 --> 00:03:38.070
-And product placement.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.320
All right, map.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.720
-Check.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.280
-Tuxedos.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.250
-Check.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.140
-Crappy car.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.000
-Uh, that's a big check.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.810
-A year's supply of Trident
Layers gum.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.760
-Why are we taking
so much Trident?

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.410
-What, are you kidding me?

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.090
This stuff comes in handy
all the time.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.210
Been paying our rent
with it for months.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.010
-What do you do with the
cash that I give you?

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.530
-Actual Trident.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.500
-Check.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.430
-Check.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.610
-Clipboard.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.175
-Check.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:04.050
-Let's do this.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.141
-Road trip.

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:07.025
Whoo!

00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:09.380
So how far do we have to go?

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.630
-Four miles.
