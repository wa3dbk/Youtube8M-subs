00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:20.380
Far and deep at the ends of the earth I stand in an abandoned capital where

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:39.380
All that rise are those who rule over the spirits here in their lamentful deaths

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.740
A deep crimson river flows out of the darkness, swallowing all those that would live

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.600
Raging fires exhale, engulfing the bodies, and their resonating screams pierce eardrums

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.480
O what multitude of lives born into the world where here their words turn to death agonies!

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.280
Great universe and sky and stars, how your reason and karma would lead to such suffering!

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.140
Don’t be so foolish, mutters a foreigner

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.120
Even if you gaze up above, here there is no sky to shine back at you!

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:03.480
Under this dark shut sky, just how far will my eye

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.340
See through it if at all? But without knowing my limits

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.080
I close my eyes – Yes, even now my heart

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.160
Feels as if it will fade away…

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.420
The brimming fear and leering horrors will never burn out, will never dry up

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.300
Like this filthy spring ever boiling over.. Only loneliness will shield my eyes

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.160
Days where we might have understood each other never come, and I can’t even decide whether I want us to or not…

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.020
With its innumerable futilities and immeasurable hatred, hell is filled with glass blades

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.880
Crushed, I can’t even find myself…

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.880
Since when could I no longer touch you?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.140
Not even my emotions will reach you… All this time,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.120
Was it all I wanted? For you to admire me? I’m such a child…

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.580
Forever then I’ll embrace this eye’s light

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.780
Just like a prayer

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.660
Under this dark shut sky, just how far will my eye

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.780
See through it if at all? But without knowing my limits

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.400
I close my eyes – Yes, even now my heart

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.600
Feels as if it will fade away without a sound…

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.420
Not even my emotions will reach you… All this time,
Feels as if it will fade away without a sound…

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.900
Not even my emotions will reach you… All this time,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.140
Was it all I wanted? For you to admire me? I’m such a child…

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.740
Forever then I’ll embrace this eye’s light

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.700
Just like a prayer
