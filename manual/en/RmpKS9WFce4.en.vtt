00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.540
Welcome to Snap-on Training Solutions. This
module is designed to help you get the most

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.920
out of your SOLUS Edge diagnostic tool and
covers the use of scanner data in Parameter

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.920
ID view, also known as PID view.
The scanner data display shows the live data

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.640
parameter information from the vehicle's
control module. To access live data, select

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.820
Data Display from the scanner main menu.
Depending on the vehicle, this may open a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.190
submenu of viewing options. Remember you can
scroll down with the touch screen or keypad

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.000
for additional selections. For this example,
we will choose to view engine data from the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.489
submenu.
A list of engine data parameters is shown

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.860
along with a brief description of each parameter.
The data appears in a digital text format

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.860
on the right, called PID view. The data values
refresh as the vehicle sends new data. The

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.140
speed may vary depending on the speed of data
sent from the vehicle and the number of data

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.000
parameters being shown.
Scroll down to see all available data parameters.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.830
The data is continuously recorded for all
available data parameters. After 2000 frames

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.830
are recorded, new data is recorded and overwrites
the oldest frames of data. The pause button

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.619
freezes the data display for closer examination
and review.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.179
When viewing paused or recorded data, the
left and right arrows move forward and back

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.459
one data frame at a time.
The double arrows move forward and back 580

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:06.459
frames at a time. Move the position indicator
to navigate to any part of the recorded data.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.150
The pause icon indicates live data from the
vehicle is being displayed. Selecting the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.440
pause icon stops data collection.
When paused you also have the option to clear

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.400
the data buffer and start over.
This is useful when vehicle conditions change

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.870
and you want to record and view new frames
of data.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.239
Use the record icon to restart data recording
at any time.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.269
Scroll down to see the complete list of data
parameters at any time the live data is playing

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.469
or when it is paused. Here are the rest of
the engine data parameters for this vehicle.

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:52.579
You can choose data parameters you want to
see together on one screen. Just highlight

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.959
any parameter and select the lock icon to
lock it on the top of the screen. Scroll down

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.170
and lock to select additional parameters.
This enables you to see relationships between

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.120
data parameters. Simply select the lock icon
again to unlock a parameter.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.999
The Custom Data List function gives you even
more power to customize the view. Selecting

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:24.999
the Custom Data List checkmark opens a menu
for selecting parameters to display.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.099
Checkmarks to the left of the parameter description
indicate which parameters are selected for

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.560
display.
Here we see the Select All icon. Use it to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.189
hide or display all the parameters.
Touch once to select all data parameters in

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:48.189
the list. Touch again to deselect all parameters
in the list. Touch the Select button on the

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.450
toolbar to activate it. Then touch a parameter
to add it to the custom data list. Touch it

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.780
again to delete the checkmark and delete the
parameter from the list. Select as few or

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.780
as many as you want.
Note that locked parameters cannot be hidden.

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.159
When you have created your custom data list,
use the Back arrow to return to the data display

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:22.159
and view the list. Custom Data Lists can significantly
accelerate the speed of the data display by

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.930
processing only the vehicle data that you
need, so you can find tough intermittent failures

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.610
faster.
The Sort function is another handy way to

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.360
find and view the parameters you need. Select
the sort icon to sort the list by the factory

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.360
default sort order, or from A to Z, or Z to
A.
