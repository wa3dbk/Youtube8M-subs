00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.120
Mirus Bio has been making research
easier for two decades

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.760
by providing transfection solutions that
allow better gene expression

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.869
or knockdown for many applications;
genome editing

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.369
RNAi, virus production, protein production

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.010
and high-throughput screening

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.100
we have been able to do this with the
help of chemists

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.990
who create libraries of novel
compounds including polymers and lipids

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.220
that are then tested by biologists for
nucleic acid uptake

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.380
and delivery. The outcome is an array of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.730
optimize transfection reagents that can TransIT

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.300
any nucleic acid into any cell type

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.579
How do we TransIT? The process of
transfection

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.710
begins with transfection reagents that
coat and condense

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.090
the negatively charged nucleic acid into
a transfection complex

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.539
with a net positive charge

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.659
transfection complexes than incubated
with target cells

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.130
to allow binding with the negatively
charged cell membrane

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.340
followed by uptake through endocytosis

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.780
into cellular vesicles called endosomes

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.380
the transfection complex must then
escape the endosomes acidic environment

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.940
and be released into the cytoplasm
nucleic acids such as

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.060
siRNA, miRNA

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.300
and mRNA can function right here

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.430
whereas plasma DNA must be shuttled into
the nucleus

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.420
for transcription into mRNA to
eventually produce

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.880
target protein

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.200
at Mirus we care as much about
transfection

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.510
as you do about your research, as a result

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.780
Mirus develops transit solutions to
provide better performance

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.979
and lower toxicity than other reagents

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.030
the first transit transfection reagent
TransIT LT1

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.020
introduced in 1996 was the very first
serum compatible reagent

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.380
LT denotes low toxicity simplifying
transfection protocols forever

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.850
no more media changes we were also the
first to introduce

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.410
an siRNA transfection reagent
TransIT-TKO

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.400
our latest breakthrough the TransIT-X2
system

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.410
is a novel non-liposomal system

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.090
that allows high efficiency delivery
of plasma DNA

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.590
and/or siRNA and we continue to
innovate
