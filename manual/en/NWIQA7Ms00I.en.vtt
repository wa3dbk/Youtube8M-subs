00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.860
Yo, what's up! It's the Korean Alex

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.060
I'll introduce you to our "Mouse House"

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.613
Eye, eye

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.600
Ear, ear

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.600
Nose

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.420
 The yard is pretty big

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.220
 The reason is that America is pretty wide

00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:34.374
Seoul is tiny (in space)

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:37.895
Apartments and houses are pretty small

00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:41.594
Shall we go in? Let's go

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:43.594
Right away is my room

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:48.334
The blue room

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.280
Here's a bunch of pictures from my high school days

00:01:02.877 --> 00:01:04.877
And the kitchen

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:10.974
Our computer room

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:18.833
The interesting part of this room is definitely the family pictures

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.020
Pictures of my brother, my sister, and me

00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:27.182
Pictures of our family in Japan

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.113
My brother and I were in middle school here, and my sister was in elementary

00:01:32.094 --> 00:01:34.094
This is a Japanese advertisement

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.620
 These are my brother's graduation photos

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.620
My graduation photos

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.633
My sister's graduation photos

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.900
 I'm on the right, my brother on the left

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.780
We're Americans, so we eat a lot

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.694
My brother's room

00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:13.154
Let's go out to the swimming pool

00:03:37.353 --> 00:03:39.353
Really pretty, right?

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.700

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.700

GOODBYE HASAYO!
