00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:14.269
If a fire happens in you home, remember - time
is the biggest enemy and every second counts!

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.160
In less than 30 seconds a small flame can
get completely out of control and turn into

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.800
a major fire. It only takes minutes for a
house to fill with thick black smoke and become

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.050
engulfed in flames.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.130
The Spokane Fire Department believes that
having a sound escape plan will greatly reduce

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.770
fire deaths and protect you and your family?s
safety if a fire occurs.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.320
Practice escape plans every month. The best
plans have two ways to get out of each room.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.739
If the primary way is blocked by fire or smoke,
you will need a second way out. A secondary

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.469
route might be a window onto an adjacent roof
or a collapsible ladder - evaluated by a nationally

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.070
recognized laboratory such as Underwriters
Laboratories (UL) - for escape from upper

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.989
story windows. Make sure that windows are
not stuck, screens can be taken out quickly

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.360
and that security bars can be properly opened.
Also, practice feeling your way out of the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.550
house in the dark or with your eyes closed.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.800
Security bars may help to keep your family
safe from intruders, but they can also trap

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.660
you in a deadly fire! Windows and doors with
security bars must have quick release devices

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.020
to allow them to be opened immediately in
an emergency. Make sure everyone in the family

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.640
understands and practices how to properly
operate and open locked or barred doors and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.640
windows.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.800
When a fire occurs, do not waste any time
saving property. Take the safest exit route,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.570
but if you must escape through smoke, remember
to crawl low, under the smoke and keep your

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.350
mouth covered. The smoke contains toxic gases
which can disorient you or, at worst, overcome

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.679
you.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.340
When you come to a closed door, use the back
of your hand to feel the top of the door,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.399
the doorknob, and the crack between the door
and door frame to make sure that fire is not

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.489
on the other side. If it feels hot, use your
secondary escape route. Even if the door feels

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.910
cool, open it carefully. Brace your shoulder
against the door and open it slowly. If heat

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.580
and smoke come in, slam the door and make
sure it is securely closed, then use your

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.220
alternate escape route.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.610
Designate a meeting location away from the
home, but not necessarily across the street.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.500
For example, meet under a specific tree or
at the end of the driveway or front sidewalk

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.170
to make sure everyone has gotten out safely
and no one will be hurt looking for someone

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.210
who is already safe. Designate one person
to go to a neighbor?s home to phone the fire

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.850
department.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.230
Remember to escape first, then notify the
fire department using the 911 system or proper

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.500
local emergency number in your area. Never
go back into a burning building for any reason.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.440
Teach children not to hide from firefighters.
If someone is missing, tell the firefighters.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.420
They are equipped to perform rescues safely.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.770
Finally, having working smoke alarms installed
on every level of your home dramatically increases

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.350
your chances of survival. Smoke alarm batteries
need to be tested every month and changed

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.370
with new ones at least once a year. Also,
consider replacing the entire smoke alarm

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.730
every ten years, or as the manufacturer guidelines
recommend.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.890
Remember to practice you home fire escape
plan with your family regularly because in

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.490
a real fire situation, your life may depend
on it.
