Hi, I’m Leisl, I’m from Johannesburg in
South Africa and I’ve just finished an MSc

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.620
in Poverty Reduction and Development Management.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.330
I really wanted to get an international qualification
because I’ve done most of my studying in

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:21.800
South Africa and I did my research, Birmingham
seemed to be really strong in this particular

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.289
field of study and everyone had good things
to say about it, so yeah.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.909
I think the exposure to a range of people
because I’ve always studied with people

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:37.430
from my country and to have the debates about
things that I was so interested in with people

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.920
from such various backgrounds, that was really
cool And we formed relationships as well,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.920
which was nice.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.989
Linda and Andrea who, if you study at Birmingham,
you will get to know very well, they were

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:49.989
fantastic.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.809
They responded immediately to any sort of
emails and then when I did my dissertation

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.289
I had skype chats with my supervisor and he
was fantastic.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.329
He was very attentive as I was trying to get
through it.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.120
Well, firstly I believe that having an international
accreditation is very useful but then also

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:18.460
I work with poverty reduction business in
South Africa and so I think having the ability

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.160
to understand the way poverty works at an
international level helps in an African context,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.110
especially with government work etc.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.060
So I’ve recently started a job, a couple
of weeks ago actually, that is micro-finance

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.040
but banking the unbanked, so it’s a business
initiative in South Africa to create mass

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.170
banking for the unbanked.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.440
Make sure you’ve got lots of time to study
because it’s not something you can chuck

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.040
into a spare five minutes, which was my original
intention!

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.180
And yeah, just make sure you’re really interested
and passionate about what you’re doing because

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.700
that motivates you and pushes you through
those times when you’re really just not

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.100
in the mood for anything else!

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.160
Yeah, but it’s a great course and definitely
if you’re considering something local versus

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.909
the exposure to this, just exposure to people
who understand things from different continents

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.260
is really really cool.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.090
I’d advise it.
