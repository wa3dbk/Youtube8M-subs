00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:14.700
Richard Sayre: The upside of renewable fuels
is that they're sustainable, they reduce the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.790
environmental impact, and they can help potentially
mitigate climate change.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:27.980
We particularly like algae as biomass or biofuel
feedstock, algae grow about two to ten times

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:36.390
faster than the best terrestrial crop plants,
they often will store oils as an energy reserve

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.390
product.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.170
And oils that come out of these algae we found,
can be directly converted into fuels using

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.589
preexisting technologies.

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.129
Jose Olivares: So the laboratory is interested
in this area because we have a mission around

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.079
energy security, providing new technologies
for energy for the nation.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.679
The big problem, the big challenge is how
to get that whole process to be economically

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.000
and energetically efficient.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.630
Sayre: To make algobiofuels economically viable,
there are two very important factors that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.720
we have to improve.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.980
And that's the biomass productivity per unit
land area, or the yield, and the other very

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.510
important factor that we need to improve is
reducing the costs of harvesting the algae

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.510
from the pond.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.520
Olivares: The laboratory is actually developing
some nice technologies in a number of different

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.290
areas, transforming algae so that it can produce
more lipids, more biomass, overall better

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.180
productivity, under better conditions.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.950
Peter Lammers: You've seen how we transfer
the algae from the lab, from colonies on a

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.210
petri dish to larger cultures.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.020
We bring them out here, adapt them to the
outdoors and the sunshine.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.240
We begin to scale them up, pretty soon we'll
have algae at hundreds of acres, if not thousands

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.240
of acres.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.050
Sayre: Another important concern is water.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.110
How much water are we going to use?

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.289
And, to address those issues, we're now focusing
on developing heat-tolerant strains of algae

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.010
that can be grown in ponds that are covered
with plastic to reduce the evaporation.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.630
We've figured out how to engineer algae so
they can use light more efficiently than normal

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.770
algae do.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.620
we've seen up to a two-fold increase in growth.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.310
We've also figured out how to engineer algae
to make more oil.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.260
So, at the time that we want to harvest the
algae, we'll induce the expression of a gene

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.421
that will cause all the algae to stick to
each other, settle out of the pond, and then

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:38.421
we pick them up.

00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:42.410
Maybe the last reason that immediately comes
to mind why we like algae is that we can recycle

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.630
the nutrients that are in waste waters.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.540
Lammers: Algae can do waste water treatment
better than conventional systems.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.440
So why not take an energy-intensive expensive
process and turn it into an energy-generating

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.860
system where you're getting clean water and
liquid fuels as your two products, and do

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.840
that in a way that generates revenue.
