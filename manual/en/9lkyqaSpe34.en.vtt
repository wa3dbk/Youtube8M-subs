Tyler: I'm Tyler Archuleta.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm from Sammamish, Washington.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:42.830
I'm driving the '91 Nissan 240 Shindig Machine.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.920
This is Evergreen Grassroots round one.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.840
First comp of the season.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.170
For judging, they start looking for speed,
line, angle and my personal favorite style.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.930
You got to go hard.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.870
A little nervous but it's all about fun where
we get down to it.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.360
You can't be all worked up about your competition,
making number one, that's important but you

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.659
got to have fun.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.710
This car, this is actually set up pretty basic,
mild suspension mods, the engine is almost

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.410
stock, just spent some good money on a clutch
and my flywheel.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.230
I take care of the basics, my coil overs,
I got knuckles, tie rods.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.220
I've got the cage in here from Ram Fabrication.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.420
They hooked it up and built me an awesome
cage.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.340
Other than that, it's pretty stock.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:52.570
This car is meant for one thing, going hard.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:10.979
The car feel really strong.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.939
It's the same as it's been the last couple
of events.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.740
I just need to dial in my line a little bit
on the infield but I still feel pretty confident

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.150
coming into qualifying.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.349
I think I'll do pretty good.

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.270
It feels good.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:52.390
I'm still having fun so let's do it.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.150
First qualifying round didn't go so good.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.520
I spun out on my initiation in the bank, most
definitely got to have to change the tire

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:13.400
pressure.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:56.360
My next two runs, I felt fairly solid.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.879
The rest of it feels, looking fairly good.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.349
We'll see how we did once the results come
out.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:16.789
There's a top three, two top 16.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:27.070
A little bit of nerves but it's a good time.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:48.910
Just kept driving hard, took it run by run.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.710
Next thing I knew, I was up against Aaron
Mosman in the finals.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.860
The guy killed it.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.070
We had an epic battle.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.680
I was blessed to be able to standing on top,
number one.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.919
Speaker 2: Not bad.

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.810
Speaker 3: I think you took it.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.810
Yeah, buddy.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.810
Tyler: Dude.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.780
Plans for next round is just keep maintaining
the KAA.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.110
I'm going to put some nitrous on this thing
so I can keep up with these guys in the dry

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.669
and pretty much just keep this thing running
strong, fix the body, make it happen.
