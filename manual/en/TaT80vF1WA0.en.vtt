Hey guys, I am Hilah, welcome to Hilah Cooking!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.450
So a lot of people have been asking about
vegetarian recipes, and I am gonna show you

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.349
how to make a pasta salad today that is delicious
for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.470
Plus it's really fast, so if you're all like
"Oh, my God!

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.600
I have to be at a potluck in 20 minutes, what
am I gonna do?"

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:32.180
Then you can bring this pasta salad and be
the hero of the potluck.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.850
Okay, so what I got boiling right here in
this pot.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.950
I put it on first.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.730
I put on some little cheese tortellinis.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.929
This is the package.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:46.929
They come dried.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:47.929
I don't know how I am gonna do it.

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.499
They put cheese in there and they dry it.

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.730
Anyway, you can use regular like bow tie noodles
if you want to.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.579
I don't care, but I put that on first, and
then while that's cooking, I am gonna get

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.761
my little vegetables all cut up.

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:04.510
I am gonna have some red bell pepper and some
zucchini and some tomatoes, and I am gonna

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.230
have little dressing here that I will show
you how to make that too, but first I am gonna

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.970
start cutting up this pepper.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.320
So, cut it down in half like that, and then
you can pull out these seeds like that, and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.520
I am gonna make little dice.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.090
I want every little vegetable piece to be
small enough so that you can have a bite of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.840
pasta and a bite of vegetable on the same
bite of your little plastic fork.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.680
I've got my bell pepper cubes, and now I am
gonna have this zucchini here.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.850
I am gonna do something kind of fancy with
it so get ready.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:53.190
I am gonna make really thin strips, oh sugar
and spice.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.030
Okay, really thin strips since it's raw.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.300
Maybe it's kind of weird if it's in big chunks,
and then I am gonna cut them into cross section

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.929
pieces, so we have just the tiniest little
bites of zucchini going throughout, and I

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.090
am gonna stop once I start to get like big
seed time in there.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.280
Okay, so I will save that for later.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.590
I will put it in my freezer, and then once
I have a whole bag full of little vegetable

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.740
scraps, I'll make some stock.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.910
That's what I'll do.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.370
Okay, so this is a big jumble.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:41.530
I am just gonna do this, and not worry about
getting it all exact, and throw it in my bowl,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.819
and then I also have some cherry tomatoes,
but I think I am just gonna rinse them off

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.060
and leave them whole because I like it when
they pop a little bit.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.760
Yums!

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.260
Okay, and I also have some green onions that
I am just gonna try not to burn the house

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.771
down or set off the smoke alarm again, and
roast them a little bit over the flame, so

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:16.310
yeah, just to sort of soften up a little bit,
take the bite off a little, whoa!

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.620
Oooh!

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.640
It smells like roasty onions in here now,
Hmmmmm!

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.730
Okay, so now they're just a little soft, and
you get a little bit of that roasty flavor

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.730
in there.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.050
And we're almost done with our pasta salad.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.390
Okay, so I just drained my pasta.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.060
I normally don't rinse it, but I did because
I wanted to cool it off a little bit.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.550
So now I am gonna throw it in here and put
my dressing over and voila!

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:58.200
So, this dressing is just about one part of
red wine vinegar to two parts olive oil with

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.480
some dried basil and oregano and red pepper
and salt and some Dijon mustard.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.010
I knew I could of course use like a bottled
Italian salad dressing, but this is, I don't

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.370
know, it's almost as easy as that, and it's
better in my opinion.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.290
So, try it out, okay, and then this salad
will get better the longer it sits because

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.110
the pasta will absorb the dressing and everything
gets all mixed up.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.110
So yum!

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:38.600
Okay, I am gonna taste it now, and I am gonna
get my germs all in it.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.139
Oh, c'mon.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.910
Mmmm!

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.449
It's yummy.

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:53.620
It's light enough that you could use it as
a side dish, but it's also hearty enough to

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.440
use it as a salad if you want to add some
like spinach or some beans or something, voila!

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.310
Vegetarian main dish salad.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.410
Okay, I will see you later on another episode
of Hilah Cooking.
