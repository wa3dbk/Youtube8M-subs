00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.110
yeah

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.710
about back to where we started

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.340
now remember the first shrink brought
the edge down about three-eighths of an

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.390
inch

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.830
now we're down about oh I'd say five
eighths of an inch

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.189
nice 16th 58 so almost twice as much as
we had at first and again the shrinking

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.290
action the dumbing action goes in almost
two inches so far so good

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.480
okay what if we want to make this a nice
complete curve with a general curve all

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.980
the way from the edge the edge to do
that I'm going to have to dome the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.840
center and this machine doesn't do that
so a good way they're down the center is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:01.640
to work with a mallet and sandbag so
here's the sandbag I've got a selection

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.630
of mallet so i think i'll use the
largest mallet and what I'm going to do

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.649
is to work from the inside into the sand
bag with the nose of the largest mallet

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.649
and you'll see that that domes the metal
pretty quickly

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.560
there's four hits

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.450
so you can see it's moving doesn't look
very nice now but trust me I know how to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.450
make it look nice in the am

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.330
so there's what we've got so the work I
did with the shrinker brought the edge

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.080
down about five eighths of an inch the
work I did with the mallet and bag

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.800
brought the center up about another
three quarters of an inch so we have a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.060
fairly deep dome now more than an inch
of doming and that happened pretty fast

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.400
right and it wouldn't take much bondo to
smooth this know what we'll we'll smooth

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.760
this out any any questions so far

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.530
so how do you smooth out lumpy metal
that's something we all deal with and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.820
working on old cars they always have
lumpy metal on it and if you're making

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.900
something from new metal it looks pretty
lumpy to start with in the early stages

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.880
of shaping it tends to look lumpy well
there's many ways to do it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.220
we're going to work up to use in English
wheel which is the cool way to do it

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.620
yeah

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.870
yeah

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.750
yeah
