Hi! This is JB again, with Austin Home Brew
Supply. In this segment, we’re going to

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.519
be adding more hops. This is a fairly hoppy
little beer. I like my beers fairly hoppy.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.830
This recipe in particular is meant to really
bring out the nice aromatic quality of these

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.400
beautiful hops that are grown up in the Pacific
Northwest. I was going to adjust the heat

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.370
maybe a little hotter, but it’s actually
fine. It’s rolling away, which is what you

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:39.219
want. Now, I’m going to add some more hops.
On this recipe, it’s going to call for…I’ve

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.210
already added the bittering hop initially,
which is one ounce of the optimum hops. Now,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.980
I’m going to add a half ounce of optimum
and half ounce of Amarillo hops. Different

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.890
kinds of varieties of hops from different
areas with different qualities. All of our

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.909
hops are in one ounce container. If I wanted
to be super accurate, I would actually measure

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:11.500
it out, but I’m not that particular. I’m
going to eyeball a half an ounce, which is

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:22.030
that much. This is my obviously, very scientific
method. These are the hops and those are straight

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.600
in. That’s about a half ounce. I’m going
put just a little bit more, leaving the other

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.630
half ounce for right at the end of the boil.
That’s a half ounce of optimum and now I

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.890
need a half ounce of Amarillo hops. The same
incredibly scientific method. Generally, when

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:52.050
I’m at home I actually measure them out
into a cup, and I can kind of tell the difference.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.500
I can eyeball a half ounce or if you want
you can weigh it out, that’s probably a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.900
better way. But there is about half ounce
of Amarillo hops. Alright, now these are going

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.950
to boil for about another 10 minutes. Then
we’re going to add the last part of the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.410
hops, then we’re going to chill it down
real quick. That’s it for this segment.
