00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.959
The 
desktop is an important part of windows 8
because it allows you to organize all of your

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.410
files and folders, and also run apps that
aren't designed to run on the start screen.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.720
If you're upgrading from an earlier version,
you probably already know how to get around

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.589
in the desktop. But keep in mind that since
there's no start menu in windows 8, you'll

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:36.250
need to use the start screen or the charms
bar to access some features.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.750
When you're on the start screen, you can switch
to the desktop by clicking the desktop tile,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.750
or by holding down the windows key on your
keyboard and pressing D.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.120
The desktop includes the desktop background,
also known as the wallpaper, and the task

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.640
bar at the bottom of the screen. As you may
already know, Microsoft brought back the Start

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.149
button with the 8.1 update, and you'll use
this to switch to the Start screen. The task

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:15.149
bar also contains shortcuts to commonly-used
apps, and settings such as the Action Center

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.280
and the sound volume.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.460
To open an app, you can click the icon on
the taskbar, or if there's a shortcut on the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.210
desktop, you can double click it. If you don't
see the app you're looking for, you'll need

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.969
to switch to the start screen.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.639
The Start screen may not show all of your
apps by default. If you're on a tablet, swipe

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:49.380
up from the middle of the screen to view All
Apps. But if you're on a computer, just click

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.289
the arrow at the bottom of the screen. When
you've found the app you're looking for, you

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:02.289
can click it to open it, or you can add it
to your taskbar by right-clicking it and selecting

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.810
Pin to taskbar. That way it will be easy to
find the next time you want to open it.

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.290
To access your files and folders, you'll use
a specialized program called File Explorer,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.810
which was previously known as Windows Explorer.
You can open it by clicking the folder icon

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.810
on the taskbar, or by double clicking any
folder on your desktop.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.049
If you want to navigate to a different folder,
you can select a different location on the

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.090
left side of the window, and once you find
the file that you want, you can double-click

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.739
it, and it will open in the default program
for that file type.

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.269
Now it's important to note that some files
open with Start screen apps by default; in

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.439
this case, it opened with the Photos app.
But you can easily go back to the desktop

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:03.439
by pressing Windows+D on your keyboard. If
you would prefer to open a file with a different

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.959
app, you can right click the file, go to Open
with, and select the app you want. And to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.700
close this I'm just going to click the X in
the upper right corner.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.359
To delete a file, you can select it and press
the delete key, or you can click and drag

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.659
it into the Recycle Bin. If you're sure you
want to permanently delete the file, right

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:40.349
click the recycle bin and select empty recycle
bin.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.989
These are just the very basics of using the
Desktop, and all of these things will become

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.330
very natural to you as you get more practice
with Windows 8.
