[SOFT BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:24.070
... rains too much, they think that seeding the clouds helps the dams ...

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.689
... you can't drink our water ...

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.630
... it's yummy ...

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.460
... yeah - unless ...

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.829
... it is nice actually ...

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:36.829
... it's brown but it's nice ...
... because it's there I'm just used to drinking it ... the tap water I'll drink it...

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.330
Really when we got here

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.340
we were so affected by the place

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.210
with the mining landscape

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.000
the effect that it's had on the environment

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.350
and then the natural environment that is so contrasting

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.050
and that's quite a moving thing

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.630
I found that very affecting

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.800
and the isolation is also very affecting

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.430
and seeing the affect the isolation has on a community

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.430
we essentially went - lets let this place seep into us and see what comes of that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.160
Art making for me is a process of discovery, its really about searching

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.230
so while I can have some idea of where I want to get to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.950
I actually enjoy the process of just going on the journey

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.689
and when you're an artist and you come into a new context

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.610
the way you worked before or the way you
approach things before doesn't always

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.970
hold true to where you are now

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.049
so there is always a certain amount of reinventing that has to go on

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.400
and that's what has been going on here I guess

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.250
Mountain Heights School is situated in Queenstown which is on the West Coast of Tasmania

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.470
and the students at Mountain Hights School come from Zeehan, Straun, Gormanston and surrounding areas.

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.499
Many of our students have experienced
trauma in their lives

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.609
so students find

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.040
sometimes participation in a regular school program quite challenging

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.730
so we find lots of alternative programs for them to participate in

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.109
the AIR program was offered to all
students in grade 9 to 10

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.469
so we held a student assembly where we offered the program to our grade 9-10 students

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.099
and students could opt-in

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.689
basically what we want to do is sit
down with the students without

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.939
any ideas of what we were going to do and

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.349
and we started to record their conversations

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.779
and we'd ask them about their life in Queenstown, about the things they do

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.540
about ...

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.930
things that happen to us and get them to explain

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.669
why is it that there are rocks showering down on our roof at 8 o'clock in the night

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:07.079
If I was like trying to hit that building over there I'd probably throw it from here because I can reach that... by the time you throw it you could just walk off... or if you run...

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.239
to get to your hiding spot quicker

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.819
from those stories we'd get little
snippets - Queenstown legends that

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.659
the stories going around

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.790
and we would take those stories and
start to build upon them in a visual way

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.439
just trying to find a visual equivalent for some of the stories

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.079
that they had been talking about

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.119
so that it's not a foreign experience to themselves and so the art that gets made

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:33.119
still reflects them

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:53.749
[BACKGROUND MUSIC &amp; STUDENTS TALKING IN BACKGROUND]

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:59.959
when they came in we'd always have ideas about what we were going to do and if that

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.769
wasn't feeling like it was really going anywhere we'd always change tact

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.400
that's been a new thing for them

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.589
that you can come into a space and go

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:12.119
that's not working - let's try this, we can play with those ideas,

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.919
and then it turns into something

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.169
it was good to be able to

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.770
just have a say in what you were going to do and what you're going to draw

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.349
you kind of forget everything else and you just know that this is kind of the moment

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.029
this is just like 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:35.650
what you remember all the fun stuff we did with everyone

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.800
- just making art

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.930
I thought it would have been a bit more structured

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.600
but then at the same time it's fun

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.160
because you're thinking - we'll it might be like this, but at the same time it might be like that

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.860
and it's definitely not going to be the one thing it could just turn in an instant

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.139
life isn't just a

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.189
straight forward path, it has deviations

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.949
you might do one thing which leads to other things but then that next thing could lead you to

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.479
something completely different

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.429
when you wake up in the morning it's something to look forward to

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:17.429
art isn't just painting a picture and it being spectacular 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.580
it's more than that

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.980
we always look forward to it

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.870
we didn't look forward to school that much but

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.169
on that days that we had this program we always wanted to come so we could do that

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.989
I just realised that it could be anything

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:37.800
it doesn't have to be drawing or painting

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.250
it could be movement, light, pictures - anything

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.870
They've often talked to Nick and Freya in quite detail about a variety of things

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.620
and we've learned a lot about

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.939
- well I've learned a lot about their thoughts about their school, their community

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.629
and about the arts just through their conversations

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.949
this opportunity has really just been

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.629
a way of opening up

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:07.650
all those new little paths and now I feel when we leave 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.810
and we get our own studio again that we 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.290
- that we just continue on

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.129
those little openings

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.370
the relationships that have been built here

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.520
have been

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.300
really significant I think in terms of
my own learning

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.770
working with the students has been really

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.259
 - a really important process, in me

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.899
exploring what I do
