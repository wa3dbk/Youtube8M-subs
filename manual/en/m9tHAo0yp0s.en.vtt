Hello, this is Rick Seibol

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.259
 at Valley RV Supercenter in Kent on the corner of Washington Ave and James Street

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.839
619 Washington Avenue North

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.270
Today I want to talk to you about this bad boy here. Its called the 2015 Jayco RV Seneca 37HJ Class C Motor Home.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.939
This even beats some of the top class A's out there in comfort and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:23.760
class.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.490
Jayco only

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.070
builds them one way. Complete quality and  full of comfort.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.290
So come with me. I want show you a few things about this

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.480
particular class C we call a
Super C.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.510
The reason why it's Freightliner frame with a Cummings engine in it.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.059
It also has a 2500 HD

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.000
Allison 6 speed transmission.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.359
14 ply, twenty two and a half Rims
on this.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.870
All-wheel disc brakes all the way

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.750
around.You have an engine break in this is well. Full body paint is another

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.930
unique feature about this. And this side wall

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.240
goes all the way out to the corner of the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.360
cab.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.100
So it is one piece and this will hold up to
750 pounds.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.210
So you could put here grandmother up
there with

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.289
no problem whatsoever. Other than that,

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.119
you got side setup storage

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.979
areas on this. You've got four 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.720
on this side and four on the other side. This area here,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.759
if you wanted to sit outside and enjoy
watching a

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.830
good NFL football game especially the
Seahawks.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.670
Right here's the way you're going to do
it. The awning comes out and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.290
has an LED lighting all the way across it.
Which is really pretty neat.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.680
Come back over here on the other side here I want to talk you about the type

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.150
of generator we have in this particular

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.140
badboy.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.159
It is an Onan 8,000 watt generator with an
1800 watt

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.459
inverter in it which is really nice.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.130
In this particular generator

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.330
you can actually program to turn
on

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.100
and off. Either heat or cool. This
system

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.030
is what the call a heat pump system. You've got dual air conditioning systems.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.400
You have one for the main cabin and
one for the master bedroom for this which is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.900
really kind of nice. Also in this badboy you've got the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.019
on demand hot water system in it. So you
got hot

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.120
water all the time, which is really nice, especially when

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.600
you want to take a shower before your
wife does.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.709
Here you have your electrical cord

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.130
for hooking up to any station

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.519
that you have. It is on an electrical reel so
you can

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.360
pull it out and put it back in. You don't
have to fumble around with it. I wanna

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.200
take you on

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.790
