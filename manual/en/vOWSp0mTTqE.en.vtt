Hi, Iím Jenny, from the Missouri Star Quilt
Company. We love our forums at the Missouri

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.259
Star, and a lot of women get on there and
talk about lots of different things. One of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.930
those women was Shellscraps. She had been
over to Cozy Quilt Designs and seen a tutorial

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.370
of something they called tube quilting. Well
I went over there and watched that and was

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.990
pretty excited about it, and wanted to try
it myself. Her question was, could it be done

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.059
with a regular ruler? So, hereís what we
did.

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.499
So, the first thing weíre going to do on
this project, is cut two strips of contrasting

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:44.690
fabric 2 Ωî wide. So, this would be a great
project for a Jelly Roll as well. So, weíve

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.909
done that, and then weíre going to sew them
together using a ºî seam. OK, so weíre

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:58.960
going to sew these two strips together using
a ºî, and weíll sew all the way down. OK,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.570
so now we have your two strips all sewn together.
You set your seam and then you press to the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:13.380
dark side, always to the dark side. Open that
up and these are cut the width of the fabric

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.619
by the way, 2 Ωî, width of the fabric, sewn
end to end. OK, so now that we have these

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.439
ironed, and pressed, and open, weíre going
to measure them and see how wide they are.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:30.000
They should come out to be 4 Ωî if youíve
sewn a ºî and these do! So, what we want

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.729
to do now is weíre going to cut an additional
strip of fabric thatís 4 Ωî wide and this

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.009
will also be the width of the fabric. It should
be a lighter contrasting color, you can see

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.090
that ours is beige, and it will pick up the
red and green. So, when we put this together

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.049
youíre just going to be amazed at what happens.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.020
So, now weíre going to lay this on top of
eachother and we are going to sew both sides

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.299
of this ºî seam and make a tube. OK, so
we place these right sides together and weíre

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:13.510
going to sew a ºî seam all the way down
to enclose it. I know this sounds kind of

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.860
strange but we are doing is weíre making
a tube. When you sew long seams like this

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:28.370
you want to be sure to change directions often
so that your fabric doesnít bow. This is

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.680
only two seams so it wonít be bad at all,
but if you sewed all your seams going in one

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.640
direction it would create a bow in the pattern.
So, weíre just going to turn these around

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:54.080
and sew back down the other direction, with
our sides matched up, ºî. So, here we are

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.650
at the end of our tube, letís just finish
this up. There we go, all done. Now over to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.080
the cutting table. So, you can see that this
is a tube and weíll lay it out here. Weíre

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.150
going to use this Omnigrid ruler which is
a 9 Ωî square I imagine you could do anyone

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.170
that has the fourty-five degree line on it,
and thatís the line that will give us our

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:29.500
angles. So, you lay that line on your ºî
seam, so, that we can make a cut here that

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.299
will give us the top point of our first cut.
Now Iím left handed, so, Iím doing this

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:44.110
left handed and we will bring Natalie in to
show you how to make a right handed cut, a

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.090
little bit down. So, the next thing we want
to do is we want to slide this down here and

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.060
put it on the bottom seam line. See how easy
that was? It makes a point and we make a cut.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.890
Weíre going to slide it up, weíll move this
out of here, see this is the block that you

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:14.049
get. Put it right along the seam line and
we make another cut. This is going to be so

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:21.739
amazing when you see what happens when we
open these up. Weíll finish cutting these

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.870
and really all we need is four for our demonstration.
So, this will be the last one weíll cut,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:36.870
before the magic begins! Alright, now we have
four of these blocks and you can get four

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.310
more out of this tube. When you open them
up this is what you get a little piece of

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:52.080
magic! Look at that. Now, whatís fun about
this is because of the way theyíre cut the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:59.710
entire center will be opposites and so what
youíre making is a double hourglass, set

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.241
on point! 
How cool is that! Letís go over and iron

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:13.460
these so you can get an even better look.
So, we set our seams and then weíll lift

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:22.800
them up, and press them over to make this
lay flat. 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.930
I think if you had three of these blocks it
would make the most darling table runner.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:35.320
OK, so here we are back at the cutting table
with our nice pressed block, and we lay them

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.590
out, and you can see once again that this
is a double hour glass, set on point. Three

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.210
of these blocks with a little 3î sashing
around them would make the most darling table

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.080
runner ever. Now weíre going to have Natalie
show how to cut it from the right handed side,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.639
because itís basically the same idea it just
takes a little bit different angle. So, weíll

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.949
have her come over and show that.

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.290
Alright, the only difference between a left-handed
and a right-handed cut is which side you start

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.020
on. So weíre going to do this from this side.
Just the same as she did this before. Lining

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:33.530
the fourty-five degree angle line up with
your seam, and making your cuts.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.250
OK, so now that youíve seen the left-handed
and the right-handed way. Letís see what

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.650
else we can do with these blocks besides the
double hour glass. So, we figure we can put

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:53.819
them together, and make the double square.
We could do something wild and crazy, and

00:06:53.819 --> 00:07:04.800
line them up so they make a kind of chevron
thing. We just never, I guess we can do all

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:13.139
kinds of things! So this is really a fun technique,
and itís something youíll enjoy thatís

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:20.340
quick! So, out of three strips of fabric weíve
been able to make two and a half blocks. And

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.840
it takes very little fabric to make this,
and youíll have a table runner in no time

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.820
with this tube technique. We hope youíve
enjoyed this from the Missouri Star Quilt

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.900
Company. Happy sewing!
