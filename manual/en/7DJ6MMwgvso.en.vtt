00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As for the zombies this time, well, you have to slash through an awful lot of zombies,

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:44.000
but yet in doing so the screen gets all messed up, too. It gets covered in splashing blood.

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.000
Entrails get splattered around.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.000
Despite all of that, you don't feel guilty,

00:00:53.001 --> 00:01:01.000
instead, you get a strange sensation that is somehow humorous.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:04.000
There's the idea of the kind of shambling zombie, arms outstretched.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:08.000
We wanted to keep that feeling. We didn't want them to be thinking.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:15.000
But at the same time there's a lot of fun to just have them be kind of really, really stupid.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.000
Ah… shit.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:34.000
We have the kind of elementally infused zombies. The ones that spit bile or the ones that are kind of infused with fire or electricity.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:45.000
Because it was ninjas vs. zombies, we originally had

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:52.000
zombies that were very orthodox and easy to understand.

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:57.000
With that alone, though, both the game and the story would be too simplistic,

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:01.000
so we had to come up with lots of ideas…

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.000
How can we surprise game users?

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:09.000
Like, how can we show zombies or zombie attacks that they have never seen before?

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.000
And what kind of zombies can we create in various kinds of situations?

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:18.000
We went through "trial and error" many times with the creation

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.000
of unique and wicked zombies.

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:34.000
I was very careful with the zombies, and I had some notions about them,

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:41.000
such as their being able to run or being kind of stupid – that's my idea of zombies – 

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.000
but in Yaiba, I moved away from that.

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:52.000
The reason is that in the world of comics, having interesting zombies

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:58.000
is more important than matching reality.

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:02.000
That's why the zombies are zombies, but there are several different types

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:07.000
with different features, such as being able to wield electricity or wield fire.

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.001
That's what I did with them, but what I consider most important

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:14.000
when it comes to zombies is comedic elements.

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:19.000
What's humorous about zombies is that even though they're very earnest, 

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.000
they're a bit stupid, and that's what's appealing about them,

00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:28.000
and this time, I placed such humorous elements throughout the game.

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.000
Placing these humorous elements throughout the game

00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.000
is a trademark feature of Inafune's zombies.

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:45.000
You know, we thought about how they would act in a horde and how they would act when they're by themselves.

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:51.000
And we kind of came to the whole idea that we could differentiate each zombie by giving them more of a unique personality.

00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:02.000
They kind of will get memory flashbacks of what their previous life used to be.

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:09.000
Our base minion zombies, sometimes they'll be walking down the street and they'll have a cigarette.

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:14.000
They know they used to smoke but they don't know how to do it, so it kind of plays into the comedy aspect of it.

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:19.000
And our sergeant zombies, which are kind of more of our miniboss zombies, their personality comes out a little bit more.

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.000
So we try to develop a whole background for them and where they came from.
