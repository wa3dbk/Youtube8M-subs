00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.221
Heterochromatin is a tightly packed form of
DNA, which comes in different varieties. These

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:13.209
varieties lie on a continuum between the two
extremes of constitutive and facultative heterochromatin.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.390
Both play a role in the expression of genes,
where constitutive heterochromatin can affect

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.980
the genes near them and where facultative
heterochromatin is the result of genes that

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.050
are silenced through a mechanism such as histone
deacetylation or piRNA through RNAi. Constitutive

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.370
heterochromatin is usually repetitive and
forms structural functions such as centromeres

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.480
or telomeres, in addition to acting as an
attractor for other gene-expression or repression

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.100
signals. Facultative heterochromatin is not
repetitive and although it shares the compact

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.340
structure of constitutive heterochromatin,
facultative heterochromatin can, under specific

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.899
developmental or environmental signaling cues,
lose its condensed structure and become transcriptionally

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.159
active. Heterochromatin has been associated
with the di and tri-methylation of H3K9 in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.290
certain portions of the genome.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.080
Structure
Chromatin is found in two varieties: euchromatin

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.450
and heterochromatin. Originally, the two forms
were distinguished cytologically by how intensely

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.189
they stained - the euchromatin is less intense,
while heterochromatin stains intensely, indicating

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.680
tighter packing. Heterochromatin is usually
localized to the periphery of the nucleus.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.430
Despite this early dichotomy, recent evidence
in both animals and plants has suggested that

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.881
there are more than two distinct heterochromatin
states, and it may in fact exist in four or

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:47.189
five 'states', each marked by different combinations
of epigenetic marks.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.659
Heterochromatin mainly consists of genetically
inactive satellite sequences, and many genes

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.970
are repressed to various extents, although
some cannot be expressed in euchromatin at

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.270
all. Both centromeres and telomeres are heterochromatic,
as is the Barr body of the second, inactivated

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.590
X-chromosome in a female.
Function

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.130
Heterochromatin has been associated with several
functions, from gene regulation to the protection

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.500
of the integrity of chromosomes; some of these
roles can be attributed to the dense packing

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.050
of DNA, which makes it less accessible to
protein factors that usually bind DNA or its

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.740
associated factors. For example, naked double-stranded
DNA ends would usually be interpreted by the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.820
cell as damaged or viral DNA, triggering cell
cycle arrest, DNA repair, or destruction of

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.370
the DNA fragment such as by endonucleases
in bacteria.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.690
Some regions of chromatin are very densely
packed with fibers displaying a condition

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.970
comparable to that of the chromosome at mitosis.
Heterochromatin is generally clonally inherited;

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.340
when a cell divides the two daughter cells
will typically contain heterochromatin within

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.510
the same regions of DNA, resulting in epigenetic
inheritance. Variations cause heterochromatin

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.790
to encroach on adjacent genes or recede from
genes at the extremes of domains. Transcribable

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.520
material may be repressed by being positioned
at these boundary domains. This gives rise

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.810
to different levels of expression from cell
to cell, which may be demonstrated by position-effect

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.940
variegation. Insulator sequences may act as
a barrier in rare cases where constitutive

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.100
heterochromatin and highly active genes are
juxtaposed.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.950
Constitutive heterochromatin
All cells of a given species that will package

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.170
the same regions of DNA in constitutive heterochromatin,
and thus in all cells any genes contained

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.350
within the constitutive heterochromatin will
be poorly expressed. For example, all human

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.900
chromosomes 1, 9, 16, and the Y-chromosome
contain large regions of constitutive heterochromatin.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.520
In most organisms, constitutive heterochromatin
occurs around the chromosome centromere and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.580
near telomeres.
Facultative heterochromatin

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.850
The regions of DNA packaged in facultative
heterochromatin will not be consistent between

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.510
the cell types within a species, and thus
a sequence in one cell that is packaged in

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.910
facultative heterochromatin may be packaged
in euchromatin in another cell. However, the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.150
formation of facultative heterochromatin is
regulated, and is often associated with morphogenesis

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.790
or differentiation. An example of facultative
heterochromatin is X-chromosome inactivation

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.060
in female mammals: one X chromosome is packaged
as facultative heterochromatin and silenced,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.760
while the other X chromosome is packaged as
euchromatin and expressed.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.260
Among the molecular components that appear
to regulate the spreading of heterochromatin

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.220
include the Polycomb-group proteins and non-coding
genes such as Xist. The mechanism for such

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.680
spreading is still a matter of controversy.
Yeast heterochromatin

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.001
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or budding yeast,
is a model eukaryote and its heterochromatin

00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:15.860
has been defined thoroughly. Although most
of its genome can be characterized as euchromatin,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.770
S. cerevisiae has regions of DNA that are
transcribed very poorly. These loci are the

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.870
so-called silent mating type loci, the rDNA,
and the sub-telomeric regions. Fission yeast

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.870
uses another mechanism for heterochromatin
formation at its centromeres. Gene silencing

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.260
at this location depends on components of
the RNAi pathway. Double-stranded RNA is believed

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.610
to result in silencing of the region through
a series of steps.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:52.181
In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe
two RNAi complexes, the RNAi-induced transcriptional

00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:58.410
gene silencing complex and the RNA-directed
RNA polymerase complex, are part of an RNAi

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:05.200
machinery involved in the initiation, propagation
and maintenance of heterochromatin assembly.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.660
These two complexes localize in a siRNA-dependent
manner on chromosomes, at the site of heterochromatin

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:18.139
assembly. RNA polymerase II synthesizes a
transcript that serves as a platform to recruit

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:25.510
RITS, RDRC and possibly other complexes required
for heterochromatin assembly. Both RNAi and

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.389
an exosome-dependent RNA degradation process
contribute to heterochromatic gene silencing.

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:39.190
These mechanisms of Schizosaccharomyces pombe
may occur in other eukaryotes. A large RNA

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.400
structure called RevCen has also been implicated
in the production of siRNAs to mediate heterochromatin

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.200
formation in some fission yeast.
