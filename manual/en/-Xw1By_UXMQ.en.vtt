00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:12.530
Hi, I'm Will, with PBteen
and this is our Redesign Style Tile System.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.929
We've updated our iconic modular system
with a new hanging mechanism that makes switching

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.109
out tiles
easier than ever

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.050
and it requires less holes in your wall to
hang.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.800
Most of our individual tiles measure 16 inches
square.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.590
Our new Over-sized Monthly Calendar measures
32 inches square.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.570
Our Classic frames measure 32 inches square
and house four tiles.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.390
Our 48 inch square set houses nine tiles.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.120
To install the system, first assemble the
frame

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.530
with the four side rails on a large, flat
surface,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:01:06.370
using two screws in each corner.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.240
Attach 3m Command Strips to the back of the
rails.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.000
Press fasteners together until they snap.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.550
Position the frame on the wall at the desired
location.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.380
Mark where the D-rings will fall.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.770
Using the paper template at the D-ring mark,
Use a level to ensure the template is properly

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.650
aligned.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.570
Tape or tack the template to the wall.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.190
Using a sharp pencil, mark the wall through
the template

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.060
at the location of the black dots.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.799
The resulting marks on the wall
are insertion points for your mounting hardware.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.920
For drywall, use supplied anchors.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.020
For wall studs, use the screws provided.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.010
Use the screw driver to secure a screw into
the installed anchor.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.440
Lift the frame so that the two D-rings, located
on the back panel,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.940
align and engage with the protruding screw
heads.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.999
Use a pencil to trace the inside border of
the frame.

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.620
Remove the frame.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.859
Next, attach the cleats that arrive with each
tile,

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:23.470
to the metal strips, using the barrel nuts,
provided with the frame.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.069
Using your level, measure where the first
metal strip

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.560
should be installed.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.469
From the frame marks, measure 29 millimeters
down

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.030
and 12 millimeters over.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.190
With a pencil, mark each location for mounting
hardware.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.219
Hold the metal strips against the wall so
that the four holes

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.430
align with the installed anchors or wall marks.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.620
Make sure that the aligned edge of the cleat
faces up

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.779
and away from the wall, and secure with screws.

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.379
The remaining metal brackets should be 16
inches apart.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.599
Repeat metal strip installation.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.599
Starting with the lower left, hang each of
your tiles

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.069
from bottom to top.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.139
Gently lower the product until the cleat on
the product

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:15.159
firmly engages the wall mounted cleat.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.709
The last step is the finishing touch.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.790
Layering the frame over your completed set.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.139
Firmly press on the 3m strips for a snug fit.

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.819
Now, you're ready to enjoy your new Style
Tile System.
