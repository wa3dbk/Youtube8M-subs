00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.559
The lighthouse generator is an amazing scientific
model.

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:10.059
For making this your require Neodymium magnets,
35-gauge insulated copper wire, old CD, and

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.049
a lot of other material.

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.960
Take 35-gauge insulated copper wire and wind
1000 turns on an old film can.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.910
Remove the coil and place a pen inside the
coil.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.660
Make a hole in the pen and remove the two
ends of the wire through the pen.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.040
Scrape the two ends of insulation and attach
an LED to the ends of the coil.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.830
Now you can see that the pen is inside the
coil and the two ends go through the pen and

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.180
are attached to the LED.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.420
Fix the LED to the end of the pen.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.810
This is the complete coil and the rotating
pen.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.790
If you spin two strong magnets near the coil,
EMF will be generated and the LED would light

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.790
up.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.650
Now take an old CD and cut three parts.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.150
You require two rectangular strips and a square
portion with the hole in the middle.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.250
Fix with glue the lid of a film can to the
square.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.580
Take a press button and fix the part with
the trough in the middle of a wooden base.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.200
Stand four wooden pillars as shown.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.230
Apply glue on the top of these pillars and
fix the square CD piece on them.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.130
It is through the hole in the middle that
the pen will come out.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.580
These are 4 strong Neodymium magnets.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.100
Stick 2 magnets back-to-back on a piece of
rectangular plastic CD.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:59.630
Make two such strips with two-two magnets
each and glue them on to the pillars as shown.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.990
This is the final foundation of the Lighthouse
generator.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.340
Now slip in the pen that the tip of the pen
sits in the press button.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.440
Ensure that the pen spins smoothly.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.010
This is the view of the Lighthouse generator
from all sides.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.310
On spinning the pen the coil will spin inside
the magnets and the LED will light up!

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.680
You can see this much better in the dark.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.450
If you spin the pen the coil spins between
the magnets and an EMF is generated and the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.450
LED lights up.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.629
This is a variation.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.730
Instead of a wooden base you can have a piece
of rubber and you can have 4 pencils.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:54.129
Once you spin the pen the coil rotates inside
the magnets and the LED lights up just like

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.510
a Light House.
