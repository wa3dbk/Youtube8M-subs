Hi, this is Bruce Lessels from Zoar Outdoor
on behalf of expertvillage.com, talking about

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.519
choosing and setting up a campsite. So you’ve
had a great weekend camping and now you’re

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.830
ready to take the campsite down. So the first
thing you’re probably going to do is take

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.060
your sleeping bags out and air them out, a
good idea is to pull them out of the tent

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.750
kind of lay them out on the ground for a little
bit, somewhere dry, this is assuming of course

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.140
that it’s not raining. Just let them air
out for a little bit before you roll them

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.920
up, we’re going to pull the sleeping bags
out and I’m going to pull the mattresses

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.710
out as well, the foam pads out, lay those
out and let those air out a little bit too.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.260
Once they’ve aired out for a little bit,
then you want to roll them up. With the rectangular

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.530
bag you often roll it up instead of stuffing
it, so I’m just going to fold in half. This

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.789
one happens to have a nice strap on the end
that I can use to pull the bag to cinch it

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.620
together when it’s rolled up. I’m going
to put it down on the ground and just take

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:14.009
and roll from one end trying to keep a fairly
neat tight roll.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.000
You can use your knee to compress it a little
bit if you want, once I get to the end I’m

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:34.420
going to put that strap around it and you
have a nice compact sleeping bag. A lot of

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.409
other sleeping bags you stuff in a stuff sack
and this is a compression stuff sack so this

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.350
is one that’s actually going to allow me
to make it even smaller once I’ve stuffed

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:50.770
the bag in it. When I’m stuffing a sleeping
I like to start at the head end, just start

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.770
putting it in the bag and it doesn’t have
to go in any kind of special pattern or order,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.439
you just kind of stuff it in there. This is
best for some insulation that don’t like

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:13.590
to be rolled up and actually you retain their
loft better by doing this. Once it’s stuffed

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.170
all the way in the bag I’m going to compress
the bag, tighten up the closure and use the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.150
straps on the side to make the bag smaller
and again it’s like I’m hike backpacking

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.720
or canoe camping and size is at a premium,
this is a great way to end up with a really

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.790
tight package and there’s my sleeping bag.
