00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.500
Based on the examples
in the last video,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.180
let's see if we can come
up with some rules of thumb

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.760
for figuring out how
many significant figures

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.260
or how many significant
digits there

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.350
are in a number
or a measurement.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.140
So the first thing
that is pretty obvious

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.140
is that any non-zero
digit and any

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.720
of the zero digits in
between are significant.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.930
Clearly, the 7 and the
5 here are significant.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.550
And the 0 in between them, it's
also going to be significant.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.900
So let's write this over here.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:37.940
So any non-zero digits
and zeros in between

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.020
are going to be significant.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.170
That's pretty straightforward.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.680
Now, the zeros that are not in
between nonzero digits, these

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.610
become a little
bit more confusing.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.740
So let's just make sure we
can rule out some of them.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.730
So you can always rule out
when you're thinking about

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.272
significant figures,
the leading 0's.

00:00:57.272 --> 00:00:58.980
And when I'm talking
about leading zeros,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.910
I'm talking about
the zeros that come

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.720
before your non-zero digit.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.670
So these are
leading zeroes here.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.220
These are leading zeroes.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.061
There is no leading zeroes here.

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:11.310
No leading zeroes in this
one, this one, and this one.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.200
But in any situation,
the leading zeros

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.960
are not significant.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.830
So leading zeros
not significant,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.830
I'll write it over here.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.180
Leading zeros not significant.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.320
And so the last question,
all you have left,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.389
I mean you only have non-zero
digits and zeros in between.

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:33.680
You could have some leading
zeros, which you've already

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.020
said are not significant.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.269
And so the only thing left
that you have to figure out

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:41.440
is what do you do with the
trailing zeroes, the zeroes

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.450
behind the last
non-zero, or to the right

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.820
of the last non-zero digit.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.680
So these trailing zeroes here.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.090
There's actually two
trailing zeroes over here.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.490
And then there's three
trailing zeroes over here.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.365
So let me make a little--
so trailing zeroes.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.066
Trailing zeroes, what
do we do with them?

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.440
So the easy way
to think about is

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.490
if you have a decimal, if
there's a decimal anywhere

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.550
in your number, count them.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.550
If you have a
decimal, count them.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.560
Count them as significant.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.790
They are significant,
count them as significant.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.790
If there's no decimal
anywhere in the number,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.810
then it's kind of ambiguous.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.190
You're kind of not sure
and this is a situation.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.980
So clearly over here, there's
a decimal in the number,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.560
so you count the
trailing zeroes.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.540
These are adding
to the precision.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.950
Over here there's a decimal,
so you count the trailing zero.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.580
There's a decimal here, so
you count the trailing zeroes.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.440
There are no
trailing zeroes here.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.960
And over here-- well, the way
I later put a decimal here.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.450
Here you would count it.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.940
So if you have
the decimal there,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.460
you would count all five.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.640
If you didn't have the
decimal, if you just

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.650
had 37,000 like
that, it's ambiguous.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.420
And if someone doesn't
give you more information,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.800
your best assumption is
probably that they just

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.779
measured to the
nearest thousand.

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.820
That they didn't measure
exactly the one and just

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.610
happened to get
exactly on 37,000.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.910
So if there's no
decimal, let me write

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.820
it this way-- it's
ambiguous, which

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.590
means that you're not
sure what it means,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.820
it's not clear what it means.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.755
And you're probably safer
assuming to not count it.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.310
If someone really does measure,
if you were to really measure

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.610
something to the
exact one, then you

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.810
should put a decimal
at the end like that.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.970
And there is a notation
for specifying.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.970
Let's say you do measure-- and
let me do a different number.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.270
Let's say you do measure 56,000.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.630
And there is a notation for
specifying that 6 definitely

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.360
is the last significant digit.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.990
And sometimes you'll see
a bar put over the 6,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.740
sometimes you'll see
a bar put under the 6.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.440
And that could be
useful because maybe

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.980
your last significant digit
is this zero over here.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.030
Maybe you were able to
measure to the hundreds

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.930
with a reasonable
level of precision.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.250
And so then you would write
something like 56,000,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.710
but then you would put
the bar above that zero,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.540
or the bar below
that zero to say

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.804
that that was the last
significant digit.

00:04:26.804 --> 00:04:28.220
So if you saw
something like this,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.910
you would say three
significant digits.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.170
This isn't used so frequently.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.850
A better way to show
that you've measured

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.800
to three significant
digits would

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.001
be to write it in
scientific notation.

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.250
There's a whole video on that.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.540
But to write this in
scientific notation,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:51.800
you could write this as 5.60
times 10 to the fourth power.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.397
Because if you multiply
this times to the fourth,

00:04:55.397 --> 00:04:57.230
you would move this
decimal over four spaces

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.630
and get us to 56,000.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.372
So 5.60 times 10 to the fourth.

00:05:02.372 --> 00:05:04.080
And if this confuses
you, watch the video

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.310
on scientific notation.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.640
It will hopefully clarify
things a little bit.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.300
But when you write a number
in scientific notation,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.440
it makes it very clear
about your precision

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.760
and how many significant
digits you're dealing with.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.426
So instead of doing
this notation that's

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:18.700
a little bit outdated-- I
haven't seen it used much

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.170
with these bars below or above
the high significant digit,

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.080
instead you could
represent it with a decimal

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.970
in scientific notation.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.540
And there it's
very clear that you

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.797
have three significant digits.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.130
So hopefully that helps you out.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.380
In the next couple of videos,
we'll explore a little bit more

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.870
why significant digits are
important, especially when you

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.010
do calculations with
multiple measurements.
