00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.589
(singing) Woah, I got

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.000
the washboard blues...

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.930
It's time to wash my clothes...

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.699
It's time to pay my dues!

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.470
I got them washboard

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.309
buh-buh-buh-buh

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.309
blues...

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.679
Stay Cheap!

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.079
Hey! I'm Jeff Yeager, the ultimate cheapskate and host of The Cheap Life!

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.760
Nobody likes to do laundry! Not only is it a chore, but with every load of wash,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.260
you're sending a basket full of your hard earned cashola right down

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.170
the drain. Want to cut the cost of doing your laundry,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.450
and get more and less tear-

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.350
out of your expensive clothing?

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.790
I'll make rags out of that later.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.559
Laundering your clothes less often and in cold water only,

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.899
and then drying your duds on old fashioned clothes lines can save the average family

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.579
of four more than five hundred bucks a year!

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.030
Plus, your clothes will last even longer, which means even more savings.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.679
You know, laundering is way tougher on fabric than wear and tear. Kinder,

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.560
gentler, less frequent washing can extend the life of your favorite frocks by up to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.570
fifty percent.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.920
Here's a tip. Turn bold colored garments inside out to reduce

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.740
fading.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.829
And always zip up jeans and anything
else with a metal zipper before

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.479
you launder them. You know those little metal teeth tear up other garments in the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.890
wash, like a miniature chainsaw. LJ: Now that I've got your attention,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.329
keep watching for a chance to win a $50 gift card!

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.490
It's time for a Cheapskate Shout-out! One of my miser advisers has an

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.310
inexpensive recipe for making her own

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060
laundry detergent out of Borax,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.540
washing soda and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.590
dish soap!

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.550
It's dirt cheap and your clothes will smell delightful!

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.520
Click here to find her recipe! This sud's for you!

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.780
You can save even more by making your own fabric softener.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.040
Just mix one cup of baking soda,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.459
with one cup of water

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.069
and then slowly add six cups of distilled white vinegar.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.069
Cool! It's like Mount Cheapsuvius! Then just add seven more cups of water and viola!

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.399
Fancy and frugal fabric softener.

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:30.289
Add one cup of this brew to the final rinse cycle of your wash, and you'll

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.739
have unmentionables worth mentioning.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.129
And if you just must buy these silly fabric softener sheets, after you've used them

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.340
whatever you do,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.299
Don't Throw That Away!

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.779
Of course, fabric softeners can be re-used a couple of times a piece

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:47.710
in the dryer.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.200
And even after that, you can use them as handy household wipes or stick them

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.079
between books on the shelf to prevent
mildew.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.509
Or put them in your shoes or clothing that you have in storage instead of mothballs.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:03.009
You can even shove them in your vacuum cleaner to freshen the air,

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.579
and reduce dust. And here's one you may not have heard before: hang fabric softener

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.379
sheets near outdoor lights

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.229
to keep mosquitoes, moths and other
flying insects away at night.

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:19.159
So, speaking of moths, a guy walks into a dentists office and says: "Hey Doc!

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.709
You gotta help me. I think I'm turning into a moth!"

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.379
The dentist looks at the man and says: "Sir, if you think you're turning into a moth,

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.709
you really need to see a psychiatrist. I'm a dentist!"

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.189
To which the guy says:

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:40.189
Yeah, I know. But your light was on! *rimshot followed by various boos* Is this thing on?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560
I'm Jeff Yeager for The Cheap Life!

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.899
Stay clean and stay cheap!
