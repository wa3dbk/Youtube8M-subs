Hello I'm Maggie Roberts and I'm the
director of veterinary services for Cats Protection

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.280
welcome to this course. Do you
think that humans are from Mars and that cats are from Venus?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.820
UFO understanding feline
origins. This may seem like a strange title

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.360
but what makes our domestic pets
what they are today? Are humans and cats so very different?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.960
Cats Protection is the
UK's largest feline welfare organisation

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.920
with our three objectives: the re-homing
of needy cats, the support and promotion

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.440
of neutering and the provision of
education on cats and their care.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.520
We do this via our staff and the thousands of volunteers in our adoption centres and branches all over the UK.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.740
Cats Protection has a single and clear vision

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.720
A world where every cat is treated with kindness and an understanding of it's needs

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.800
This may seem obvious but this vision is
entirely dependent on the widespread

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.560
understanding of cats needs. In the past
often cats have been misunderstood or

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.500
misrepresented, they were tortured and
persecuted in the Middle Ages and even

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.590
today it's not just those who claim not
to like cats but often those who work or

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.240
have cats don't fully understand their
needs.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.720
In order to fully understand the species Felis Silvestris Catus (today's domestic cat) and understand it's

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.039
behaviour and it's needs, we must not only look at today's cat but also look at

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:01.439
it's ancestry; it's place in the ecosystem
and how it came to live alongside man
