00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.890
We are taking a look at the men's and women's
Bushido trail running shoe by La Sportiva.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.610
This is a fully featured light weight trail
shoe that I can see being great for someone

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.970
who is hiking or just fast backpacking with
more of a minimal mindset.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.480
It is not a minimalist shoe by any means,
but La Sportiva has, you know, put some features

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.649
on this trail shoe that makes it really stable
for how light weight it is.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:40.160
The most interesting feature about this shoe
is a TPU frame that kind of starts here on

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.739
the upper part of the shoe and connects to
the midsole seamlessly and actually wraps

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.559
around the bottom of the shoe and around the
other side.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.969
So that gives a lot of stability in the shoe
and just makes a really dialed in fit as well.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.000
The rest of the upper part of the shoe is
basically a really light weight mesh.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.119
And so, you own, it is one of the first things
that struck me about this shoe is that the

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.409
mesh is really flexible.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.450
It is really comfortable.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.770
And they have even put some overlays on the
shoe in key areas where you do need a little

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.439
bit more durability, you know, here on the
heel, you know, here on the toe.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.670
There is a really nice toe cap, you know,
on the front of the shoe to protect against

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.810
rocks and that sort of thing, but right above
your toe area, you know, if you are moving

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.369
fast, if you are running, it is going to breathe
really well.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.219
Should the shoe become wet, it is going to
dry out really fast.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.270
Taking a look at the tongue, you have a nicely
padded tongue here, so if you do need to cinch

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.689
down those laces, it is comfortable against
your foot and just really soft material inside

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.689
the shoe.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.220
I mentioned the laces.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.420
You have sort of an asymmetrical design on
the laces so, you know, fit your foot anatomically

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.840
and you can really dial in the fit.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.040
The outsole of the shoes has really aggressive
lugs.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.630
And they actually come up the round and they
come up into even the midsole of the shoe.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.450
So, against mud, against loose gravel, you
are really going to have a lot of traction.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.470
Starting at the bottom you can really see
that La Sportiva's impacta brake system is,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.100
you know, something that is really going to
give you a lot of traction on ascending and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.930
descending, you know, when you need that extra
traction.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.370
But, all in all, this shoe has an excellent
balance of weight and stability.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.760
It is going to give you a lot of confidence
on the trail on your next trail running adventure.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.750
It is the Men's and Women's Bushido trail
running shoe by La Sportiva.
