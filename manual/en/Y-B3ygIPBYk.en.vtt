00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.640
I'm Alexis van Herkman

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.420
and welcome to Resolve in a Rush,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.900
where you'll learn DaVinci Resolve

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.400
grading and finishing techniques

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.780
in under 5 Minutes.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.600
In this episode

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.840
we're going to take a look at how you can create animated titles

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.280
inside of DaVinci Resolve

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.680
without having to go to any other app to do it.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.120
So let's get started.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.260
If I open up the Toolbox,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.640
and you can see I've got some title pages

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.580
that I can pull up, these are

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.020
simple generators.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.840
So I'll edit two of them into the Timeline

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.340
and, if I double-click any of these

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.040
I go straight to the Inspector.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.100
I will edit the text,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.940
with the title of this project,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.980
an unwanted job is the name of the project,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.840
and so now selecting each one of these items

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.460
in the Timeline

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.520
as long as I have my Transform

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.360
handles turned on in the viewer

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.220
I can go ahead and just drag these

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.400
around

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.600
where ever I want them to be.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.740
And with each one of these objects selected,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.580
I can go over here and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.520
select the text and change the font

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.540
to something a little more inspiring,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.500
change the size, all the standard stuff that you can do.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.160
So now I've got a pretty good start,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.040
on my title sequence,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.720
but, of course, it's not yet animated.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980
So I'm going to go to the frame

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.180
where I want this text

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.040
to stop moving

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.520
and if I scroll down in the Inspector

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120
you can see that I have all my

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.620
Composite and Transform controls handy,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.260
so what I'm going to do is key frame Pan and Tilt,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.880
that's X and Y.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.860
I'm going to select this item and maybe offset

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.380
the animation a little bit

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.860
and again, I'm going to scroll down,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.620
and I'm going to key frame Pan and Tilt.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
Now, once key framing is started,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.800
for both of these layers,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.600
all I need to do is move my playhead

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.820
to the beginning here

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.520
and drag

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.400
these layers where I want them to fly in from.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.720
and now as I play,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.600
I've got my animation.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.120
Now I don't have caching turned on just yet,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.460
so my performance isn't great,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.340
but you can see I've got the animation

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.720
that I want.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.520
Now by default this is a simple linear animation,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.060
so if I want to jazz this up a little bit

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.980
I can click these little handles,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.300
on the video tracks,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.280
I'll shrink the video tracks down just a little bit.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.960
I don't need them to be this tall.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.020
and when I do that you can see I expose

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.260
my key frame editors.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.140
If I click the little curve button,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.400
inside of the key frame editor

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.540
now I've got a curve editor.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.520
and inside of the curve editor

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.280
I can select any point and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.480
set it to be a bezier handle to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.680
create some smooth motion.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.860
I'm going to do that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.280
in the bottom most piece of text as well.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.940
So I'll select the key frame,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.780
I'll click the bezier handle button,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.200
to turn this into an incoming smoothed key frame,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.200
and now, you can see I have some nice eased motion.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.380
I want to make sure that

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.260
I get both key frames eased

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.480
and to do that

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.500
I have a little popout menu up there that lets me choose

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.520
which curve I'm looking at,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.260
and I want to do the same thing up here.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.360
Just toggle those off and on

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.580
so I can see the other curve.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.260
So once I've added handles to both X and Y,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.580
I can see that I've got

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.420
my sequence just easing into a stop.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.660
At this point I can close the editors.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.860
If I hold the shift key

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.180
I can drag these up without moving them,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.780
and I can go in here and try and find

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.100
a nice opening shot that I had before.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.500
Grab that car,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.620
coming in underneath,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.000
and you can see how those titles

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.420
integrate with the rest of the scene.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.240
Now at this point if I want those to fade away,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.080
I can cheese out, just add a couple fast dissolves,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.200
or, if I really wanted to be fancy,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.700
I could go back into the Inspector

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.860
and using key frames,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.440
I could simply animate the opacity handle for both of those.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.660
I hope you found this useful.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.640
If you want more information

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.560
on working in the edit page of DaVinci Resolve

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.820
I strongly suggest you check out

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.660
my Editing in DaVinci Resolve 11 title

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.600
from Ripple Training.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.240
Thanks so much for watching.
