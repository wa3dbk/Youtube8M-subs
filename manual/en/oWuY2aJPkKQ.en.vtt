00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.250
Now I've got a beautiful little baby corn
snake here. This guy's a little bit older

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.620
that a hatchling. You can see he's also a
Colubrid, part of the family. He's a long,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:21.069
skinny-type snake. A little bit more flighty
and fast. He does want to run away a little

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:24.849
bit. Corn snakes tend to be pretty tame, pretty
docile. You can see he's holding on to my,

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.999
that's another great example of a use of a
tail by a snake. He's, he can hold onto me

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:34.290
right like that, and put his whole body weight
on there if he needs to. But, like I said,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.440
these guys are very, very common all throughout
the United States and northwest. They are

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.940
called corn snakes because they're often found
in corn fields, feeding on mice and things

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.280
like that. They come in a wide variety of
color variations now. There's lots of designer

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.590
species out there you can get your hands on.
This one has a, one of my particularly favorite

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.259
colorations. This nice, deep red is, I find
very attractive. You can see he's sniffing

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.749
around frantically with that tongue, flicking
it about, checking out what's going on. Making

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:17.380
sure there's no predators around, or no prey.
Maybe he's hungry, though this guy did eat

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.810
not too long ago. At this size, he is eating
"pinkies", little baby mice, and he's eating

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:32.429
roughly two to three of them a week. He definitely
likes to pack in the food. So, just like we

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:39.889
were talking about with the rainbow boa, if
I can get him to chill out for one second,

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:51.189
that's where his tail starts, right there.
You can see the sudden change in width. It

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.999
very quickly drops down. His vent is right
there on the bottom. He really does not want

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.420
to chill out for me at all. Not trying to
bite me, though, you'll notice. They're very,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.710
very tame in that sense. He doesn't want to
bite me. Snakes don't want to bite, it's their

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.479
last line of defense, really. He'd much rather
run from me than bite me, because if he bites

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.470
me, he's invested in our fight, and chances
are, against any mammal for the most part,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.450
I'm going to win, as I have lots of teeth
and claws.
