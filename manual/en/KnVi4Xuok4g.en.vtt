00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.230
Today in our 2012 Nissan Frontier, we'll be
installing the draw tight hitch part number

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.319
75282.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.950
This is what our hitch will look like once
it's installed.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.059
Now we'll go ahead and give you a couple of
measurements to assist you in selecting accessories

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.460
for your new hitch.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.850
From the center of the hitch, pin hole to
the out most edge of the bumper is 3-1/2 inches.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.220
From the top of the receiver, tube to the
ground is 17-1/2 inches.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.320
This will assist you in selecting accessories
such as a draw bar, a bike rack or a cargo

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.630
carrier.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.980
Now lets go ahead with the installation.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.410
We have a total of six attachment points.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.320
There will be weld nuts in the frame, three
on the drivers side and three on the passengers

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320
side.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.559
Before we put our hitch in place will want
to go ahead and clean out the weld nuts because

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.920
over time theyll build up with rust, dirt
and debris.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.670
To clean out the weld nuts, well be using
a half inch nylon tooth brush, part number

00:00:49.670 --> 00:02:11.349
814092 and 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:22.020
spray lubricant.
