00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.050
 Hello boys and girls. This is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.990
Callled, "A Special Coat"

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.980
Today's memory verse is from Matthew 7:11

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.380
Its says, "“Your heavenly Father will give good things to those who ask him”

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.810
The message for today's story is: God gives us good gifts because He loves us.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.170
Think about a favorite gift your mom or dad has given you.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.300
Joseph’s father gave him a special gift.
Think about a favorite gift your mom or dad has given you.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.060
Joseph’s father gave him a special gift.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.060
 And so did God.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.720
Joseph stuck his whole head down into the water

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.950
[laughter]

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.500
He came up sputtering and laughing.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.220
The cool water felt so good!

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.180
Taking care of sheep all day was a dusty business.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.660
Joseph shook his head back and forth.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.340
Little drops of water flew everywhere.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.340
"HEY!"

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.820
"Watch what you’re doing!”

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.070
His brother, Reuben, yelled at him.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.070
“Where is my son Joseph?”

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.570
Jacob had many sons, but he loved his son Joseph most

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.390
Father Jacob was old and his young son gave him a lot of happiness.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.250
Joseph wasn’t like his 10 older brothers.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.230
They quarreled, and sometimes caused their father problems.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.180
But Joseph was gentle, and he always told the truth.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.840
He was full of joy and he made his father smile.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.820
Joseph hurried to see what his father wanted.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.580
Jacob had a special gift for Joseph

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580
A beautiful new coat.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.720
Made from many different colors, it was the kind a ruler or other special person would wear.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.360
Joseph slipped his arms into the coat.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.420
He ran his hand over the soft fabric.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.900
“Thank you, Father,” he whispered.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.660
He especially liked the bright colors.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.270
Joseph’s big brothers frowned at him.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.650
Why was he so special?

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.180
Why did he always get presents from their father?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.200
The jealous brothers grumbled among themselves.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.360
One night Joseph had an unusual dream.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.250
The next day he told it to his brothers.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.670
“We were in the field tying bundles of wheat together."

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.670
 "My bundle stood up, and your bundles of wheat bowed down to mine.”

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.790
“Do you really think we would ever bow down to you?” his brothers scowled.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.100
Again, they grumbled among themselves.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.690
Later, Joseph had another dream.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.980
“I saw the sun, the moon, and 11 stars bowing down to me,” he said.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.940
Father Jacob gently scolded Joseph.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.630
“Do you really think that your mother and your brothers and I will bow down to you?” he asked.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.920
No one understood what Joseph’s dreams meant.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.350
But Jacob did not forget.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.980
Years later he would remember and understand.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.540
Joseph was blessed to receive many gifts from God.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.570
God blessed Joseph with the gift of dreams that he would one day understand.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.520
God guided Joseph’s mind and gave him good thoughts.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.750
God loves you and blesses you with many gifts too.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.270
He gives you good thoughts.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.790
He will always help you do the right things.
