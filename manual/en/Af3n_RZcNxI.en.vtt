00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.180
(Choir sings) “We are marching in the light
of God.”

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.740
Betty Henderson : “We came out of

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.550
St. George’s Methodist Episcopal Church.
And the name ‘Mother’ is significant because

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.240
we birthed five other churches.”

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.240
For 220 years, Mother African Zoar United
Methodist Church has nurtured her community.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.350
Zoar served African Americans in Philadelphia
as a stop on the Underground Railroad; the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.320
first well-baby clinic for African Americans;
a school; and a source of credit for home loans.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.399
Betty Henderson: “We have a long history
of being conscious of educational needs, social

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.710
needs and the economic development of our
community.”

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.730
Betty Henderson is a lay leader and the church’s
chief historian.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.730
Betty Henderson: “Francis Asbury did the
service of institutionalizing or forming of

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.829
Zoar. The early pastors were assigned to Zoar
through St. George’s.”

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.260
The story started in 1787.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.349
(Reenactor yells) “The board met last night
and they decided, move now!”

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:21.619
African-American members of St. George’s
Methodist Episcopal Church were forced apart

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.380
from the white congregation and tensions flared.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.469
(Reenactor speaks as Richard Allen) “A little
more than 200 years ago, in this gallery,

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.469
in this very church from which the walls and
floors were crafted with our own hands,

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:40.149
we were humiliated.”

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.979
The rift led some to leave. Others like those
who would later start Mother Zoar, stayed

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.439
because of the denomination’s support for
the abolition of slavery and commitment to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.059
ministering to the marginalized.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.579
Betty Henderson: “We were the remnant that
remained and stayed within the fold of the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.729
Methodist Episcopal Church.”

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.729
Tindley Temple United Methodist is a proud
child of Mother Zoar. The Rev. Robert Johnson

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.659
says his congregation respects those who persevered.
Rev. Robert Johnson: “We call it the ‘Mother

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.030
Church’ or ‘Mother’s House’ because
those were the ones who really started the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.780
African-American movement and empowerment.
We’ve never left. It’s kind of strange

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.040
to me even now. We’re sitting in a product
of the folk who stayed."

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.640
"Because we stayed, this was built.”
(Congregation prays) “One God, who lives

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.909
and reins forever and ever. Amen.”
As with all historic churches, over two centuries

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.230
Mother Zoar has seen times of decline and
of renaissance. But her presence remains a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.989
comfort to her community.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:00.469
Betty Henderson: “Even though people are
not coming to institutional churches as they

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:09.640
did, it is still key to bringing a community
together. And if something goes wrong, the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.250
first place they come is to the church. It’s
still vital in the African-American community.”

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.520
(Congregation sings) “Let us find our rest in thee.”
