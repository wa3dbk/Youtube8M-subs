6 Copywriting Tips For Beginners

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.360
Hi, this is Jesse from StartCopywriting.com
and in this episode, we’re going to talk

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.580
about really 6 copywriting tips that you can
use if you’re a beginner, you’re wanting

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.430
to learn copywriting.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.600
Tip #1: Write Lots Of Headlines

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.530
Now, you’re probably only going to use only
1 headline in the copy you’re writing but

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.719
write lots and lots and lots and lots of headlines
because your headline is the most important

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.769
element, the most important piece of copy
in your entire ad. If it doesn’t grab people’s

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.699
attention, get them interested, they’re
not going to read the rest of your copy. So,

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.420
write lots of headlines until one really stands
out to you and really grabs your interest

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.309
and that will be the one you use.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.120
I’ll give you right now a simple template
for writing headlines. One I’ve used over

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.110
the years and that is “How To (Benefit)
Even If (Obstacle)” or you could replace

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.740
‘Even If’ ‘Without’. So that becomes
“How To (Benefit) Without (Obstacle)”.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.850
Now all you need to do with whatever copy
you’re writing is to insert the benefit

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.050
where it says benefit and the obstacle which
is whatever obstacle your readers are going

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.270
through into a headline and that’s going
to help you. For example, it might be “How

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.890
To Buy A House Without A Bank Loan”.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.450
Tip #2: Understand Your Reader And Understand
Your Audience

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.020
You really shouldn’t sit down write any
copy unless you could intimately understand

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.940
your reader. And you want to know things like
what keeps them up at night, what are their

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.810
problems, what do they really, really want
but they’re not getting and of course how

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.320
you could help them. So, do some basic research
on your prospects, on your ideal customers,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.530
on the people who are going to be reading
your copywriting. Understand them deeply before

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.119
you sit down and that way you can ensure you
hit all the hot buttons when you’re writing.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.650
Tip #3: Make Specific Claims

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.450
Too many times in copywriting, we make big
claim but it’s not very specific and therefore

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.170
isn’t very believable. Basically, with any
claim you make, you want to see if you can

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.129
also be specific in your claim because that’s
going to make people believe that claim. Copywriting

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.860
in a real basic nutshell is making claims
and then proving that those claims are true.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.450
So an easy way to do that is to make your
claim specific. And we do that by:

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.810
using numbers
using statistics

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.219
using any kind of numbers you can in your
copy

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.540
An example of being specific might be instead
of saying “How To Lose Weight With This

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.019
New Program”; you might say “New Program
Guarantees You’ll Lose 7 Kilos In 7 Weeks”.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.269
Tip #4: Use Proof And Use Evidence In Your
Copy

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.580
Again, there’s so much mistrust in the world,
there’s so much advertising out there that

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.709
we stop to switch off and we also don’t
believe a lot of what we’re reading. What

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.769
you want to do is backup your claims with
proof.

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.249
Now, there’s so many ways you can use proof,
I like to call them credibility indicators.

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.989
Some of those might be:
testimonials

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.169
case studies
photos that demonstrates your product in action

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.810
there might be statistics
there might be... if its proof about you and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.340
that you’re an expert, it might be any qualifications
you have, any achievements you could talk

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.840
about and things of that nature

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.809
But at the very basic level, you should be
including case studies and testimonials and

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:49.849
even statistics or anything that add weight
and adds proof to your claims.

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.169
Tip #5: Tell Your Readers Where To Go!

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.309
Now, I’m not being rude, what I mean by
that is tell them what you like them to do

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:03.779
next and that’s having a strong call to
action. Too many times in copy, they have

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:08.680
no call for action or very basic call for
action or too many options, too many calls

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.310
to action and as a result, people just don’t
know where to go. What you want to do is make

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.290
it clear, make it obvious, tell them precisely
what you want to do when they order, when

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.760
they buy or when they register or whatever
it is that you want to do, tell them where

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.760
to go.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.760
Tip #6: Add Scarcity / Urgency In Your Copy

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.830
My final tips is add scarcity and add a sense
of urgency in your copy. Basically, what will

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.510
happen if people don’t take action of that
you’ve described to them, what will happen

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.460
to them if they don’t take action, how will
they lose, how will their life basically stay

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.460
the same.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.800
You may use scarcity and urgency when:
it’s a limited time offer

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.360
it’s a special discount for a limited time
you may only have a certain number of seats

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.590
in a seminar
you may have a limited amount of stock that

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.590
you’re selling

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.880
Whatever it is, have that urgency, have that
scarcity but more importantly, have a reason

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.020
for that urgency, have a reason for that scarcity
and make sure it's real, don’t make things

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.700
up that are not true.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.950
