Hey guys! What's up! My name is Kunal Daswani
I'm a professional photographer

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:04.819
based in India

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.059
today I'm going to show you, quick white background product photos

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.810
using stuff lying around at home

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.770
lying around at home and natural light

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.530
Let's get started... boom!

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.130
so here's my set up so far I've got my
product placed on four A4 sheets

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.760
which I've taken from my from my printer

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.940
one's just taped to the foam board to give it that seamless look

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.580
and we are about two feet from the
window

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.700
Time for the fun part... the shooting!

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.760
I'm gonna just use the default app that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.220
comes with the iPhone though there are better apps and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.820
as you can see it's looking pretty good on its own, just with the right light

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.300
I'm going to tap to focus and bring the exposure

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.810
to where I think it looks good

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.360
and click!

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.240
I also think that there might be a little too much shadow  on the right side of the product

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.020
so I'm going to take another A4 and fill in those shadows

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.420
It's all stuf lying around at home or in the office

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.060
