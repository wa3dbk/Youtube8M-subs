The R1 has a hot cue feature which is similar to that found on the CDJ-2000nexus. The hot cues allow you to jump to any point in the track without interrupting playback.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You’ve got a hot cue section on each deck and to use it make sure you’re in hot cue mode and then when a track’s playing just press A B or C.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:39.000
When they’re recorded the buttons will light up.  I’ve recorded a kick, a high hat and a clap. What we can then do is when the track’s playing we can press one of these buttons and it will instantly jump to that point in the track.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When you do set these The R1 will save them.  If you use CDs it will save them to the R1’s memory and it will save 3 per CD for up to 1000 CDs. The rekordbox USB key that I’m using will automatically save hot cues for up to 3 per track for any of the tracks you’ve got on there.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Once you’ve got these hot cue points saved we can recall them later so I’ll load the same track on to this deck here and once that’s loaded in just press the call button and then the three cue points will flash, just press each one of those to load it in. Exactly the same as it was here; I’ve got a kick a high hat and a clap.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:43.000
If you want to change them, or just re record it if it’s a bit wrong, just hold down shift and then touch the cue point you want to delete. If I want to delete A the light then turns off and I can either just hit the button again to re record it or I can scrub through the track and find the exact point that I want.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So that’s all been set there.

Because they have been saved to the USB key, I can then take that USB key, plug it into rekordbox on my computer and then I can re import those cue points into my rekordbox library.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So if I click on devices, when my USB key shows up just right click and click update collection. It will then bring those cue points back in so just to prove that we’ll go into collection, load the track up and then you can see the cue points are there.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We can then use rekordbox as well to recreate those cue points. I can press the ‘X’ button in the hot cue section just here to delete them and you’ll see them deleted from the waveform up here. I can re record them in the exact same way, just as the tracks playing press A, B or C and the shortcut for that as well is function 1, function 2 and function 3.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You can re record it or I can scrub through the track manually or I can use the cursor keys to get really accurate if I want as well. Then just press the hot cue buttons.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Once it has been recorded if I re export that track back to the USB key I can then take that USB and plug it into the R1. Go back into devices and click eject. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
For the R1 as well it will create a library fort that device. There’s more information about creating libraries in our rekordbox tutorial.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I’ll click eject and its now creating a library, once that’s ready ill plug it back into the R1.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This USB key will work on any of our other rekordbox ready gear as well, we can then load the track and then once we’ve called those cue points they’re all going to be reset from where they’ve been set within rekordbox.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It’s as simple as that you can create them on the R1 or you can create them in rekordbox.
