How to Make a Coin Battery.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.020
Sure you could take $2.50 and just buy some
batteries, but how much fun would that be?

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.939
You will need 10 quarters Some cider vinegar
A piece of blotter paper Some Aluminum foil

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:28.029
An L.E.D. light A little salt 2 small pieces
of 16 gauge wire Scissors and a pen.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.029
Step 1.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.079
In a bowl, mix the cider vinegar and some
salt.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.079
Step 2.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.829
Cut out ten quarter-sized pieces of blotter
paper.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:45.940
Step 3.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.969
Tear off ten quarter-sized pieces of aluminum
foil.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.010
Step 4.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.800
Soak the blotter paper in the vinegar/salt
mixture for a few minutes.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
Step 5.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.710
Time to build the battery.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.610
Start with a piece of foil, then a piece of
blotter paper, then a quarter.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.369
Keep stacking in the same pattern: foil, paper,
quarter… foil, paper, quarter…

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.270
Until you’re out of quarters.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.560
Make sure the foil is only making contact
where it’s supposed to.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.450
If it’s touching more than one quarter,
or another piece of foil, your battery may

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.490
not work.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.630
Step 6.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.729
Let the battery charge for about 15 minutes.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.000
Step 7.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.439
Touch the LED’s negative lead to the bottom
layer of foil, and the positive lead to the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.360
quarter on the top and presto – you have
light.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.250
Did you know This method of generating electricity
was discovered in 1800 by Alessandro Volta.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.329
His voltaic pile was the first wet cell battery
to produce a reliable steady current of electricity.
