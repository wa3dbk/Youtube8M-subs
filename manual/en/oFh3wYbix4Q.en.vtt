00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.140
LG GM750.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:19.980
The LG GM750 is a Windows Mobile 6.5 smartphone,
very closely related to the existing GM730

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.770
handset.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:29.369
Featuring a 3" 240 x 400 pixel display, a
5 megapixel camera with autofocus and LED

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.579
flash, 3.5G support, WiFi and GPS, the new
GM750 shares almost every hardware feature

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.980
with its predecessor.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.160
The main difference is that the GM750 comes
with Windows Mobile 6.5 Professional preloaded,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.309
where the GM730 is a Windows Mobile 6.1 device..
although it can be upgraded.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.839
Looking closely at the scant available information
on the GM750, it looks like is also has a

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.120
larger 1500 mAh battery and possibly a slightly
improved screen.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.160
Inside is the same Qualcomm 528 MHz processor
that powers the vast majority of Windows Mobile

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.480
smartphones.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.450
So what's all the fuss about?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.330
To be honest, it's hard to say.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.710
Windows Mobile 6.5 is definitely an improvement
over the earlier version, but we understand

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.250
that GM730 users can upgrade the operating
system if they want.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.580
As with most recent LG Windows devices, this
comes with the S-Class user interface which

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.930
makes it nicer to use.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.570
There are certainly rival phones that are
just as good as this though.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.280
Just in case you're not familiar with the
current version of Windows Mobile, then we

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.490
should say that it is a significant improvement
in terms of usability over older versions,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.570
and it comes with "pocket" versions of Microsoft
Office applications, plus support for Microsoft

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.420
Exchange push email, a capable multimedia
player (plus an FM radio), and a wide variety

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.730
of other applications can be bought and downloaded.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.610
The LG GM750 can also talk directly to social
networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.780
Flickr and Picasa and it also supports YouTube
and other video sites.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:23.700
The GM750 comes with HSDPA data with a maximum
download speed of up to 7.2 Mbps, or alternatively

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.750
you could use the GM750's WiFi capabilities.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.420
LG say that the phone measures 109.8 x 53.5
x 12.9mm which is a bit more compact than

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.210
the iPhone, but it does come with a smaller
display.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.900
The LG GM750 is exclusive to the Vodafone
network until the end of the year.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.120
Prices range from about â‚¬380 for a SIM-free
version to free when taken with a contract.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.720
It does seem to offer pretty good value for
money when you consider the specifications,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.740
and it is a useful addition to Vodafone's
somewhat moribund lineup of phones.
