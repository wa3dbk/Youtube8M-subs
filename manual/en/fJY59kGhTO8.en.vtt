00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.400
Hi this is Jamie from POSGuys.com reviewing
the symbol ls4208. This is one of our favorite

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.709
scanners because it has great ergonomics,
an aggressive scan engine, it's very durable

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.960
and it has a rasterizing laser.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.699
This scanner has great ergonomics because
it is easy to pick up without regripping,

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.910
it also has a two finger trigger

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.599
and it is very light weight and well balanced.

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.599
The scanner also has a unique rasterizing
option in which it has a set beam for a set

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.440
amount of time and then it begins to rasterize
if it doesn't pick up a read.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.440
This scanner you can have a rasterizing option
or you can set it as a set beam option.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.760
While in the stand this scanner is also very
aggressive in that you'll start with a steady

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.250
bar and if it doesn't read anything it will
begin to rasterize.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.690
It is also very fast.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.690
It still has a good range.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.790
This scanner comes in an industrialized version
as well as the LS3008. It has the same scanning

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.790
capability as the ls4208 and it comes in yellow.
The difference is that it has an IP54 seal

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.670
which allows to be used in dirty and dusty
environments and it can get wet which makes

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.080
it easy to sanitize.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.050
It is good for hospitals an clinics where
you would need to sanitize equipment.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.780
For those of you that need more durability
this scanner also comes in a wireless model

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.980
which is the ls4278. It has a rechargeable
internal battery that will last all day and

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.680
a 70 foot range.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.769
With great ergonomics a great scan engine
good durability and a rasterizing laser this

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.519
is pretty much as good as it gets for high
volume environments such as a grocery store

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.069
or a convenient store.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.680
For those with more industrial needs you have
the ls3008 which is the more industrialized

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.769
version of the scanner. Or for those who need
more mobility there is the ls4208 wireless

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.879
version.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.129
This scanner comes ready to go out of the
box. It has usb, keyboard wedge and serial

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:46.159
interfaces and it comes in black or beige.
