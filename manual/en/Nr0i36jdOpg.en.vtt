00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.100
Today on our 2006 Acura TL, well be installing
the Tow Ready T-One Connector, part number

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.340
118489.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.869
First well need to open up the rear cargo
door.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.650
Then well be removing the rear threshold.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.969
To remove the rear threshold, well go ahead
and clip open the spare tire access door,

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.359
and then using a trim tool or flat-blade screwdriver,
get underneath the threshold, and pull up

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.560
popping it free from its fasteners.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.890
If the fasteners happen to come dislodge from
the threshold, we can simply remove them and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.890
reinstall it.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.800
Now well go ahead and set that aside for reinstallation
later.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.989
Next well need to remove the multiple fasteners
to secure the carpeting behind both taillight

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.510
assemblies.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.230
Once we remove them, well be able to pull
the carpet back to gain access to the wiring

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.660
that runs to both rear taillights.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.290
As you can see here on the driver side, there
are two plugs that go into the rear taillight

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.290
assembly.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.940
Well remove the top smaller plug and the larger
bottom plug.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:03:02.700
Then we can take our new Tow 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.530
Ready harness.
