00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.990
The next step in our living room project is
to paint the trim. We are going to use the

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.380
semi-gloss for that, which is exactly what
it says, it gives a real nice shine to it.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:26.519
As oppose to the wall, which is a flat.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.960
Now, we have a full can of pain there, and
we want to avoid drips as much as possible,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.870
so I recommend emptying out a fair amount
of the paint, so you have about a third left

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:53.180
in the can. And you can just set that aside
for when you need it. Now, I am going to do

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.110
this by hand without relying on any help,
as far as drawing a line, but if you don't

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.220
feel confident you can use painter's tape.
You can get this at any hardware store, and

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.150
what you want to do is cover the areas that
you are concerned getting the trim paint on.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.140
Now, this is going to be black on black, but
we are just going to pretend that it's more

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.200
contrasting color, if you want to put some
on the floor, and that way, you'll avoid getting

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:35.460
any black paint on your wood floor. Again,
to avoid drips, you want to give your brush

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.250
a little shake like that to get off any excess
stuff, you don't want a lot of paint on your

00:01:40.250 --> 00:02:21.459
brush when you do this. So we are just going
to start off on the edge.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.690
You want to let the brush do the work for
you, don't push it too hard. If it's a good

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:39.940
brush, it will just do what it should do.
If you do by chance get a drip, it's a good

00:02:39.940 --> 00:03:01.530
thing about latex paint, it will come right
off, especially on a wood floor.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.000
Keep in mind that this is only that first
coat, we are going to be another one on. So,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:40.141
like the walls, if you don't get everything
the first time around, you'll get it the second.

00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:46.980
The trim is a little different because you
are working very precisely and slowly, as

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:57.340
oppose to the walls and the ceiling, and you
really want to make sure you spend the extra

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.349
money and get yourself a good brush, makes
all the difference in the world.
