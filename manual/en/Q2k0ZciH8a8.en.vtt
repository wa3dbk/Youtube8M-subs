00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040
Affordable high performance smartphone fever is far from over.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.220
And one of the most highly anticipated is Xiaomi.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.500
I know that you guys must have been waiting for this one...

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.080
Xiaomi... Oooops! Xiaomi Mi 4i!

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.540
We love Xiaomi Mi 4i design.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.020
The backside material is plastic with matte finishing which similar to Redmi 2.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.020
Thanks to flat surface of the backside, Mi 4i is only 0.8 cm thin

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.900
and its 130 gram of weight and 14 x 7 cm dimension makes it easy to use with one hand.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.880
Xiaomi Mi 4i has a unibody design.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:18.340
This phone has 2 SIM card slots that support dual 4G LTE network and no microSD slot.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.000
Despite the US$150-230 price tag, Mi 4i has a mid-high class look.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.420
Its has adjustable backlight on the menu button

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.040
and a colourful LED notification near the front-facing camera.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.360
Finally, we can taste the MIUI 6 and Android Lollipop 5.0.2!

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.880
The 64-bit support from the OS improves RAM management on this phone,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.220
we never miss any BBM or WhatsApp notification anymore while we use it.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.820
MIUI 6 in Mi 4i consumes 1-1.2GB of RAM

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.260
but there's no significant difference compare to the previous version.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.100
It still has soft display, hundreds of themes, lots of fonts options and other additional features.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.120
On Display Settings menu, there are options to enhance colour and contrast of the display.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:30.520
User can also choose One-handed mode which shrink the display size in two available options; 3.5 or 4 inch.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:40.960
Responsiveness is the ultimate improvement that we feel compare to the same MIUI in Redmi 2.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:51.500
We rarely have delay notification and force close issue while using Mi 4i.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.980
The octa-core CPU Snapdragon 615 and Android Lollipop

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.060
makes a perfect combo for delivering maximum performance, thanks to 64-bit support from the OS.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:15.900
In addition to that, Mi 4i is powered by Snapdragon 615 second generation CPU with 1.7GHz clock speed.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.300
Xiaomi Mi 4i also equipped with 2GB RAM to support the processor performance.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.660
It also has 16GB internal storage with 12GB available for usage.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.300
The display is comfortable for browsing, gaming and watching video

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.020
thank to its 5 inch IPS panel display sporting Full HD resolution and 441 ppi screen density.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.600
It also brings a perfect viewing angle even in slanting position.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.360
The Sunlight display feature will automatically adjust colour tone

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.980
without increasing brightness which saves battery.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.500
Full HD resolution push the GPU to the limit when rendering graphics, especially in playing games.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.000
Some HD games like Goat Simulator, Mortal Kombat X, and Implosion can run smoothly

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.080
but there's a bit lag on Reckless Racing 3. We also run benchmark test to reveal its performance.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.620
Mi 4i scored 39358 points on Antutu 5.7 benchmark and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.080
scored 5682 points on 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme benchmark.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.020
Xiaomi managed to cram 3120 mAh battery into Mi 4i slim body

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.000
which will give this phone up to 12 hours life with two active SIM cards.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.120
Mi 4i is great device in terms of design and battery capacity.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.111
On the flip side...

00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:58.411
the heat generated when playing games quite high, exceeding 40Â° Celsius.

00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:02.931
Accesories like casing is very useful to reduce the heat.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.360
Mi 4i main camera has 13 MP resolution, f/2.0, and dual tone flash.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:20.760
The 2.0 aperture is very useful in capturing image with short depth of field as well as in low light condition.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:28.860
There are manual options available for White Balance, Shutter Speed, Focus and ISO up to 3200.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.680
There are also 2 other features,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.160
Refocus to create image with short depth of field and HDR to create a high contrast image.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.420
The front-facing camera has 5 MP resolution with Age Detection and Beautify feature.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.200
It locks object and capture images pretty fast...

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.320
but takes about 2-3 seconds to switch from the main camera and vice versa.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.060
Here's some images and video we captured in the highest resolution.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.980
There you have it, Xiaomi Mi 4i review.
