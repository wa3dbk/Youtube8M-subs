00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.390
Ok this is just a brief introduction to the
differences between the types of paint that

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.860
you might run into at the store. We've been
dealing with acrylic which and the base for

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.340
acrylic is an acrylic polymer. It's basically,
everybody uses the same pigment in other words

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.930
its ground up earth or it's ground up Cobalt
to make the color and then they suspend it

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:33.730
in a vehicle in acrylic it's, it's polymer
emulsion. In water color it is, it is gum

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.870
Arabic and watercolor is known, watercolor
never gets opaque. It's never going to completely

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.170
cover anything up and so watercolor is really
about playing around with the water in the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:00.559
color. And another thing that watercolors
do and I'm going to see how this one works.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:10.430
Watercolors also can be granular so I'm going
to put down a big part of this. They can be

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:21.399
sedimentary colors so that you can kind of
start to see separating in here, drop a thing

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.009
of water in here, see this is what I like
about watercolor, you drop in the water and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.100
you start moving the pigment around. Can't
really do that with acrylic it, if you do

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.640
that with acrylic, if you water it down too
much you ruin the vehicle and it isn't going

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.279
to stick to your canvas. But watercolor is
made for this sort of thing and it's made

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:46.469
for making edges and it's made for this sort
of sedimentation which is an affect you don't

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:56.100
get anywhere else. You can get an opaque watercolor
it is called Guasch and it goes on, it's a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.929
lot like watercolor, I mean it's, it's not
going to be plastic it's going to dry very

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:07.569
flat. It's not going to have a sheen but it
is basically opaque and if you want an opacity

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.780
that you want to play around with some of
these water issues you can do it with Guasch.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.790
You can certainly water down Guasch and get
watercolor affects but you can also get a,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.910
an opaque affect so that's the difference
between those medium.
