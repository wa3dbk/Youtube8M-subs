00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.790
Hi, this is Matt Saternus for Plugged In Golf
and in this video I'm going to review the

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.670
new Nike VR Forged Pro Combo irons.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:14.950
Let's get plugged in.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.710
The Pro Combos iron set is really two iron
sets in one.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.460
This is basically because Nike understands
that better players want more control and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.320
precision in their short irons but they still
need a little more forgiveness in their long

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.320
irons.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.730
So from the 3 to the 6 iron, you have pocket
cavities and from the 7 to the pitching wedge

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.010
you have split cavities.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.190
The looks of the VR Forged Pro Combo irons
are very consistent all the way through the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000
bag from the 3 iron all the way through the
pitching wedge.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.540
And that looks is pretty much what a good
player or aspiring player is going to want:

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.550
thin top line, relatively thin sole, and modest
offset.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.420
The feel of these irons is pretty much what
you'd expect from a forged players iron.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.620
It's nice and soft on centered hits, you get
good feedback of where you hit the ball on

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.659
the face, but what's most impressive about
this set is that the feel is perfectly consistent

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.049
from the 3 iron through the wedge.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.380
What you would have expected, or what I expected,
was that the pocket cavity clubs would feel

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.420
different than the short irons, but they don't.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.430
Nike has used a polymer, what they're calling
a shot making goo or gel, and they've filled

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.119
the cavity so that feel is very consistent
even when you're switching from the pocket

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.570
cavity clubs to the short irons.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.630
Now the performance of the short irons in
this set is excellent.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.830
You get a lot of ball control, you can control
trajectory very easily, shape shots very well,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.049
but what really sets it apart from similar
irons in its range are the long irons, the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.860
3 through 6 iron where they have the pocket
cavity.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.580
Personally, I play 5 through pitching wedge
because I hit a very low ball so a 3 and a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.909
4 iron don't make sense for me because I don't
get good distance gaps, but with these irons

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.440
the ball launches 2 degrees higher compared
to my clubs with the long irons so I could

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.420
actually play 3 through pitching wedge and
have real distance gaps all the way through

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.550
because those long irons are getting up on
a much more playable trajectory.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.630
In addition to that, they are a little more
forgiving, you can hit it a little bit thin,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.900
a little toe, a little heel, and still get
a pretty good result.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.970
With that, you're not really giving up anything
in terms of control of the ball.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.650
If you want to hit a little cut, a little
draw, you can still do that even with the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.200
long irons, so to me, you gets lots and lots
of benefits from playing this combo set without

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.150
really giving anything up.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.670
The other thing that Nike did really well
was picking a great stock shaft for this.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.720
They're using the new DG Pro which is a flighted
iron shaft.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.879
It's meant to help get those long irons up
in the air a little more while keeping the

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.890
short irons down.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.550
It's a great shaft, it feels really good,
and pairs really well with what this iron

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.310
head, this iron set is trying to do.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.830
