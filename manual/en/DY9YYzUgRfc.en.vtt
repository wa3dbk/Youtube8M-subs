Kinder Playtime!

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.860
(children laugh)

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.120
Hey Kinder Playtime friends. Today we got the My First Thomas and Friends. Let's open it.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.980
Now we builded it up.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.140
Thomas and Percy come with this set. Percy is my favorite.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.240
Whoa, it's got a spinner on top.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.560
Let's open the gate for Percy.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.040
(Jacob laughs)

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.280
(Jacob laughs)

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.360
Hey Percy, let's get those baskets at the end of the ramp.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.080
That was fun. Let's do it again.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.580
Thomas, my brakes are broken!

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.020
Oh no, Percy. What are we going to do?

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.900
We'll save you. Come on down!

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.940
Ahh, thanks for saving me.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.180
It's a good day that we have good friends.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.800
This is a cool track for little kids. My favorite was the spinner on the top.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.240
Thanks for watching, bye!

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.480
