00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.390
Erica: Hi, I'm Erica. I have been working
at Crutchfield for almost two years now. I'm

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.559
slowly getting into car electronics. You really
can't help it if you work here. You kind of

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.960
have to. So I've been thinking about putting
a new car stereo in, but it's a little intimidating

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.760
for me. I don't know a whole lot about it,
but everyone here has made me very excited

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.800
about the great sound that you can get and
all the cool things you can through your car.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.529
So, I've decided I'm going to put one in and
today Deb is going to help me do that.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.780
Deb: Okay, the first thing I do is get the
Crutchfield MasterSheet. Page one. I check

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.340
and make sure I've got all the tools that
I'm going to need. So for your radio removal,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.030
you're going to need a socket and ratchet,
and you're going to need a trim panel tool.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.750
So I got two, just to make sure we have the
right ones. And then we go to page one and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.489
just follow the instructions step by step.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.949
Okay the first step is to set your parking
break, which we've done. And then you want

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.930
to disconnect your negative battery cable.
So pop the lid off of your battery.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.040
Erica: Okay.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.730
Deb: Now you want to set it on something that's
not metal so it doesn't ground out.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.730
Erica: Okay.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.730
Deb: Then we want to get in the car. So you
see your nice diagrams. Figure 1 and 2, right

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.300
here. What you want to do is get your trim
tool...

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.300
Erica: Okay.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.820
Deb: ...And just start prying out all around
down here. And you see the...there's two screws

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.420
here and two screws on the other side. And
you're just going to pull those out. Okay,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.580
screws are out!

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.580
Erica: Yea!

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.380
Deb: Alright, we're going to disconnect the
power outlet to give us a little bit more

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.980
room to pull out the radio, so it just is
a simple unplug.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.980
Erica: Okay.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.900
Deb: And just lay that down like this and
just slide out your radio. Much easier, don't

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.900
you think?

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.000
Erica: Yes, much easier.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.150
Deb: Okay, then you want to disconnect. Here,
I'll hold that while you pull. Unplug everything.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.590
Right there. Alright and you want to unplug
your antenna.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.390
Erica: Here's the old stereo, it's now out.
And we're ready to put in the new one.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.110
Deb: This is the parking break wire. So this
is going to enable you to actually watch the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.780
DVDs while the car is in park, the parking
break will have to be engaged. This black

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.950
wire that's hanging out here is for your GPS
antenna for your navigation. We previously

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.030
installed the antenna on the roof and ran
the wire the length of the car all the way

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.020
back. So it's under the upholstery, under
the carpeting. It looks much nicer that way.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.100
These your going to plug in, plus you got
your antenna for your regular AM/FM and you've

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.000
got your factory plug. So what we're going
to do is plug all that stuff in.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.160
So this is the new radio, and this is a factory
sample, so we had to attach a wiring harness.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.370
Normally they're going to come with the Ford
plug already done, but we used a Crutchfield

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.040
plug and connected it together. So are you
ready to start plugging stuff in?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.740
Erica: I am, let's start.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.470
Deb: So we don't have to go through this.
We can just plug it in the back. Like so.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.470
Erica: Ah, got it.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.300
Deb: Because what we're going to do is set
the radio in this way and then pop the dash

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:13.110
piece over it. The black one's going to go
in right here. Alright, now your antenna should

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:22.320
slide in here. Okay, now following our instructions
it says, connect everything. Plug the antenna

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.830
into the rear of the receiver. We're going
cram all of our wires back here.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.750
Okay, so we reconnect the battery and tested
it to make sure that it works. That way if

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.030
anything's not connected properly it's pretty
easy to fix. So it does work and now we just

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.540
pop the dash back in. We've got it mounted
and ready to pop the dash piece back on.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.540
Erica: Alright.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.620
Deb: You've plugged in your power outlet,
so that does work. Then just pop in on in.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.630
Just use pressure.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.630
Erica: Ta-da!

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.680
Deb: Ta-da! And you've done your first stereo
installation. Yea!

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.170
Erica: How exciting.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.830
Deb: Final step: Reattach your battery.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.740
Erica: Just going to tighten it up. Okay.
You just tap it very lightly and I can change

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.760
the channels on the radio.
