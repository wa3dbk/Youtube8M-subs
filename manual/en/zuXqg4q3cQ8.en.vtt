00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.769
So here's the world famous pink and green
lawn mower. Pink for these wheels

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.609
(this thing started out life as a Barbie Jeep)
 and green for this battery

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.609
(doesn't use any gas). It's, uh, got little bumpers.  I'll
show you how those things work. It's got little

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.340
flaps, coated with aluminum so that when
they touch, the mower knows it's hit something.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.189
It's got a little control system -- a *really*
little control system: couple of NAND gates,

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:47.789
couple of timers, some relays, stuff like
that. And that's the basic mower that just

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.549
responds to the bumpers and the flaps.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:58.549
But it's also got -- I don't know if you can
see it -- some coils down here that listen

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.859
to my electronic dog fence, and a circuit
I got off the internet that reads those guys,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.400
and treats them just like the bumpers or the
flaps, so whenever it hits something it goes

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.360
in the other direction, until it hits
something and then it goes in the other direction.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.200
So...

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Let me turn it over, and take a look at the
cutters. There's three motors with little

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.200
plastic wheels [disks] on them, little razor
blades attached to the wheels [disks], and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.360
that's it for the cutting.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.530
There you can see the...what I salvaged from
the Barbie Jeep, the motors and the wheels

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.200
and the chassis.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.200
It's got an independent suspension, so it
doesn't get hung up too much. Here I'll show

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.320
you how that works. I don't know if you can
see it. Anyway, without this it gets stuck

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.659
all the time.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.740
So, that's, that's the mower. Let me plug
it in [connect it to the battery] and turn

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.960
it on.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.860
Oh, and one more thing I didn't show you...the
steering. Steering is mostly random; it's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.620
not controlled. But there is this little scrubber
here, so that when the mower's going forwards,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.010
it tries to turn the wheel to the right; When
the mower's going backwards, it tries to turn

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.319
the wheel to the left, so it doesn't go back
and forth over the same path all the time.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.049
All right let me turn it on.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:32.049

[Music: "Waltz of the Toddlers"]

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.920
Oh, it runs like this for about an hour. Maybe
an hour and a half. Gets most of the grass

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.920
in this yard. But, you know, it leaves a little
bit. I don't care about that. Eventually it

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.070
gets it all. This yard hasn't been cut by
anything else for about a year, so you can

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.180
see eventually it gets it all. But it doesn't
get the edges at all. You gotta do that with

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.430
a lawn mower. I'm not going to worry about
that
