Hey everyone, meet my new BFF, she listens really good

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.060
What's up ThreadHeads, it's getting hotter outside, so you know what that means

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.620
More t-shirt recons

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.700
So I'm gonna show you a really simple, no sew t-shirt recon that helps you turn an old

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.260
kinda baggy t-shirt into a beautiful adorned Racerback t-shirt

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.300
First, pick out the t-shirt you wanna use. 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.160
You want it to be loose fitting but not too large on you, and I like to work with 100% cotton

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.540
Then, I usually cut the collar off

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.620
And since this is a v-neck, it's gonna have a V shape.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.880
But this also works with shirts that have rounded collars

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.760
Now, locate the side seam, about 5 inches down from the armpit, and make an angled slit

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.540
I am a slit, Hehhehehe

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.760
Insert your scissors into one side of the slit, and cut up the side until you reach the top seam

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.980
Make sure not to cut too far in if you want full boob coverage

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.400
Next place a pin in the back of the shirt, indicating how far in you want the racerback to go

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.520
The pin should be about 4 inches down from the collar

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.180
Start cutting where you left off at the top seam, down the back like so, until you reach that first slit you cut

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.440
You can also cut the bottom off a bit if you're so inclined 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.600
Next make a small slit about 1/2 inch down from the back collar

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.320
Cut a longer slit about 1 in down from that small slit you just cut

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.180
and continue doing that down the length of the racerback

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.140
And you also wanna have them decrease in size as you reach the ending point you want

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.320
With the bottom slit being smaller than the rest

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.960
Then stretch out all your cuttings and it's time for the fun part

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.920
Ok, take this strip and loop it under the strip above

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.700
Pull it down, then loop the next strip through that loop, and so on and so forth

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.600
until you reach and loop the last possible strip

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.200
You can hand sew that last loop down with a needle and thread to keep it in place

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.360
Or you can cut a slit in the bottom half of the last hole like so

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.160
Then cut that last strip in half and tie each side to it's corresponding flap in the bottom hole

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.420
Just tuck those little ends in and that part is done

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.620
Lastly, stretch the sides of the shirt really good and go rock out to your favorite music festival

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.700
There's a ton of variations you can do with this design,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.160
You can choose to leave the racerback plain, you can choose not to weave the little strands

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.140
and just leave it kinda tiger striped

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.720
Whatever you decide to do, it's up to you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.080
That's what DIY is all about

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.880
Make it fit your style

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.440
