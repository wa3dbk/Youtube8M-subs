00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
*Red vs. Blue Theme Song*

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.560
CHURCH: Hi, how you doing? My name is Private LL Church,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.140
and I'm one of the actors on the popular web series Red vs. Blue.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.930
GRIF: And I'm Private Dexter Grif from the same show.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.440
CHURCH: But you know what, we are not here today to talk to you as world-famous actors

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.559
who also happen to be, you know, very good-looking

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.129
GRIF:That's right. We're here today to tell you how to run your life

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.020
CHURCH: You know a lot of you out there are probably considering getting a tattoo,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.909
or as the young people like to call it, a tat.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.940
GRIF: Or adding a tattoo to your already impressive collection

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000
CHURCH:So today we present to you a very special

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.320
Point/Counterpoint edition of Red vs. Blue

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.120
GRIF: Should you get a tattoo?

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.100
CHURCH: I think that, it's quite clear that you should not get a tattoo

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.539
And I can sum up my point in this elegant, but very simple bulleted list

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:04.830
Number one:

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.830
Tattoos are permanent

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.220
Number two:

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.420
You are a goddamn idiot

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160
And I'd like to prove this mathematically if I may

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.940
Take your current age,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.200
Now subtract ten years from it

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.600
Were you smart back then?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.000
Of course you weren't, you were a goddamn idiot

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.820
Fact of the matter is, you're just as big an idiot today

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.410
it's just going to take you ten more years to realize it

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.029
Now think if you had drawn a picture on your body ten years ago, would you be happy with it today?

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.360
Chances are you wouldn't be.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.200
GRIF: Unless it was cool, which brings me to my main point.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.740
Tattoos are cool

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.740
As long as you avoid the following rookie mistakes, you'll be just fine

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.980
The barbed wire ring:

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.269
Nothing says 1998 quite like a barbed wire ring around your bicep

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.300
You'll look like a defensive lineman and if you get the tattoo you're probably about as smart as one

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.780
The band logo:

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.989
Any band logo. Think about it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.220
the only Pop star to remain cool for more than ten years was Madonna

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.760
And you're not fooling anybody by getting a tattoo of her

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.260
CHURCH: Right.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.438
GRIF: Lastly and most importantly are the tribal design and the Asian character.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.079
No one gets it. Let's be honest-

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.389
You don't either. Someone had to explain it to you, and you have no idea if they were even telling you the truth

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.659
So avoid these simple pitfalls and a tattoo could be a wonderful rewarding experience

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.540
Except for the pain.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.340
CHRUCH: It's at this time

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.920
That I would like to point out that our friend Private Grif here has a tattoo on his neck.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.560
His neck!

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.450
In plain sight where anyone can see it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.760
From the movie Blade starring Wesley Snipes, right?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.600
It's Blade not Blade 2?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.620
GRIF: Actually it's from the comic book...

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.760
CHURCH:Yeah, that's great

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.720
I'm sure your boyfriend loves it.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.000
GRIF: In closing, be sure to choose wisely when getting a tattoo, don't repeat my mistake

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.900
CHURCH: Right. Listen, if I can't stop you from getting a tattoo

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.420
at least let me offer a good suggestion for a design.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.500
How about this?

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.409
Why not get a tattoo of your favorite character from your favorite online cartoon?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.180
I meant your other favorite online cartoon

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.630
Okay, you know what? Screw you

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.540
But seriously what do I care?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.180
Get a tattoo of an M16 in the middle your forehead, that would give Sarge a boner.
