00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.566
As our photographs are being printed, we have the 
option to add custom text as a Personalized Logo, 
or as a Studio Logo.

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:14.399
To add personalized text to our photographs, click 
on the Personal Logo button.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.500
By selecting the options from this dialog, 
personalized text will be added to the photographs 
at the time of printing at no additional cost.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.033
Choose how the logo is to be applied for the 
selected image; wallets only, all prints, etcetera.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:34.233
Next, choose the font for the custom text. Click on 
a font style, to see an example of how each font will 
print.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:44.099
Choose the color of the text. The default color is 
white. Next, select the location of where the text is 
to be printed. The default location is lower right.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.633
Finally, input the text to be printed on the 
photographs. Use one line, two lines, or all three 
lines to personalize the text.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:56.766
Click OK, and the personalized text will be printed 
on our photographs.

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:07.499
If the Foil Stamping Personal Logo option on Step 
1: the Start step was selected, we would finalize the 
foil stamping options in the Personal Logo dialog.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.033
We would specify the size of prints for the 
personalization, and input the text for the foiled 
stamped personal logo.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:20.999
The foil stamped personalization option is an 
additional cost.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.233
To have the studio’s logo printed on our 
photographs, the logo must first be setup and on file 
with Miller’s.

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:35.533
To setup a logo, we will need to create the logo as 
black text on a white background, and then save it 
as a JPEG, or a TIFF file.

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:39.433
Up to two logos can be on file, and ready to use for 
your studio.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:43.099
Next, email the logo image to the Miller’s Customer 
Service.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.333
Miller’s will process the file, and configure the logo 
so it will print correctly on any size photograph 
ordered.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:54.333
Once the logo is ready, Miller’s will store the logo 
for use on future orders.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:02:02.033
There is a small charge to setup the logo. But once 
setup, there is no cost to have your studio logo 
printed on the photographs.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:05.733
To add the studio’s logo to our photograph, click on 
the ‘Studio Logo’ button.

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:13.433
From the dialog, choose how the logo is to be 
applied to the selected image: wallets only, 8x10 
and smaller, etcetera.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:18.499
If this is the first time the studio logo is ordered, you 
will be prompted to input a key.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.033
The key will be sent via email once the logo is ready 
for use. Input the key, and click OK.

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:33.633
Next, choose which logo is to be used: Primary, or 
Secondary. Choose the color of the logo. White is 
default color.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:41.299
And finally, select the location where the logo is to 
be printed. Lower right is the default location. Click 
OK.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.966
As our photographs are being printed, the studio’s 
logo will be printed on the photograph as specified.
