00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Welcome to League of Legends Patch Preview

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.900
In this video we'll be covering some of the major changes coming into the next patch for League of Legends

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.900
Skarner is getting a huge suite of buffs in the next patch.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.900
What problems are we fixing?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.900
One thing about Skarner now that players have had a good chance to figure him out and get used to him,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.900
we wanted to see where he really stood versus where he needed to be.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.900
The main thing we wanted to change about him was his Crystal Slash had a scaling mana cost that went up as you ranked the skill

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.900
which constantly left Skarner out of mana and unable to do anything

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.900
We've flattened and lowered the costs accross all ranks

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.900
to make sure Skarner can always use the skill thats designed to be reusable and spammable.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.900
Skarners attack speed per level was probably a lot lower than where it needed to be

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.900
for a fighter who does a lot of auto attacking.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.900
We brought that up by a signigicant amount.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900
You know Skarner is using his Crystal Slash a lot and he's also auto-attacking

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.900
to bring that cooldown down. Without the attack speed per level,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.900
he's just not able to do the effectively as he needs to.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.900
Finally, we've increased the duration of Skarner's Ultimate Impale to better reflect it's ultimate nature.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.900
It is a hard CC and it does drag people around but it didn't quite have that,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.900
"This is my big skill, this is my marquee moment" feeling and I think that's what players

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.900
expect so we've increased that by a little bit.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500
We'll see where it stands after this and be evaluating from here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.900
Almost all of Hextech Gunblade's stats are getting hit in the next patch, what are the goals of this nerf?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.900
We've ran some math on Hextech Gunblade and the stats that you get from the amount of gold are frankly pretty insane.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.900
We took a look at that for these hybrid characters, you know the Akalis, Jax, those guys that are out there.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.900
They are getting so much gold value from this single item

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.900
that it just makes sense that they buy this and they go from "Hey, this guy was manageable" into "Holy crap what do I do now"?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.900
Instead of hitting any one thing significantly,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.900
we've tried to hit everything a little bit to make it so Gunblade still feels like the item that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.900
people are buying and have fun with but it's not quite as powerful.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.900
The other thing we did was really Dominion focused. We've made the Spellvamp

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.900
on Hextech Gunblade unique. What you're seeing on Dominion is this kind of skirmishy, dueling kind of game that goes on there, is people using

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.900
the Spellvamp to stack Gunblades to become essentially invulnerable to one or two targets at a time.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.900
We're seeing this again on Akali and Jax and also on characters like Cho'Gath

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.900
and other characters you wouldn't neccessarily expect to do this, that usually signifies a problem. That change will give

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.900
it the nerfs it needs on Dominion without us needing to effect it more on Summoner's Rift.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.900
Corki's Gatlin Gun is getting somewhat remade,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.900
instead of hitting for a percent of his total damage and having the number of hits scale per level, we're

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.900
normalizing it. It lasts 4 seconds at all levels, has an actual base damage

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.900
and now scales off of bonus damage instead of base damage. What are the goals here?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.900
Gatlin Gun is kind of an old school skill thats a little clunky and needs a little help.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.900
It has what we like to call a bad best case/worst case scenario

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.900
which means in some cases Corki's is just tearing through people doing tons of damage, shredding armor,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.900
doing all this stuff and other times you tap a guy with it once and it doesn't do anything.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.900
We don't like that about it, I don't think Corki players are particularily attached to that so what we did is instead

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.900
of making instead of making the duration scale as it goes up,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.900
we've made it a flat rate that's in the middle. We actually give it a base damage as well as

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.900
scaling and we've actually bumped that base damage up from derviving out of that total attack damage to its own value.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.900
What this does is not only gives it a buff in the now, but also allows us to tune additional knobs

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.900
and make adjustments to both of these things when balacing Corki so that we can make sure

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.900
Gatlin Gun stays a viable and not overpowered skill in the future.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.900
We have a number of changes coming in for Dominion, from game mechanics to personal score.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
What can players expect in the coming update?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.900
We do have some Dominion specific changes, you know a lot of people

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.900
have had a chance to play Dominion, get their impressions about it.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.900
Everybody does have their favorite strategies that they're starting to fall into now.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.300
While we do want the meta game to settle cause we think players

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.900
will find a lot of things to counter, things they may think are too strong now,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.900
there are some adjustments we want to do in the short term that we know

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.900
are problems. One new system we introduced into Dominion was the idea of personal score.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.900
The old kind of kill, death, assist ratio thing wasn't a good indicator of who was doing well on Dominion and who was doing poorly.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.900
We think that players really enjoy being able to measure themselves against the other

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.900
players in the game. The problem with personal score currently is that it doesn't reward all actions that make you successful as a team in Dominion.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.900
It really does a good job of rewarding offense and kills

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.900
but it does not do a good job of rewarding minion pushing or defense of points. Those are really

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.900
important actions in Dominion as I think a lot of people have started to figure out more and more as time has gone on.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.900
So what we've done is we've increased the amount of personal score you gain

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.900
by activiely defending points against opponents as well as increased personal score gain from pushing minions.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.900
This will mean if you're that player that goes bottom

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.900
and does the lane pushing and messes around bottom while your team teamfights top, instead

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.900
of coming out with a lower score regardless of your performance,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.900
your score will start reflecting your contribution to your team.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.900
One of the changes that looks smaller on paper that it acually is is ambient xp reduction.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.900
We've reduced ambient XP by about 10% for all characters.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.900
One thing we're seeing a lot on Dominion is hyper carries

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.900
and very rapidly scaling characters are seeing a lot of play and a lot of dominance on

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.900
Dominion and one of those things that is contributing to that is the inevitibility of a late game.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.900
This XP nerf is going to reduce the inevitibility of that into closer

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.900
or longer games so when you take a hyper carry champion, instead of being like "I know I'll get to this point and then I will

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.900
dominate", you go, "If the game gets to this point, I know I'll be stronger"

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.900
so Im kind of betting on a long game. This allows teams to develop strategies

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.900
around these hyper carries and around that different game length.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.900
We will be looking at this as a general balancing point in the future. We want to start

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.900
with the 10% XP reduction and we're going to continue to look at XP, gold,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.900
and other factors that are determining game length and scaling of characters.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.900
One mechanic in Dominion is that when you kill enemies, you reduce the enemy Nexus health.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.900
This works up until the enemy Nexus is at 125 health or lower

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.900
in which kills stop counting against it. What this change aims to do is to make sure that the early game matters,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.900
right now we're seeing a lot of teams get to the 125 to 125 state

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.900
regardless of the early game actions and we don't think that's a very good diferentiation of skill. We think; early game

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.900
should matter, mid game should matter, and late game should matter

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.900
and this changes one step in the direction of making that be completely balanced

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.900
and even. We'll be looking ar more adjustments as we go forward

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.900
but we think this is going to have a pretty major impact on making sure the most

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.900
skilled team wins every game on Dominion.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.900
