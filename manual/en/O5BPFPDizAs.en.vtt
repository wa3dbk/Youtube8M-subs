00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.180
Long time ago there was a merchant who was very rich.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.340
He used to go to far places at time to time to do his business.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.660
Once he set out for his journey...

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.800
putting a few eatables in his pocket.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.960
When he was coming back after finishing his business,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.320
on the fourth day of his journey...

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.360
he felt the heat scorching,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.080
so he branched from his road and came to a walnut tree..

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.800
where a fountain of clear water was running.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.800
He took some food, drank water and took some rest there.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.360
As he was taking some rest...

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.860
he saw a huge Genie coming angrily towards him.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.200
Arise and let me kill you as you have killed my son.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840
Sir, may I know what I have done to you,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.140
so that you have come to kill me.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.380
I shall kill you as you have killed my son.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.060
But how can I have killed your son,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.040
I do not know him and I have never even seen him.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.580
When you arrived here did you not sit on the ground?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.040
And did you not take some dates from your wallet

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.740
and whilst eating them did you not throw the stones about?

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.100
Yes, I certainly did so.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.380
Then I tell you have killed my son,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.200
but whilst you were throwing about the stones, my son passed by,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.140
and one of them struck him in the eye and killed him.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.720
So I shall kill you.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.320
Ah, sir forgive me.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.200
I will have no mercy on you.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.280
But I killed your son quite unintentionally,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.040
so I beg you to spare my life.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.760
I shall kill you as you have killed my son.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.960
One word more, I entreat you.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.120
Grant me a little delay.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.860
Just a short time to go home sir

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.400
and bid my wife and children farewell and to make my will.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.000
When I have done this I will come back here

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.780
and you shall kill me.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.800
But if I grant you the delay you ask,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.200
I am afraid you will not come back here.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.240
I give my word of honour...

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.000
that I will come back without fail.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.800
How long do you require?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.560
I ask you for a year's grace.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.700
I promise you that tomorrow after twelve months,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.420
I shall be waiting under these trees to give myself to you.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.400
On this the Genie left him near the fountain and disappeared.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.020
The merchant having recovered from his fright...

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.780
mounted his horse and went on his road.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.900
When the merchant arrived home his wife...

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.980
and children received him with the greatest joy.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.340
But instead of embracing them he began to weep so bitterly.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.500
Tell us, I pray you, what has happened?

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.920
Alas! I have only a year to live.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.960
Then he told them what had passed between...

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.349
him and the Genie and how he had given his word...

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.800
to return at the end of a year to be killed.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.600
When they heard the sad news they were in despair and wept much.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.500
The next day the merchant began to settle...

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.340
his affairs and first of all to pay his debts.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.480
He gave presents to his friends

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.640
and large alms to the poor.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.540
The year soon passed away

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.680
and he was allowed to depart.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.720
At length he reached the place...

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.060
where he had first seen the Genie,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.600
and on the very day that he had appointed.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.680
He dismounted and sat down at the edge of the fountain,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.700
where he awaited the Genie in terrrible suspense.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.000
Whilst he was thus waiting an old man...

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.600
leading a gazelle came towards him.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.020
May I ask you brother,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.600
what brought you to this desert place?

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.389
Where there are so many evil Genie's about.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.060
Oh sir! such is my faith.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.140
Then he told them what had passed between him,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.600
and the Genie and how he had given his word...

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.300
to return at the end of a year to be killed.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.680
This is the most marvelous affair.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.120
I sure glad to be a witness of your interview with the Genie.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.420
In the meantime another old man...

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.000
came there with his two black dogs.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.200
He also asked them what were they doing there?

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.780
He also got curious to know the fate of the merchant,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.900
so he also sat down there with them.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.820
In the meantime a third man with a she mule also came there,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.160
and he also sat down there with them in curiosity.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.640
They soon saw in a distance a thick smog like a cloud of dust.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.200
This smoke came nearer and nearer,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.200
and then all at once it vanished.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.580
And they saw the Genie who approached the merchant.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.060
Get up and let me kill you as you killed my son.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.380
Oh king of the Genie, I beg of you...

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.350
to stay your fury and to listen to me.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.320
I am going to tell you my story,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.360
and that of the gazelle I have with me,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.600
and if you find it more marvelous...

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.600
than that of the merchant whom you are about to kill,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.980
I hope that you will do away...

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.800
with a third part of his punishment.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.580
Scheherazade at this point, seeing that it was day,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.180
and knowing that the Sulan always arose very early..

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.400
to attend the council, stopped speaking.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.900
Wow sister, it is a wonderful story.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.700
The rest is still more wonderful and you would say so...

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.460
If the Sultan would allow me to live another day.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.800
Hmmm, I won't slay her until I hear some more of her wondrous tale.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.200
All this time the grand Vizier was in a terrible state of anxiety.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.400
But he was much delighted when he saw the Sultan...

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.120
enter the council chamber without giving...

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.260
the terrible command that he was expecting.
