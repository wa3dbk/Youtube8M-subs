00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.299
Hey guys.

00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:04.170
So for today's video I am really excited because
I'm doing something different.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.180
I
guess I could say that I don't do that often

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.720
and I'm kind of doing a Halloween inspired
hairdo so

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.059
if you're still looking for a Halloween costume
this is super easy and if you wanted to do

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.970
pinup
looks, but you're nervous because maybe your

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.150
hair doesn't feel like your strong point I
think that

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.359
this is a really great like hairstyle to start
with and the other cool thing about it is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.369
if you have
short hair like me you can still do this hairstyle.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.779
I would do a little bit of a tricks do in
this

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:32.779
hairdo.

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:36.080
If you've been watching my hair videos and
you've seen them over the years you know that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.870
shampoo and conditioner is like a really important
thing to me.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.070
So, if you're looking a really
great drug store shampoo and conditioner the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.620
Suave Professionals All Day Body Shampoo and
Conditioner is really awesome nurse.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.620
No parabens.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.710
They also help to bring body to your hair
if

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.039
you're someone who has troubles of having
body so I like to brush my hair out and like

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.480
I said it's
going to be really easy not like hairstylist

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.780
and I'm going to take a chunk from the front
of my

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.770
hair and just kind of grabbing whatever feels
right like this just kind of took a chunk

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.130
and I'm
going to brush this.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.210
So, once I have this hair separate I'm going
to take the TONI&amp;GUY, this is the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.650
casual collection, the Forming Spray Gel Spray
and this is like a gel that's going to help

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.270
the hair
stay in place, stay smooth, but it's really

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.720
light because it's a spray and you don't get
it all goopy

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.720
all over your fingers.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.500
So, I'm going to take this, this stuff smells
really amazing, I'm going to shake it up and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.410
I'm
going to really lightly spray and then brush

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.630
it back up again and I'm going to kind of
tease it, but

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.990
I'm using a brush so it's obviously not going
to be as dramatic.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.360
So, depending on your hair if
you may want to actually tease it, but for

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.970
me just adding a little bit of spray gel,
a little bit of

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.520
teasing with a brush is just fine, then I'm
going to take that hair and we're going to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.070
create a
really twisted to the back like this and we're

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.840
going to push forward to create a pretty dramatic
pompadour and you may have to mess with it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.970
sometimes to get it right.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.170
I know that I usually do
when it comes to like shaping my hair.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.670
I have to pompadour and then I'm going to
pin the hair

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.000
in place with a couple of Bobby pins just
kind of crossing it over the top, letting

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.620
the Bobby pins
replaced where my finger is where really just

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.730
like that.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.980
Alright, so once I have the pompadour up nice
and smooth I'm going to take my hair of the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.510
sides
kind of start prepping it osteoporosis pulling

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.480
it back and because I want to create a really
long

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.950
ponytail or like the effect of a long ponytail
I'm going to pull my hair into a half of half

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.981
down at
first so I'm going to take all this, pull

00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:43.423
it back and about halfway through is where
I went keep

00:02:43.423 --> 00:02:47.910
pulling it up and once you cut the hair back
and nice and smooth where you want it to be

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.840
I'm
going to secure in place with a hair tie pretty

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.360
high towards the top of my head and I'm going
to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.400
pull it up like this.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.730
So, you could stop here.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.880
You could kind of adjust to some things and
make

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.670
this a little smoother if you want, but I'm
going to keep going and I'm going to create

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.530
the illusion
like I said of a high ponytail.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.200
So, depending on how short your hair is you're
going to take the rest of your hair and need

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.360
to
pull that into a little mini ponytail or you're

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.740
going to do what I'm going to try to do which
is take

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.420
that half, that bottom half and then split
that in half as well so it's kind like you're

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.709
doing another
half of half down look because my bottom hair

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.910
is pretty short.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.190
So, taking this splitting that in
half and then wrap this ponytail around three

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.520
times because there's less hair here so it's
going to

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.740
take more two attach, then we have these little
pieces right here and I'm going to take care

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.740
of that
just by using Bobby pins and I'm going to

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.600
go under, I'm going to twist the hair and
I'm kind of

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.319
going to just pin the twist into place underneath
the other ponytail.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.990
So, it's going to take a little bit of fluffing
to try to blend them, a little bit of pulling,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.910
a little
pushing, then I'm going to take a bandana.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.430
This is actually dance bandana.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.380
I'm going to end up
going towards the side and make a little baby

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.190
bandana bow.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.332
I have a really massive skull.

00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:06.332
I
totally just walked in to the living room

00:04:06.332 --> 00:04:08.610
and Dan was like, I said, Oh, I did two ponytails.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.610
Is it
weird?

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.620
And he was like, What two ponytails?

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.700
He didn't even know they were two ponytails.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.840
So, then I'm going to take the Nexxus Comb
Thru Touchable Hold Finishing Mist.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.669
It's not
going to make your hair stiff, but it's going

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.989
to hold things in place and I'm going to lightly
mist

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.449
that all over my head and voila.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.650
Let me know down below if you guys like this
kinds of videos.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.930
