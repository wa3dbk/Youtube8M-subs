00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.169
The dynamic basic position is a pre-requisite for good skiing.

00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:17.536
With good basic position, skiing is easier

00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:24.960
The basic position should be considered as the skier's work position

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:32.609
Ideally, everybody should strive for a posture while all the body joints are slightly bent

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:42.837
Only slightly bent joints permit you to adjust your movements to the changing terrain

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.910
Avoid swinging your back and distending your bottom

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:54.108
It only locks you in and affects your balance

00:00:56.037 --> 00:00:59.769
instead, keep your hips forward

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.552
this will optimize your basic position

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:10.099
when you are in the right position you will find your weight and pressure lie in the front part of your feet

00:01:12.714 --> 00:01:16.920
To the best of your ability don't lean backwards

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:21.364
if you do, you will lose control

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:31.200
therefore move yourself forward

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.186
press your knees forward

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:36.657
and let your shins rest on the front of your boots

00:01:41.358 --> 00:01:45.293
Notice how the knees are pressed forward during skiing

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.922
if you are leaning backwards too much

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:54.733
use your arms to adjust your posture wile keeping them in front of you

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:56.834
it will help you to lean forward

00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:59.947
Your arms also help you keep balance

00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:02.400
So keep them where you can see them

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:05.400
If they are behind you

00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:07.847
the rest of your body will lean backwards

00:02:07.847 --> 00:02:11.703
and you will find yourself with your weight in the back of your ski boots

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:16.924
instead, if you place the weight in the front of your ski boots

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:20.937
keep your joints slightly bent and your arms in front

00:02:20.937 --> 00:02:23.839
chances are you will ski much better

00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:30.546
It's simply wrong that the skis should be kept close together

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:39.688
The best way to find your balance is to keep your skis about 10 to 15 centimeters or 4 to 6 inches apart

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:43.910
if you keep your skis too close together

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.088
your legs will be long

00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:58.728
An open stance empowers safe skiing and good balance on more difficult terrain

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:13.715
If you ski up straight without proper body movements you hurt your balance

00:03:15.783 --> 00:03:18.299
Get down into the basic position

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.138
this will give you the freedom of movement and enable you use your legs actively

00:03:31.442 --> 00:03:33.232
From the basic position

00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:35.881
you can easily absorb terrain

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:40.285
You won't be able to do that if you stand tall and stiff

00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:48.114
By absorbing the terrain

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:52.095
you will insure that your skis are always in contact with the snow

00:03:52.444 --> 00:03:56.108
This way, you can control direction and speed

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.346
Don't forget the right basic position is a pre-requisite for all good skiing
