Bailey: So it's showcase day, and my little
sister's about to perform. I'm so excited

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.190
to see what she's been working so hard for
this week. I have 2 younger sisters, and all

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.900
3 of us have done the RSI now. My middle sister,
she's now dancing at Disney, and the youngest,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.939
she's starting her own journey and I'm excited
to see what she's about to do. Both of my

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.570
younger sisters decided to try RSI, because
I came back with such a positive and uplifting

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.809
experience that they wanted to be a part of
it too.

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.760
Lindsey: This is my older sister Alex.
Alex: This is my sister Lindsey.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.730
And we're dancers from Kentucky.
Lindsey: We're staying in the same room together

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.469
and we're in the same group together which
is awesome. Then at night we go out and eat,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.219
go to shows together, so we're spending this
whole trip together, basically.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.129
Alex: It's awesome to have a sister who dances
with you, because it is a support system,

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.120
and you always know that there's someone who's
by your side and is having the same struggles

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.530
and the same hard work and someone's there
feeling it with you.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.380
Gloria: I'm Gloria.
Grace: I'm Grace.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.990
And we're sisters.
Gloria: I think it's nice to like meet new

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.810
friends, but it's also comforting knowing
that you have someone that you know and are

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.030
used to. I think growing up together and at
the same studio, we both share similar styles

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.450
and dance alike, and feed off of one another
and are used to dancing next to each other.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.729
sisters.
Ali: I love the summer intensive, it's amazing

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.869
being here with the Rockettes and going through
the process and how intense it is, and it's

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:26.979
even better having the support system of your
sister and going through it together.

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.240
Keeley: This is my little sister Autumn.
Autumn: Hi. This is my big sister Keeley.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.590
Watching her dance on stage, I usually ... it's
hard for me to watch her, 'cause I get nervous

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.710
for her. I can feel my heart start racing
and I start sweating for her.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.549
Keeley: When I watch you dance, you make me
want to cry sometimes. It's so emotional.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.790
It's 'cause she's my baby sister.
Autumn: It was nice knowing that she was in

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.790
the room learning the same exact thing I was,
so when we go home every night I think of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.090
it like, "Keeley! What do you do now?" It's
good to have her there, definitely.
