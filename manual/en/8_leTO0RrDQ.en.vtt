00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:09.330
Alright, as I turn around to my rear of the
machine. I'm ready to start digging. Remember

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:19.670
the controls; you have a boom up, swing, stick
in and out, bucket curl. Two little leavers

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.550
are stabilizers. Over here, your throttle
control set your engine at the speed you want

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.010
to operate. If you?re out doing fine work,
maybe not using as many RPM's as you would

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.160
if your doing heavier work. A lot of your
work would be at a medium RPM. Alright, were

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:51.059
ready to start so were going to put some RPM's
on it over here. Put our outriggers down,

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.370
stabilizers. Were sitting out of level, so
I'm going to put a little more on one side.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:10.840
Release the boom block and here we go. Boom
down as your stick out, roll the bucket out.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:24.060
You have to pull your stick in and boom up
at the same time. Then roll the bucket, boom

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.580
up, swing. Always remember that swing is pretty
quick. Lay the dirt far enough to be out of

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:52.150
the way. Alright, now we can get down a little
deeper here, maybe another cup. Always try

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:00.119
to keep your work on a pretty level dig. Makes
it much neater and much easier to stay at

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:14.219
grade. I'm going to roll the
bucket a little bit, pull the stick in, boom

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:33.849
it up and keep it about the same level. Always
remember in operating a backhoe, these leavers

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.459
will move a little or a lot. The more you
move the leaver the faster it moves. Sometimes

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:51.779
speed is not the main object, safety is and
accuracy, so speed comes with experience and

00:02:51.779 --> 00:03:00.299
anytime your operating a backhoe you need
to take your time until your really feel sure

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.200
of yourself before you add speed to anything.
