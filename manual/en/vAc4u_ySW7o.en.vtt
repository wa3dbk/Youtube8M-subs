00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.600
TLIF stands for transforaminal lumbar interbody
fusion.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.580
Those are fancy words for a lumbar fusion
or a low back fusion.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.660
We typically use the TLIF procedure for patients
who have spinal instability, patients who

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.450
have deformity or advanced arthritis of their
spine causing severe spinal stenosis.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.000
We do treat adult scoliosis.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.780
Many patients with adult scoliosis do not
actually need their deformity corrected.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.610
They just need relief of their leg pain or
some of their back pain.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.960
Many patients just want a better quality of
life.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.270
And by decompressing the nerve that’s pinched,
we can really relieve the pain down their

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.489
leg immediately or permanently.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.250
Sometimes we can use other devices besides
the fusion, but many times the TLIF procedure

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.190
will provide permanent relief by decompressing
the nerve and immediately stabilizing that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.760
portion of the spine.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.059
Through small, 1-inch incisions, we can perform
the TLIF procedure on an outpatient basis.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.170
Through the same incision, we then remove
the disc.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.590
Once the disc is removed, we will fuse the
area using bone.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.620
There’s a small structural implant that
provides immediate stability to the front

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.729
of the spine.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.850
This helps to relieve the pain and provide
immediate stability.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.490
We pack a lot of bone into the disc space,
and this is the key to the fusion actually,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.420
using the small implants are important.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.659
It holds the spine still while the fusion
consolidates.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.600
But the bone that is packed up front where
the disc space is, is actually the key to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.350
the success of the procedure.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.909
And we have a unique way to do that, is using
special instruments at Laser Spine Institute.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.249
We can provide the same stability as a large,
open back procedure but with very minimal

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:41.479
blood loss, very little anesthesia, and we
do it on an outpatient basis.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.689
Most patients return to their normal activities
in about six weeks.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.619
Some patients who have a more demanding job
may require a longer period of time — up

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.880
to 12 weeks.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.729
But the spine is immediately stable.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.280
They just walk out the same day.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.090
The pain they came in with is gone that day.
