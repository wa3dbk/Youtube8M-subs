00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.780
And absolutely useful new feature has been
introduced in 5.5 and really 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.629
the point is making our lives a little bit 
more easier where 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.430
the published setting have been really
expose us in our

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.230
properties panel so we can now change our
player version rate from without going

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.639
into another menu you could just go and 
change your Flash version and see what happens.

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:30.299
And you could also change action script
version that you want to code in and

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:34.339
obviously you can always click into your
edit and jump directly into all

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.479
these really fantastic stuff in 
cutting that need to go into

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:44.970
your file and then publish settings and your
publish settings go and change these properties

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.400
now if we are in our publish settings is
another thing that is introduced

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.140
and it kind of combined together and 
I actually really really love this.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.870
Much cleaner display.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.730
Nothing new here really the only thing that's 
really new here is the fact that you can now

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.480
create a SWC on its own without the
need to create an FLA files you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.129
create a SWC on the spot.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.700
But beside that it's really about
organization making it easier to get access

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.570
to all the things that you need to.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.290
Now one thing that is new which is I
think is absolutely sweet.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.120
When you change your output file when 
you change your

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.820
destination of the file to your creating
it's not going to use a hard coded

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.940
path as it did in the past but it's
going to use relative path which is

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.190
absolutely absolutely awesome.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.290
Only thing that I wish they did was I
wish they did the same thing also

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.320
for the advance action script settings I
wish that if I would go into my advanced

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.780
settings and add another folder

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.689
well that's the same side as my

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.750
project and I'm going to the lib.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.159
I wish it wouldn't use a full path but
it still using the full path so hopefully

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.730
in the near future.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.480
Maybe Adobe will come up with a solution cause
that would be actually fantastic if we're

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.750
ready insider that folder.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.880
Not to need to type because I always would go
back inside then manually change it.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.110
I think it's a really fantastic addition
and it shows how Adobe really wants you to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.930
be working and how we all want to
be working want to use relative paths

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.639
uh... very small

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.419
very cool going to cut down a little bit
of like a few milliseconds and each

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:15.899
project when you're working.

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.339
That's all I have to say about the publish
settings and the new properties panel of

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.709
the way up
