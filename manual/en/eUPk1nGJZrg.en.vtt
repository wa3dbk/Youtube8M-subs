[SWORD SOUNDS]

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.365
N'GORA: Lord, my
name is N'Gora,

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:38.040
his mistress's sub-chief.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.370
I took the liberty of
cleaning your armor.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.220
CONAN: I am not your lord,
but I thank you, N'Gora.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.730
N'GORA: Mistress Belit
has chosen you.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.180
We serve you as we do her.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.850
CONAN: I remember you from
the fight yesterday.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.530
You fought well, N'Gora.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.310
I'm glad you and I did
not square off.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.600
N'GORA: You are skilled
with the sword.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
Such is the reputation of
the Northern races.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.940
CONAN: Relax, N'Gora.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.880
You are Belit's second in
command, and respect both the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.430
position and your prowess
in battle.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.270
You have nothing to
fear from me.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.200
N'GORA: You should feel
honored, Lord.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.110
Mistress Belit is a
powerful goddess.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.550
Many respect and fear her.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.520
In my time on the Tigress, she
has taken no other men.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.470
CONAN: N'Gora, if you must call
me Lord, do so in Belit's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.770
presence only.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.200
We are warriors--

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.430
equals.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.100
You call me Conan.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.160
N'GORA: Conan the Cimmerian.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.410
I have never met a Cimmerian.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.760
All of you so useless
wielding a bow?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.870
CONAN: [LAUGHTER]

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.910
Tell me the story
of this ship.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.280
Past conquests, battles, how you
came to serve aboard it.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.270
I cannot believe, if the stories
are true, that you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.860
have survived this long
unmolested by the authorities.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.260
Surely, you have encounter
patrols.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.060
N'GORA: My mistress knows these
waters, as she does the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.650
nearby provinces.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.330
She is cautious when it is
tactically sound to be so, and

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.780
fierce when required as well.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.380
I came into her service
years back.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.790
Half the men here once crewed
the Obsidian, a timber barge

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.270
out of Abombe.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.060
I was the captain.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.040
The ancient forests of the Black
Kingdoms are home to

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.510
many valuable woods, valued by
rich men of Argos and Shem.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.040
Belit came to us.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.540
We were on the run, being
trailed by local raiders.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.820
They were in mere punts and our
numbers were greater, but

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.570
they used multiple boats
and fire arrows to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.280
keep us on the defensive.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.780
Belit appeared on the third
night, alone and in a native

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.410
craft, offering assistance.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.121
She was compelling.

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.290
CONAN: What help could she
offer you on her own?

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.860
N'GORA: Perspective.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.280
We were blinded and bound by
the value of our cargo.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.770
We were placing that above
the lives of the crew.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.170
We dumped the cargo and
fled, Belit aboard the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.330
Obsidian with us.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.220
CONAN: And?

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.140
N'GORA: She knew the raiders--

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.640
knew where they lived.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.790
The next day, she
took us there.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.330
We burned their village to ashes
and killed every single

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.330
one of them.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.960
The silver and gold we
looted was equal to

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.080
three seasons' pay.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.945
After that, we were to go
back to hauling timber?

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:24.810
Belit has led us to victory
after victory after victory.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.830
We are, all of us, rich
as nobles, yet we

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.310
will never leave her.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.555
She liberated us.

00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:33.570
She delivered us.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.350
You will soon feel the
same way, I believe.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.810
Now Conan, Lord.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.120
Where to now?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.425
CONAN: What do you mean?

00:03:40.425 --> 00:03:42.370
N'GORA: Our next destination.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.560
My mistress sleeps, and I am
your sub-chief as I am hers.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.280
Our destination?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.940
NARRATOR: N'Gora's story
rang in Conan's ears.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.290
It was a story of freedom, of
revenge, of liberation from

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.020
the shackles of those
who would impose

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.850
their will on others.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.710
CONAN: North, to Argos, the
port city of Messantia.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.610
N'GORA: As you wish, Lord.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.240
NARRATOR: In time, the story
would spread along the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.640
southern coasts that the
she-devil Belit had found a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.480
mate, this white warrior
with ice blue eyes.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.630
They would remember him.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.851
The bitterness and hate would
yield crimson fruit for years

00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:23.060
and years to come.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.050
But in those early days, the
Cimmerian lived well, drunk on

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.670
Belit's passion and
rich in gold from

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.970
their frequent raids.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.610
SHAMAN: The fates favor
you, Cimmerian.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.895
CONAN: But?

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:40.930
SHAMAN: The thread of life
is never a straight one.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.530
It twists, knots itself
up, and can be broken.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.012
Just because the fates look
kindly on you today, they may

00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:50.440
not tomorrow.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.215
Try.

00:04:51.215 --> 00:04:53.612
Take heart, barbarian.

00:04:53.612 --> 00:04:56.588
This is true of all
living things.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:57.580
Drink.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.044
I can sense the emotion
underneath the sadness, the

00:05:02.044 --> 00:05:04.524
dread, the anger.

00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:07.500
The drink will not walk back.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.484
CONAN: But I am happy.

00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:11.468
SHAMAN: Then why seek me out?

00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:13.480
I am a shaman.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.530
There is only one reason.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.780
Show me.

00:05:21.998 --> 00:05:23.248
[SCREAM]

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.860
NARRATOR: The sound of the oars
in the water, the war

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.270
drums at night, the cries
of mercy, and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.810
the roaring of fire.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.180
Such is the sound of Belit.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.150
-I heard the client coming about
two minutes before I saw

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.560
his broad silhouette
in my door window.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.920
His footsteps were like cinder
blocks dropped on wet carpet.
