00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.302
The President: A few of you
are hoping that he was right.

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.537
(laughter)

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.409
But Michelle and
I are thrilled to host our

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.846
nation's governors and your
loved ones here tonight.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:17.050
If it's your first visit, then
welcome to the White House.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.152
We promise a good time.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.856
The only thing we can't
conjure up from the past

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.225
is Governor Schwarzenegger
on the dance floor.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.459
(laughter)

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.762
And it was something.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.631
We are glad that the
weather held up after

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.199
yesterday's storm.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.534
And we've been thinking
about you governors

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.803
from New England, and
everything that your

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:39.973
citizens have been
through this winter.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.574
I want to make sure
we're working with

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.144
each other to get
what you need.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.680
It is a good thing that
you are not coming

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.752
on a snowstorm like there was
during the dinner of 1987.

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:54.988
Hours into the dinner,
the food was gone.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.157
Everybody was
standing around.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.759
The snow seemed to keep
falling harder and harder.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.227
And President Reagan
looked out the window

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.029
and turned to the
First Lady and said,

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:05.165
"Honey, do we have
enough cots?"

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.000
(laughter)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.234
To which Nancy
replied,

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.837
"We have a few
spare bedrooms."

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:13.006
But it looks like the
weather has cleared

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.241
up enough that there will
not be a pajama party

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.310
here in the Blue
Room tonight.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.278
(laughter)

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.078
We are
looking forward, though,

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:22.549
to spending time with one
another in fellowship and good

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.586
food and good entertainment,
and, undoubtedly,

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.055
we'll find that we have
more in common than

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.857
sometimes is assumed.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.492
And hopefully,
that will inform

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.961
the business that we
do together tomorrow.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.197
Our economy
keeps improving.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:40.600
And I hope that we can
seize on that momentum

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.036
to keep improving the
circumstances for every

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.139
one of our citizens --
keep building a country

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.608
where every citizen can
look around and see cause

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.543
for optimism about the
future, not only for

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.012
themselves but also for
their children and their

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.881
grandchildren; feel
good about their own

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.384
prospects and the
country's prospects.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:01.855
Within this room, we're not
going to agree on everything,

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.690
but I am committed to working
with each and every one

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.259
of you over the next two years
to keep making progress.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.027
And we'll talk more
about that tomorrow.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.563
Tonight, I just want to
express my appreciation

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:14.534
to all of you, all of
the hard work that you

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.436
bring to bear.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.271
And I want to say thank
you to the spouses

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.640
as well, because I know
that's a particularly

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.411
difficult job, trying
to keep us in line.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.780
So let me propose
a toast --

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.388
to our citizens to
our spouses, to our

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.358
families, and to what
Thomas Jefferson once

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.661
described as our
country's precious

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.298
blessings, "its
soil, its climate,

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:49.435
its equality,
liberty, laws, people

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:53.273
and manners...which no other
people on Earth enjoy."

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.107
Cheers.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.508
Audience: Cheers.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:57.544
The President: Cheers.
