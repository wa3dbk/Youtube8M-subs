00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.550
Women from the inn rushed to and fro.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.570
Some of Joseph’s relatives stood around,
staring at the baby in Mary’s arms.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.950
Joseph just stood staring, with a peculiar
expression on his face.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.220
He’d been next to useless as Mary was giving
birth.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.599
In the end, he’d let one of his relatives
guide him to hold Mary’s hand.

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.830
And then he’d seen the baby.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.300
His son.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.350
Well, God’s Son, but Joseph knew the task
he had ahead of him.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.500
He had to bring the boy up, look after him,
be his earthly father.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.070
Mary lay on a hastily made bed of hay.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.050
She looked down at the baby, the boy in her
arms.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.690
So this was the child the angel had told her
about, the one who was going to save the whole

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.070
of mankind.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.670
As she looked at his tiny hands, she couldn’t
imagine what her son’s life would be like.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.770
How would he fulfil the meaning of his name?

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.070
The women from the inn went back to their
normal work, but one or two of Joseph’s

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.540
relatives stayed around.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.220
‘What are you going to call him then?’
asked one.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.079
Joseph looked at Mary, and remembered the
words of the angel he had seen in his dream

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.530
all those months ago.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.229
‘Jesus.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.229
His name is Jesus.’

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.120
‘”God saves”?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.090
I think we could do with that at the moment.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.420
The Romans don’t seem to care what happens
to us, they just want our land and our money.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.119
And our own lot aren’t much better – that
Herod in his fancy palace.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.659
A good name, Joseph, a good name.’

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.790
‘It’s a name from God.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.570
Like the boy himself,’ replied Joseph, lost
in wonder of the newborn child.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.659
‘The Son of God.’
