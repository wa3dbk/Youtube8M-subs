00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:23.310
I�ve heard �Gaiden� translated a bunch
of different ways. �Tangent� is certainly

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.580
a new one, though. I won�t deny, it most
definitely applies, especially considering

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.840
that this game�s got about as much to do
with Guilty Gear as� well. I downed an entire

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.870
burrito after that ellipsis and couldn�t
come up with a more abstract derivation than

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.420
this run-and-jump platformer, spun off from
Guilty Gear 2: Overture, itself a rather inexplicable

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.070
real-time-strategy spinoff from one of the
most storied of fighting game franchises.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.699
I suppose it�d be like taking something
like Mario, then taking a spinoff like the

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.630
Mario &amp; Luigi series, then giving Fawful his
own game. (Which I would be all kinds of down

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.370
with.) Not to say great games can�t arise
from such strange origins; they just rarely

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.780
carry the name of their lineage so prominently.
Honestly, the only thing that�s Guilty Gear

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.580
about Pro Jumper! Guilty Gear Tangent!? is
that your rival, named �Rival,� appears

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.540
to have stolen Sol Badguy�s hair.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.060
So Chimaki, that strange stuffed-toy thing
from Guilty Gear 2: Overture, has as of late

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.270
been suffering from a range of maladies, including
but not limited to backaches, lumbar tension,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.110
joint stiffness, and cold-like symptoms. Fortunately,
just as he enters the throes of moderate inconvenience,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.170
a flyer flies through his window (fittingly
enough) touting a hot spring that claims to

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.000
cure EXACTLY what ails him! Now that�s deus
ex advertising if I�ve ever seen it. So

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.620
Chimaki dons his� no, actually, he remains
naked, clad in but a fig leaf and a moustache�

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.850
lemme try that again. So Chimaki grabs his
handy towel, proving his status as a hoopy

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.340
frood, and heads off to trek through the six
bathhouses that comprise Pro Jumper�s quest.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.070
(Anyone having flashbacks to Persona 4 yet?)
Anyway. This Sol-Badguy-Haired rival, in a

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.130
bout of seemingly arbitrary antagonism, has
animated a number of common bath items like

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.180
soap and buckets to try to stop our distressingly
exposed protagonist. Fortunately, he�s got�

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.290
um� a towel. And jumping. And occasionally
SOAP.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.230
Awright, so there�s not really much to Pro
Jumper aside from rather difficult platforming,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.000
owing largely to the kinda slippery nature
of the controls. (Admittedly, running in a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.250
bathhouse is a really dumb idea anyway, so
perhaps it�s a bit more accurate and what

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.780
the hell am I saying?) Each stage also features
just shy of a hundred apples to collect, which

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.980
can provide you with extra lives in the next
stage� so long as you can get through this

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.980
one. This game is tough, no doubt about it,
but for the frustration it brings at least

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.940
it looks decent. Each sprite is animated in
extensive detail, and the whole presentation

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.709
is done with a lot of care by Aksys, the folks
who get Arc System Works� drift. Heck, I

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.700
had three good laughs just reading the manual.
So don�t pick up Pro Jumper! Guilty Gear

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.580
Tangent!? thinking you�re going to get some
fighting game substance on your DS that isn�t

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.950
Dust Strikers (because who would want that).
Do pick it up, though, for literally any other

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.640
reason. Maybe you just like apples. Buy it
for the appels. That works.
