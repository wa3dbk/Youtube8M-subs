00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.180
Let's talk about rests for moment.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.770
Rests are a very important part of the process
of playing metal rhythms.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.250
A rest gives the music a chance to breathe
and it's not just a matter of stopping the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.250
chord.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.210
It's actually a matter of dampening the chord
in time with the music.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.470
You'll hear this done with a lot of great
riffs, stuff like Smoke on the Water by Deep

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.170
Purple has great rests, so does Master of
Puppets by Metallica, Symphony of Destruction

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.379
by Megadeth, War Pigs by Black Sabbath.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.690
So when you do rests like this, it comes from
this part of your hand.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.269
You always want to play in time.

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.089
Oh, I should mention ACDC too, another great
band that does rests.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.000
Listen to Back in Black and Dirty Deeds Done
Dirt Cheap.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.030
I'm going to play a chord, and I'm going to
stop it.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.030
See how that's happening?

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.180
It's right here, this part of the hand.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:25.330
I might be able to do this with eighth notes
if I'm playing to a tempo like this.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.610
Three, four.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.170
If it's a slower tempo I can subdivide into
16th notes.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.170
If the tempo is this, but I'm hearing da da
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.360
so I can take the chord and then hit the rest
in time.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.290
Notice I'm using the volume knob to turn off
the rhythm especially with metal guitar tone

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:10.149
because it can be very loud and noisy.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.400
There I'm shutting it off with just the volume
knob.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:42.430
Here I'm just going to use my palm.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.569
There you have a few examples of fun things
you can do with rests.
