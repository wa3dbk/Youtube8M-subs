00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.940
If you'd like to teach your dog how to ask
to go outside, one of the things you need

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:13.680
to do is be prepared to be at a door and to
ask your dog to do something and then reward

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.890
instead of a treat for example would be to
go through the door. Hopefully your dog enjoys

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.880
going outside and you have a safe fenced in
location outside of the door. So you've already

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.779
set your dog up to learn to go outside, to
prefer to go outside to go to the bathroom

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.460
and now you're going to stand at the door
and you're going to ask them for a behavior

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.460
that will lead to letting them through the
door. So for example, a bark is a common thing

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.730
that you would want your dog to do. So here
you are at the door and you ask your dog to

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:58.859
speak because you've taught your dog how to
bark on command, Lady speak. Good girl, OK.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:12.540
Yay. Come back here, good girl. Speak. OK,
good girl, go ahead, yay, good girl. Speak,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:25.770
good girl, OK, come, good girl, yay, good
girl. Another common thing to do is to hang

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.749
a bell from the door, teach your dog to touch
the bell to ring the bell and that is your

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:37.030
queue to let them out and that's their reward
is getting a chance to go outside. Another

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.470
really clever idea I had somebody think up
one time was to buy one of those remote doorbells

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.240
that are wireless and you have the doorbell
and you put the doorbell down low and you

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.009
teach your dog to target it with their foot
and then when the doorbell rings, you allow

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.140
them to go outside. Now remember its important
to know what motivates your dog. If your dog

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.900
isn't motivated by going outside, they don't
particularly enjoy it, then you might want

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.479
to have a favorite person on the other side
of the door so its exciting to go through

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.480
to that person, you might want to toss a treat
through the door so going through the door

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.841
and getting the treat is a motivating thing
or a toy or you might walk through the door

00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:17.260
yourself. But remember always to know what
motivates your dog.
