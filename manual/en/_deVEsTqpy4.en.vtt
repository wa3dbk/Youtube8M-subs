00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.009
Hear that?

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.030
That's a sound you haven't heard from a Chevy
car in a while.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.780
In my 17 years of test drives this is the
first American car I've had with a Diesel

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.780
engine.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.410
But the headline here is 46mpg highway and
it comes courtesy of the Chevy Cruze.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.480
When 50-state compliant diesel engines began
showing up a few years ago, the push was primarily

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.870
engineered by the VW Group.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.789
Gas prices were sky high and alt fuel vehicles
were in consumers’ minds.

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.870
2015 Chevrolet Cruze DieselSo Chevy decided
to see how a small diesel-powered car would

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.859
do against competitors’ hybrids and other
diesel models.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.019
Now in its 2nd year, Chevy’s best-selling
global car with a 2.0-liter clean turbo-diesel

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:56.280
is the choice for about one out of every 10
Cruze buyers in the U.S. GM’s unreliable

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.539
diesel models from the 80s left Americans
with a negative impression of this gasoline

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.390
alternative but with so many advancements
in the technology since then, diesel cars

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.280
nowadays are no more of a concern than any
other propulsion you may choose.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.140
So why go Cruze Diesel?

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.600
It’s all about fuel economy and torque with
secondary considerations given to a diesel

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.360
engine’s reputation for longevity.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.850
In this case, the engine was specifically
adapted for the U.S. market, meeting stringent

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.280
emission standards while producing peak torque
of 264 pound-feet that gives this Cruze an

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.890
instant on feeling when you press the go pedal,
particularly impressive in passing maneuvers

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.950
on the highway.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.370
Don’t measure this engine’s strength by
its mediocre 0-to-60mph time of about 8.5

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.130
seconds; it has the low-end gumption drivers
appreciate when stepping off.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.370
As for the efficiency angle, as paired with
the only available transmission – this 6-speed

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.070
auto – the city/highway spread of 19mpg
is greater than that of any other new vehicle.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.250
Rated at 27mpg city/46mpg highway and 33mpg
combined, the Cruze Diesel’s return on investment

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.330
will greatly depend on where you drive most
of the time.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.489
I averaged 35mpg for the week and during a
highway run from NYC to Albany I managed over

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.569
45mpg.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.310
So unlike some other alternative powertrains,
the impressive diesel mileage numbers are

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.459
once again for real.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.799
The most obvious difference between the Cruze
Diesel and the Jetta TDI is the clatter heard

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.310
from the engine.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.159
VW really knows how to mute the typical diesel
sounds while Chevy makes it loud and proud.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.189
Does that bother me?

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.200
Well, it's a little off-putting and everyone
who stands near it or rides in it instantly

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.930
noticed but I'm sure to some diesel aficionados
it sounds like a badge of honor.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.279
It’s also not a sporty car when running
on these fuel-saving tires, instead it promotes

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.219
comfortable cruising – diesel sounds and
all.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.069
There were also occasions where the 6-speed
felt confused.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.730
The Cruze debuts an updated front fascia this
year with LED daytime running lights and the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.620
Diesel model comes with a rear spoiler, an
aero performance package and ultra low-rolling

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.120
resistance tires.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.230
Inside, Apple Siri integration is a welcome
addition as is OnStar with 4G, not 3G, built-in

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.040
Wi-Fi hotspot.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.099
The sport mesh trim used around the cabin
is a unique look and though the next generation

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.849
Cruze will debut shortly as a 2016 model,
this car has maintained its premium composure

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.189
quite well with features such as a back-up
cam, side blind zone and rear cross traffic

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.639
alert the very agreeable Chevy MyLink system
with navigation.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.370
Remote start is always appreciated, too.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.879
And as long as the folks in the front aren’t
too long legged, the rear seats are useable

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.349
and are elevated for better forward visibility.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:02.379
Priced as the premium model in the Cruze lineup
from $26,485 and stickered here for $29,105,

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:09.439
the Cruze Diesel’s nemesis is the gas fueled
Cruze Eco which the EPA estimates costs $100

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:19.430
less per year to fuel with the culprit being
the high cost of diesel vs. a gallon of regular.
