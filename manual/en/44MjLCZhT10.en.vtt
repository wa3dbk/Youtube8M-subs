*electric crackle*

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.480
Okay. Here we go.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.620
Well.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.580
Nothing special. I just thought I'd
show this.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.480
Ooh, uh sorry about the dirt.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.120
Buuut. *sigh*

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.700
That's it!

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.180
And it did turn out pretty well, I must admit.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.560
So! Does this mean that I like Celestia,
more than Luna?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.560
Peh.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.820
Of course not!

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.200
Yeah. Ah man, these turned out
really, really awesome.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.020
Alright!

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.380
And for those of you who are wondering you can get these offline-

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.980
*zzZZ-THOOM*
*electric humming*

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.280
Whooa! O-okay.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.100
Uaah?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.020
I'm gonna be visited by somebody, but I have NEVER seen it like this before.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.400
It's usually not like th-

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.000
*BRRTZZ*
WHOA!

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.340
Whoa! Woa-okay! Um, okay.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.800

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.760
*POWwwmmm*

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.660
Ooooh boy! Ohboy!

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.820

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.320
(Twilight) RUN!

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140
Yeah! Run-run! Running is a good idea!

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.600
Running is a GOOD IDEA!

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.420

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.180
(Twilight) I'm sorry! Please, please don't hate me.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.820
No I don't hate you, Twilight. But-eh...

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.460
...Do you mind telling me what-...

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.600
...What this is all about?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.220
(Twilight) Well, see...

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.160
...It's the most horiffic trouble I've ever been in and I REALLY need your help!

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.320
Go figure.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.500
Wel I-I assume you have a plan, but you don't want to tell me while the cameras on do you?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.760
(Twilight) Sorry.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.280
It's cool.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.140
*faint roar*

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.300
And whether I like it or not.
We dont have time to argue about it.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.300
'Cuse me.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.260
(Twilight) Well. It can't get any worse.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.520
Heh, ya know?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.660
I really find it funny. I mean.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.220
You're brave enough to face HIM!

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.200
But.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.000
You really don't like being on camera at all do you, Twilight?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.040
(Twilight) Ugh not this again.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.180
(Twilight) You know we don't have time for that sort of thing.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.860
(Twilight) This is serious business!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.920
*chkk*

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.040
(Twilight) What's that for?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.840
It's just encase he gets that close to me again.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.340
*shh-kk*

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.360
*sigh* Okay. I'm turning off the camera.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.520
