00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.060
Good morning, John.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.550
Today's going to be a good old-fashioned boring
video.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.020
So I decided to go outside!

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.320
So it would be a little bit more interesting,
at least.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.920
So yeah, I'm not going to ride in a helicopter
with Bill Gates, I'm not going to dump a bucket

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.630
of ice water on my head, and I'm not even
going to do any sock puppets.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.900
I just wanted to talk about what's going on,
cause there's a lot of stuff that's going

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.900
on.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.080
And I kinda want to start a couple of new
projects.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.890
The first project, John, you are not allowed
to know about, but everyone else should go

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.519
to llamajohn.com...

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.919
Because it's John's birthday in a couple of
days.

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.020
And we're doing a little something, I'm not
going to say what the something is we're doing,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.020
just a little something.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.250
Number two, I wrote a song with Danny Weinkauf,
the bassist from They Might Be Giants, about

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.230
a kidney that lived in 4 different people.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.110
If you're interested in making a music video
for that song, we would love for you to do

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.110
that.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.440
And, if you do, we might be able to provide
you with one of my kidneys.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.830
Thing number three, so you know how I've been
interested in making adaptations of classic

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.220
novels into video blog series?

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.280
We're branching off finally, not doing Jane
Austen, we're going to be doing Mary Shelley's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.280
Frankenstein.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.930
Our version is Frankenstein MD, starring Victoria
Frankenstein, who is not quite, yet, an MD.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.049
I'm excited about this one, extra a lot, uh,
because not only is there comedy, and drama,

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.369
and quirkiness, but there is also science.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.060
SciShow is about to hit two million subscribers,
Crash Course just hit two million subscribers,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.420
SciShow Space is about to hit two hundred
thousand subscribers.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.509
All of those things are going very well, thank
you to everyone who watches them.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.670
I hope that you find them enjoyable, entertaining
and educational.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.670
I do.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.860
Okay so, here's the last thing, whatever the
thing-

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.860
Hi duck!

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.860
What are you doing?

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.549
I fake threw something and they were like,
'yeah, that looks like the right motion.'

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.319
[singing] Who likes the little, little duckies
in the pond?

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.570
I do, I do, I do, a-chick-a-quack-quack.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.310
-They're getting very close now, I'm surprised
at how close you're getting.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.409
This is kind of scary, there's more of you
than there are of me.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.549
Ohhh, they're like 'you definitely don't have
any bread, this is really disappointing, and

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.549
I'll see you later.'

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.549
Ok, bye ducks.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.549
Unexpected visitors!

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.670
The last thing that I want to talk about is
kind of weird.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.359
John and I are always looking at doing interesting
things in online video.

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.189
And, the three things you need, the magic
ingredients for making good online video are

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.570
good writing, good on camera personality-talenty
stuff.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.119
And, good editing.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.319
So we thought it would be cool to create a
little bit of a framework, within which people

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.899
could stretch their muscles in those three
different places.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.239
So people who are interested in writing, we've
got a little workshop system set up over on

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.239
Wattpad.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.540
I've also uploaded a video of me writing a
script.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.620
It's REAAALLY boring!

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.940
For people who are interested in editing,
I've uploaded a vlogbrothers video that is

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.940
entirely unedited.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.480
So if you want to stretch those muscles, you
can download that video, edit that video and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480
then share it.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.750
And then, other people can critique it.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.170
Finally for onscreen talent people, I've put
a couple of scripts, linked in the description,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.170
and you can record those things and edit yourself
recording those things.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.620
I hope that this will be an interesting, fun,
collaborative thing for people to work with

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.909
each other and critique each other and workshop
their...

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.140
Their stuff.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.200
Their online video stuff.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.680
Sorry about the lens flare here.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.680
There's a rainbow!

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.520
But I love this world, so I want other people
to be invited into it and work in it and do

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520
interesting things.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.280
Especially people who care about and know
a lot about it.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.870
Which I think includes a lot of you.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.090
But for the rest of you who don't care about
internet stuff, I got something for you as

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.510
well.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.939
OhhhAhhhhhhhhhAh!!

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:17.909
Ah the inside of my ear exploded!

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.329
AHHHHHHH!

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.650
Michael Aranda: Look, I already did the challenge!

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.650
Hank: Ah, my brain is on fire!

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.140
I challenge SciShow hosts, Reid Reimers, Caitlin
Hofmeister and that guy.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.909
For the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.480
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.950
I forgot a thing, what a surprise!

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.290
We're having a back to school at DFTBA.com
right now.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.190
20% off ALL posters, almost.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.030
Including this brand new one.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.969
It's a quote that I said one time.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:52.360
We are also for the first time ever doing
pens, and notebooks, and folders.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.360
That's it, I think.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.140
Iggy Delacey: That's worse, ow!

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.560
Victoria Frankenstein: And, now you're dead.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.959
Fantastic.
