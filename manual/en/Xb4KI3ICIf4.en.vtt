00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.069
Now we are ready to put on the final patina
which will give it that antiquie flavor. Right?

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.110
So here we have our patina it comes also in
copper this is black which I like because

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:24.029
it gives it the ancient look and we just put
it on it. Instantly we have this, the old

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:39.660
metallurgy look. No one would guess that it's
a modern piece. See how quickly it goes on,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:51.610
very fast, and it protects the solder form
oxidizing on the copper foil so it's important

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.899
for that otherwise the stuff gets this flaky
look. So now we have given it that instant

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:08.150
patina black look, the antiquing, how nice
that is to get the light coming through. I'm

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:26.370
not sure. And we will then turn it over for
the protective beautifying patina.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:44.040
And then we'll give it a rinse with the wash
with the water again and it is complete.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:58.420
Now over to the sink for the rinsing. A little
hot water and the brush action.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:25.620
Probably not that.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:39.400
There we go, oop wrong side, oh that's perfect.
So in just a few easy steps we have made our

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.860
own stain glass window.
