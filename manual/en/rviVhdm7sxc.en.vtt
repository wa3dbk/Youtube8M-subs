00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.700
Undergrowth and canopy

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.449
I think I will take advantage of this
cutover

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.749
on the banks of Rio Manu

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:20.500
to state loud and clear that a forest is
more complicated than you usually think.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.369
Actually, there are two forests on top of one another.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.800
There's the undergrowth, which you can see clearly
with the palm trees.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.130
And there's the canopy, with 
large trees in

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.180
the background.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.180
These are two different forests.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.240
The canopy is the forest of the present time.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.380
And, in the undergrowth are the forest
of the past and

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.760
the forest of the future.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.600
Let's have a look at the bottom for a start.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.090
It's dark.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.200
It's extremely quiet. There's no
wind.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.680
Extremely damp,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.120
with 98-100% humidity at night.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.250
It's constantly showered with things
falling from the canopy.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.700
Therefore, I think the undergrowth 
may be regarded as some sort of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.200
trash can.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.320
Everything that's dead ends up there.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.790
Everything is digested, enters the ground and gets mineralized

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.790
in the ground.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:59.010
As far as wildlife is concerned, it's very important to understand that animals are not the same within the canopy and in the undergrowth.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.900
In the undergrowth, there are mostly immobile and homochromous animals, which means that they blend into the environment.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.900
A specific form of mimicry.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.419
As to the canopy, we're quite unfamiliar with it.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.449
It's the first thing that should be reminded.

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.909
We've been studying canopies for less than
a quarter of a century. And it's far

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.789
from being over.

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.929
What do we know about canopies?

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:59.929
One major aspect is that it's
the most living place in the world.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:05.009
It's undeniably the peak of
terrestrial biodiversity,

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.859
terrestrial and marine. Well, what I just said
applies to the entire

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:15.859
planet. The bulk of biodiversity
lies in the canopy.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.029
The canopy is defined as the
upper surface of the forest. It's

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.629
the surface that is directly
exposed to sunbeams,

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:31.629
to light energy.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.759
Naturally, there's overabundant wildlife,

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.639
attracted by flowers,
and fruit.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.359
So there are leaf
predators,

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.509
flower pollinators, seed
propagators, parasites and

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.259
predators of it all. So, there's an
extremely rich,

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.269
very diversified

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.689
animal layer.

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.619
75% of wildlife

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:03.619
lives in the canopy.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.100
I've been sitting in the tree since this morning, and I've
seen a

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.039
number of magnificent birds flying by.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.729
I've heard monkeys screaming over there.

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.079
They were probably wondering what we were doing here.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.109
There are many insects, and
butterflies, some of them very beautiful.

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.249
And there's the small,

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.900
usual fauna that lives on the bark:

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.759
ants, centipedes,

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.349
cockroaches, etc., etc., etc.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.229
This really is a place with profuse forms of life.
