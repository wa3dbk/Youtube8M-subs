Horse Fair care home is a new addition to
Rugeley town centre and has quickly

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.780
established itself as a highly respected
provider of elder care services to the

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.320
surrounding region

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.450
having been opened in september twenty ten
the home office residential and dementia

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.390
care services

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.779
let's show you around this home and show
you some of the spaces and features that

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.849
gives this home unique feel and
introduce you some of the people that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.680
make up this community at Horse Fair

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.600
I know every single resident that is here
so far

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.649
and i do try to have a conversation with each
of them every day at some point I do take

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.769
their post to them and their newspapers and
that, so that helps me interact with them

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:45.859
in a good way

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.370
dining is of a high restaurant
standard

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.089
and nutritious meals are prepared daily

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.640
we usually ask them what they want so we can
plan a menu for the next month or teh next

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.460
week or something like that and then i will
ask the carers if they want a big portion

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.199
or small portion
and then i 'll give it to which ever residents

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.690
wants a big or small portion

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.510
they usually come back empty plates, that
sort of stuff they usually enjoy it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.850
we normally have a menu when the resident
comes in that tells us that they are vegatarian

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.600
so we plan something in the kitchen beforehand
and today we have a cauliflower and cheese

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.250
bake for teh vegetarians

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.759
all our residents are able to enjoy a variable
programme of recreational and leisure based

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.590
activities

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.570
these are devised daily by our recreational
co-ordinators who will help you settle quickly

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.869
into home life through the various shared
activities we all enjoy

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.869
is looking really back in the past what kind
of things they have seen we have got memorable

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.850
events in history

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.850
shots of things like margaret Thatcher, things
like the first man landing on the moon

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.219
just memorable events really

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.380
we have had positive feedback from all of
them every time any time we have done reminiscence

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.380
really they have all said they have enjoyed
discussing what happend on those days

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.640
i do try to do what i can for the music i
cant read but i play by ear and i sing

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.890
Your still the stars loose their glory

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.890
This is the piano in the foyer?

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.410
Thats right, yes that is where i play there

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.050
all bedrooms are generously sized and come
with en-suite walk in showering facilities

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.550
and a flat screen Tv. Our rooms and the support
services you can enjoy are of a hotel standard

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.720
its very interesting i never get tired of
them

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.450
i take them out now and again and dust them
put them back again and that settles me im

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.000
happy about that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.490
you have only been here a few days havent
you and you have already turned it into your

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.760
own little personal space

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.510
Since yesterday

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.750
i see that you are a fan of John Wayne too

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.750
he is my man i like him and read his books
i got draws full of him and i know about his

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.980
history he is a lovely person

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.580
when the weather is fine we take out time
to enjoy our enclosed garden and seating areas

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.620
where our mature trees and water feature help
make our summer evenings extra special

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.620
i am a senior carer here I basically run the
shift and if the girls have any problems they

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.270
come straight to me as seniors we are expected
to work the floor so we do obviously get the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.370
up in the morning

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.370
as you can see i am making drinks now so if
we have not got any of the paper side of things

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.270
to do or the medications we muck in and help
the girls

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.410
our lounges are free from televisions and
light and airy in their feel many of our residents

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.430
make many new friends at Horse Fair and really
enjoy the companionship that our small community

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.070
affords

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.070
I dont what i would do with Janet Gail Karen,
this is the special one.There are some very

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.389
very good people.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:28.389
job satisfaction when they say they have enjoyed
something you have done with them and its

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.639
just general all round I dont think there
is any part of the job i dont really like

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:42.639
they are so kind and thoughtfull and when
Harry had to come in for as an emergency they

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.900
were wonderful to me as well I cant speak
too highly of them

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.240
our residents play a large part in helping
to guide the running of the home our residents

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.780
and family committees have all offered valuable
contributions to the development of home life

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.740
we feel that horse fair offers a vibrant lifestyle
oppotunity for our residents a warm and secure

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.800
elder care community that suports a positive
lifestyle choice and were everything we do

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.489
is guided by our residents quality of living
