[Opening jingle]

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.849
Hi and welcome to The Bread Kitchen.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:18.319
Today I'm gonna make a Welsh bread called Bara Brith which means "speckled bread"

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:23.050
and I'm gonna make it the traditional way using yeast.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.980
For this traditional recipe, I've got 450 g of strong white bread flour,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.439
225 ml of lukewarm milk,

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.040
75 g of butter that I've cut into small pieces,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.220
a 150 g of dried fruit. This is mixed dried fruit but you can use sultanas or raisins or mixed peel or whatever you want.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.950
75 g of demerara sugar, a beaten egg.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
Here there's 2 teaspoons of dried yeast and a teaspoon of brown sugar.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.620
Finally, I've got a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of mixed spice.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.220
Mixed spice is a mixture of things like cinnamon and nutmeg and cardamom. You might know it as pumpkin spice.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.560
I'll start by adding the yeast and a teaspoon of sugar into the warm milk.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.750
Give it a whisk and then I'll leave it for 10 minutes just for the yeast to activate.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.000
While the yeast is waking up, I can sift the flour into a bowl.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.590
I'll add in the butter and I'll mix these together, rub them together with my hands

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.780
until I get a texture which is a bit like sand.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.010
If you've ever made scones, you'll know the texture I'm talking about.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.460
When the butter has been nicely rubbed in, it should be like playing in a nice, dry sandpit.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.350
Now add in the brown sugar, the 75 g,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.420
the mixed spice and the salt and I'll just mix it altogether.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.760
I'll just make a well in the centre.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.480
My yeast has gone all frothy and is now smelling...well...

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.310
yeasty, I suppose. Add that in. Together with the beaten egg.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.479
Now mix this to a nice, smooth dough.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.290
Depending on your size of the egg,

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.819
you might find that your dough is a bit sticky

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.159
but that's no problem because I'll show you
how I deal with sticky doughs.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:29.229
Liberally, flour a surface which you're gonna knead the dough on. Your sticky dough.

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.549
Turn the dough out

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.819
and knead it well.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.609
Some of the flour that you've got on the surface, will start to get incorporate into the dough

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.569
and start removing the stickiness. Now you may need to

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.629
dust the surface

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.749
a few times depending on how sticky your dough is

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:57.729
but you will eventually end up with a
nice, soft dough. You see, this is getting much better already

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:02.909
I've managed to knead in enough flour that the dough is just slightly tacky.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.739
It's not sticky anymore.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.639
So I'm gonna knead it now for about 7 or 8 minutes.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.510
Work that gluten. Hm.. hm.. hm..

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.009
After you've given your dough a really good pummelling,

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.869
make it into a nice, smooth ball.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.939
Pop it into a lightly-greased bowl

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.979
and cover and put in a nice warm place

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.929
until the dough doubles in size.

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:36.939
Well, this has certainly risen very nicely, thank you.

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.639
So I'll dip it out onto a floured surface.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.939
Splot!

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.339
I'll just knock it back a bit.

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.019
Add all the dried fruit,

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.849
fold over

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.499
and knead the fruit into the dough.

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.859
I'm gonna knead for about

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.859
5 minutes probably.

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.599
Alright. I think I've got the...

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.759
fruit fairly well incorporated.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.989
So I'm gonna make this into a around.

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.909
What I intend to do

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.209
is if I see any bits of fruit on the surface, I pull them off

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.449
because in the oven, they tend to blacken very easily

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.270
and it doesn't make the loaf particularly appetising.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.349
So I've picked off about a dozen. Just over a dozen

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.999
bits of dried fruit.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:35.360
I got a piece of dough here which has no fruit poking out of it.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.150
I'll now transfer this

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.370
to a lightly-greased baking tray.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.330
Now I'll just cover it. You can use some cling film. I'm actually gonna use an upturned bowl

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.169
and I'm gonna leave this again in a warm place to rise for about half an hour.

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.209
Once your loaf has risen,

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:59.229
I'm gonna bake this in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius fan oven, 200 degrees Celsius normal oven

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.369
for about half an hour.

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:06.469
After about 30 minutes, it should be this lovely, golden brown colour.

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:13.409
While it's still hot, just brush it all over with a little warm honey.

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.680
Look at that lovely, shiny glaze.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.759
Now leave this to cool.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.479
Serve in slices, slightly warm maybe.

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.779
Spread with butter or margarine if you prefer.

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:31.309
There are many variations of the Bara Brith recipe and a lot of them use self-raising flour or baking powder

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:38.830
and I used to use that recipe too but once I've made Bara Brith with yeast, I'm never going back again.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.249
I hope you enjoy making your Bara Brith and do join me next time in The Bread Kitchen.

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.499
