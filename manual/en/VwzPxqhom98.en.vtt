S: You can see we got some YouTube candy and YouTube candy

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.160
Martina: I wanna do Kai Bai Boh to see which one we’re gonna try first

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.700
S: Okay. You know I’m gonna win

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.530
M: No you’re not

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.830
Okay, Kai Bai Boh

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.060
S: Good. So I’m opening mine first

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.100
I have no idea what this is

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.430
It looks like, little like soft pockets on the back

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.940
M: I think it’s a cola bottle or something

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.570
I’ve touched it and I have a feeling 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.010
the psychic connection is that this is some kind of cotton candy 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.940
That’s my feelings for it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.940
S: Okay so let’s see what this is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.150
I didn’t actually open this right

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.080
M: Guys my nose is so stuffy

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.700
I sound awful

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.610
I sound like I’m in a cave 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.310
Can you hear it? Listen

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.950
S: Umm, is this candy or is this a sponge?

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.120
M: Umm, are we supposed to eat that?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.120
S: It smells like coke

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.920
M: I can’t smell anything

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.550
S: Not like, the drug, but like, the cola

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.180
M: Not that I’d know what it smells like

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.210
How do you smell the smell of coke?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.630
You smell it and it goes up your nose and then you’re like

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.330
S: That’s how it works usually, that’s how I saw it in the movies

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.890
M: What if I can’t taste anything properly because my nose is so stuffy? 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.100
S: Oh my god, this is, 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.000
Ok take your piece

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.830
M: Okay ready? Jjang

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:15.510
S: Whoa, this is wonderful! 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.240
It’s really sour but it’s like cotton candy but coke!

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.500
M: Do you see those tiny, like little, 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.300
I don’t know if you guys can see this, 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.720
we have a tiny little nibbiley hoobodehoohoos

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.720
S: Let’s open up our second thing

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.090
S: Ok, the second one, also YouTube, ooooh

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.400
M: YouTube makes the greatest candy! 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.430
S: Wow, amazing!

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.390
Oooh it’s one of those fishy bean cake things

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.110
M: Ok but we have these - is it upside down?

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.800
S: I don’t think so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.830
Fish are never upside down

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.260
M: What! If they’re upside down they’re dead!

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.610
S: That’s true

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.440
M: It’s gone

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.470
S: I guess we can eat it now

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.270
M: I think this is chocolate

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.810
You know how everything in Korea looks like chocolate 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.410
and then it’s bean paste?

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.940
S: Ok, I don’t think this is gonna be bean, I think it’s gonna be chocolate

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.150
M: I think we have to do like a love bite 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.280
S: You think so?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.390
M: Like, half and half together

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.510
You ready? Ok, 3, 2, 1

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.350
M: Oh god, Simon, you’re covered in stuff

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.300
S: That’s chocolate

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.400
M: Ok you are just like covered in stuff

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.420
I’m gonna get some napkins. Simon’s like, filthy

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.670
S: Take care of me ducky~

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.100
M: Oh my god you’re so messy

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.980
S: This is incredibly difficult to eat without making a mess of yourself

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.050
*girly scream*

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.450
M: Simon, you better not eat all the food - 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.610
NOBODY BITES MY HUSBAND BUT ME!!

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:51.770
MARTINA BEAR TRANSFORMATION!!

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.100
Oh my god, where? Where?

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:12.230
Ah Noooo~~!!!

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.570
Mordney: Ah, vampire brother! Wait, wait!

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.010
Do you know where I could find UKiss?

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:30.370
Oh, thank you, thank you, I will go. Thank you!
