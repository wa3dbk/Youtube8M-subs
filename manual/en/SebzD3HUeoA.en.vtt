00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.569
When taking a portrait, there are several
different poses that you can choose. But you

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.480
need to understand how all of them work in
relation to the final image you're going to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.339
get. The straight on head shot is a typical
portrait. But you need to be careful, because

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.970
this only works for people that have really
strong features, that are very well balanced.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.330
If you're not careful, you can end up with
an image that looks like somebody's driver's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.700
license or a passport photo, and we all know
how unflattering those can be. So things to

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.660
consider when you're taking a portrait, not
only alternatives from the head on shot, but

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.940
also you need to find a way to make your subject
comfortable. And you need to pay close attention

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.530
to what your subject is doing with their hands
or any objects they might have. The scene

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.530
in this portrait, I took of a young tuba player.
I wanted to show that he was a young guy and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.190
that he was interested in his instrument and
still in the learning process. So, I got him

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.830
out, away from the music room, we did it in
some woods near his school. And, you know,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.250
I really liked the final result. I had it
so it looked like he's playing the instrument

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.140
a little bit, but at the same time, he's still
paying attention to the camera. So you get

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.670
the essence of the person, but also the essence
of what they're doing. So again, it's really

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.470
important when you're taking portraits to
make sure you experiment with some different

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.530
views, but also to make sure that your subject
is really comfortable and then to make sure

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.950
that you're paying attention to any objects
that they have, or their hands, their eyes

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.280
and their feet. One little trick I have for
taking a portrait, is I'll line my camera

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.990
up like I'm ready to take the shot, then I'll
move it over to side and just have a conversation

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.490
with the person. So, I'm still lined up how
I want to be, but they don't feel as much

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.550
like they're staring into the camera. And
they feel more like they're having a conversation

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.530
with them. But it also allows me to see their
face and how they're reacting to certain things.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.330
You know, maybe say something humorous, get
them to smile. Or have them, look away and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.580
look back at you and get like a bit of a glance
look. But again, all part of making the subject

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.299
comfortable. So again, experiment with different
viewpoints, make sure your subject is comfortable

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.239
and pay attention to all the objects around
them.
