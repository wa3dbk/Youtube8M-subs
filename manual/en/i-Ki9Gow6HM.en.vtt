00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.430
Stuller's full line of precious metal classic
wedding bands are manufactured here at our

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.870
global headquarters in Lafayette, Louisiana.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.190
Today we'll take an in-depth look at the process
and meet some of the people who have created

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.210
these beautiful pieces.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.340
The entire process begins with the creation
of precious metal tubing from which all of

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.210
our wedding bands will be cut.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.020
To see how this is done we will visit the
metal fabrication department.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.860
Wedding band production begins with our continuous
cast process to create the appropriate size

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.000
tube.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.950
Once the machine is set up for the needed
size, a starter bar is inserted into the machine.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.550
Casting grain is then added to the crucible
and the temperature adjusted for the metal

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.530
begins casting.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.420
We simply have to press the towing button
for the cast to take place.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.420
Once the pipe is of the needed length it is
cut and the machine is allowed to continue

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.140
to exhaust the metal.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.290
From here the tubing will have to go through
the pipe drawing process.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.899
The pipe drawing process transforms the raw
pipe to the required diameter and cross section

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.189
of the end item.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.469
Stuller offers a finger size range from 2
to 15 however the drawing sequence of dies

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.560
is determined not only by the finger size
requested but also other attributes such as

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.390
finish, wall thickness, and outside diameter.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.409
Both internal and external diameters are intentionally
adjusted for the lathe operators in NPO to

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.420
machine for final specs.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.039
The end of the pipe is then swedged to fit
onto the end of a rod die that represents

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.219
the inside diameter of the required finger
size.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.319
Careful consideration must be given to ensure
that the swedge tip is small enough to fit

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.100
the entire sequence of drawing dies and the
draw rod.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.090
Once the inside diameter of the pipe has tightly
wrapped around the draw rod it must be rolled

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.130
after each die draft.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.689
The process of rolling is also to keep the
pipe from sticking to the draw rod odd given

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.130
the intense friction and heat generated from
the draw bench.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.759
After the last die and the draw sequence the
draw rod is pulled through a pull-off die

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.469
leaving the finished pipe in the drawing trough.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.330
The swedge tip is then cut off the finished
pipe.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.680
The pipe specification and metal quality of
inscribed on to the pipe using an engraving

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.720
pin before the job is sent to the machine
tool operations department to be lathed.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.840
In the lathe process the drawn pipe is fed
through the lathe machine and then cut to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.230
exact millimeter width, finger size, and profile.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.860
The profile of the band determines what next
step will be done to the band.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.610
Most bands will go straight to the Polishing
Department.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.250
If a band requires millgrain this can be done
on the lathe as well by simply applying a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.560
mill grain tool.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.110
We can also add channels and stone holes to
create channel set bands.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.180
All of our bands will then be polished.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.970
After the bands are put through a tumbler,
we apply a hand finish to each band to give

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.010
it that special shine your customers love.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.500
The band is polished inside and out then put
on a lathe and lacquer machine.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.980
The entire process for one wedding band to
go from tumble to polish takes just over four

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.280
minutes.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.840
At this stage bands may be engraved and special
finishes may be added at your request.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.030
Many couples like to have a special message
added to their band.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.990
This is done in our Stuller Studio area.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.280
The laser engraving is applied and then if
requested sent over to our enamel area that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.310
have black, brown, blue pink, green, or red
add it to the engraving of the band.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.180
Special finishes can also be placed on bands
at this point.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.870
You can have one of seven different special
finishes applied to the outside of the band

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.540
for a look that is uniquely yours.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.830
Finally if one of our various designs or patterns
are requested on the band, it will be sent

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.810
through a posilux machine to be diamond-cut.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.700
Each diamond tool has a different size and
shape that gives you a specific look once

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.010
the cutting process is completed.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.350
The posilux machine uses a diamond-tipped
tool to cut various designs and patterns.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.880
There are more than 30 different tips that
can be used to make these designs.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.570
After all of this your customers will have
the perfect band for their special day.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.710
