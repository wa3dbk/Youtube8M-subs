Hey what's up guys?

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:02.909
Troy here with WeightGainNetwork.com.

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.660
I got a super important topic - I want to
get into how to gain healthy weight and the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.799
importance of antioxidants and building muscle
mass, and also increasing your overall health.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:19.570
Now I like to think of antioxidants as the
biggest x-factor when it comes to building

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.810
muscle mass.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.800
Antioxidants are actually a group of compounds
that are going to fight free radicals in your

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
body.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.640
So what antioxidants do is over the course
of the day (through pollution, through things

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.180
in your diet, through stress, through cortisone
production) - this forms free radicals in

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.690
your body and free radicals play absolute
havoc on your immune system guys.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.090
The worst things you can have is an abundance
of free radicals in your body.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.920
This is going to cause disease and sickness
long-term.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.079
So what antioxidants do is they're going to
fight these free radicals; they're going to

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.630
help boost your immune system; they're going
to help your body run at peak efficiency.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.750
When your body runs at peak efficiency, your
muscle building capabilities are at their

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.080
all time high as well.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.400
So antioxidants are super important when it
comes to boosting our overall health - being

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600
able to put on rock solid lean muscle mass
effortlessly.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.890
So let me get into the list.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.040
I want to talk about antioxidants - some really
easy antioxidants you can incorporate into

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.320
your diet and how it's going to help you gain
healthy weight.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.740
So let's get right into it.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.000
First I want to get into three benefits that
antioxidants are going to have for your body.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.470
And number one and probably most important
is they're going to boost your immune system

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.010
and your overall health.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.330
So think about this guys - if you guys are
just eating protein and you guys aren't having

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.299
antioxidants from (some of the sources I'm
going to talk about later like) fresh fruits

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.420
and vegetables and beans and all that kind
of stuff.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.270
If you're just having protein, you guys are
feeding your body what's going to stimulate

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.390
your protein synthesis and increase muscle
mass but you're really not doing much for

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.160
your immune system; you're not doing much
for your overall health and eventually you're

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.160
going to train.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.500
And when you train your immune system, something's
going to lower and more free radicals are

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.390
going to build up and you're not going to
be able to put on lean muscle mass and you're

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.520
going to get sick and when you get sick you
won't be able to train and you're basically

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.110
going to go through this spiral of - you train
hard for a week or two and then you get sick;

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.890
you don't feel good - you're tired.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.860
So antioxidant consumption regularly is going
to help you boost your immune system and really

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.220
improve your overall health.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.800
You guys are going to find out that you get
sick less; you're going to feel really good;

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.570
you're going to feel energized, so I highly
recommend antioxidants for this very important

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.819
reason.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.069
The second benefit is antioxidants actually
help you increase your muscle recovery and

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.810
your muscular endurance.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.550
This is pretty self-explanatory - you obviously
want to be able to recover optimally; you

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.270
want to have optimal muscular endurance.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.300
And this has a lot to do obviously with the
antioxidants boosting your immune system;

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.520
it just helps all your other physiological
functions including your muscular recovery

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.620
and your muscular endurance.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.410
So it's been shown that like high intensity
athletes (even endurance athletes) have more

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.630
muscular recovery and enhanced muscular recovery
and enhanced muscular endurance when they

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.190
consume a regular amount of antioxidants.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.450
The third benefit to antioxidants is it's
going to increase your energy.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.129
This is so important when you guys are going
through - you got work, you got school.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.610
And you also want to have really intense training
sessions.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.069
You want to make sure your energy levels are
at their optimal level.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.120
So antioxidants are going to naturally help
you increase your natural energy so you won't

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.120
have to rely on stimulants.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.900
You won't have to rely on energy drinks and
all that other garbage.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.340
You guys will have an abundant source of energy
coming naturally from your body; you're going

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.290
to be a lot healthier.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.780
The more antioxidants you have, the higher
your energy levels - which is going to translate

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.120
into a really ridiculously high workout intensity.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.010
And the more intense your workouts are, the
quicker you're going to be able to transform

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.010
your body.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.430
This is kind of a huge factor in being able
to rapidly transform your physique is your

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.570
workout intensity so the more antioxidants
you have, the healthier you are; the harder

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.850
you're going to be able to work; the more
overload your body's going to be able to sustain

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.100
and you guys are going to be able to bulk
up and gain healthy weight rapidly.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.360
Alright, so we've covered that antioxidants
are really important.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.170
I'm sure you guys are really excited to start
incorporating them into your diet.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.730
So where can you find some antioxidants?

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.850
You don't have to look far - they actually
live in your local grocery store.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.430
Some of the best antioxidants sources are
actually just regular fruits and vegetables.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.430
Some really high sources of antioxidants are
things like blueberries, things like acai

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.560
berries.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.989
Green leafy vegetables are great - things
like kale and spinach.

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.379
I believe red kidney beans have the second
highest antioxidant ratings.

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:23.460
Black beans, red kidney beans - those are
all really abundant sources of antioxidants

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.581
and green tea - specifically matcha green
tea; I believe matcha green tea has between

00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:30.284
is like 15 to 20 times the antioxidant level
of blueberries.

00:04:30.284 --> 00:04:35.469
So if you guys want to spend a little bit
of more money and increase your metabolism

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:39.909
and get even more antioxidants into your system
- try matcha green tea (one of my favorite

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.360
fat burning supplements).

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.680
And one more thing you probably see people
drink all the time - coffee actually has some

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.740
antioxidants but please don't rely on coffee
as your only source of antioxidants.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.700
Americans are actually so unhealthy that coffee
is the number one source of antioxidants in

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.059
the American diet.

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:01.879
So I recommend getting them from things like
blueberries and green tea and vegetables instead

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:02.879
of coffee.

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.529
But if you do drink coffee occasionally - like
pre-workout or anything, that is a-ok as well.

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.430
So anyways, that is the importance of antioxidants
to gain healthy weight and build lean muscle

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.430
mass.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.550
