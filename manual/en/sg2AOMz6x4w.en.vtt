00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.820
It's quite easy to do something for someone.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.740
But in Korea, it's more difficult to receive something.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.140
In our culture, if you gave sth to sb, she/he'll rather say, "Why did you buy such thing?"

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.040
instead of saying, "I needed this so much. Thank you!"

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.240
But people are not good at accepting sb's favor.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.000
A few days ago, it was my father's birthday.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.640
So everyone gathered and had a nice dinner, you know.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.780
And I just tried to give aunties some money for their transportation fee..

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.940
They got panic, refusing money several times!

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.300
They react as if they encountered an infectious disease.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.940
But then, they finally accepted it after several more eh..

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.380
Feel like that custom's sort of a promised dispute..

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.420
After three times of "Give-and-take"

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.120
,people'll then finally accept sth.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.280
But for example, if your parents refused to accept money at the first time,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.620
and you gave up to give it to them,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.980
then you are done with them..

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.280
that's dim witted..

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.580
My friend did that for a while, actually.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.020
He said, I'll pay for this.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.600
And I told him, "Nah, I'm paying for this."

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.300
But he accepted my offer right away, "Ok, go ahead."

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.580
So I felt weird paying for this, you know.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.400
"Oh, no..feel sorry for you to pay for every meal.."

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.040
Wanted to hear this kind of thing, right?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.600
And in Korea, people don't take praises as they are.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060
Oh, I'm really poor at doing that.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.780
Sometimes, girls yell out, "I love Heo Ji-woong!".

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.440
Then, I feel so sorry for those girls' parents.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.000
So, I really don't know what to do at those moments.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.740
Aren't you sorry for me, then?

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.700
Ah, right! His cousin said "I love you" to you, too!

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.860
I'm divorced, and..so I felt really sorry to her parents..

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.940
Her parents are my older sister and her husband!

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.040
I felt so bad for them..

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.460
This story is about "something", right?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.520
I'm still not sure what "something" exactly means..

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.120
Can people with "something"touch each other?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.660
But, "something" is a hot trend in nowadays.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.600
Because if people kiss on each other's cheeks, or hug each other..

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400
They should be responsible for everything..

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.700
but people with "something" can have a free love..

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.100
What you just mentioned is soo childish...

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.640
"Cheek kiss or hug"?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.660
This show is for adults who are 19 and above!

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.180
What you just said suits the show called "Animal farm".

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.820
Oh, I remember this!

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.680
You know, monkeys were mating each other..

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.560
He's always talking about monkeys!

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.980
Anyways, in that scene, Son Beum-soo was a narrator,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.920
but he expressed their mating scene as

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.940
"Marry me! Marry me!"

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940
He expressed mating scene as marriage scene.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.500
When animals were proposing?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.020
No!

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.420
When they were mating!

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.880
Ah! He said like that while they were mating?

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.580
Marry me, marry me!Quickly! Quickly!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.820
That show was so famous that almost everyone watched it, right?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.140
The theme song for that show was very famous!

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.440
'Earth is breathing. Every creature is alive.'

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.040
To the world you've never been to!

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.140
Alive but unknown world

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.900
No, it's not unknown! It's mysterious!

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.360
Quiz~

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.080
Quiz exploration

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.760
And the lizards started to run around at that moment!

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.280
That program was really amazingly funny!

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.280
'Animal farm' is also very funny!!

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.880
Can I come out in your show as a man who wipes cat's tears away?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.020
(He got embarrassed.)

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.020
I'm serious. As a man who is very warm to cats..
