Hi. My name is Make Quebec. Today's subject
is stomach exercises. I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.110
three variations off of the same theme while
lying down. You notice I'm making sure that

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.320
my back is protected by having this mat on
the floor. So, remember whenever you're doing

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.160
any kind of abdominal work you want to make
sure that the ab muscles are actually seen.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.300
You want to combine your exercise routine
with a sound and healthy eating plan. So,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.320
that way your body fat percentage is low enough
so that way the definition can actually be

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.790
seen. I should also mention this. Any kind
of muscle work that you do, it's a good idea

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.300
to work opposing muscle groups, so that way
your body is in balance. So, actually after

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.789
I demonstrate these three abdominal exercises
I will demonstrate a lower back exercise as

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.219
well, because that's the opposing muscle.
You want to make sure that like pulleys your

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.619
muscles are in balance and they're not pulled
in one direction or the other too much. Alright,

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:15.529
so let's get to work. I'm going to go ahead
and lie down. I'm going to brace my head without

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:22.749
pulling so hard that I'll be straining my
neck, because I don't want to strain my neck.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.240
I want to strain my abdominals. So, I want
to get my upper body high enough off the floor

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.119
so that my stomach is engaged. Now, I'm going
to go ahead and point the toes and lift my

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.659
feet up off the floor just high enough so
that my stomach muscles are held tight. From

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:49.520
here I'm going to do this motion. I call it,
scissors up and down. Like this. One, two,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.359
three, one, one; two, three, two; one, two,
three, two. If you are a beginner exerciser.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:03.749
One, two, three, one, one; two, three, two,
for twelve. If you are intermediate, advanced

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:11.209
twenty-five. If you are a beginner one set
of twelve. If you are advanced, two sets of

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.760
twenty-five. You notice the key here is getting
my upper body up high enough so that the stomach

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:28.070
is engaged. OK. Moving along, the next exercise
is exactly the same. The only difference is

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.340
instead of the feet going up and down like
this they are going over this way, so it's

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.489
scissors the other direction. Alright, so
again it's exactly the same. I want to brace

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.860
my head and my upper body up high enough so
that my stomach is held in tight. I'm going

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.180
to point my toes, lift up the feet, now it's
one, two, three, one, opening, opening, opening

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.950
and closing, opening and closing. OK. One
set of twelve if you're a beginner. Two sets

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.939
of twenty-five if you're advanced. Opening
and closing, opening and closing. Good. The

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:16.130
last exercise that I'm going to do for abdominals,
before I switch to the lower back is; it's

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:26.939
some twists. It's like this. Again, the set
up is the same. Upper body off the floor,

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:35.079
head is braced; I'm going to twist this way,
so that this elbow meets this knee. The feet

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.859
are off the floor, now I'm just going to twist
from one to the other. Twist, twist, twist,

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:50.819
one, twist, twist, twist, two; if you're a
beginner one set of twelve. Advanced two sets

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.590
of twenty-five. If you're intermediate find
a happy medium that works for you. Alright,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.150
so those are the three exercises that I do
for my abdominal routine. Now, I want to also

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.909
work the opposing muscle group, the lower
back. Just to make sure that I have balance.

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:15.329
The simplest thing you can do is just make
like Superman, just like this. You're lying

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:23.220
down, opposing hand, opposing foot. I'm going
to lift up straight right arm, straight left

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:34.241
leg and then down, straight right leg, straight
left arm. I'm just moving up and down for

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:45.820
twelve, if you're a beginner. If you're intermediate
advanced twenty-five. Don't forget to stretch

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:53.300
afterwards. Alright, so these are the exercises
for an abdominal routine. Thank you.
