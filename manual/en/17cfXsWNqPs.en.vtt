00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:13.537
Janko Pislak, beekeeper
Born in 1934, Doklece near Ptujska Gora.

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:17.541
Known for his largest hive collection in Slovenia and one of the biggest in Europe.
He has 2600 beehives.

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:24.520
He has made a substantial contributions to beekeeping with his numerous technological inventions and improvements.

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:37.650
I had three things. As a small child, I had hens. They were of a lighter color.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.681
But there was not much technological development to that.

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:46.870
Six, seven eggs. A chicken under the hen. There are spring chickens and roosters. Over.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.848
Nothing else to it. Well, then as a second or third-grader, I started raising sheep.

00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:58.805
We had many sheep. We sheared sheep. My sisters knitted sweaters and so on.

00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:07.268
Well, at the age of 12, I left sheep for beekeeping.

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:16.393
For the money I received at my Confirmation, I went to a beekeeper and bought a swarm of bees.

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:22.593
I used clematis to make a skep, which I then coated with clay.

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.752
It was all very primitive those days.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.237
Because back then they had bees in every village.

00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:36.757
There was not a village without five or six thatched skeps. The house had honey and bees for pollination.

00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:46.788
In 1950, I trained to become a carpenter.

00:01:47.038 --> 00:01:53.927
Because I had already taken a few of those subjects. This and that. I became acquainted with the technology

00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:56.448
Not focusing on hives alone.

00:01:56.698 --> 00:01:59.489
In the first year of my apprenticeship, I made three hives.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:02.206
And additional nine the following year.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:08.638
We currently have 2600 beehives. That is the largest collection in this part of Europe.

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:12.980
All of it grew from only one beehive.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.462
It is similar to a mother having ten children and each of her children having ten.

00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:21.455
Over the years, the number increases. It is the same here.

00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:34.969
For example, someone might come home from work and enjoy the time they spend with their dog.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.075
When they will stand outside on the street, the dog will wag its tail and the owner will know exactly what the dog needs.

00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:51.177
A farmer with livestock will come home from the field or from work and go straight to the stable.

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:53.290
A beekeeper goes straight to the bees.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.214
But those who like women very much.

00:02:57.464 --> 00:03:02.555
They will come home and go straight into the kitchen to kiss and caress their wife a bit.

00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:06.595
They shoud stay away from the cows and bees though.

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:11.796
A true beekeeper leaves everything. No vacation.

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:15.674
He takes care of bees and to him that is a true delight.

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:21.874
The wife agrees, she is content. But if she is not … she keeps quiet.

00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:25.984
We do not go really to the seaside much. It is the season now.

00:03:26.234 --> 00:03:31.115
If we do go on vacation, it is during the winter. We go to a spa in the winter.

00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:40.032
The Carnolians. Carnies. Apis carnica. It is native to Slovenia.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:51.095
Bees live a socialist lifestyle. This does not mean “MICKA you have to do this today. ANZEK you should do this.”

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:53.917
As the case is in capitalism.

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.611
When a bee finds a place to pasture, it comes back home quickly,

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.420
dances around and lets others know, where the location is.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.694
In ten minutes, the whole hive goes there to check it out.

00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:05.527
If the hive is full. If it has 200 kilograms of honey.

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:14.165
They will be no less glad or quick to go to pasture. If there is pasture, the bee works enthusiastically from dawn to dusk.

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:16.232
From birth to death.

00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:20.143
If a bee mistakenly goes to a wrong hive, it can bring whatever it wants into it.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:24.253
It is no problem. But not out. Not out.

00:04:24.753 --> 00:04:31.255
If one, for example, has 10 kilos of honey and the other does not have enough to make it through the rain.

00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:37.164
Two bees come and hold their hands together, begging “Please, just a little bit of honey, to survive.”

00:04:37.414 --> 00:04:41.888
The others do not care and throw them out. The meaning: “Never give anything to anyone.”

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:44.630
This is where the socialism ends.

00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:53.987
An old saying goes that when desire is met, the love is gone.

00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:59.026
Most beekeepers focus only on how much honey they will get.

00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:02.927
Those who only pay attention to how much money bees will bring in,

00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:05.621
is mistaken in thinking they are beekeepers.

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:09.359
You need to love the bee, to make anything happen.
