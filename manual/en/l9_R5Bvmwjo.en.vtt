00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:05.486
- [Narrator] I'm Michael Bungay
Stanier from Box of Crayons.

00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:09.136
And I wanna talk to you about
building rock solid habits.

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:12.089
Not bad, end up on the
couch type of habits,

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.089
but good, useful habits.

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:16.891
Now you can't move these days

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.776
without somebody giving you advice.

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:22.803
Seven steps to do this or
five wide steps to do that.

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:24.202
But actually doing something with

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:25.922
all that advice is pretty tricky.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:27.758
I know you've found that.

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:30.102
And in fact, we're
laboring under old stories

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:32.822
about how best to build new habits.

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:35.007
Here are the two I think
are most pernicious.

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.680
The first is, if you just do
something for 21 days in a row,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.852
that's it, you're set.

00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:43.544
Or maybe this one, if you
just clench your teeth

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.633
and maybe your hands
and maybe your buttocks

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.099
really tightly, and
you try really, really,

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:51.796
really, really hard this
time, it'll all be okay.

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:54.713
And of course, neither of those work.

00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:56.198
So here's what I wanna share with you,

00:00:56.198 --> 00:01:01.047
some 21st century science
about building new habits.

00:01:01.047 --> 00:01:03.423
And here's where I'm gonna start.

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:04.923
We're half zombie.

00:01:06.338 --> 00:01:08.782
Research shows that we're operating

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:11.880
in habit mode at least 45% of the time.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.567
That means we're on automatic.

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:17.107
Let me explain how that happens.

00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:19.560
Imagine your brain is an egg.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.976
The yolk, you can see it
there, is the conscious mind.

00:01:22.976 --> 00:01:26.306
It's brilliant, language,
and creativity, and strategy,

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:27.831
they all live there.

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.618
But it's got limited capacity,
it gets tired really quickly.

00:01:31.618 --> 00:01:34.703
Meantime, all around it, is the egg white.

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:36.737
That's your unconscious mind,

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:40.202
and it's this that runs
most of your behavior,

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:42.602
most of our behavior.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:46.025
So you've gotta be smart
to outsmart your own brain.

00:01:46.025 --> 00:01:51.004
You have to consciously
manage your unconscious pans.

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:54.205
Here are two of the best
tactics I know to do just that.

00:01:54.205 --> 00:01:56.876
And the first one comes
from Charles Duhigg,

00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:59.268
he wrote the book "The Power of Habit".

00:01:59.268 --> 00:02:00.842
And he says this:

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:04.261
Rather than focusing
only on the new behavior,

00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:09.182
become aware of the trigger
that sets off the old behavior.

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:11.182
Let me make this real for you.

00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:15.349
You behave like a monkey, but
you wanna act like a beaver.

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:18.815
You've heard nothing but
good things about Canadians

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:21.193
and who wouldn't want teeth
that never stop growing?

00:02:21.193 --> 00:02:22.175
Just think of the money you're gonna save

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.754
on those dentistry bills.

00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:26.767
But even with the best of intentions,

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:29.668
you keep defaulting to monkey behavior.

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:30.765
And that's because you keep

00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:33.674
getting triggered by monkey context.

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:37.329
People come up to you and go
hey, do you wanna try a banana?

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.229
Before you know it, your
unconscious pans kick in

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:41.950
and you've gone ape again.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.969
It's all connected.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.147
So this is the take-away for Duhigg:

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:47.368
When you become conscious

00:02:47.368 --> 00:02:49.848
of what triggers your old behavior,

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:52.397
you can become mindful about replacing it

00:02:52.397 --> 00:02:55.564
with the new habit you really want.

00:02:55.564 --> 00:02:58.066
The second is insight comes from BJ Fogg.

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:01.074
He created Tiny Habit, he's an academic,

00:03:01.074 --> 00:03:02.408
and he says this:

00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:04.313
define your new habit,

00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:08.157
so that it takes 60 seconds
or less to complete.

00:03:08.157 --> 00:03:10.526
In other words, make it simple, and clear,

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:13.276
and absurdly easy to actually do.

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:16.062
His favorite example is this:

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.324
He says after he brushes his teeth,

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:21.814
his new habit is to floss one tooth.

00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:23.456
Now of course once he gets started,

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:25.225
he normally finishes the job,

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:27.999
and in fact the way I
try and tackle this is,

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.777
my habit is I wanna sit
on my meditation cushion

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:33.828
for one minute a day,

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:35.188
and I have to tell you I find that

00:03:35.188 --> 00:03:37.827
far more successful and far less daunting

00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:39.564
than my first attempt at that habit

00:03:39.564 --> 00:03:43.196
which is I'm gonna meditate
for 20 minutes everyday.

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:45.322
So there we go, two strategies to start

00:03:45.322 --> 00:03:47.392
building rock solid habits.

00:03:47.392 --> 00:03:50.615
First, from Duhigg, figure your trigger.

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:54.282
Second, from Fogg,
define a 60 second habit.

00:03:55.513 --> 00:03:57.406
Now we're just getting
started on this habit stuff,

00:03:57.406 --> 00:03:59.890
there's a ton more to
tell and share with you.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.394
Next video I wanna introduce you

00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:03.425
to Leo Babauta and Dan Coyle,

00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:06.307
they've got some great
insights about habits.

00:04:06.307 --> 00:04:09.060
But in the meantime, if
you are enjoying this,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.657
why don't you sign up for some
of the other cool, free stuff

00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:13.543
that we've got going at Box of Crayons.

00:04:13.543 --> 00:04:16.903
We've got quotes, and news
letters, and interviews.

00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:20.184
But you could just start with
our great work provocations.

00:04:20.184 --> 00:04:23.684
And in fact the sign up for that is below.
