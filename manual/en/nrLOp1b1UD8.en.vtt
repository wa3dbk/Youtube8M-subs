00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.340
Narrator: “Blueberries will grow wild throughout
Maine without ever having been planted. Even

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.799
though they don’t need human input to grow,
many fields are managed to increase yields.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.630
The Cooperative Extension at the University
of Maine conducts extensive blueberry research

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.050
on everything from fungi, insect pests and
disease to weeds, pruning practices and beneficial

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.660
insects.”
Frank Drummond, professor of entomology: “It

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.250
has to be squeezed through the holes in the
screen. It knocks off some of the pollen loads

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.890
that are on their back legs.”
Seanna Annis, professor of mycology (fungi):

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.780
“And I’m kind of looking around to see
if I see any swimming spores, which I don’t.”

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.450
Dave Yarborough, Cooperative Extension specialist:
“The Cooperative Extension really got involved

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.230
as a way to bring research-based knowledge
to the wild blueberry growers.”

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.340
Narrator: “Many growers have adopted integrated
pest management, or IPM. This method takes

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.970
the whole ecosystem into account, figuring
out when to apply pesticide so it will kill

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.620
the insect pests at a time when they’re
most vulnerable.”

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.710
Judith Collins, assistant specialist: “These
are yellow sticky cards to monitor for blueberry

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.979
thrips.”
Yarborough: “By understanding the biology

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.850
of the pest, we can reduce the amount of spray
that we need by about 80 percent.”

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.100
Collins: “We’re looking at better ways
to time pesticide applications, because basically,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.180
by the time you can physically see the damage,
it’s too late.”

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.020
Narrator: “IPM is also about making sure
the chemicals won’t harm the bees or other

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.850
beneficial wildlife.”
Drummond: “Well, we’re able to use the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.770
bees to sample the environment, so it’s
a very efficient way to have a million individuals

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.320
go out and sample the flowers within a radius
of a couple of miles.”

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.729
Narrator: “Sara Bushmann, a graduate student,
is studying wild, native pollinators and their

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.909
diversity in fields that are managed in different
ways.”

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.039
Sara Bushmann, graduate student, bioscience:
“One thing we’ll try to look at is if

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.090
there’s a difference in pollination level
in relation to the diversity of wild bees

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.939
that we find.”
Narrator: “Another aspect of integrated

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.789
pest management is studying the factors that
are involved in the spread of disease.”

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.099
Annis: “We’re collaborating with Frank
Drummond on our project to look at how the

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.950
monilinious spores get transferred from infected
leaves and flowers to healthy flowers.”

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.459
Narrator: “Monilinia also is known as Mummy
Berry, because it makes the fruit shrivel

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.400
up like mummies. Frank and Seanna are looking
at how bees spread the fungus.”

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.840
Drummond: “The bees are actually moving
the pathogen around inadvertently. So the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.599
fungus is deceiving the bees, in terms of
tricking them, making them think they’re

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:46.340
just another flower. These silvery pieces
on the leaves reflect UV light, and the fungus

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.060
also produces sugar. The bees are attracted
to the UV light because it mimics a flower.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.469
They land on it, and in so doing, they pick
up the spores.”

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:01.310
Annis: “The idea, though, is how well this
transfer really is occurring. And are bumblebees

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.099
better at it, because they’re better pollinators
than honeybees? Is there a difference between

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.140
the two of them? And also, just how much of
this is really happening?”

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.790
Drummond: “Yup, so we will put this one
in there.”

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.489
Narrator: “Researchers with the Cooperative
Extension also study different pruning methods,

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.859
determining which are the most effective at
helping blueberries thrive.”

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.870
Yarborough: “Well, burning was a practice
that was used to prune the blueberries. The

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.319
wild blueberry has about two-thirds of its
biomass underneath the ground, so when we

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.049
prune the plant, we’re really taking that
top third off. You do this to invigorate the

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.450
plant, to produce new stems that are more
productive.”

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.560
Narrator: “While burning is quite effective
at killing insect and weed pests, UMaine researchers

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.140
are helping growers to develop cheaper, more
environmentally friendly methods.”

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.040
Yarborough: “The type of burning originally
done was putting down straw …”

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.459
Narrator: “… which is extremely labor-intensive.”
Unidentified male: “Strictly for the love,

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.290
remember that, Dave.”
Yarborough: “We did the research at the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.370
university. We found that if we pruned blueberry
plants within an inch to the ground, this

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.040
would be equivalent to burning for the pruning
process.”

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.420
Narrator: “The Cooperative Extension also
works to bring scientific research to growers,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.260
holding informational sessions and gatherings
throughout the growing season.”

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.970
Yarborough: “I’m Dave Yarborough, blueberry
specialist for the university. I’m also

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.900
a weed scientist.”
Annis: “I’m Seanna Annis, I’m a berry

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.160
ecologist. I study blueberry diseases.”
Yarborough: “And the ants and the spiders

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.340
so far have been the two really predominant
beneficial insects.”

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.570
Yarborough: “Also to provide demonstration
plots, because the growers will actually get

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.020
to see the results of the work … The sulfur
is on this half.”

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.910
Narrator: “To see more results of the work
on blueberries and to learn about one study

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.410
in more detail, click on the ‘Blueberry
Genetics’ video.”
