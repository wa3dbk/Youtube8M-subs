00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Welcome! First, start CommView.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.060
You can use the scanner mode to scan all channel for your wifi accesspoint.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.700
If you have determined the channel of your wifi accesspoint, you choose single channel mode.

00:00:24.873 --> 00:00:27.773
Start capture by pressing on the play button.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.240
Check for your wifi accesspoint in the list.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.420
In my case it's named 'test' and has WPA / WPA2 encryption.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.980
For WPA / WPA2 a capture of the authentication
process of a connected client is needed.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.580
My phone connects to the wifi as a regular
client.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.480
If the client is connected you can stop the
capture and save the logs.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.120
Make sure you use the Wireshark / TCPdump
format.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.520
Now start the aircrack-ng GUI.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.660
If you don't have aircrack-ng on your PC you
find a download link in the description.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.080
Choose WPA encryption.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.920
Select your .cap file.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280
Select your wordlist.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.020
For this video I use for reasons of time a very small list.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:46.360
Assuming one does not know the password then you you need for a password like 'cake' a lift of all four digit combinations of characters from a to z.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.400
If you need a wordlist you find a link download
link in the description.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.600
Choose your wifi and check for a handshake.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.940
If you don't have a handshake you have not
captured the authentication of a client.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.040
Press Enter.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.700
My password is 'plausible'.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.160
Thanks for watching! Stay safe and stay legal!
