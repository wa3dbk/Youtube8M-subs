00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:00.325
When you think of great five cylinder engines

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:02.476
The Focus RS immediate comes to mind

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.705
as it should

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.654
That engine is born in a Volvo

00:01:22.654 --> 00:01:25.550
The 850 T5..

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.452
As you can see this car is green..

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:31.247
.. Focus RS green

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:33.664
Heico chose this color with a reason

00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:37.794
Because that Focus RS engine should be in a Volvo

00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:41.130
So they built this V40 HPC

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.822
And it's as sweet as it looks!

00:02:21.493 --> 00:02:24.660
As I said, it's built by Heico

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.913
HPC stands for Heico Performance Car

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:31.500
Heico is founded in 1995

00:02:34.684 --> 00:02:35.899
In Germany

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.092
By the owner of a Volvo dealership

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.261
When they built a race car

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.566
based on the 850

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:47.648
They got many requests for parts by customers

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:50.149
like the exhaust and suspension

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.397
They wanted that on their roadcars

00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:56.150
So the market for Volvo performance parts was born

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.900
So they built fast Volvo's

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.699
The tuning of Volvo's especially

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:16.045
The tuning of this car is very welcome

00:03:16.045 --> 00:03:19.746
The T5 as standard is pretty modest

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:22.807
Almost docile..

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.120
You really feel that the T5 has more to offer..

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.890
And that potential is now fully used

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.560
The tuning is quite extensive

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.452
It's not a simple remap

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.649
And it really brings this car to life!

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:41.300
That engine deserves this treatment..

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:51.488
So it's a 5 cylinder with a nice Turbo

00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:55.311
It has 320 HP, 510 NM

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:58.129
0-100 takes 5.6 seconds

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.300
And it's equipped with the Speed Pack

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.599
So it now has a top speed of 265 km/h

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:09.973
And they modified the exhaust

00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:11.931
Which truly is..

00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:14.896
magnificent!

00:04:14.896 --> 00:04:18.647
I dare to say that this is one of the best sounding 5 cylinders!

00:04:28.183 --> 00:04:30.548
Which can be opened by this button..

00:04:30.548 --> 00:04:33.161
When it's green the exhaust is closed

00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.770
When blue, the valves are open

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:39.002
It just sounds so brutal

00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:42.377
Loud and hard

00:04:42.377 --> 00:04:44.343
With a great blowing sound

00:04:44.343 --> 00:04:56.460
It's like the MTM Audi TT-RS and the Focus RS500 have combined their exhaust sounds

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.805
But then 5 times louder

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:10.063
When driving here through these woods..

00:05:10.063 --> 00:05:14.371
The sound is echoed by the trees and their leafs

00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:17.979
The car can be heard from miles away!

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.984
You then hear that great screaming sound!

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.840
It just sounds..

00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:35.775
Let's just switch to some footage from outside the car!

00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:09.675
To stop this violent car..

00:06:09.675 --> 00:06:13.557
They fitted these enormous brakes

00:06:15.003 --> 00:06:16.613
With 6 piston brake calipers

00:06:16.613 --> 00:06:18.768
They are really big

00:06:18.768 --> 00:06:20.897
accompanied by 19 inch rims

00:06:22.104 --> 00:06:26.052
This car positions itself among the extreme hothatches

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.362
The S3, the M135i..

00:06:28.362 --> 00:06:30.477
A45 AMG..

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:33.671
Which are great cars!

00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:36.078
The A45 is very very fast

00:06:36.078 --> 00:06:38.373
Probably faster than this one

00:06:38.373 --> 00:06:39.839
But..

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.780
It's all a bit composed or restrained..

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.549
A bit..

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.547
Let's just say they aren't as special..

00:06:47.547 --> 00:06:50.326
This is really special and you won't see it a second time!

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:54.055
The sound of the exhaust and turbo ..

00:06:54.055 --> 00:06:59.573
They both blow and hiss..

00:06:59.573 --> 00:07:03.975
When you get of the gas pedal there's another great sound!

00:07:03.975 --> 00:07:06.882
Those little sounds are just awesome!

00:07:06.882 --> 00:07:09.490
All of those things really make this car something truly unique!
