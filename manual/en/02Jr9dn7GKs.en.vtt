Hey, I'm Kimberly Walleston and welcome to 
Insiders Health where we bring you the freshest

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.699
happenings in the world of medicine without
that quack propaganda. Today we'll be talking

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.670
about athletes that are putting themselves
in harm's way with energy drinks,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.629
as well as the proposed new 
warning labels on cigarette packs.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.279
Every now and then you just need a little pick-me-up.

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:42.810
That extra cup of coffee, that Red Bull you keep in
your desk, even caffeine pills in some extreme cases...

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.090
And while for the most part it looks harmless,
it turns out that athletes can do major

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.440
damage to their bodies by turning to energy drinks.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.250
This study reported in the Mayo Clinic proceedings
adds weight to previous research that found

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.330
such drinks can cause heart attacks, seizures,
and in some extreme circumstances, lead to death!

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.590
The biggest problem is that runners will
use it as hydration as well as an upper

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.970
But energy drinks actually dehydrate
you as much as some alcohols.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.490
Weekend warriors are depending
on the pep to get them through,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.250
but water or sports drinks 
would actually be healthier.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.060
As far as researchers are concerned, you should
never have more than one energy drink a day,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.579
never mix them with alcohol and 
drink plenty of water after exercising.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.229
So put down the Red Bull if
you want to be truly healthy,

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.150
because all that running isn't going to 
help you much if you have a seizure!

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:49.640
In other health news, the federal government unveiled
new proposed regulations mandating bolder health
warnings on cigarette advertisements and packages.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.350
The proposed requirements are the biggest

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.619
change in tobacco health warnings in twenty-five
years, including new, larger and more

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.810
noticeable warning statement as
well as color, graphic images

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.800
depicting the negative health
consequences of smoking.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.169
One of these images is even a person in
a coffin with the text: "Smoking can kill you."

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.739
The idea is to make it obvious to everyone who
picks up a pack of cigarettes that what you're about

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.359
to do is extremely dangerous. While big tobacco
is fighting tooth and nail, we couldn't be

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:28.579
happier to see any steps in making
this habit less prevalent in our society.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.280
Here's hoping that they finally
found something that works.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.459
That's it for this edition of Insiders Health TV.
I'm your host Kimberly Walleston and remember: 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.459
it's your health. We're just 
helping you think outside the pack.
