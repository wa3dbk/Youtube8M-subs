NASA's Swift and ESA's XMM-Newton satellites

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.100
have used their X-ray telescopes to watch the interaction between a pair of gigantic

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.130
stars. This is a stellar grouping called Cygnus OB2,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.160
one of the richest collections of hot, massive O-type stars in the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.210
galaxy. Unfortunately for optical astronomers, this spectacular

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.270
sight is mostly hidden by dust clouds. One of these stars

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.330
is a radio source simply called Cygnus OB2 number 9.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.390
In 2008, astronomers concluded that the changes in radio emission only made

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.400
sense if the star were actually a binary, with two massive stars in a tight

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.430
orbit. Massive stars run so hot that they

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.450
actually drive away some of their gas in powerful outflows called stellar winds.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.480
In binaries with two large young stars orbiting closely,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.480
these hot outflows collide and produce X-rays. Only a few

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.510
of these colliding wind systems are known, and they aren't especially well behaved for

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.530
astronomers. The collision may become turbulent, and X-rays may appear only

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.550
at some times in the orbit. Which brings us back to Cygnus OB2 number

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.570
nine. It should produce X-rays where the stars' winds collide, but there was

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.600
no evidence for it. Perhaps it only occurred when the stars were closest in

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.630
their 2.4-year orbit. The first opportunity to test this came

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.650
during the close approach on June 28, 2011. So astronomers

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.670
enlisted Swift and XMM-Newton, as well as ground-based observatories to monitor

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.690
the system at intervals throughout the year. As the stars approach each other,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.730
their fierce winds crash together at several million miles an hour, reaching temperatures

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.750
of millions of degrees and creating X-rays. As they separate,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.800
the collision strength decreases. Even so, these powerful winds

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.820
will influence star formation in the binary's neighborhood.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.860
Cygnus OB2 number nine has turned out to be a 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.880
model colliding wind binary, one of the most reliable and best behaved now known.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.930
It will be a key to better understanding how these systems

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.970
help shape the galaxy. (Music)
