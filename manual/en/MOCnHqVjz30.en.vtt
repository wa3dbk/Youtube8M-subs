00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.880
Crouched between the branches, 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.120
a wildcat waits for the right moment to launch its lethal attack.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.440
In the most isolated mountain forests

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.360
 lives one of the last wildcats in Europe.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.840
Wildcats feed on small mammals and birds 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.400
which they hunt in the early hours of the evening.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.880
This tired pigeon is looking for a quiet place to roost for the night, 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.720
and is unaware of the discreet presence of the feline.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.560
With the utmost stealth, 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.040
it finds a blind spot from which to approach without detection: 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.320
the least noise or sudden movement would betray its presence.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.960
It advances in stages, until it close enough to reach its prey in a final, 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.120
explosive sprint.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.400
Sadly for this species, 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.920
crossbreeding and hybridization with domestic cats 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.560
is undermining the purity of this extraordinary wild feline.
