00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.792
(intense dance music)

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:07.982
- [Inna] Today we're making
the Green Apple Fuzz.

00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:11.661
(humming)

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:13.903
Cause it was a jazz.

00:00:14.974 --> 00:00:16.234
- Let's make this drink.

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:17.393
- Let's do it!

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:18.881
- Rum. Pour.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.227
- [Inna] (sings) Rum.

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:23.738
- [Skyy] Stop.

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:25.295
Would you pay attention to
what the hell you're doing?

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:26.655
(humming)

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.241
(snaps fingers) Would you pay attention?

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:30.137
Midori.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.144
- [Inna] (sings) Midori.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:34.499
Would you like my--

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:35.738
- Did I tell you to stop?

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:37.099
God dammit, would you pay attention

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:38.803
to what the hell you're doing. Huh?

00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:40.943
- Sorry. Okay, I'm concentrated.

00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:42.000
- You drunk?
- Focused. Focused.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.585
Focus on this.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.555
(humming)

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:49.232
- [Skyy] Stop.

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:51.002
- [Inna] Look how they--
- [Skyy] Stop!

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:54.296
(laughing)

00:00:56.058 --> 00:00:57.378
- Give it to me.

00:00:57.378 --> 00:00:58.516
- Give it to me, give it to me.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.491
- Give it to me, give it to me.

00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:01.259
- GIve it to me, give it to me.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:02.579
- Something yellow.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.372
- Give it to me, give it to me.

00:01:03.372 --> 00:01:05.425
- Yellow somethings.
(Skyy laughing)

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:06.603
Whoo!
- Okay, okay!

00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:08.953
(Skyy laughing)

00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:10.965
- I'm getting so much better.

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:11.966
- Blend!

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:12.769
- Woo!

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:14.390
- Pay attention to the drink.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.564
- It's twisting around itself.

00:01:16.564 --> 00:01:17.681
- No shit, okay?

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:19.570
- Because you didn't close it right, punk.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.744
- It was closed right. But you had--

00:01:21.744 --> 00:01:24.270
Put your hands on it properly. Blend.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:26.763
- [Skyy] Corn syrup.

00:01:26.763 --> 00:01:29.950
- [Inna] Corn syrup is in
every food we eat, guys.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.575
You the one who's doing everything.

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.607
- [Skyy] Good. Then do everything with me

00:01:33.607 --> 00:01:35.029
and stop fucking dancing.

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:36.837
- [Inna] All I do is
standing and watching.

00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:38.341
- So we got these bottle holders.

00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.185
We put in lime, cherry,
our little bottle holder

00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:43.054
on the side here. Uh-huh.

00:01:43.054 --> 00:01:44.070
- [Inna] Uh, uh-huh.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.122
- Don't let it leak
out. It has to go fast.

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:47.241
You can put your finger over it.

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.702
- Make sure you wash your
hands before you do that.

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:50.395
- Washing your hands optional, man.

00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:51.350
- He doesn't do that ever.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.545
I'm not drinking from that one.

00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:55.986
Yay.

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:58.148
- [Skyy and Inna] And there you have it!

00:01:58.148 --> 00:01:59.673
(mimicking Spider-man web slinging)

00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:02.692
- I didn't know that we were
doing this Spider-Man thing.

00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:05.741
Are they guns or are they web sling--

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.357
Never mind that's a super
hero I've never met before.

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:10.734
Never saw any of his
work but I didn't realize

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.209
that we were doing him.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.186
And there you have it.

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:18.163
The Green Apple Fuzz created
by my girl stephnesse21.

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:19.876
Go ahead, put your lips on that.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:22.791
- Oh, wait.

00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:24.552
Mmm.

00:02:25.563 --> 00:02:26.925
- Try to keep the straw in the glass.

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:28.419
- Mmm.

00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:35.551
Taste cool. Oh, now I feel this.

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:37.421
It's like a popsicle creamsicle

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:39.344
but if it would be liquidized.

00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:42.961
Slushie mushie fashie, like
all those things, you know?

00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:45.013
Now I feel Smirnoff a lot.

00:02:45.013 --> 00:02:49.077
Very bubbly and it just
goes into my nose. Mmm.

00:02:49.077 --> 00:02:51.332
- Okay, that's a Russian
description of this drink.

00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:53.770
I think that's positive,
I'm not sure. Okay.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.781
Let's test your twerking skills.

00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:57.982
Okay, ready? Go ahead.

00:02:58.671 --> 00:02:59.382
Twerk. (laughs)

00:02:59.382 --> 00:03:00.759
- I cannot. (laughs)

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.584
- Try again, sorry, okay.

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.094
- [Inna] I can slowly twerk.

00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:05.089
- Okay, that's a slow twerk.

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.816
Okay, a little bit faster. Go ahead.

00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:07.913
- I don't know.

00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:09.721
- What are you doing? Come on.

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:13.277
Twerk, twerk. (laughs)

00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:14.659
- I'm not a twerker.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.512
- Straight from Russia.

00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:17.076
Hold up, hold up.
- I'm not a twerker.

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:18.681
- I know. I know. Don't worry, Russian.

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:19.392
We just showing--

00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:21.201
- I can do like (mimics heavy bass).

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.354
- Hey, hey, hey. Pay attention.

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:25.000
We just showing them
how it's done in Moscow.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.056
Moscow twerking.

00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:27.926
- We don't twerk in Russia.

00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:28.657
- Don't worry.

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:29.896
Go ahead. Go ahead.

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.095
This is a Moscow Twerk, go ahead.

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:32.598
(Inna groaning)

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:33.609
- Ready? One, two--

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.761
(Skyy laughing)

00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:38.298
The Moscow Twerk!

00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:39.942
- I'm not from Moscow!

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:41.100
- It's called the Moscow.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.274
You just get it like this
and you do this, okay?

00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:45.001
The Moscow. Oh, shit.

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.901
The Moscow. The Moscow.

00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:49.999
- I don't look like I'm retarded.

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.754
- Oh, look at the Moscow.

00:03:51.754 --> 00:03:54.167
Dude, I'm gonna go into
the club tonight with this.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.065
(Skyy laughing)

00:03:57.065 --> 00:03:59.691
- [Skyy and Inna] Tipsy Bartender!

00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:06.146
- That was pathetic.

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:07.793
- [Voiceover] Today we're
making a raspberry mojito

00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:08.766
in a bottle.

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:11.814
- [Skyy] Exactly homeboy for
the man or woman on a go.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:14.336
- [Together] Charlie,
Charlie, can we play?

00:04:14.456 --> 00:04:17.377
- Charlie, Charlie. I dare
you to come out, Charlie.

00:04:17.377 --> 00:04:19.063
(laughing)

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:20.783
Charlie, are you here? Charlie?
