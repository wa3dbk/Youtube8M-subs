Hi, I'm Masequa Myers and I'll be talking
about a few of the most essential and fun

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.570
components in celebrating Kwanzaa. First of
all, because they're our future, Kwanzaa is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.060
all about the children as well in our family.
And on the last day, is when we bring out

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.759
the zawadis, the gifts. And those gifts are
given to the children on the seventh day.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.640
And remember, the children can give each other
gifts, can give the adults gifts, the adults

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.210
can give them gifts. But what we really want
to stress is creativity and not just buying

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.650
something, but something that you create yourself,
that you put your heart and your love into

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.829
it. So we're not worried about how much it
cost or where it came from as long as it comes

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.520
from the heart. And also on the last day,
is our feast day, our karamu, which means

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.590
we all come together either in our family
or in the community or at public Kwanzaas

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:15.399
and we bring food and we eat and we sing and
we say prayer and we mediate and we pour libation.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:24.310
But we do this all over the wonderful activity
of food. So the karamu is the big feast. Feast

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.909
is the English translation of the word karamu.
So I hope you incorporate these two essentials

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.439
in your celebrating of Kwanzaa. And, if you
want more information about how Dr. Maulana

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:50.329
Karenga created Kwanzaa, feel free to pick
up his Kwanzaa book. It is so wonderful. It

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:58.340
goes into details about everything that we've
covered in this video. And visit the official

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.590
