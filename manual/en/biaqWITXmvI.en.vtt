00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.210
3, 2, 1.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.690
Hello YouTube.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.889
That's really awkward.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:12.889
Hi guys.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:13.889
Hey.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:14.889
Saying hi is sometimes difficult.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:15.889
This is Game On.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:16.889
I'm Grace.

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:20.830

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.930
I think it's subscribe Laurie.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.500
I'm going to work on that.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.939
Next time I'm going to be like subscribe.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.150
Subscribe.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.160
First of all we've got something extra special
for you Laurie went down to the Call of Duty

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.450
launch last night and...

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.730
...and I met Rizzle Kicks and a dog.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.719
I'm not sure which was better you can decide
check it out.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.320
There he is.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.920
Look at him.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.789
Who's a cute little COD dog?

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.429
Anyway... while I was down at the launch I
wanted to answer the most important question

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.330
- why is Call of Duty so popular?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.990
But before all of that let's quickly find
out what Ghosts is all about by poking through

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.280
the classified documents by which we mean
asking Tina Palacios from Infinity Ward the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.280
games developer.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.740
Call of Duty Ghosts takes place in a war torn
America with very limited resources and manpower.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.009
So for the first time ever in Call of Duty
you're not going to have the best of everything

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.220
that you would need to win against the enemy.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.520
So you're going to see Logan which is your
character and his brother Hesh go up against

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.380
a new enemy called the Federation and really
try to struggle to survive and protect what's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.640
left of the United States.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.000
Although the single player is only really
half the battle as it's the multiplayer that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.010
really shifts the copies.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.570
Activision have said that everyday players
clock the equivalent of 1,900 years worth

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.290
of play time in the multiplayer and that so
far more than 18 billion multiplayer matches

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.399
have been played.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.450
That is a lot of time to be stuck in a cycle
of kill, be killed, respawn, repeat, or if

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.349
you're like us the cycle's more like kill,
be killed, respawn, be killed, rage quit,

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.430
cry.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.790
And even with the frustration it causes for
fat fingered folk like us, people still want

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.690
more COD and if you need proof, just look
at these people queuing up in London to buy

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.650
the game at midnight.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.540
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.489
We needed it.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.290
We needed to get it as soon as it came out.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.510
We just had to get it straight away just to
play it.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.450
I've taken a week off work so I can play it
all week so I'm happy so yeh it's going to

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.090
be awesome.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.890
Dunno why he's so excited that's a PS4 copy.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.180
He's definitely got nothing to play it on.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.420
So just what is it about COD that inspires
such whooping and hollering dedication from

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.420
the fans?

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.760
The great thing about Call of Duty is that
it's very competitive and it gives you that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.320
sort of satisfaction of wanting to win in
really small doses if you wanted to but on

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.879
top of that we always had this huge passion
at Infinity Ward to have games run at 60 frames

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.760
per second which means it's really smooth,
we have low latency controls which means when

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.750
you press a button you don't have to wait
for the game to react to your actions.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.220
But surely COD's magic can't just come down
to the fact that it feels good when you press

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.220
a button.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.760
Maybe we need a new type of expert.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.940
How about Rizzle Kicks who thought it was
all about the smack talk when taking part

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.450
in a Call of Duty competition?

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.440
So in my mind yeh the round one was the smack
talk and I'm pretty sure we won that.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.900
Come against us in Call of Duty only thing
you'll be calling is your mum.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.400
Say you're good at COD well I'm good at shark.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.580
In fact smack talk seemed to be the theme
of the night as rapper, Wretch 32, joined

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.580
in.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.640
I've been yet to do an interview so now I
get to say my piece and my piece is, there

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640
will be no peace.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.049
That's my peace.

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.129
Whether you like Call of Duty for its smooth
gameplay and tight controls or just for the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.030
fact that it lets you trash talk with strangers
and from going online it's probably that - with

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.730
Ghosts leading the first person shooter charge
for the new generation of consoles it seems

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.310
like there is no toppling the current king
of multiplayer.
