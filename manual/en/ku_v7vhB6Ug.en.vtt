00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.139
Elsa "Happy birthday Anna, I've made you a
cake"

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.040
Anna "Oh Elsa it's beautiful, how'd you cook
that?

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.880
Elsa: Ann on YouTube showed me

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.630
Welcome to How To Cook That I am Ann Reardon

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.860
To make a frozen fever birthday cake you'll
need 3 sponge cakes cooled and leveled.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.789
You can see the recipe video for them on the
howtocookthat.net website and the frosting

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:22.910
recipe quantities are there too.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.810
And I'll put a ink in the description below.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.039
We will leave one sponge cake full sized and
then we need three smaller cakes.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.630
I'm going to use bowls to help me cut them
the right size.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.330
Cut the middle sized one out first.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.170
Then using the left over part of that sponge
cake cut out two pieces to make the smaller

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.920
circle cake.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.060
Then cut around the bigger bowl so you end
up with four different sized cakes.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.930
Seive the icing sugar or powdered sugar to
get rid of any lumps Then melt your butter

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.340
or margarine in the microwave.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.780
Pour that into the icing sugar and mix it
through really well.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.650
Now because the butter is not white it turns
your icing that yellowy colour.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.810
If we addd blue to that we'll get green, we
don't want green.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.470
So I am going to add some white food colouring
first and then some blue.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.410
Once you are happy with that put that to one
side.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.080
And in another bowl add your compound white
chocolate and some cream.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.560
Now you want to heat that in the microwave
in 30 second bursts, stirring each time until

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.310
it is melted and smooth like this.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.700
Then add the blue frosting to that and mix
the two together and your frosting is ready.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.880
Put a small bowl or cup onto a plate and then
add one of your cakes on top.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.140
Pour some warmed frosting over it and just
let it drip down the sides of the cake.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.420
If there are gaps just add more frosting and
let it drip down.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.760
Once it has cooled take a spatula and add
a bit more frosting around the edges just

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.960
to smooth it out - and we'll add another layer
in a moment.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.940
Scrape up all that excess frosting that's
dripped onto the plates.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.170
And warm it up again to make it liquid.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.920
Then pour it through a sieve to get rid of
any cake crumbs that came off the cake when

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.750
you did that first layer.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.750
Now we want the frosting to be warm enough
to be liquid but not hot or it's just going

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.080
to melt our first layer of frosting of the
cake.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.620
Pour it over the top just like we did the
first time

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.090
And this second layer just helps to get the
frosting smooth, now it is not as smooth as

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.890
if you used a cold whipped frosting and spread
out using your spatula and leveled it.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.280
But because this cake is so small and it has
so many details on it you are really not going

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.790
to see it anyway.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.810
And this is just much quicker.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.870
In the movie this is an ice cream cake, if
you want to make an icecream cake follow the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.960
directions on the fault in our stars cake
video you can find that on youtube.com/howtocookthat

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.860
Once it is set trim off any drips.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.340
And then stack your four cakes on top of each
other.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.940
Now make up some royal icing and pipe it around
to cover the joins where the cake joins the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.240
next one.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.720
Just squeeze and drag go back squeeze stop
drag go back and and continue that for each

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.250
layer of cake.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.099
Then using a small star shaped tip pipe little
stars around the top.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.959
Start low and squeeze stop and pull up start
low squeeze stop pull up.

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.550
Add those around the top edge of each layer
of cake.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.440
Now using a small round tip pipe semicircles.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.440
Attach it at the top the pipe and pull away
from the cake letting the frosting just hang

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440
down.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.400
And then bring it back to the cake to join
it on again.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.099
So you get a nice smooth semicircle when you
do that.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.330
Once you've done that on each layer add some
yellow decorations, I am just using soft sugar

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.129
pearls that I purchased form the shop.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.069
Now add some swirls of frosting around the
bottom layer.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.810
A bit like drawing an s shape on its side.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.299
And then using a toothpick mark where you
want you sunflowers to be.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.599
Then pipe from the dot a curve going down,
up and around.

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.500
And continue that all the way around and then
on the next layer up do the same thing but

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.730
in the opposite direction.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.110
Take some little chocolate drops and cut off
the top of it so you're left with a round

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.739
bit for the flower centers.

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.269
If you can't get chocolate drops in this size
that is fine just melt some chocolate and

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.720
pipe out little circles.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.639
Using yellow buttercream and a star tip pipe
a flower on the side and add a chocolate circle

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.280
for the centre.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.810
Squeeze out less frosting for the flowers
on the next layer up.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.660
So they are a little bit smaller put them
all the way around the cake and then smaller

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.120
again on the top level.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.710
Mix in a little blue to the left over yellow
frosting to make green and pipe on a leaf

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.889
next to each flower.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:42.889
And pipe on a leaf next to each flower.

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.460
Now you can use a piping tip to do this or
I have a whole page on the website showing

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.330
how you can use just plastic bags to make
the tips like this so that you don't need

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.590
to buy the tips.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.020
So you don't have the tips just click through
to the website to find that.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.800
Now we just need to add a little snow.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.500
Put something to the very top of the cake
to protect it and then using a tea strainer

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.770
sprinkle on some icing sugar.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.910
Remove the cupcake liner and then add the
ice sculpture picture to the top using a toothpick.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.729
You can print that out in this size from the
website.

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.070
Elsa "Do you like it"

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.400
Anna "Yes I love it"

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.800
Elsa "ahh choo"

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.669
Anna "bless you Elsa"

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.070
Anna "mmm yumm"

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.070
Elsa "ahchoo"

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.320
Elsa "thank you but you have a fever lets
get you to bed"
