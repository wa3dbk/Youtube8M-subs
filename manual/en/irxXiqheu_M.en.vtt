00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.033
In the previous tutorial we found out how to 
teach our Robot spin around

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:15.733
But how do we make it stop when it is pointing 
at the Toy?

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:19.733
To remind us how the program commands in the 
last tutorial work

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:23.633
It start at the green triangle image,

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.166
It goes into the first part of the loop.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.599
It starts up the motor command

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.466
The motors turn on with a power of thirty 
percent, one forwards, one backwards

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:41.466
It then goes to the loop end, and finds that the 
loop ending condition is "Unlimited" repeat, so...

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.899
so it goes back to the start of the loop.and...

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900
and keeps both motors going, finds the loop end 
condition is "Unlimited" repeats, and...

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.333
and keeps going around the loop keeping the motors going and keeps YayaBot spinning forever...

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:59.833
that "8" sideways is a sign for "infinity" 
repeats...

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.666
Now, we don't want YayaBot to spin forever, we 
want it to stop pointing at a Toy...

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:06.899
We can do this by changing the loop ending 
command.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.900
Left-click on the loop-ending image, and left-click on the "Ultrasonic Sensor" option

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.900
Choose either the "Distance Inches" option (or "Distance Centimetres" option)

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.133
I will choose inches because I'm ancient and I was raised with distances in inches...

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:28.599
Set the comparison condition to "less than" (option 4), and...

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.033
Change the distance to thirty inches (or seventy-five centimetres), because...

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:38.033
because thirty inches is about the length of my swimming pool (your distance may be different)

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:43.499
So NOW the program will start at the green triangle, enter the loop, and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.500
and keeps the "Move Tank" motor command motors going, and...

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.700
It then goes to the end of the loop  command, and checks to see if there is anything less than thirty inches straight ahead, if not...

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.700
if there is nothing less than seventy-five centimetres ahead, it goes back to the start of the loop command, and...

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:11.766
keeps the motor going, checks the end of loop condition again, and keeps repeating the loop and motor commands until something is ahead.

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:21.932
When something is ahead, it leaves the loop and goes into the next program command after the loop.

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.933
We do not have a command after the loop, let us put a command in.

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:31.366
To give us some room, close the documentation window by left-clicking on the "Close Content Editor" option

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:39.899
Make sure the green rectangle is raised, and left-click on the "Move Tank" command and drag it up to the Command line after the loop.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:51.133
Theoretically, if everything has gone right, YayaBot will be pointing at the Toy, so...

00:02:51.133 --> 00:03:02.333
This Move Tank command will send YayaBot forwards with both motors 50 percent power for one wheel rotation.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:08.566
We will need more than one wheel rotation, in my case about nine wheel rotations will take YayaBot to the far end of the Pool, but...

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:15.132
but your swimming pool will be a different size, so you will probably need a different number of wheel rotations...

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:23.299
Before we download the program commands to YayaBot for the first time, let us check that the motors and sensor slots are correct

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.300
Motors are B &amp; C - good.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.300
YayaBot's ultrasonic sensor is in port three - so that is also correct.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:40.233
This is where we would left-click if we wanted to correct the port number, but we don't need a correction in this case.

00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:46.633
Everything looks good, so let us download our program commands to our Robot.
