00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.380
Ok, so today we’re replacing the steering
stabilizer.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.910
Basically, we’re underneath a Jeep Grand
Cherokee and the steering stabilizer is this

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.140
guy right here.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.130
This kind of attaches to the middle of this
bar and then on the frame right here as well.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.970
It’s right above the track bar.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.480
So mine is uh, it’s one of the death wobble
fixes you can say.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.750
Usually it’s the track bar, also the steering
stabilizer; sometimes an alignment can cause

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.960
it.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.190
Basically anything that has play in it.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.480
Like you can see the track bar sometimes has
some play here in this bushing.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920
In my case this was not the cause.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.630
Sometimes play here in these arms can cause
it.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.829
Over here with the pitman on, that can cause
it.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.119
Sometimes the steering gears can do it.

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.220
So we’re just kind of narrowing it down
with the options.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.750
The most common options I guess you should
say.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:21.210
Anyway, so to take off the steering stabilizer,
this bolt right here is a 15mm and the one

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.369
right here is a 19mm.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.640
And I already took out the cotter pin.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.659
So this bolt right here is completely stuck
onto this bar.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.490
Right here the only place with threads so
it’s not threaded inside of this.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.030
So what I’m going to do right now is I’m
going to take a torch and heat it up a little

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.179
bit.

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.570
The WD40 didn’t do anything to it.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.889
One more reason it makes me suspect this is
going bad up here is that it’s starting

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:56.950
to leak, well, it’s been leaking the fluid
that’s been inside of it.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.179
So once that happens you know the shock itself
is shot.

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.859
So hopefully a new one will fix the death
wobble.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:12.680
Ok so the heat was pretty much useless so
what I have right now is a pitman puller.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.200
So what I’m going to do is I have it tightened
around the edges right here and then this

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.379
bolt right here pushes against that one and
hopefully we can get the bolt out of there.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.689
It’s bound pretty tight.

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:31.209
Anyway, so this one is a 17mm and you just
basically tighten it down until that one pops

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.329
off.

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.610
So that’s what the bolt looks like when
it’s stuck down in there.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.510
Like I mentioned before it doesn’t have
threads on this part of it so it was just

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.090
basically bound inside of that.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.530
I also forgot to mention I did use a couple
squirts of that PB blaster stuff.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.090
That stuff is amazing.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.510
I was using WD40 before that and I don’t
know if it was the pitman arm or the PB blaster

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.450
but hey we got it out.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.840
You can see where it’s been leaking all
that hydraulic fluid or whatever else they

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.600
put inside these things.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.860
So with the new arm it’s pretty much just
plug and play.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.969
You just slide it in there and then I believe
this bolt on this end is a 15mm and the other

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.520
one is an 18.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.290
And then with this end right here, I went
ahead and put the top on first of all just

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.379
so I wouldn’t have to deal with it up inside
the car.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.689
And then I just slipped this end down into
it.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:35.689
And it’s pretty easy.

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:41.109
You know, it’s all, now that I got the other
bolt out this one just slides in and out.

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.340
Pretty simple.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.569
And then I just need to put the bolt on this
end with the cotter pin.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.359
You can see the bolt has the little ridges
on it so the cotter pin can slide inside.

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:59.090
Bolt just goes on like that.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.090
There you go.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.680
I believe that this nut needs to be tightened
to 35 pounds of torque and then the top one

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
as well.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.200
So that’s how you install a steering stabilizer.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.870
I usually throw out videos probably every
week or so.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.310
So if you’re interested in jeep repair,
automotive or anything, you know, taking apart

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.310
cell phones.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.830
I do a large variety of stuff.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.970
Anyway feel free to “like” if this helped
you and subscribe.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.170
Thanks!
