Welcome to the Ac News!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Letâ€™s see the trailer of the movie: Never Let Me Go. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
See you later with the news of today.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Kathy, Tommy and Ruth are three seemingly ordinary teenagers,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
students of an exclusive English boarding school.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But when they reach the age of majority

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
they get to know the terrible fate that awaits them:

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
all students of the school are just clones

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
created to provide spare organs.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The movie comes to cinemas March 23, 2011.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Matthew Vaughn is planning

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to bring to the screen the adventures of new superheroes.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It seems that the director is interested

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in making the film version of The Golden Age,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
comic that tells the story of a nursing home for super heroes.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
