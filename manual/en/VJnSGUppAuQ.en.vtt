Hi, I'm Josh from eSpares.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.280
In this video I'm going to be showing you
how to change the motor on this Numatic Henry

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.020
Micro HVR-200M22, although the process is
going to be largely the same for other Numatic

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.320
vacuum cleaners.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.009
Safety first: make sure you've unplugged your
vacuum cleaner before you carry out this repair

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.009
work.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.579
Now, the motor for the Henry is housed in
Henry's head unit, so the first thing we need

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.600
to do is remove the head unit from the rest
of the body.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.260
So I'm just going to undo these clips at the
side and rest it on something soft so that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.360
the top doesn't get scratched.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.440
Underneath we have a total of seven screws.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.719
Four on the outside and three on the inside
here.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.539
So firstly, you need to remove the four outside
screws.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.250
So now I've removed those four outer screws,
I can remove the top cabinet and the cable

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:16.950
assembly, I'll just pop that to one side.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.530
And now I can remove these three inner screws
as well.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.030
Okay, so now I've removed all the screws,
I can very gently turn the whole unit over,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.360
being careful to keep both parts together
and then remove the top, exposing the motor

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.630
underneath.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.920
There are two wires connected by spade connectors
to the motor, so all I need to do is just

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.799
pull these off, before lifting the whole motor
unit out.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.070
Okay, so now I've taken the old motor out
I can put the new one in.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.640
The first thing I need to do is take the cover
from the old motor and locate it correctly

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.920
on top of the new one.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.540
Now that's done, I'm going to reattach the
spade connectors to the relevant terminals

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.290
on the side of the motor.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.290
Top tip: We found that it's actually much
easier to fit the new motor upside down into

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.129
the lid, rather than the normal way up in
the base.

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.370
So, I'm just going to turn the motor upside
down and locate the tabs from the cover into

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.550
the spaces in the lid.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:45.300
Then, take the locating ring with the sound
insulation foam and place that around the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:54.400
motor, so that the tab of the locating ring
covers the exposed wires in the lid and finally

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.659
take the rubber sealing ring and place that
around the base of the motor.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:19.900
Then I can place the base onto the lid and
now I just need to screw them back together.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.500
So now I've screwed in those three inner screws,
I'm just going to turn the assembly over and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.020
then take the cable assembly and place that
back on the top, making sure that the cable

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.790
comes through this gap in the side here.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.569
Then take the lid of the unit and place it
back on the top, making sure that the switches

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:55.250
come through these two holes here, as well
as the cable feed clipping into place, here.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.070
Then I just need to screw it all back together.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:13.900
Now, it's important to bear in mind that Numatic
have actually used several different manufacturers

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.940
for production of their Henry motors, so if
you buy a new motor for your Henry, make sure

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.650
you find the right one for your particular
model.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.750
eSpares has a range of motors for Numatic
and other vacuum cleaner manufacturers and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.030
they're all available on the eSpares website.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.830
Thanks for watching.
