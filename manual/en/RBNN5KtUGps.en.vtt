00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.310
The Löwe is a Tier VIII premium heavy tank.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.200
It's a menacing vehicle with an impressive name.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.830
It's slow, but has a nice sniper gun.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.320
The time has come to learn how to play

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.520
this legendary German vehicle in World of Tanks.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.100
The Löwe's trump card is its gun.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.270
Its damage per shot may be not very impressive,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.200
but it is still clearly one of the best guns of any Tier VIII vehicle.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.910
Its aim time is 2.9 seconds

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.620
After the shot, it takes a long 12 seconds to reload.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.570
But there's no need to rush,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.030
because snipers don't run to the enemy in a bayonet charge.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.180
And the Löwe is, very definitely, a heavy sniper.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.900
Average damage per shot is 320.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.420
This is a pretty typical value for Tier VIII vehicles,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.260
but its average damage per minute is not high-1600

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.590
You can improve the situation a bit with the help of equipment

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.300
and crew skills and perks.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.600
Equip your tank with Gun Rammer and Improved Ventilation,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.440
train your crew with the Brothers in Arms perk, and use Chocolate,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.840
and you'll have a significant improvement in aim and reload time.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.270
The Löwe penetrates 234 mm of armor with its standard AP shell.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.270
That outstanding penetration value

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.660
makes it viable to play not only against Tier VIII vehicles,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.900
but also against higher-tier opponents.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.440
The Löwe's gun is also incredibly accurate.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.950
Let's run an experiment.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.800
Suppose a Löwe is left alone against four enemy vehicles

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.030
and they are not just vehicles, but those that make player hands sweat.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.920
Can you hit the bull's eye?

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.370
Everyone can do it!

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.730
And now try to hit the cupola of the T110E5 from 300 m.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.560
This could be a stalemate situation, but not for the Löwe

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.830
The German tank confidently sends shell after shell

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.100
at the vulnerable spots on the enemy armor like a world biathlon champion.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.820
Yes, the Löwe will have trouble fighting against Tier X vehicles at close range.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.190
But from this distance, it can cause damage

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.160
without worrying about being hit by enemy at its weak spots.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.430
Enemies destroyed!

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.100
The Löwe exemplifies the famous German accuracy and armor penetration value.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.200
So, the gun is up to the task.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.720
But the gun needs to be placed in a fighting position.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.720
And that's not a simple task.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.320
The Löwe is heavy and slow.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.840
Although it has an 800-hp engine,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.600
that engine has to propel a 90-ton steel monster.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.870
Among all Tier VIII heavy tanks, the Löwe ranks last in power-to-weight ratio.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.140
Its maximum speed is only 35 km/h.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.720
So, you need to think about what position to take

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.660
and what game style to use at the start of the battle.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.700
It's very hard to change the flank during the battle.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.840
Despite all that weight, the Löwe is not very well armored.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.240
Although its front hull armor is quite good for a Tier VIII heavy tank-120 mm -

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.570
it's rendered almost ineffective by the hull configuration.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.640
The upper glacis plate is placed at a 45-degree angle,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.490
so the relative armor thickness is about 180 mm.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.070
That much armor does allow the Löwe to withstand hits from Tier VII medium and heavy tanks,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.080
but Tier VIII vehicles have little trouble penetrating it.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.150
A wide joint between plates is vertical,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.680
so its relative armor thickness is 120 mm.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.250
Almost all vehicles are able to penetrate this vulnerable spot.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.240
That's why you have to try to hide it behind cover

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.960
or roll out at the opponent at a sharp angle and turn your hull.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.080
You can tank effectively with your 100-mm side armor only against Tier VII vehicles.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.420
Higher tier vehicles won't let you do it.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.160
Prospects would seem bleak if it were not for the 120-mm gun mantlet.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.420
Sure, all tanks have mantlets.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.020
But the Löwe stands out.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.030
Its mantlet covers the entire front of its turret.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.720
The sum of mantlet and turret armor gives a thickness of 240 mm.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.880
It's incredibly hard to penetrate it.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.880
And if you manage to hide the hull,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.280
the German tank turns into a real unassailable fortress.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.400
The Löwe is an interesting vehicle.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.000
You can either play as a sniper or use it as a support vehicle.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.270
It's large and easily spotted even at long distances.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.900
So, you should carefully choose your cover when playing as a sniper.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.520
You main task is to hide the hull as well as possible, and let the turret work.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.720
The Löwe's gun has good elevation and depression angles,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.400
allowing it to take advantageous positions

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.620
and confidently deal with enemy vehicles, while staying safe.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.390
If you want to fight on the frontline, you can do that in your Löwe as well.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.980
When the German is at the top of the list,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.280
it can tank with its front armor if rolls out at the enemy at a sharp angle.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.200
Shells will most likely ricochet from its armor.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.290
It will be more difficult to fight against Tier IX and X vehicles.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.040
Most of them can send the Löwe back to the Garage

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.590
in a few shots so you have to play carefully.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.160
Hide behind the backs of the more heavily armored teammates,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.750
use any available cover to protect your hull, and exploit your strong turret.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.050
Your sniper gun will help to fight against higher-tier vehicles successfully.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.260
You can roll out while the opponents are reloading,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.260
 shoot at their weak spots, and then roll back to your protected position.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.340
Remember that the Löwe is a premium vehicle,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.640
so its crew will be trained 50% faster than usual.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.440
Also, earning credits in this tank is an absolute pleasure.
