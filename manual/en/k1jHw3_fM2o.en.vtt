00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.269
I am going to Salamanca for a few days.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.269
I have never been there and
 I can't wait to get to know the city.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.269
The first thing I will do is to book a place.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.820
I am looking for a hotel which is not expensive,
 which is good and which is centric.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.290
I want a room that is comfortable and has a big bed

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.290
and a clean sink.
Ah! One that offers free buffet breakfast.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.750
There are plenty of hotels to choose from...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
at the end I stay at this one.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.079
It is not expensive, it is good and it is centric.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.979
The room is comfortable

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.840
it has a big bed

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.840
and a clean sink.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.840
And it offers a free buffet breakfast.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.540
Now I am going to go for a walk around the city.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.090
I need a map which indicates the monuments.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.090
I will go to the tourist office and ask them for one.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.090
A very kind girl has given me a map

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:58.209
which indicates the main city monuments.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.389
I have been told there are many beautiful places.
I will see if I find places

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:08.389
where I can make good photos.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:43.989
To be honest I have found many places
 where I have been able to take nice photos.

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.259
After walking for so long I fancy having a drink.

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.670
I am going to look for a deck
 which is on a beautiful place

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.370
and where the sun does not hit.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.189
Here the sun is hitting, I am going to roast.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.189
I don't like this place,
 there are better places for sure.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.189
Ufff! I'm so thirsty!

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.129
At the end I have found a deck
which is on the shade

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:24.129
and at an unbeatable place.
 Don't you think?

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.200
I want to get a souvenir to my family,
 but I don't know what to buy for them.

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.519
It has to be something that they like,
 that is typical of Salamanca

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.519
and that is practical.

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.519
I look in the souvenir shops but I can't decide.

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.099
Afterwards I take a walk to the market

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.010
and I find there are many butchers 
with ham and 'embutido ibÃ©rico'.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.910
At the end I decide to buy 'salchichones'.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:13.579
They like 'embutido ibÃ©rico', it is typical
 of Salamanca and it is very handy.

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:19.579
I am sure that they will love it.

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:27.579
