00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
one, two, three, four!

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.720
Rev up your engines!

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.100
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.200
today I'm going to show you how complex
it can be to fix modern air conditioning

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.390
systems in your car, now this vehicle is
the 2002 Lexus, so it's 11 years old but

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.120
it's still really complicated and
unfortunately most modern cars are just

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.000
as complicated as this when it comes to
running heating and air conditioning

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.340
systems, so they require a fancy scan
tool like this, just to analyze what the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.200
problem is, so we'll pick air
conditioning system and then active test

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.130
and up comes a whole list of things you
could actively check on the vehicle's air

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.450
conditioning system, you can check all
kinds of sensors with these machines, you

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.560
can activate them and then see if they
respond on the actual car and as you can

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.790
see as I scroll down, there are all kinds
of things to check and it's a good thing

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.470
they also show trouble codes for the air
conditioning system and this is well

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.430
beyond the simple trouble code you get
from a cheap scan tool, they don't access

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.180
any of these codes, you need a fancy scan
tool like this in order to access the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.500
air conditioning trouble codes and in
this case it's the code for the solar

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.670
sensor circuit on the passenger side,
yeah I'm not making it up there that

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.520
complicated, they measured the
temperature of the heat coming from the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.340
Sun and without a machine like this to
analyze it, you got pot luck guessing, now

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.510
personally I find it absurd that they
have to make cars this complicated, but

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.710
they do, so when you want to fix it you
have to deal with this complexity with

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.909
such a scan tool, now many times when I
use a scan tool, I find out that it's

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.659
going to cost eleven twelve hundred dollars
to fix the customer's car the way it was

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.680
designed, now if you find you have to
take the whole dash apart and replace very

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.540
expensive parts in order to make the a/c
work again, there are options, you can go

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.500
to youtube and watch my old video repair
your own cars air conditioner cheaply, it has

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.129
over four hundred and twenty six
thousand people have so far, because when

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.189
the computers break down, there are a
certain amount of things you can

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:17.349
actually bypass using wires and simple
toggle switches, because where there's a

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.510
will, there's often a way, so now you know
your air conditioning system is a lot

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.080
more complicated than just a simple
button you turn on and off to make it

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.430
work, it can
often require a very complicated

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.170
computer like this, just to fix, and remember if you've
got any car questions, just visit the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.830
Scotty Kilmer channel and I'll answer
them as soon as I'm done fixing this

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.360
horseless carriage!
