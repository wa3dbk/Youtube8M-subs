00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In my work as a sound designer for theatre, video and film productions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I frequently find that the ambient sound of the place

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where I am recording cannot be used because it is owned

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by someone, and that someone is almost always

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a large corporation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Think about it.  If the sound in your environment

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
comes from a radio, television, jukebox, iPod, iTunes, Muzak,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or any of a dozen other sources that deliver

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
copyrighted sounds into your space,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
then that environment is owned by someone else.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It doesn't matter if you are the one playing the sounds, or your neighbor,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or the business that is trying to keep you in the mood to spend -

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
it doesn't matter if you enjoy the sounds,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or if they're driving you nuts - the intellectual property rights

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
have been reserved.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Okay, this makes sense when we're talking about big-budget movies.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It makes sense that Hollywood cannot just use

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a great song in a scene just because it happened to be playing

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in a real place when the sound crew happened by.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Most big-budget productions, after all, are carefully contrived

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to deliver maximum emotional impact,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and sound, especially music, and above all pop music

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
is the signifier, container, vessel, and cue

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of complex - yet conventional - emotions. And of course

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a big-budget production rarely uses

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the actual sounds that actually happen to be playing

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
in a specific place. The sound is broken apart into layers:

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the dialog, the sound effects, the carefully distorted

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
music that is supposed to be coming from within the scene

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and the swelling symphonic music

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that comes from outside the scene, like an authorial voice,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
telling us what to feel.  So it makes sense for the builders

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
of such complex, mass-market, emotion-delivery systems

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
to respect the rights of each other's creative work.  Or, to be exact,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
it makes sense for the corporations that have bought out

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the copyright as part of their distribution and marketing deals

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to respect each other's property, and to force

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
their creative people, often very highly paid creative people,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to incorporate such respect into a professional ethic.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But what about those of us who live

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
in a world saturated by the intellectual property

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
of others? What rights do we have to the environments

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in which we live? Do I, for example, have the right

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to record the sound in my own living room?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Do I have the right to take my own living room as a specimen

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
of all the living rooms in America?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In other words, do I have the right

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to portray, in an audio composition, my living room as a place

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
where the television is playing? Where a hundred channels

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
vie for my attention?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Do I have the right to mix and loop those sounds

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
into an original composition? Is such a thing original at all?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Do I have the right to treat

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
fragments of broadcast audio

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
as irreducible elements of a compositional practice?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
As notes to be composed?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Does it matter if this is art? What if it's bad art?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Or play? Or politics? Does that affect my rights?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
What if I figure out a way to "monetize this content"?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
What about ordinary people

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
channel-surfing at home? What if they record themselves

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
watching TV?
