00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.087
Andreas Baksa, Opus 53 - Excerpts presented by Radmila Besic

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.924
Bassoon and Guitar

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:39.034
This is my new project - a piece of music 
 composed for guitar and bassoon by Andreas Baksa.

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:44.195
The name of the piece contains my name - it has five movements

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:48.833
I'll be happy to listen to it with you now.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.785
The first movement is named "Playful Promenade"

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:56.354
...I am especially happy that I was given the chance to name these movements...

00:00:56.583 --> 00:01:07.082
I named the first movement this way because to me it 
 sounded like flirting, teasing, joking while having a walk.

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:11.759
Let's just listen to a little bit more of it...

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.523
The second movement I named "Mellow Mood"

00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:45.190
It's an Adagio and I would translate it to "sanfte Stimmung" [mellow mood]

00:03:07.463 --> 00:03:16.590
Third movement is called "Cheerful Voices". It is a walz and you 
 can actually hear two cheerful voices - like I named it.

00:04:03.992 --> 00:04:13.315
The fourth movement sounded to me like dreaming. It's an "Andante" movement.

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:15.750
"Blissful Dreams" - the fourth movement...

00:05:08.388 --> 00:05:14.940
And the last, the fifth movement - also my favorite one  
 - not just because of its measure 7/8 ...

00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:27.390
I named it "Bouncy Dance" - because, when I played it for the first time, I 
 wanted to dance right away... I would translate it as "lebhafter Tanz" [bouncy dance]

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.140
The recording session of these excerpts in my music room. The result 
 is good, but for the complete piece of 20 minutes

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.560
it would be an impossible recording situation.
It is not enough 
 to just hope that there will be no noises.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.820
(even with such great neighbours - thanks)

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:20.580
