TODAY FAST FORWARD IS 
AT COGDELL BERRY FARM 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A FAMILY FARMING 
OPERATION THAT GROWS 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
YOU GUESSED IT 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
BERRIES! 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
BLUEBERRIES THAT IS! 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
BUT BEFORE WE GET STARTED LETS 
GET TO THE IMPORTANT STUFF. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY 
TO EAT BLUEBERRIES? 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Russ: WE'VE GOT 
FRESH BLUEBERRIES. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
WE GOT BLUEBERRY 
SMOOTHIES, BLUEBERRY PIE. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Joy: BLUEBERRY CRUNCH CAKE. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
WE MAKE BLUEBERRY COBBLER. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Johnny: BLUEBERRIES 
ARE GOOD IN PANCAKES. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Russ: BLUEBERRY SYRUP. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Johnny: THEY'RE 
GOOD IN MUFFINS. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Russ: BLUEBERRY JELLY. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
WE'VE GOT BLUEBERRY CIDER. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
AND THE BEST WAY? 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Allena: I LIKE TO FREEZE THEM 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
AND THEN EAT THEM 
IN THE WINTER TIME 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A 
BLUEBERRY POPSICLE 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
BUT IT'S LIKE A FOR REAL 
BLUEBERRY POPSICLE. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
SO WHEN IT COMES 
TO EATING BLUEBERRIES, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
THERE ARE A LOT 
OF...BERRIATIONS? 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
SPEAKING OF WHICH, 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY OF 
THAT PIE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Allena: WELL 
I'M NOT A COOK, 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
BUT I MIGHT CAN FIND 
SOMEONE TO MAKE YOU ONE. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
NOW THIS IS 
MY KIND OF JOB! 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
SO LET'S FIND OUT A LITTLE 
MORE ABOUT THIS PLACE. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Johnny: OUR FARM HAS BEEN 
IN EXISTENCE FROM 1913. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
WE STARTED 
PLANTING BERRIES IN 2000, 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
AND 	WE HAVE OVER 500 
ACRES IN PRODUCTION NOW. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Russ: BLUEBERRIES BECAME MORE 
POPULAR OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
THERE'S BEEN MORE AND MORE 
EMPHASIS PLACED ON THE 
ANTIOXIDANTS 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
AND THE HEALTH BENEFITS 
OF BLUEBERRIES. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
AND THOSE 
ANTIOXIDANTSYOU MENTIONED, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
THINGS LIKE BETA-CAROTENE 
AND ASCORBIC ACID, 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
REMOVE CHEMICALS THAT 
ARE HARMFUL TO A CELL, 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
SLOWING DOWN CELL DAMAGE, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
AGING, 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
AND EVEN HELPING PREVENT 
SOME FORMS OF CANCER. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
BUT BEFORE CUSTOMERS GET TO 
ENJOY ALL THOSE HEALTHY 
BENEFITS, 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
THE BLUEBERRIES HAVE TO 
GO THROUGH A FEW STEPS, 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
LIKE MAKING IT TO THE 
STORES FOR EXAMPLE. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
SO EXACTLY HOW DO ALL 
OF THOSE BLUEBERRIES 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
GET FROM THE PLOT TO 
THE PRODUCE ISLE? 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Russ: THE BLUEBERRY IS 
PICKED OFF THE VINE. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
IT'S PLACED INTO A 
ONE-GALLON BUCKET. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
IT'S CARRIED TO A 
REFRIGERATED TRUCK 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
WHERE IT'S STACKED ONTO LUGS. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
AND THEN WE CARRY IT 
TO THE PACKING SHED 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
AND IT'S GONE ACROSS THE PACKING 
LINE WHERE IT'S GRADED, 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
AND IT'S PACKED 
INTO A CLAMSHELL, 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
STACKED ON A PALLET AND SHIPPED 
TO A DISTRIBUTION CENTER 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
AND ON IT'S WAY OT YOUR 
LOCAL GROCERY STORE. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
AND WHOSE JOB IS IT TO COUNT 
ALL THOSE BLUEBERRIES? 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Joy: THAT WOULD BE 
THE COMPUTER'S JOB. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I LOSE TRACK. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
COMPUTERS ON A FARM? 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'M LISTENING! 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Johnny: THEY GO DOWN 
THROUGH A COLOR SORTER, 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
WHICH HAS A LASER THAT 
DETECTS ANY SOFT FRUIT 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
THAT'S THERE AND 
IT KICKS IT OUT. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
WAIT! DID YOU SAY IT SORTS 
BLUEBERRIES WITH A LASER? 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Allena: YES WITH A LASER. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
SOUNDS LIKE A 
TEACHABLE MOMENT TO ME! 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
LASER LIGHT IS DIFFERENT FROM 
OTHER LIGHT BEAMS BECAUSE 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
A LASER IS MADE UP 
OF JUST ONE COLOR, 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
OR WAVE LENGTH OF LIGHT, 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
AND ALL THOSE LIGHT 
WAVES ARE LINED UP 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
ALSO CALLED COHERENT. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
SO WHEN IT REFLECTS 
OFF OF A SURFACE, 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
YOU LEARN ABOUT THE 
PROPERTIES OF THAT SURFACE 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
BY SEEING HOW THEY ALTER THE 
LASER'S COLOR AND COHERENCE. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
COGDELL BERRY FARM'S SOFT 
SORTER USES THIS TECHNOLOGY 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
TO SEPARATE THE RIPE BLUEBERRIES 
FROM THE OVERRIPE ONES. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
IT SHINES A LASER BEAM ONTO A 
CONVEYER BELT FULL OF FRUIT. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
WHEN THE BEAM 
REFLECTS OFF THE BERRIES, 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
DATA ON THAT REFLECTION IS 
COLLECTED BY THE MACHINE'S 
SENSORS. 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
BECAUSE HEALTHY BERRIES 
AND OVERLY SOFT BERRIES 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
REFLECT THE 
LASER DIFFERENTLY, 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
THE MACHINE DETERMINES 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
WHICH ONES AREN'T UP TO 
COGDELL'S HIGH STANDARDS . 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
THAT WAY 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
ONLY THE MOST 
DELICIOUS BLUEBERRIES 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
MAKE IT OFF THE CONVEYER BELT 
AND INTO YOUR SHOPPING CART. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
BUT DON'T WORRY. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
MACHINES AREN'T 
RUNNING THE JOINT. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOBS FOR 
PEOPLE AROUND COGDELL AS WELL. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
FOR INSTANCE... 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Russ: FULL TIME EMPLOYEES, 
DURING PEAK SEASON, 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
WE'LL HAVE 200 OR SO. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
AND THAT'S INVOLVING EVERYBODY 
FROM TRACTOR OPERATORS, 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
TO MECHANICS TO 
BLUEBERRY PICKERS, 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
FOLKS THAT WORK ON 
THE PACKING LINE. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT ALL 
THE SECONDARY JOBS 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
THAT ARE CREATED 
BECAUSE OF AGRICULTURE. 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
WE'VE GOT THE 
TRACTOR DEALERSHIPS. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
WE'VE GOT THE FOLKS 
THAT COME HERE 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
AND ARE THE TECHNICIANS FOR 
THE PACKING LINE EQUIPMENT. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
THAT'S A LOT OF 
BLUEBERRY JOBS! 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
AND WITH THE US PRODUCING 
MORE THAN HALF A BILLION 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
POUNDS OF BLUEBERRIES 
LAST YEAR ALONE, 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
EVEN MORE JOBS ARE SURE TO... 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
CROP UP! 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
UH, LOOK OVER THERE! 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
DID YOU KNOW THAT 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
BEFORE A BLUEBERRY BECOMES 
A FULL FLEDGED FRUIT 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
EACH AND EVERY ONE HAS 
TO BE FERTILIZED? 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
AND THAT FERTILIZATION 
HAPPENS 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
WHEN POLLEN IS TAKEN 
FROM ONE PLANT 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
AND DELIVERED TO ANOTHER 
RESULTING IN REPRODUCTION. 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
THE JOB GETS DONE BY 
HONEYBEES LIKE THESE! 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
EXCUSE US! 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
WE'LL UH...LEAVE 
YOU FOLKS ALONE. 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
ANYHOW 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
THIS PROCESS IS REPEATED 
HUNDREDS OF TIMES , 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
AND THE RESULT IS A FIELD 
FULL OF BLUEBERRIES, 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
LIKE THIS ONE. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
AND WHEN YOU PLANT DIFFERENT 
VARIETIES OF BLUEBERRIES CLOSE 
TOGETHER, 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
LIKE THEY DO HERE, 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
THIS REPRODUCTIVE PROCESS IS 
CALLED CROSSPOLLINATION. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
THAT CAUSES MORE 
VARIATION IN THE BERRIES 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
AND INCREASES THE SURVIVAL 
RATE OF NEW BLUEBERRY PLANTS. 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
AND THAT MEANS BETTER 
BLUEBERRIES FOR YOU! 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
WE NOW RETURN YOU TO YOUR 
REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAM. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
OKAY, NOW 
WHERE WERE WE? 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
OH, RIGHT! BLUEBERRIES! 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
AND I WANT TO GET IN 
THE BLUEBERRY GAME 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
WHAT SHOULD I DO? 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Allena: I WISH THAT 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I HAD BEEN MORE INTERESTED IN 
AGRICULTURE IN HIGH SCHOOL 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
AND THAT I HAD TAKEN THE 
CLASSES THAT WERE OFFERED. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I WISH I HAD BEEN 
INVOLVED WITH FFA. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
FF WHAT? 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Russ: FUTURE 
FARMERS OF AMERICA. 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
IT'S BEEN AROUND 
FOR A LONG TIME. 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
IT'S IN MOST 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
IT'S A WAY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
A BENT TOWARDS AGRICULTURE 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
AS YOUTH IN THE SCHOOLS TO 
GET INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FARMING 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
AND THE 
FARMING PROFESSION. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
SO THE FFA TEACHES GROWING 
GROWERS HOW TO GROW? 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Allena: THAT'S JUST A 
TONGUE TWISTER TO SAY. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
AND I'M SURE THERE'S A BUMPER 
STICKER IN THERE SOMEWHERE. 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
ANY LAST THOUGHT'S 
BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN? 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Russ: GEORGIA IS THE SECOND 
LARGEST PRODUCER OF BLUEBERRIES 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
IN THE COUNTRY 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
BUT BY THE TIME THIS VIDEO 
MAKES IT TO YOUR CLASSROOM 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT 
WE COULD BE THE NUMBER 1 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
PRODUCER IN THE 
COUNTRY OF BLUEBERRIES. 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
GEORGIA'S GROWING SEASON 
IS LONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
TWO CROPS OF DIFFERENT 
BLUEBERRY VARIETIES 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
WHEREAS NORTHERN CLIMATES 
MIGHT BE LIMITED TO JUST ONE. 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
OF COURSE THERE IS 
ANOTHER REASON 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
GEORGIA'S SO GREAT 
FOR BLUEBERRIES. 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
ALLENA? 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Allena: BECAUSE IT'S GEORGIA 
AND GEORGIA IS AWESOME. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
AND THAT MEANS MORE DELICIOUS 
JOBS FOR GEORGIANS. 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
WHICH REMINDS ME, 
WHERE IS THAT PIE? 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I'LL FOLLOW MY NOSE, 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
AND HOPEFULLY SEE YOU NEXT 
TIME ON FAST FORWARD.
