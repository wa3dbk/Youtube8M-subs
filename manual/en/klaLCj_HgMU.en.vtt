00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.860
So we're about 10 minutes before
showtime. Here's where the butterflies

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.900
start. There's a guy in an all black
bodysuit out there, I love it!

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.040
I think I'm ready.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.040
You know this was the tallest building in
the world at one point? It's pretty cool.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.100
My wife will make fun of me being Mr.
Milwaukee fact, but I love it.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.220
I'm a huge Walt Disney fan, mortgaged his
entire studio and his home to open those

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.840
theme parks. We're at C-K, the ad agency I
work at. They allow me to print stuff out

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.930
and they made me some banners this year
which are really cool. You know of all

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.840
these people working to cure disease or
fix the economy, this guy was just doing stuff for fun.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.980
Some people carry a
bag full of notes, I carry a bag full of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.890
extra luchador masks.
That's the goat: El Chivas Blanca. I think

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.340
it was Andy's birthday we went for an
independent wrestling show and it was

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.140
god-awful and it was in a bowling alley.
We just kind of went, we're like, "Oh we could do something like this."

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.440
"It's...Mondo Lucha!"

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.440
Mondo Lucha ends up becoming like, retro TV and crazy old variety shows, Memphis-style wrestling...

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.260
"Milwaukee Day? Give me a break!"

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.600
I mean just me, visually, it's
like the full sort of Bobby Heenan array.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.600
It's the process that takes not just a
week or two weeks, it takes months.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.660
"Whew, I think we're doing good."

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.420
You never know
when someone's gonna all of a sudden

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.540
no-show or cancel at the last minute.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.840
"Shock Waves checked in at the hotel he's probably about 50 minutes away..."

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.460
It keeps growing, which
is great.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.720
"We're about five minutes away. A couple minutes behind than I'd like to be but..."

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.640
There's an independent spirit here at
Milwaukee that feels very DIY.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.480
"Just another layer of like, Liberace show business..."

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.080
It's not just Jay I, it's 30 different points of
people that help make this happen.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.320
"This is happening."

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.580
So you guys come out, "We're with Milwaukee Day..."

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.540
There's no absolute formal dress rehearsalâ€”It's a really fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants type thing.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.780
"So, we're like 30 minutes away from showtime. We gotta get everybody through. Like, hustle, now. Go, go, go."

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.000
"I wanna say thanks to everybody for coming out to Mondo Lucha!"

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.720
"We need to find Zach's prosthetic..."

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.500
"What did I say about Walt Disney?"

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.700
"A standing ovation!"

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.320
"Holy shit!"
