Hey guys,
So today we're gonna show you how to make

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.689
Ahloo Tikki which is a snack food that street
vendors sell in India.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.620
So for this recipe you'll need the following:
Green chutney and dates chutney, both of which

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.320
you can find simple and easy Indian recipes
to in the description down below.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.610
You'll need some red chilli, about a half
a bunch of cilantro, half of a sliced onion,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.170
some chaat masala and some salt.
You'll also need plain yogurt about 16 oz,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.460
a can of garbazo beans, and 3 slices of bread
soaked in water.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.550
And of course, you'll need about 8-9 potatoes.
So we'll start off making slices in the potatoes

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.499
so that they heat up better. Then, we'll go
ahead stick them in the microwave until they're

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:43.210
done. You can use the potato feature on your
microwave, and you'll probably have to flip

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.139
them over at least once.
You'll know when they're done because they'll

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:49.539
mushy and soft. Then once they're done in
the microwave, you go ahead and peel them

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.010
and mash them with a fork. And you'll end
up with this.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.569
Then we'll take our soaked bread slices. And
really just immerse them again in water. Then

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:13.799
we'll crumple the bread up and add it to the
potatoes in bits and pieces

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.450
We'll mix everything really well.
Add about Â½ a teaspoon of salt to the potato

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.260
bread mix and mix it again.
Now we're going to actually start our tikkis.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.520
Take some of the potatoes in your hand and
your going to roll them into this kind of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.619
fat circle. You can see here we're using dabbling
in a little bit of water just so that the

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:38.090
potatoes stick together better.
Then you're going keep repeating that step

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.530
until your potatoes are all done.
Add your corn oil to a pan. We used about

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:54.950
a tablespoon of corn oil here.
Then, add the ahloo tikki to the pan.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.490
You're gonna cook them for about 5-7 minutes
or until they turn brown like this. Then flip

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.990
it over, and cook the other side.
They'll look like this once they're done.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.360
Okay, then we're going to work on the toppings.
So add your garbanzo beans to the pan and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.690
just heat them up for 2-4 minutes until they're
warm. Add some red chilli powder to the top.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.670
Here we used about 1 teaspoon but you can
add more or less depending on what you like.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.721
Mix it and add it to your tikkis.
The next step is to prepare your yogurt. Just

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:43.100
add some yogurt to a bowl. We added about
16 oz of yogurt. Here then add some water

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.160
depending on how thick you want the yogurt
to be. Here used about 4-5 oz of water but

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:57.740
the exact amount really just depends on what
you like.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.980
So now, we're gonna finish it off.
Add the yogurt on top.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.950
Add the dates and green chutneys, which you
can find the really simple and easy recipes

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.730
for in description down below.
Add some red chilli powder to your taste.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.700
Same with the chat masala. Sprinkle some sliced
up onions and cilantro on top.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.340
