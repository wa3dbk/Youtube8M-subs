00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.690
Hi. My name is Tom Antos
and today we’re going to talk about

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.280
some basics when it comes to 
camera angles and framing.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.430
The Full Shot or Full Body Shot includes the
feet in the frame.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.430
For this kind of a shot, remember to 
never cut off just the feet.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.390
In fact, it’s a bad practice to cut off
your subject at the knees and below.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.339
It may look like you did it unintentionally
or by a mistake...

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.400
like you can see here.
It also looks awkward when a person’s legs

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.420
are cut off below the knees.
This, in fact, is not a rule by any means.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.280
In fact, I don’t think there are 
any rules in film.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.219
But it is just a bad practice.
If you’re going to frame your subject like this,

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.770
then you’d better have a good reason for it.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.129
Otherwise, it will just confuse your audience 
and

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.719
it will look like you simply don’t know
what you’re doing.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.789
So, for a full body shot, you should 
stick to something like this.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.530
Next shot is a Medium Full Shot.
That’s when you go a bit closer and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.230
it's usually also when you cut off your subject 
somewhere between the knees and the waist.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.620
Once you frame above the waist area, 
that’s called a Medium Shot.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.050
After that, we move in for a Close Shot.
That frames from around the breast area and up.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.940
And then this here is a Close-Up,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.130
which mainly frames just the subject’s head.
Once you move in even closer,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.400
where you start to cut off 
the forehead or the chin,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.700
that’s usually referred to 
as an Extreme Close-Up.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.450
Even if you move in to frame just the eyes,
for example.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.700
Now, what you have to remember is that
there is no standard by which to go when naming

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700
these shots.
These are simple the name that I use.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.920
There are others out there 
that use different names.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.900
What’s important is that you know what type
of shots you want to get.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.770
So, when you’re planning your shots or 
doing your storyboards,

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.510
you always use the same names 
for the shot types,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.560
so you don’t end up confusing yourself 
later on down the road

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.630
when you go back to look at your notes or
storyboards.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.120
Next, we’re going to talk about the types
of shots or angles,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.170
like Over-the-Shoulder or a Two-Shot.
These are most commonly used in a scene when

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.489
two characters are talking to each other.
These shots refer more to the angle than

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.609
what the exact framing is.
For example, you can have a close-up over-the-shoulder...

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.409
or a medium over-the-shoulder 
like you see here...

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.209
and you can even go to a 
full body over-the-shoulder.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.379
Same goes for the two-shot.
Here we have a full body two-shot.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.579
And then a medium two-shot.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.849
And then a close-up two-shot.

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.810
Or you can also have, you know, 
a three, four shot, depending how many characters 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.599
you have in your shot.
Other shot types you might hear about are

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.499
an Insert or Cut-Away,
which is, basically, a close-up 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:52.409
on a part of a scene or
it could be a POV of one of the characters

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.569
seeing a certain detail in that scene,
like we see here

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.739
where one of the characters passes 
the car keys to the other.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.719
Many times people ask me what size lenses
should they use

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:08.980
to get, for example, a good medium shot.
And really, there is not one correct answer.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.069
The types of shots or the framing really have
nothing to do with the lens.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.019
For example, you can have a medium shot
that’s shot using a wide angle lens 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.280
such as this 16mm Canon lens 
that I’m using here.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.420
Or you can have a medium shot
that’s shot using a 50mm lens.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.039
Same if you use a 100mm...

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.139
or even a 300mm telephoto lens.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.249
They all produce medium shots.
But of course, each of those lenses gives

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:42.159
that shot a different look and effect.
The framing doesn’t change. 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.579
It’s just the perspective.
So, remember that shot framing has nothing

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.430
to do with the lens size.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.019
And the only way you’ll really know what
type of lens to use

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.639
in your scenario is
once you’ve got a lot of experience 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.319
going out there and filming.
You know, just trying out different types

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.799
of lenses and experimenting.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.310
Then, afterwards, you should come home 
and compare

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.859
what kind of effects you got using various lenses

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.090
on different types of shots.
Because there’s virtually an infinite amount

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.879
of effects you can get
when you’re mixing up different types of

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.579
framing, shot types, angles and lenses.

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.669
For example, let’s take a close-up and 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.730
do a few versions of it
and see what kind of effects we can get.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.000
If we were to use a mid-sized lens 
such as this 50mm,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.490
then you would get something like this.
You know, an average looking shot.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.290
But, for example, if you were filming a comedy
and you wanted to show a person in a funny way,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.490
then it might be better to go in really close

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.320
and use a wide-angle such as this 16mm lens,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.110
which will make your subject’s features
look a bit distorted or exaggerated.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.570
It’s not actually the lens that makes 
your subject look that way

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.310
but your relative position to the subject.
Basically, the closer you move to your subject,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.240
the more dramatic the perspective will be.
But obviously you have to use a wide-angle lens

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.540
when shooting this close.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.070
Right now we’re about 
two feet away from the subject.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.250
Now, if we were to use a 50mm lens 
at that same distance,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.800
then the perspective doesn’t change,
but the framing obviously will,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.690
because we’re basically zooming in.
So, all you end up seeing is this.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.650
It would be the same if you look at this shot
that we got using the 16mm lens and then 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.660
digitally zoomed in.
The only difference being that the depth of field

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.190
would be the same as the 16mm lens.
And of course we end up loosing 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.260
a lot of the resolution,
which is why we use different lenses.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.180
Or if you’re using a camera that doesn’t
have interchangeable lenses,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.850
then you would simply zoom in or zoom out.
Now, let’s take a look at a full body shot.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.920
To get it with a 16mm lens,
we have to move away from the subject 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.980
a few feet.
If you were to move away from your subject

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.610
to about two hundred fifty feet,
then this wide-angle might be good 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.460
if you’re trying to get, let’s say, 
a wide-shot of the location.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.800
Because your subject is so small that 
it’s really hard even to see him.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.870
So, that’s when you want to use a long lens,
such as this 300mm, to basically zoom in.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.270
Now, when you’re this far away,
that’s when the subject will look more flat

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.440
and less exaggerated,
since you’re seeing all the features from,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.750
pretty much, the same perspective.
It will also bring other surrounding objects,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.400
such as this mailbox 
that we have there in the background,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.810
closer to our main subject.
Whereas, if we were closer and using, 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.150
let’s say, a 50mm lens,
it looks like that mailbox is a lot farther away.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.110
They’re both the same types of shots 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.230
- a full body shot,
but what changes now is our relative position

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.420
to the subject.
And since with the 300mm lens we have to move away

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.420
so much farther
and then zoom in optically,

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.790
we end up also zooming in on the mailbox,
which is why it makes it look like it’s

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.830
a lot closer to our subject than...
than, for example, you can see in this 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:54.210
full body shot we got using a 50mm lens.
So, next time you’re wondering what lens

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.590
you should use in your setting,
just simply go out there with your camera, 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.630
test out different lenses, experiment
and above all, have fun.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.450
Because that’s really the best way to learn.
I hope this video helped to answer 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.880
some of your questions and 
I’ll see you guys later.
