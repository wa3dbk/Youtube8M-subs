Meet Phil Harris, Black Cod Fisherman

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.400
Leaving San Diego Harbor

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.413
[ music ]

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.460
There's an old joke amongst fishermen. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.990
Like, what would you do if you had a million dollars?

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.150
Well, the joke is, well, I'd just keep fishing.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.860
The Southern California Bight

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.730
My name is Phil Harris. 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.640
I'm a commercial black cod fisherman,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.240
otherwise known as sablefish.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.010
Okay, we're using traps.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.500
I've got 12 traps on two strings. 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.450
We're fishing about a half a mile deep,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.520
and our gear is about a mile long.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.770
Has to be a little bit longer than

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.000
the depth of the water. 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.370
Basically, we run out and find the spot

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.170
drop our gear on the spot,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.680
and let it soak for three to four days.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.840
Then come back out to the same spot.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.500
Hopefully you can find the gear and then pull it.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.890
[ Shawn Collins: Out of the frying pan and into the fire. ]

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.660
In our industry, there is very little bycatch.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.860
We catch a few red bottom fish called thorny heads

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.810
And that is about the only real fish bycatch there is.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.120
We do catch a lot of California spiny king crab,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.620
but weâ€™re not allowed to keep them.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.617
[ Shawn Collins: Ohhh, look at that, codzilla! ]

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.460
[ Shawn Collins: Whoa! ]

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.466
[ music ]

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.009
Our goal is to get fresh fish straight to the consumer. 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.674
[ Phil Harris: 57, 58 ]

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.540
[ Phil Harris: What does it read there, Nick? ]

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.430
This is the life that I think I want to live.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.370
That's all.  

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.560
I love it out here. 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.560
If I couldn't come out on the ocean,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.550
 I'd be less of a person.
