00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.340
And then Vegeta and Goku said, 'Princess Darlene

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.740

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.510
And Vegeta said, "Oh no!

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.730

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.910

The most strong planet known to Saiyans, Planet
Darlene!

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.280
And Goku said "Why are you not married to
the Princess Darlene who is the most beautiful

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
in the world.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.880
I would marry her if I was you!'

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.790
And Vegeta said, "Because I thought she was
dead and not alive!'

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.439
Then Vegeta looked at Darlene sexily, "But
she is the one I love the most more than anyone

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.539
else especially Bulma who is really ugly!"

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.539
And Princess Darlene run too Vegeta's arms
and says, "I has to be looking for you since

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.770

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.820
Even though I was from Darlene I was on vacation
to Vegeta when it exploded.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.490
I barely escaped with my live, but after all
these years of searching I have found you!"

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.380
And Vegeta kissed Darlene on the mouth and
Darlene kissed his lips back and they beat

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.070
up the android until the android was almost
dead but they didn't kill him all the way!

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:15.390
And the android 11 destroyed a building with
its special beam canon and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:35.110
it fell on 
Vegeta but not Darlene and Darlene lifted

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.330

And Goku tossed a sensuu bean into Vegeta's
mouth form way far away and Vegeta got better!

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.250
And Vegeta said "I love you most more than

And Bulma realized, "If we gets the dragonball
I can wish that Vegeta were in love with me

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.650
and falls in love with me."

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.100
