00:00:00.431 --> 00:00:02.680
A wood wall like this one
can really class up a joint.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.346
This one was done with reclaimed lumber.

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:07.582
By the end of this video, you'll
know how to make one just like it.

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:10.807
Hey, I'm Rob North, and I'm going to
be guiding you through this project.

00:00:10.807 --> 00:00:12.640
But if you want, you
can click on the screen

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.890
right now to download
your own project plans,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.600
so you can build your own wood wall.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.940
Ready to get some work done?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.790
Let's do it.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.470
OK.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.550
First things first.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.820
This is reclaimed lumber.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.025
As a matter of fact, it
came from an old barn.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.500
And all we're basically going
to doing is attaching this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.270
to a plywood substrate.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.160
Pretty simple?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.435
I think so.

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:33.950
Now, here's the thing with
working with reclaimed lumber.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.241
You want to make sure there's no nails,
no screws, or any other foreign objects

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.309
that can mess up your equipment or you.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.100
And there's one more
thing you need to know

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.840
when you work with reclaimed lumber.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.540
Oftentimes, there's stuff hidden
in it that you just can't see.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.770
So grab yourself a magnet
and sweep your board.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.960
Trust me; you'll thank me later.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.680
OK.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.500
Now, our first order of business
is getting our panel to height.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.340
You see, our ceiling
height is 87 inches,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.590
so that means we have to
bring our panel to 87 inches.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.512
So the trick is to use a straight edge.

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:01.220
If you're going to
run that saw, the edge

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.095
of the saw along this
straight edge, you have

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:06.500
to account for the distance from
the edge of the foot to the blade.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.880
So grab yourself a tape measure and
measure from the edge of the foot

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.250
to the inside edge of the blade.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.166
So then, just subtract
that from your overall.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.557
So if you need 87 inches,
subtract that down to 85 and 1/2.

00:01:16.557 --> 00:01:18.390
And that's where you
put your straight edge.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.223
So when you run the edge of the
foot against it, you end up with 87.

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:23.139
Capiche?

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:24.680
It's time to get your piece in place.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.138
Put a couple of clamps on each
end, and you're ready to go.

00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:35.155
All right.

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:37.090
You're going to notice a bunch
of tear out on that piece,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.840
because we were cutting
accross the grain.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.525
But it's no big deal, because
we're going to cover it all up.

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:43.960
Didn't I tell you this project was easy?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.780
OK.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.430
Now, let me explain exactly
what it is we're doing.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.770
We're basically going to
make a section of panels,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.400
because we want to cover a whole wall.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.670
And as you already know, a sheet
of plywood is four by eight, right?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.604
So we need to make a bunch of these.

00:01:57.604 --> 00:02:00.520
Now, the question is, how do we do
that, making sure they all lay out,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.186
and it doesn't look like a bunch
of different sheets of plywood?

00:02:03.186 --> 00:02:04.490
And the key is overlay.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.130
Let me show you what I mean.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.990
All we have to do is create what
we call a reveal and an overlay.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.675
Basically, a distance that's
consistent from panel to panel

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:21.765
is going to let them overlock and
join together and hide all the seams.

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:23.390
And we're going to go with four inches.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.290
So grab yourself a combination
square, set it to four inches,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.470
and then lay your piece out with
that on each end, like this.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.030
Set it in place.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.730
Make sure one end is flush, right
there, and then throw a clamp on it,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.870
so it doesn't go anywhere as
you work on the other end.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.650
Now, just grab a pencil and mark
the underside of your board.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.931
That's going to give you your length.

00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:48.430
OK.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.870
Now, we just made a reveal.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.045
And now, it's time to make an overlay.

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:56.304
And again, if one end
isn't square, like mine

00:02:56.304 --> 00:02:58.720
isn't, go and take it to your
miter saw and square it off.

00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:12.110
And this time we're
going to let it overhang

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.290
the plywood by about four inches.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.437
So flush at the bottom of one side,
get it close to where you want it,

00:03:18.437 --> 00:03:19.770
and then grab your square again.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.610
So put the body of the
square against your stock,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.276
and then slide it over until you
feel the blade hit the plywood.

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:26.854
Boom.

00:03:26.854 --> 00:03:28.770
Now, just do the same
thing on the other side.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.390
And the way we're going to
hold the pieces to the plywood

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.140
is with a little bit of construction
adhesive and some staples.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.590
Keep in mind, when this
goes, it overhangs, right?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.610
We have an overlay.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.220
So we want to make sure--
this is our overlaid area-- we

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.140
want to make sure we don't put
glue on that overlaid area.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.420
[INAUDIBLE], patter-- this
stage where you put it.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.440
Flip the back over.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.010
Try not to get the glue on your hands.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.810
And put it back in place.

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:12.705
Go on down to the other end.

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:17.440
Just make sure that whatever
your fastener length is,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.981
it does not go through the substrate.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:23.920
Repeat on the other side.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.248
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.370
OK.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.090
All we have to do is fill in the
middle, aka the field, and that's it.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.569
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.740
All right.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.000
There you have it, a nice wooden wall
that will give your room a rustic cabin

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.355
feel.

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:06.050
And all you have to do is
put it wherever you want it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.591
and install with some finish grooves.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.110
