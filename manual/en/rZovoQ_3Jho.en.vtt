Hi, how're you doing ? Justin here.
 In this little video today, we're

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:12.295
going to be checking out the names of the open strings,

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:16.666
i.e. what their note name is, for each one of these open

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.030
friends. because eventually, we need to learn what the

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.462
notes are all over the guitar and we're going to start with

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:22.900
these open strings.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.702
So first of all, we need to create a little bit of space over

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:28.504
here, for me to stick a little neck diagram up, so if I just

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:33.742
kind of lean over . Okay, about now, &lt;i&gt;ping&lt;i&gt;, up comes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:39.786
this little neck diagram and you'll see there, 
E A D G B E.

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:42.821
And these are the names of the open strings.

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:46.156
And what I've just done is name them 
from the thickest string.

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:50.074
See, if I play it at the same time now, 
we've got E

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:52.174
A

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:54.221
D

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.244
G

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:57.852
B

00:00:57.852 --> 00:01:00.367
and E again.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:04.359
Of course noticing now that the two outside 
strings are both E's

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:06.653
Which is why somethimes I call it the fat string or the

00:01:06.653 --> 00:01:10.486
thick string and the skinny string or the thin string because

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:13.222
I can't both call it the E string 'cause they're both E strings.

00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:16.015
Now, the thing that's going to really help you remember the

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:19.598
names of the open strings is to make up a funny little rhyme

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:22.026
Now, the one that I used when I was groing up, was

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:26.287
Easter Bunny Gets Drunk After Easter, which starts with the

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:32.604
thin string: Easter Bunny Gets Drunk After Easter.

00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:34.995
Now, this one for me if kind of funny, the idea of the easter

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:37.733
bunny going around, delivering eggs to all of the bad kids,

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:40.422
being a bit upset about it, going back to his little burrow and

00:01:40.422 --> 00:01:43.257
knocking off a bottle of Jack Daniels. I think it's kind of fun.

00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:45.880
So therefore, it was easier for me to remember. But you can

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.804
make up any other rhyme that you like. There's quite a few

00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:54.862
ones that I heard that I though have been quite funny.

00:01:54.862 --> 00:02:00.688
Every Boy Gets Dizzy Around Elle which is Elle Macpherson,

00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:03.751
my favourite super model. So, Every Boy Gets Dizzy Around

00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:07.005
Elle: my little tribute to the the wonderful Elle Macpherson.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:11.407
We could have also, one of my students told me one,

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:13.075
starting from the thick string:

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:19.400
Eddy Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddy. So that one is going

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.019
from the thick strings. It really doesn't matter. You can make

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.858
up your own rhyme, so long as you have a rhyme that will

00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:29.639
help you remember the open string note names. And this

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.839
is really important because very, very soon,  i.e. in the next

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.053
stage, we're going to be starting to look at all of the note

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:37.518
names and the notes in the open position. If you don't know

00:02:37.518 --> 00:02:40.959
the open strings yet, it's going to be kind of, well

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.574
next to impossible.
