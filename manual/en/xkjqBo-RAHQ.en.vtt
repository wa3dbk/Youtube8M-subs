00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.759
a hotel in Quebec is suing a hotel
patron who wrote a nasty review on

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.859
TripAdvisor

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.550
so this man %uh allegedly stayed adds a
hotel call back which is known as a very

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.639
nice hotel

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.660
and he knows that there are bedbugs on
the bed in fact he took about four the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.210
bedbugs and put them in a glass

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.449
went downstairs to concierge and showed
it to them

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.000
and said that obviously there's an issue
here well they offered him about forty

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.800
dollars and accommodations

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.279
for the evening at a different hotel
however since it was three in the

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.899
morning he made the decision to just
stay and

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.850
rough it out I guess I'm until the next
day and he moved to a different hotel

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.980
the next day he was also staying with
his son

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.040
well afterwards he wrote an ass a review
on TripAdvisor

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.510
and the hotel lost a considerable amount
of business well they're unhappy about

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.910
that so they're suing for ninety five
thousand dollars

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.199
look great way to it we at

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.399
people write reviews even if they're not
right

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.160
sad day for you that's just like now
you're soo everybody that would a bad

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.870
review

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.820
well that repaired review I think auspey
like fifteen thousand dollars now the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.240
150,000

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
a decir soon everybody that's mental and
I mean if you listen to go story

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.110
he seems to be clearly right on top yeah
I mean there were bedbugs in the only

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.189
thing that makes him a little
questionable as he made the decision to

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:18.909
stay

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.409
like I even if it was like three in the
morning I would I wouldn't care

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.380
I would get the hell outta there but he
made a decision to stay he thought was

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.720
too inconvenient to move but look there
were bed bugs there

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.430
you showed the bedbugs to the employees
at the hotel you had proof that it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.130
happened

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.560
so it's not like you're lying you know
what i mean this isn't like

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.759
you know defamation or anything like
that he took picture tube videos he

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.500
brought for bed bugs down to the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.140
clerk and they said that they couldn't
reach the hotel's manager cuz it was the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.210
weekend it was three in the morning
obviously

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.409
so I'm sure the clerk was scared to make
a decision either way

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.310
and he made the wrong decision you
should have gone out your way to make

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.829
sure that person was taken care of well
that has consequences

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.270
sad day for you you should have the
bedbugs asymmetry the guy like that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.810
so now look egos you know and he was
good but around telling

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.860
everybody in the lobby as he was leaving
the next day

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.330
they got bed bugs or stay here they go
bad boy so stay here you know who would

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.819
do that but i got really mad

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.860
me but yeah I think that he did a great
thing by telling other hotel patrons

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.349
that they had bad bites for small

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.099
but ones are very difficult to get rid
of right even if they get on your

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.910
luggage

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.250
then all the sudden you're reading bed
bugs to your own home here

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.530
really hard to get rid up and remember
we've done stories about how they're

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.390
basically like

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.050
immune to it anything that we used to
get rid of them New York has a huge

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.489
problem the bedbugs right now

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.519
and look his is review was even that bad
news is drawing attention to a real

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.050
issue that the hotel had

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.060
I wonder if you guys just a little
snippet of it it's a long review but

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.800
here's the part that I think was like

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.569
the harshest he says beware the bedbugs
if you're looking for

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.950
a scratch free nights sleep state
elsewhere you'll be doing you and your

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.700
loved ones a favor trust me

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.659
and that's why the internet is a great
tool if the hotel wins

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.120
the president sets would be unbelievable
you have to just shut down

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.360
Yelp TripAdvisor every single thing that
that

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.370
out there on the internet that reviews
things because it could

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.190
every bad review those potential
financial damage to the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.360
business I just don't see how they would
win I mean

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.550
they were obviously in the wrong they
had bedbugs it would be like us miss

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.769
reporting a story

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.920
and then someone writes a bad comment
and then other people read it decide not

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.239
to watch the show that we see that guy
for the bout comment

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.420
we miss reported the story but we do
that's just about it with

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.799
right now it's absurd guilty

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.280
sorry for the guys not guilty not guilty

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.420

bed bugs
