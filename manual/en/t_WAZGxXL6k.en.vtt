00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.060
Hey beardlovers.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.510
On tour again with Driftless Pony Club.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.200
I know I said I'd be standing up in my videos,
but I can't really stand up in the van.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.200
I did try to stand up on the roof earlier.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
It's like I'm flying!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.420
I am flying.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.420
Whoaaaaa.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.420
Yep.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.360
Then I broke in half.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.360
See?

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360
Don't worry.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.289
I'll get it fixed.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.369
It's actually kinda nice.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.750
I had a foot cramp earlier.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.589
Now I have a foot gone.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.960
Gosh, I'm so lucky to have happy-go-lucky,
exuberant, fragrant friends like you to go

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.960
on tour with.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.630
All across the country.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.350
Like the show we played in Cincinnati a few
nights ago, for example.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.610
And then in Nashville.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.570
And then in Marietta, Georgia.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.810
And I'm certainly glad I don't live in a parallel
universe where our drummer Jeff moved backwards

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.810
in time.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.810
That would be terrible.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.810
And confusing.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.810
Nope.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.350
It's good to be back in good ol' our universe.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.059
Or have never been out of our universe.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.970
- Well, I guess that clears that up.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.970
- Clears what up?

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.970
- Nothing.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.939
What are you talking about?

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.219
- What are YOU talking about?

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.219
- Runs away.

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.219
- What?

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.219
- I'm not here anymore.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.219
- Alright.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.219
We're currently headed to Playlist Live in
Orlando.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.829
And then our next show is on Tuesday in Durham,
North Carolina.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.240
And down there in the doobly-doo is the info
for all the rest of the dates on our tour.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.240
Tar.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.240
Towr.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.240
I still don't know how to say that.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.280
How do you guys say that word?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.490
- [backwards talk]
- Tour.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.560
- Tour.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.630
Tour.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.840
- What's the matter this time, Sam?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.249
- I ran into an old flame in Nashville.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.039
I know you're always crazy happy all the time.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.039
I just...

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.679
I have something serious to ask you right
now.

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:54.009
We've had some good times together, and I
was just wondering, Will you marry me?

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.329
- It said no.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.099
I hate it.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.200
- Alright.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.890
So you know that OK Go video where they're
driving the car with all the mallets and hammers

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.939
sticking out of it hitting pianos and guitars
and other instruments?

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.369
If you haven't seen it, you should.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.409
There's a link in the doobly-doo.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.780
It's seriously amazing.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.279
- More amazing than me?

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.279
- Yes.

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.279
- That's unpossible.

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.750
But then I got thinky and I thought, We could
do that.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.750
They're a band.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.750
We're a band.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.750
They're from Chicago.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.750
We're from Chicago.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.010
They make astounding viral videos that launched
them to incredible wealth and fame.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.060
And we make videos.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.890
Theirs took, like, four months to plan.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.390
I bet we could do it in ten minutes.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.390
That's more efficient.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.260
And efficiency leads to getting stuff done
sooner so you don't have to do anything anymore.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.260
And who wants to do stuff?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.260
- I did stuff once.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.060
In college.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.890
Technical college.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.819
So the following is us playing our song He
Plans Houses Like Trees with the van.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.930
No trick editing here.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.700
What you hear is the actual sounds we made
while shooting.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.020
Enjoy.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.620
He plans houses like trees.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.220
He plans houses like trees.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.130
They don't make 'em like him.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:19.050
They don't make 'em like him.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.370
So beardlovers, we got a fundraiser going
on for water.org.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.190
Follow the link in the doobly-doo to donate.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.150
And come to one of our shows on this tour
if we're coming to a city near you.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.150
What cities are we going to, Matt?

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.799
Hahaha!

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.799
Rawk sawk!

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.799
- Not good.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.349
Not good at all.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.639
- Oh, go on.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.650
- Well, we're going to Durham, North Carolina.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.650
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.650
Hamden, Connecticut.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.650
Boston, Massachusetts.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.890
New York, New York.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.550
And then Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.670
- And then we're going home?

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.110
Hahaha!

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.430
Rawk second sawk!

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.719
- Not good again.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.439
Not good at all.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.299
Ever again.
