00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.380
Hi my name is Dave Andrews today I'm going
to show you how to reset the computer clock

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:15.369
using Microsoft Windows. Let's go to our computer
and as you can see down here at the very bottom

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.699
of right hand side of the computer screen
we have a clock. Now I'm going to show you

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.640
how to set the time on this clock and by doing
so you can also set the date on the computer.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.820
Now basically all you got to do is right click
somewhere on that clock and then let's just

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.570
click on adjust date and time. This pulls
up a little more information about the current

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.260
date and time on your computer including your
time zone. It gives you a read out on the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.980
time and the date and shows you a little image
of a clock here. To change the time just click

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.030
on change date and time. Now you have to be
an administrator to do this so it's going

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.410
to pop up saying you need permission, just
click on that to continue. So here we accessed

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.500
the date and time setting screen. To change
the date on the clock we basically just click

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.180
on a different date and we can scroll it over,
and change the date whatever we like. To change

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.760
the time, just click inside the time and you
can either type the time that you would like

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.080
it to show or you can click inside of the
say the minutes field here and just use these

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.300
little arrow buttons here to change the minutes.
Now once you've set it to what you would like

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.050
it to be all you have to do is click on the
ok button. Now I've set it to four fifty seven

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:50.670
on September the tenth. As you can see our
changes that we have taken have changed the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.030
time to say four fifty seven on September
the tenth. My name is Dave Andrews and I've

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.750
just shown you how to change the time on the
Windows Microsoft clock.
