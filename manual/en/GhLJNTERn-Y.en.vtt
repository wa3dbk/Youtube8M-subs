Hey guys, Chef Mark here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.337
Today I'm gonna make for you
a crab and avocado berry salad.

00:00:07.337 --> 00:00:09.473
Beautiful berries,
gorgeous in season right now,

00:00:09.473 --> 00:00:11.374
so let's take advantage
of those.

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:13.877
Well, let's use our
Jumbo Lump crab meat.

00:00:13.877 --> 00:00:15.178
It's the biggest,
most meaty

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:17.380
luscious pieces of
the crab you can get.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.249
Our guests are really
gonna appreciate that.

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.018
I need two of these,
so just grab another one

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:23.253
and we'll be on our way.

00:00:23.253 --> 00:00:25.021
I got the base
for my salad here.

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.491
This is gonna be organic
family pack greens.

00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:28.892
It's the right size.

00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:31.795
It's got a lot of variety
of flavors and textures

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.263
for the base of the salad.

00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:35.332
Now for the berry portion
of the salad.

00:00:35.332 --> 00:00:37.267
Got gorgeous berries here.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:38.768
I'm gonna start out
with these here,

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:40.036
the raspberries.

00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:41.805
I'm gonna actually use
these for the vinaigrette.

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:43.273
Cut some in half so
they soften a little bit,

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:44.841
and then we'll garnish
with some others.

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.110
So let's grab some
blueberries,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.246
and these gorgeous big
blackberries.

00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:52.015
Some of these may not even make it
to the salad before I go there.

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:54.150
Let's put it together.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.119
Okay, so our crab
and avocado salad

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.787
with some gorgeous
berries here.

00:00:57.787 --> 00:00:59.122
Everything's ready
in front of us.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:00.423
There's not much
to put this together,

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:03.126
but first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna have

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:05.395
a container of cider vinegar here
which I've cooked

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.998
with a little bit of sugar
just to dissolve it a little bit,

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:09.199
and I've stored that
in the fridgerator

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:10.300
just to cool it down.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.469
So that's already
done here.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:13.970
So let's put the rest
of it together.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.207
So I have some raspberries,
halved raspberries.

00:01:17.207 --> 00:01:18.775
This is our vinaigrette
we're making.

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:21.077
So we've got our
olive oil.

00:01:21.077 --> 00:01:23.313
Just do our tarragon here.

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:25.949
And our shallots.

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:29.452
So let's do some black pepper,
make a nice vinaigrette here.

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:31.221
Just toss it together,
doesn't have to be

00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:33.990
emulsified or anything.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.393
And a little bit
of a salt, good.

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:40.230
Let's do our vinegar mixture.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.199
So all this is is just
tossing this up.

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:44.968
It's a broken vinaigrette.

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:48.171
Like I said, as this sits,
those raspberries will soften,

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.440
actually create a little
bit even color to the vinaigrette,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.209
which makes a nice
addition, so...

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.945
The next thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:57.247
put together our crab mixture, so...

00:01:57.247 --> 00:01:59.316
We'll take our lump
crab here,

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:00.350
be gentle with this stuff.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.185
They picked it,
were very particular

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:03.219
about how they picked it.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.288
Keeps up
nice, big pieces.

00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:08.224
Let's do some lemon zest.

00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:12.462
Our chives chopped up,
and our mayonnaise.

00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:14.998
Like I said, be gentle with it.

00:02:14.998 --> 00:02:16.333
We're gonna toss this
all together

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.501
with some salt and pepper.

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.203
Try not to break those
things up,

00:02:20.203 --> 00:02:22.138
'cause when your
guests get this

00:02:22.138 --> 00:02:25.375
they wanna see those nice,
big pieces of Jumbo Lump crab.

00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:28.011
The choice pieces.

00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:29.479
So a little bit of black pepper.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.214
And toss this together.

00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:34.484
Again, just to barely
fold this through.

00:02:34.484 --> 00:02:36.252
That mixture's done.

00:02:36.252 --> 00:02:38.121
And all we gotta do is put
our salad together.

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:40.957
So, let's do an avocado here.

00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:42.826
So, when you grab an avocado,
you wanna make sure

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:45.028
that it gives a little bit,
a little bit soft,

00:02:45.028 --> 00:02:46.329
not too soft though.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.864
There's a little piece
of the stem in there,

00:02:47.864 --> 00:02:48.999
pluck that out.

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.201
And then all I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna put my knife inside here,

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:53.036
go right to where
the pit is,

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:56.072
and you're gonna rotate
this around all the way around

00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:57.207
until you meet the other side,

00:02:57.207 --> 00:03:00.477
and hopefully you get it
just right on camera.

00:03:00.777 --> 00:03:03.146
So then the next strat
we're gonna do

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:04.214
an X on the top.

00:03:04.214 --> 00:03:06.916
So criss cross this
and then come all the way

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:09.352
around to the other side,
and once you get there,

00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:11.921
take this, twist it,
and you're gonna get

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.223
four pieces here.

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:16.126
This right here can just
barely be tapped,

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:18.261
and then we're gonna
twist this off and it comes off.

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:20.230
Push this away
from the blade,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.499
and that pit falls away.

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.268
When you peel your avocado,
it peels very nicely

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.003
from the tip of the avocado.

00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:28.872
And then what I want
you to do

00:03:28.872 --> 00:03:31.341
is you're gonna take these
and just lay 'em down.

00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:32.809
And you can do it
a couple different ways,

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.845
you can make it slices
like this,

00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:38.281
or you can keep
one end together

00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:39.315
and then fan it out.

00:03:39.315 --> 00:03:41.885
The idea is we're gonna try
to keep some of these

00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:43.420
fanned together so that when
we place it on

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.821
it looks nice on the top.

00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:46.923
I'm gonna put one of
these dishes together.

00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:48.058
We could put the whole
thing together,

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.826
but let's just do one
plated.

00:03:49.826 --> 00:03:52.062
So let's take some
field mix, spring mix,

00:03:52.062 --> 00:03:54.097
whatever's in season
is good.

00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:55.465
Our vinaigrette.

00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:58.001
Those berries have
softened a little bit.

00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:59.903
You're gonna notice a little
bit of red tinge

00:03:59.903 --> 00:04:02.338
to your shallots in there.

00:04:02.338 --> 00:04:04.474
Don't worry about
the salt and black pepper to this,

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:08.445
which I normally would do,
it's in the dressing already.

00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:10.346
It's going to plate.

00:04:10.346 --> 00:04:12.849
Tuck it in a little bit.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.851
And then each one of these
gets topped with some

00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:16.753
of your crab mix.

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:20.457
Right on the top.

00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:22.959
Gorgeous crab.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:26.229
And then let's do
our avocados.

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.998
Let's just fan this out
ever so slightly.

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:31.334
All right?

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:33.002
And then some fresh berries.

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:34.871
Today I've got some
blueberries,

00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:36.206
we'll go over the top.

00:04:36.206 --> 00:04:39.342
And then we're gonna do
some blackberries,

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:41.411
these are gorgeous,
these are huge.

00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:44.380
And then some raspberries here.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.750
Right over the top,
just a little bit more

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.351
of the dressing here

00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:52.122
just over the top of those
berries we just sat down.

00:04:52.122 --> 00:04:55.058
This is a great refreshing salad.

00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:56.993
Take advantage
of this one for sure.
