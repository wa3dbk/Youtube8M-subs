00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.510
First we'll start with a size floss about
twelve to eighteen inches in length, and that

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.940
is pretty important because of the fact that
as you're flossing, you will be winding floss

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.930
around fingers to get the grip, and the tautness
that you need. All I did was wrap it around

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.710
the middle fingers a couple, few times. You
want to leave about a four-inch segment, and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.010
then I put my thumbs under, and my index fingers
on top to support it, and you'll see that

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.030
it's a very taut piece of floss at this point.
I have full control over that. When you're

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.750
flossing, what you'll be doing is you'll be
easing that floss, I'm at the back of the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.850
arch, but I'm easing it, and I'm scraping
down the side of the tooth. When you're in

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.149
between teeth, you're actually easing it between
teeth, and you're just going to ease it down.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.950
You'll be getting on the surface of the back
of that molar, and on the front of the one

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.460
next to it. So, you're actually scraping each
and every tooth surface there, and again,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.439
you'll ease it back on up. And you'll continue,
and you'll proceed to do this throughout the

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.750
arch. Again, there is no abutting tooth, no
neighboring tooth, so you're still going to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.549
scrape up and down the sides of those teeth.
They're still vulnerable for disease. And

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.539
you'll do this throughout the entire arch.
And again, what you'll want to do is keep

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:36.590
changing your floss by wrapping, and going
through in that manner. So, you're using a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:44.500
new piece of floss each time that you're going
through. Floss holders you'll note, do not

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.279
enable you to do that. You would be using
the same piece of floss in a floss holder.

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:54.399
So it would be important in that moment that
you be by a sink, and paper towel, so that

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:01.070
you'd be able to rinse that off, and wipe
that off. So again, you'll continue each and

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:12.900
every tooth as we go along, in and out, all
the way through the entire arch. You'll do

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.200
lower, and you'll do upper, not forgetting
any area of that mouth.
