00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.500
Duke Energy is a company that we've
covered a couple times now

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.950
we talked about I think it was last week
this story and how Duke Energy

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.000
had these call ash related

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.199
I II I think calling it a disaster would
be okay a spill

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.400
and incident and and overflow call it
what you will

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.400
and Duke Energy said okay we're gonna
run the money

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.500
to clean up all over this coal ash stuff
but if the state

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.939
makes his move these locations away or
close as the mall together

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.010
we're going to really recoup the cost of
the cleanup

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.629
from our customers so it was an example
love profits

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.510
are fine for capitalism but all of a
sudden if its cleanup costs

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.190
or losses were gonna socialize those all
the sudden we move to a socialist system

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.329
Duke Energy's in the in the news again
and they've been caught

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.170
dumping coal waste into North Carolina

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.800
water just dumping it right in North
Carolina regulators a few days ago

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.339
cited you can urge E were illegally and
deliberately dumping $61 million gallons

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.630
of toxic coal ash waste

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.030
into a tributary of the key %uh the Cape
Fear

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.180
River which is not just a river of no
consequence if you thought

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.520
well it's one or the rivers that don't
make a difference to anybody

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.830
this is a river that provides drinking
water for several cities and towns in

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.100
the state in North Carolina

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.439
and this is the listen here now the
eighth

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.860
time in less than a month that Duke
Energy has been accused of violating

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.680
environmental regulations and remember
ladies and gentleman

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.350
when they have a spill or they need to
clean something up that happened as a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.780
result the mistake they made

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.579
bill socialize those cuts they'll go to
their customers

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.240
they will go and and and recoup those
costs

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.520
eight times accused in last month %uh
violating environmental regulations

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.380
and to be totally clear what they were
doing was taking this bright blue

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.500
wastewater

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.909
from to have its coal ash impoundments
and running it through hoses

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.990
into a nearby can now and drain pipe
they

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.229
are allowed to wasted some love this
water in that way

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.069
but they need to be running it through a
filter system that allows the heavier

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.819
sediment to come to the bottom

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.209
so that it's not included in the
wastewater that eventually makes it into

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.540
the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.920
to the a River they weren't doing that
and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.690
Waterkeeper Alliance tried going to the
source of the pollution

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.209
with the boat but they were warned of by
plant employees a policeman said you've

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.640
gotta get outta here Duke Energy owns
the land

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.819
so they went to aerial surveillance and
as

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.769
Rachel Maddow played some the video you
can see exactly what they're doing and

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.110
they're they're just dumping this water
in there

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.810
we've got whole ash wastewater that is
bright blue

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.700
we have licorice smelling flammable
water

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.400
that came as a result I've up racking in
West Virginia I think that was the story

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.890
from a month or two ago

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.060
this is just incredible and and we we
don't seem

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.159
what will it take for people to realize
you know we'll have to be dealing with

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.330
this type of energy

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.569
we could be completely on alternative
energy and and it just doesn't seem

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.120
there that there's anything that will
make people realize this

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.349
we could we could be but I mean the term
too big to fail I think doesn't just

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.670
apply to banks I think it applies these
energy companies as well

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.120
I mean what you gonna do you gonna shut
down this energy company and then have

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.590
have all these people have no power
because back I

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.340
its unfortunately something you have to
keep up and running it the santa thing

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.670
Lewis I think that we could apply to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.319
Obamacare's negative affect when it
comes to you

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.049
you give 30 million more customers to
the for-profit insurance industry

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.349
you for their lock that system in and it
becomes even more difficult to get outta

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.799
that these companies have so much power

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.700
receive so much money in the wave
lobbying and yes people depend on the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.390
energy provided by then

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.260
that it allows for a situation to
perpetuate itself

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.590
yeah and I'm gonna get reamed here
because the best but I mean should

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.879
energy companies even be privatized are

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.110
should those be government-run should
our internet be

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.120
privatized I mean it is a question that
I think were asking these

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.570
some countries believe that the answer
is No that when you talk about utilities

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.530
they shouldn't be privatized

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.160
internet while in this country I know a
lot of people say

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.930
poor people shouldn't have internet the
same way they shouldn't have TVs for

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.830
example

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.889
but other parts of the world disagree
right other parts of the world say

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.440
no actually Internet is increasingly
becoming ubiquitous and a

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.550
a utility it is is simply a basic that
we should be providing

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.169
and price gouging through these a
monopolistic

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.139
cable companies is not the right way to
deliver internet these are all perfectly

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.229
fair questions of course right-wingers
are gonna

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.370
go nuts Louis but that's that's to be
expected on this program are used to

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.620
that
