At work we had a private dinner party for
20 people and I helped make 3 dozen Deviled

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.740
Eggs!

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.320
Remember in my Deviled Eggs video where I
showed you how to boil them but I had some

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.169
eggs that kind of stuck to the shell and they
were messy and hard to peel?

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.630
Has that ever happened to you?

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.039
Where the shells kinda stick to the egg whites
and end up looking like craters.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.009
Well since then I’ve found a MUCH easier
way to peel an egg, so I wanted to share my

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.150
technique with you!

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.160
First, I’ll take a large pot and fill it
with water about an inch high.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.110
Now with a steam basket, I’ll just place
the eggs inside, cover the pot and let it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.820
come to a low boil for 20 minutes on medium
heat.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.830
If you don’t have a steam basket you can
use a metal strainer that fits inside the

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.830
pot.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.260
I’ll be careful, making sure the heat isn’t
too high cause I don’t want all the water

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.080
to evaporate and burn the bottom of my pot.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.820
Here’s a tip on how to cook your eggs based
on how soft you like it.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.860
For slightly runny and soft-boiled eggs, cook
it for 12 minutes.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.860
For creamy and firmer eggs cook it for 15
minutes.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.920
And for hard boiled eggs cook it for 20 minutes.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.460
Once they’re done, I like to take them out
and plunge them immediately into an ice bath

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.530
- a bowl with cold water and ice cubes.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.510
I’ll leave them in there for a few minutes
until they’re ready to peel.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.420
The shells come off so easily!

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.780
It’s almost like the steam created this
pocket of air between the egg whites and the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.780
shell.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.940
It’s the incredible, edible egg.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.190
These boiled eggs are great to have in the
morning for some extra protein.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.300
I love sprinkling a little bit of salt and
pepper on mine, so simple yet delicious!

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.260
It really brings out the flavor!

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I hope you found this egg peeling technique
useful and let me know how it worked out for

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.260
you.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.140
Let me know if you have any questions and
I’ll see you guys next time.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.650
Byeeee!
