00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.799
I'd like to talk to you about sodium and potassium.
This is a very important aspect of a healthy

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:13.320
diet. We have a real problem right now with
our modern diet in that it contains far too

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.470
much sodium and not enough potassium. Just
the opposite of what our ancestors ate. And

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.390
you might think well I don't have high blood
pressure, I'm not salt sensitive, I don't

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:32.610
need to watch my salt. Not so. Too much salt
in the diet has many implications for our

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.330
health. Everyone should be watching their
sodium intake. High sodium intake has been

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.020
linked to osteoporosis, stomach cancer, all
sorts of diseases. So this is very important.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.690
The sodium potassium ratio effects how nutrients
move back and forth across cell membranes.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.920
That's why it's so important. And believe
it or not most of the salt in our diet doesn't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.610
come from the salt shaker, it comes from fast
foods. Fast foods are notorious for high sodium.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.000
Packaged and processed foods. If you're not
eating fresh foods you have to compensate

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.930
in these products by adding a lot of salt
and sugar. For example I was looking at one

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:31.310
frozen dinner and it had about five thousand
milligrams of sodium in this large frozen

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.510
dinner. Which is about twice our recommended
intake of sodium. Recommendation is about

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.760
2400 milligrams of sodium per day. What you
would find in about a teaspoon of salt. So

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.350
it's not coming so much from the salt shaker
but coming from fast foods. Coming from canned

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.479
foods. Canned soups. Canned vegetables you've
got to be careful about. A lot of condiments,

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.530
too. And a lot of times it's not so much,
not just the sodium quantity but the lack

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.390
of potassium. There's sort of a seesaw balance
between these two minerals. And if you keep

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.870
your potassium level high that's going to
bring down, help to bring down the sodium

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.139
level. And where do we get the potassium?
Well again, that's the vegetables and fruits.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:27.980
If you're getting your quota of at least two
fruit, at least three vegetable a day that's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.120
where you're getting the potassium. But I
would shoot for the higher amount. I would

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.559
try and go for four servings of fruit and
five of the vegetable. Sometimes people ask

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:44.939
me, well can I take a potassium supplement.
Sure you can but the best potassium supplement

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:52.069
would be a glass of tomato juice or vegetable
juice. Which would give you about 400 milligrams

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:00.290
of potassium versus maybe 99 milligrams in
a potassium supplement. Bananas also. Very

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.249
high in potassium. Several hundred milligrams.
But all the vegetables and fruits. Good sources

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:16.669
of potassium. And if you do that there is
room for some salt in your diet. Hopefully

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:24.139
a healthy salt. And this is a good choice
here. This is called Celtic or sometimes called

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:31.900
Celtic sea salt. And you can tell that it's
very nutritious by this gray color versus

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.719
the white salt. It's like the difference between
whole grain bread and white refined bread.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.040
This has minerals in here that account for
that gray color. So a little bit of healthy

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.769
salt in your diet is fine if you're getting
lots of vegetables and fruits. Here's another

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.450
one. This is called Pink salt. This is Himalayan
salt. And the pink color is from the iron

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.400
and other minerals in there. So that's the
deal on sodium potassium. Make sure you're

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.700
getting your quota for vegetables and fruits
every day. Hold down the fast foods and the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.459
convenient foods to avoid sodium.
