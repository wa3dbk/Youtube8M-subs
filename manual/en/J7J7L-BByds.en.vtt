Are you radiating longevity, are you radiating
beauty?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.720
When you see Crow's feet, do you see some
blemishes, some pimples, maybe some blackheads

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.720
on your nose.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.840
When you look at your over-all body, do you
see saggy skin?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.440
One of the biggest emails that I get all the
time is that people that have loosed, that

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.100
have lost a lot of weight, then all of a sudden
they have this saggy skin that they have to

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.180
deal with as well.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.180
Nobody likes that.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.129

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.410
So your health is representative of things
that are going on internally.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.780
So the first place we have to take care of
is your gut and the greatest thing for you

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.799
Fitlifer, is that when you juice, especially
the ingredients that I'm gonna use a little

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.100
bit later, it actually helps restore your
gut.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.030
And when your gut is restored and when your
absorbing, the vitamins, the enzymes, the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.000
minerals, the amino acids, everything comes
together there, it's gonna be reflective in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.290
the outside as well.

acne, that have had dry skin , that have had

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.590

have had you know, even saggy arms in the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.180
back; when they start juicing, they really
start to notice a huge difference in their

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.840
over-all skin quality.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.329
And what happens when you start noticing difference?

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.890
