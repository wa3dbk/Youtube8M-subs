00:00:41.804 --> 00:00:44.443
Today is a very good day

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.444
Again, we have reached

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:48.454
into the AMG candy jar

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:50.993
of Mercedes Benz The Hague

00:00:50.993 --> 00:00:55.558
and we have got a nice treat today

00:00:55.558 --> 00:00:59.412
the Mercedes CLS63 AMG Shooting Brake

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:03.703
and we have the coolest combination as well

00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:04.709
black on black

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.561
black wheels, black body

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:11.198
and man, does it look good

00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:27.282
it is fitted with the very well-known

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:29.472
5.5 V8 BiTurbo

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:33.797
558 HP and 720 Nm

00:01:33.797 --> 00:01:38.751
it may have 2 HP less than the RS6 and M5

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:41.286
but it has 40 Nm more

00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:42.539
and you can feel that

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.456
it has a lot more thrusting power

00:01:45.456 --> 00:01:48.217
than an M5 for example

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.353
what strikes me is the way it handles

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:03.767
how precise

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:06.092
it really surprised me

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:07.686
when we drove the E63

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:10.417
that one didn't handle all that well

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:11.857
it was bit unwieldy

00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:13.898
this one handles excellently

00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:16.623
did I mention it's a 4matic?

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:32.817
the 4matic ensures optimal power use

00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:35.357
but it doesn't make it feel heavy

00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:39.557
that's why it's more sharp

00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:40.900
and better handling

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.399
than an RS6

00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:00.917
You won't see the shooting brake very often

00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:02.516
but if you want to spot one

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.802
just go wait at a gas station

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:06.187
because you need to fill it up quite often

00:03:12.103 --> 00:03:14.605
but after filling it up with your eyes closed

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:15.890
you can proceed

00:03:19.184 --> 00:03:21.888
and when rejoining the high way

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:24.806
you can use one of the best features

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:26.397
the launch control

00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:28.979
what to do to engage it

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.637
ESP has to be in sport mode

00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:32.923
turn this dial to RS

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:33.929
Right paddle

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.164
and go

00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:39.986
thanks to the 4matic

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.250
it'll go from 0-100 in 3.8 seconds

00:03:42.838 --> 00:03:44.754
3.8!!

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:46.328
that's bizar

00:03:51.937 --> 00:03:56.544
this is such a great car

00:03:56.544 --> 00:03:58.246
and when I say this

00:03:58.246 --> 00:03:59.964
I mean this specific one

00:03:59.964 --> 00:04:00.969
when you see it just standing there

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.572
or driving along

00:04:02.947 --> 00:04:04.474
it commands a lot of respect

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:08.177
it looks very sleek through the corners

00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:10.245
with that black body and those black wheels

00:04:10.245 --> 00:04:11.571
and that beautiful roofline

00:04:11.571 --> 00:04:12.596
perfect!

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:14.257
where can you buy this one?

00:04:14.257 --> 00:04:16.214
as I said, Mercedes Benz The Hague

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.524
just under â‚¬100K

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:20.229
and it has all the great extras

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.395
the massaging seats

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:23.942
which are the best around

00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:26.353
better than those from Jaguar, BMW or Audi

00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:29.746
it also has ventilated and heated seats

00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:31.495
heated seats in the back

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:33.829
HarmanKardon sound system

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:35.266
it's fully loaded

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.177
I can't stress it enough

00:04:44.177 --> 00:04:45.992
you have to have the 4matic

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:48.780
it makes it much more usable

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.918
you can use all of the power, all the time

00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:53.766
and when you'd chiptune this car

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:55.373
what would happen?

00:04:55.373 --> 00:04:57.096
well we're founding that out very soon

00:04:57.096 --> 00:05:01.332
because we're going to DTE systems soon

00:05:01.332 --> 00:05:06.462
to drive a chip tuned CLS63 AMG

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.998
we'll see what happens!
