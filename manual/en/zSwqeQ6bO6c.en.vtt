00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.374
So tell us a little
bit about how

00:00:01.374 --> 00:00:03.120
you decided on how
to set up your room

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.500
and was this the
first idea, or did you

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.750
have to change it a few times?

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.583
Do you want to talk?

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:08.600
Sure.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.000
We had to change it
like over six times.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.462
We kept lofting the
bed, de-lofting it, just

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:15.545
trying to figure out how
we can make our own space

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:16.170
in this corner room.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.086
What's it like for you
to have your bed lofted

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:20.360
and have your
workspace under it?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.430
I have two lamps, so it
works out with lighting.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.310
And I don't mind it lofted.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.110
It gives us more
space, so I like it.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.610
Yeah.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.000
If it was down lower, I feel
like we'd be too cramped,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.020
and I wouldn't like it.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.650
And now we have
space for the carpet.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.150
Yeah.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.332
I like our room a lot.

00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:39.290
Everyone's always in here
and chilling with us,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.990
so it's really nice
and comfortable.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.800
And how did you decide
how to decorate?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.490
What's your style?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.160
We really like classic
people like Audrey Hepburn,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.800
Johnny Cash.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.300
Yeah.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.799
We didn't even plan our bringing
the Audrey Hepburn posters.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:51.430
Yeah.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.730
We both brought one.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.230
Yeah.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.170
We both are really
into hockey, Bruins.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.845
U Mass hockey
posters over there.

00:00:57.845 --> 00:00:59.970
And just a lot of photos
of our friends and family.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.470
College.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.756
If you look on this side, I
even have pictures up here.

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:05.930
They're hidden, kind of.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.620
Well, it seems like you've
also maximized your storage.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.950
You've got stuff under
this bed that's not lofted.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.030
And that's perfectly fit.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.780
I don't know if you
brought that with you.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.520
I did.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.940
It worked out perfectly, then.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.050
Tell us what you like
about your micro-fridge.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.880
We used to have a
smaller fridge earlier.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.920
It's down to the ground.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.420
Yeah.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.890
The TV would be low
and be hard to watch.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.390
Yeah.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.170
This is really convenient.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.410
Everything's in one little
spot and it's under,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.540
so it doesn't take
up space at all.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.280
We used to have to
walk down the hall

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.336
to bother our friends
to use their microwave,

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:35.612
but not anymore.

00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:36.320
Easy Mac all day.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.310
We have it at home.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.420
What advice would you give
a new first year student?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.450
Definitely if you
get a corner room,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.830
don't feel trapped that you need
to loft your beds or anything.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.630
You just can continually
rearrange it and figure out

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.070
how your space is and
you want it to look.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.580
It's definitely
good, too, to have

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.030
each your own side of the room.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.540
Any words of wisdom?

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.114
Be nice about laundry.

00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:02.614
Yeah.

00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:03.910
That would be good.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:04.910
Get to know people.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.410
Yeah.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.560
Leave your door open.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.370
And get involved.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.090
It's nice to do sports
and go to the gym.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.590
Yeah.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.381
That kind of thing.

00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:11.740
The gym's awesome.
