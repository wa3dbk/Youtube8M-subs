DR. SUSAN JEWELL: Hello. My name is Dr. Susan
Jewell, and on behalf of Expert Village today,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.260
I'm going to talk to you about ways to treat
fevers and how to reduce the symptom of fevers.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.610
Now in this clip, we're going to talk about
medications, specifically over-the-counter

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.189
medication that you can buy readily in the
local drug store or the pharmacy. Besides

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.000
that, prescription medication, for example
if you have fever and you know it's a cold,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.970
a bacterial infection, and you have fever,
then you're going to get prescription medication

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.920
from the doctor and antibiotics, and that
would help. But also, if you know it's just

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.600
a simple cold or flu, or you have fevers that
you could try temporary relief you can get

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.350
over-the-counter drugs. Now here, medications
you can get, for example NSAIDs, for example

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.700
acetaminophen, and Aspirin, Tylenol are popular
brands that you can buy over-the-counter on

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.739
the shelf in drug stores to help you to at
least temporarily reduce the fever and reduce

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.720
the temperature in the body. So, most of these
medications have what we call "antipyretic"

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.400
which is, it means it reduces the temperature
of the body down, and also anti-inflammatory

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.830
and analgesic because sometimes when you have
high fevers, you have the accompanying symptoms

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.720
of aches and pains, especially if it's viral
or bacterial flus and fevers, and so you want

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.049
to get some temporary relief with these drugs,
over-the-counter. Here, I've given you a display

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.500
of some of the popular drugs that you can
buy in the store, and for children, specifically

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.619
when they have high fevers, they don't really
want to--they're very fuzzy about what they

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.290
want to ingest, or put in their mouth, so
you can try to buy some like more popular

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.659
children's brand of medication, but here I
have an example of Cold Eeze, and it's a bubble

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.110
gum, so for older children of course, not
for infants, where they can chew the bubble

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.219
gum; If they are able to and they don't have
vomiting then they can take this medication

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:14.620
this way. Also, you can have children's. Make
sure that for elderly and the pediatric or

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.160
the children's age group, that you give the
right dosage of these over-the-counter medications,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.970
so always follow the advice and recommendation
on the package, and read it first to tell

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.661
you how much of the medication you should
give to the children, the infants, and also

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:35.910
the elderly. And the other thing like, of
course, the Aspirin is very good, that you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.569
could buy that would help. It has antipyretic
to reduce the fever temperature and for nighttime,

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.260
of course, when you are having a hard time
for sleeping, you can get drowsy; induce sleep

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.700
with some of this medication. For example,
here's Contac for severe colds and flus; that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.659
also will help to reduce the fever.
