that the United States of America will endure,

00:01:27.098 --> 00:01:29.234
that it will prevail,

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:32.764

00:01:32.764 --> 00:01:38.429
I want to thank all of the speakers and performers today

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.934
for reminding us through song and through words

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:47.021
just what it is that we love about America.

00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:48.830
Thank you America.

God bless you.
