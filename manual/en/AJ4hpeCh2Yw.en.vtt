Dear friends welcome back! Today and I'm going to show you how to receive phone

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.450
calls with your

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.210
Arduino using the TinySine GSM

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.120
shield. Let's start! We are using an Arduino Uno

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.330
along with the GSM shield from TinySine.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.980
I have prepared detailed tutorials about that shield

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
in previous videos. You can check them out.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.039
I have connected a small speaker to the speaker output

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.849
of the shield which is the green one. The other one

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.210
is that microphone input. If you connect a microphone

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.829
in that input you can send sound as well. Not only

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.530
receive sound. In order to test the project I will go

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.190
outside and call Arduino. I will try to speak

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.140
but expect a lot of interference from the GSM shield

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.399
to the camera's microphone. That noise does not exist in reality.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.319
It's only a camera's fault.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.220
I am now testing the GSM shield. As you can see

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.810
Arduino can auto pick up the call. I am hanging up now. Bye.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.030
Let's now go to the computer and see the
software side

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.830
of the project. As you can see the code
of a project is very simple.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.220
We are using the library from TinySine the designer

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.680
of the shield. In this program at first we connect to the GSM network,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.570
with this line of code here. Next in the loop function,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.670
we check the status of the shield every second

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.970
with this command. If there is an incoming call

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.270
we immediately pick up that call with this line here.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.840
It's that easy! With 40 lines of code we can receice phone calls from

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.460
our Arduino projects. Really impressive.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.440
That's the real power of Arduino and open software!

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.729
That's today's video! As you can see
receiving phone calls from Arduino

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.920
is really simple. In a future video we
are going to see how to make phone calls

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.390
from Arduino and how to connect to the GPRS network

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.700
in order to send and receive data from
the internet.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.940
