00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.010
How do you turn this, into this?

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:11.210
You won't believe how easy, inexpensive and
satisfying it is!

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.769
Looking for a fun, fresh way to finish furniture?

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.110
I'm going to give you an easy paint recipe
you'll use again and again.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.620
This is a chalk-finish paint and it gives
this pretty matte finish to almost anything.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.380
You can paint wood, metal, wovens, glass and
the best part?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.320
There's little to no prep.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.270
That's right no stripping, or priming necessary
-- all you need is a clean dry piece to work

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.620
on.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.470
The Recipe
This is the key ingredient - Plaster of paris.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.420
This is what gives it the great matte texture
and helps it adhere to almost anything.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.260
Mix a third of a cup with a 1/3 of a cup of
cool water, and stir that up really really

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
well until the plaster of paris is completely
dissolved.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.810
Then add a cup of paint, just plain ole latex,
and stir.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.850
That's it!

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.340
This may seem like a really small batch, but
you'll be amazed at how far it will go.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.400
This isn't about getting a completely smooth
finish like you would with a glossy latex

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.960
or an oil-based paint.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.450
You're going to see some brush strokes and
you're going to have some texture in the finish.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:30.640
This is why I love this stuff, I didn't even
sand this and look how easily it covers.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.610
Since the paint does have a more brittle finish,
you want to protect it from wear and tear

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.700
so you can use a spray poly, or a wipe on
wax.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.610
This step helps seal the finish and protect
the paint.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.340
You can do just one color, of if you really
want that aged, worn patina, you could layer

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.080
colors, creating more depth and interest.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.160
I love the raised patterns on this frame,
and by adding almost a wash of the chalk finish

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.009
paint, it's really going to highlight all
that beautiful detail.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.979
Since the paint has such a soft matte texture,
it's really easy to distress and blend.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.540
That's one of the best things about this paint,
you can get lots of looks and it's very forgiving.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.469
I love using this, it's so user-friendly and
it's fast and fun and really -- you don't

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.160
need a lot of expertise to get really great
results -- so give it a try!
