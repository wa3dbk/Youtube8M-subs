“Food Sources of Flame-
Retardant Chemicals”

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.090
What are they eating in New York?

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.600
I bet it’s more than just big apples.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.210
You may remember me covering
this study a few years ago,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.690
which showed that the primary sources
of flame-retardant chemicals

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.050
in the American diet (with the exception
of infants, who get all the pollution

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.980
straight from their moms)
are meat, fish, dairy, and eggs.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.000
But, which kind of meat is the worst?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.649
We didn’t know, until recently.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.879
We know fish is the worst—

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.719
and this is for halibut, which is actually
one of the least contaminated.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.199
But, in terms of other meats, second
only to fish in terms of contamination—

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.049
poultry; then pork; then beef.

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.359
What’s this one here, though,
between chicken and fish?

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.580
Turkey.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.299
So, bottom line: white meat
is more contaminated with

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.430
flame-retardant chemical
pollutants than red,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.780
though the highest concentrations

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.700
are actually found in
dogs’ and cats’ food.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.460
What about polychlorinated naphthalenes?

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.719
Until this study was published,

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.130
“Information on the occurrence
of [these] toxicologically significant

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.850
[industrial pollutants] in food,
or on human exposure, [was] sparse.”

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.280
“…PCNs…are chlorinated
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons—

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.630
a potentially vast group of little-known

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.399
environmental contaminants
of [human] origin,”

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.359
whose chemical structure “can bestow
a dioxin-like mode of toxic action.”

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.270
Say no more.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.170
Though banned in many countries,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.640
which aisle might we still find the
most in the grocery store?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.759
The bread shelves?

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.420
The dairy case?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060
Would it be in the deli?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.689
The egg section?

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:08.720
Fish counter?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.270
Or, would it be in the
produce department?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.250
The worst was fish,
with the worst of the worst—

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.230
farmed salmon—

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.990
followed closely by organic salmon.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.610
Then comes poultry and eggs.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.310
Let’s zoom in a bit here.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.670
Red meat has less;
the worst being lamb.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.730
Then comes dairy.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.120
And, at the bottom of the food chain,
vegetables, fruit, and bread.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.001
So, about ten times less
than meat, dairy, and eggs.

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:49.290
And, about a hundred times
safer than fish—

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.490
which gives us an idea of the
route we may want to take

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.190
through 
the supermarket.
