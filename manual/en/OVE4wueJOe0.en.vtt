00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.600
Hi once again I'm Sue Rose with Expert Village
we've done our sky and our green hill and

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:18.070
our water and now we're going in to do the
details on our boat. I'm still using the number

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:37.079
30 brush and I'm still leaving the white of
the paper for my sails so I dip my brush in

00:00:37.079 --> 00:01:05.220
the water and I'm going to start here with
my blue from my boat going very carefully.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:21.619
I'm going to do this dark boat here because
one's in front of the other and things get

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:50.340
darker as they get further further from you,
so the boat behind the behind boat should

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:06.619
always be darker than anything in the foreground.
And I'm going to lift up some of the blue

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.370
with my brush on this to make sure that it's
lighter than the boat behind it, so begin

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:36.190
to put our blue for our boats in
and I'm going to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:46.260
take this and I'm going to do this little
strip here on this sail. And this one over

00:02:46.260 --> 00:03:04.710
here has a strip too and I think I'll add
one on this little boat right here as well,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:22.970
stay tune for next segment when we'll put
in our red and do our final details on this.
