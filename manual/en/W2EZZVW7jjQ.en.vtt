00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
Batman: Arkham City is the most overrated game

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.780
in 300 years!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.460
For some god-forsaken reason, this hybrid between...

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.140
Splinter Cell and a "beat 'em up"

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.940
is being paraded as a "Masterpiece" of video gaming.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.880
Every time someone describes Arkham City, they say

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.280
[Clueless Scrub] "Oh man! That game makes you feel like Batman!"

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.460
[Dunkey] Now, I never read the comic books,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.060
but, uh

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.060
was there really an issue where Batman became

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.820
A FUCKING

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.700
BALLERINA?!

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.360
This man is a HUMAN TANK!!!

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.040
He can't see his own feet because his pectoral muscles

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.420
weigh 300 pounds EACH!

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.720
How is he sliding across the ground

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.900
like a goddamn Olympic ice-skater?!

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.960
I wouldn't mind that Batman jumps around

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.140
like a total asshole,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.140
if the combat was actually engaging

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.860
in any way whatsoever...

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.360
CRIMINAL: There's a fight goin' on over there!

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.380
*mashes Δ*

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.800
CRIMINAL: Whaddya gonna do Bat?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360
*shallow combat mechanics*

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000
CRIMINAL: This will be easy Batman!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.800
*repetitive metascore*

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.660
CRIMINAL: I'll kill you freak!

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.780
*button mashing continues*

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.340
*new tilt combo attack*

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.600
For the stealth parts, you have like 12 gadgets,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.620
10 of them are worthless.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.920
But still...

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.520
the best thing to do is just

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.560
sneak up behind people...

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.580
...and hit the Δ button like always.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.320
It's brain dead gaming. There's no challenge.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.200
You can't really be creative in how you take people down

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.520
It's just...

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300
BATMAN: A Batarang will hold enough charge to overload the fuse box.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.000
DUNKEY: Oh really?!

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.540
I thought I just fucking hit it with a goddamn Batarang!!

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.120
The story actually starts out really interesting

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.460
and then, uh...

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.700
something happens with the Penguin...

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.160
and then Robin shows up...

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.200
I don't care anymore.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.320
I think what sucked me out of the story the most

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.880
is when I realized Batman was an uncharismatic

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.760
mental

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.400
RETARD!

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100
DEATHSTROKE: So it's the world's greatest detective

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.540
versus the world's deadliest assassin?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280
Who's going to win?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.160
BATMAN: Not him.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.820
*the crowd goes wild*

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.540
You can never defeat me Batman!

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.160
...unless you have Mr. Freeze's suit!

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.020
The only way to defeat the Penguin...

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.080
...is to use my Mr. Freeze Suit dude.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.080
OFFICER: And that's the famous Freeze Suit.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
BATMAN: Unfortunately.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.500
Didn't I already beat Penguin anyway?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.960
This game is also loaded with AGLs;

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.960
just shit to waste time.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.820
Dino...

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.720
Something dino...

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.980
Just take each screw out real quick...

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.160
and just...

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
place it gently next to the vent...

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.220
so I don't lose it.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.700
What's an 8 letter word for "penguin?"

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.380
Batman! It's me: Morgan Freeman.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.440
You'll have to rip out all 3 screens

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.760
on the communications towers

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.240
to stop Penguin's plan.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.460
He... uh...

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.920
put 3 screens on there...

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.380
as a hilarious joke.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.360
Also, there are 10 towers.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.280
Is this the new Gameboy OneDS?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.480
MR. FREEZE: What man?

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.540
BATMAN: His name is...

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.820
DUNKEY: He can't even say Ra's al-Ghul right.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.020
What a fucking idiot.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.720
