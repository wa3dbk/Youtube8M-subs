00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
This is ready to pick and this is really
fancy in revel if you've ever eaten raw

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.900
corn, but it's really good. You're going
to like some this pretty.  Flavor

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:24.560
being the first criteria. Did you see cauliflower already? Beautiful. It's almost ready.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.260
I mean look at these things,
they're nice. Those are

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.700
beautiful. That's got the harder wall, so it
will take the heat when

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.370
it's being roasted or grilled. Be perfect
grilled.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.079
Farmers' Market is held every year when
the students come back in the last week

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.280
in August and primarily runs until the
first week in October. We have a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.030
partnership with Costa Fruit and
Produce. What Costa does is they work as

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.829
a conduit to get all the farms to come
in. Jim Elise, who's our main contact at

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.090
Costa actually goes out to the fields,
spends time with the farmers, talks about

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.190
their harvest. Top sellers are always
fruit, everything from blueberries to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.330
apples, peaches when we have them. We also
bring in some bread that's made locally.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.780
I know from talking to students on
campus that there isn't really options

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.380
close to them on campus. They like the
fact that we have a lot of different

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.789
fresh food items on there as well and
they can use mandatory, which is a great

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.330
option for them.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.830
So, I plant tomato, mozzarella, and
basil. The basil is fresh too. It's all

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.700
from the farmers market. It's actually

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.760
really, really good.
