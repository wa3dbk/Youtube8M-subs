00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:05.934
(swamp sounds)

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:09.166
&gt;&gt; CADDO LAKE IS UNIQUE BECAUSE
IT IS THE LARGEST BALD CYPRESS

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:13.600
SWAMP IN THE SOUTH IF
NOT IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.767
(Heron calls)

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:17.567
(Paddling)

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.166
THE PADDLING TRAILS HERE ON
CADDO LAKE WILL GET YOU BACK

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:25.333
INTO SOME HABITAT THAT IS JUST
NOT EVERYWHERE, IT'S UNIQUE.

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.567
(Paddling and birds call)

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:29.166
IT GETS YOU INTO A PLACE THAT
YOU MAY HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:40.033
(Music)

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.033
WE HAVE FIVE TRAILS HERE
ON CADDO LAKE,

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.633
WE HAVE HELLS HALF ACRE,
CARTER SHUTE TRAIL,

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:49.667
THE CATHEDRAL TRAIL,
TURTLE SHELL TRAIL,

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:53.000
AND THE OLD FOLKS
PLAYGROUND TRAIL.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.433
&gt;&gt; OKIE, DOKIE.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:56.767
&gt;&gt; TO GET THE PEOPLE OUT
HERE AND TO EXPERIENCE THAT

00:00:56.767 --> 00:01:00.800
UNIQUENESS, THE TRAILS
REALLY HELP US DO THAT.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.934
REALLY GET TO EXPERIENCE THE
SURROUNDINGS AND THE SOUNDS.

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:07.266
(Bird sings)

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.266
&gt;&gt; RIGHT OVER THE GREEN STUFF
THERE, YOU CAN JUST SEE HIS

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.066
HEAD, THERE'S A GREAT WHITE
EGRET RIGHT OVER THERE!

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:23.367
I'VE LIVED IN MARSHALL MOST OF
MY LIFE WHICH IS, UH,

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.700
I'M ALMOST 70 YEARS OLD.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.900
(Canoe paddle slides
through water)

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.000
WHAT'S INTERESTING I GUESS IS
THE AGE AND THE BEAUTY

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
OF THE CYPRESS TREES
AND THE SPANISH MOSS.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.834
IT HAS KIND OF AN
ETHEREAL FEEL TO IT.

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.433
YOU CAN'T REALLY EXPERIENCE
CADDO UNLESS YOU GET OUT ON IT!

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:51.934
(Music)

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:54.700
&gt;&gt; I THINK EVERYTHING
ABOUT IT IS UNIQUE!

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.900
YOU CAN'T FIND THIS WELL
REALLY ANYWHERE ELSE.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.233
ALL THE NETWORK OF CANALS
AND THE SWAMPYNESS OF IT.

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:09.734
AND THE WAY IT
ATTRACTS THE BIRDS.

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:14.367
I JUST FEEL REAL CLOSE TO
THE EARTH WHEN I'M HERE.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.867
(Water gurgles)

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:21.900
(Music)

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.000
&gt;&gt; CADDO LAKE IS DIFFERENT EVERY
SEASON, YOU CAN'T JUST COME

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.600
ONE SEASON AND SEE IT ALL.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.100
IT IS DIFFERENT EVERY DAY!

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:33.800
YOU GOTTA GET OUT ON THE BOAT,
YOU GOTTA GET IN THE SWAMP

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.934
AND YOU REALLY GOTTA SIT DOWN
AND YOU GOTTA SIT AND LISTEN.

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:39.000
(Sounds of swamp)

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.233
IT'S BEYOND WORDS TO DESCRIBE
HOW WONDERFUL THIS PLACE IS,

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:45.667
IT'S JUST UNREAL!
