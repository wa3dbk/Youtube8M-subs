On behalf of Expert Village my name is Jim
Dufresne, I'm here to tell you about the ebow.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.259
Now we're using no effects what so ever that
was strictly the pure sound. No compressor,

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:37.994
there's no distortion, there's no EQ modification,
the board is flat. In this case I got all

00:00:37.994 --> 00:01:10.740
the knobs cranked up and I'm still using the
neck pick up. Let's see what it sounds like

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.710
in the middle position (playing) now we can
see in this position. It's just the middle

00:01:15.710 --> 00:02:07.570
pick up on and there's your bridge pick up.
It doesn't hurt the guitar you can use it

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.930
on your vintage guitar and not worry about
it there's no modification, it's takes a little

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.580
bit of learning curve the fun kind of learning
curve.
