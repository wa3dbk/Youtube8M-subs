00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.430
Now on my finishing cuts here I need to go
a little bit slower. I can't be as aggressive

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:23.420
and now I am going to bump the speed up too.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:51.440
See I am anchoring it, beveling it and then
cutting. I've got all the directions going

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.979
right. That's pretty good. I need to have
a little bit of extra wood down in here because

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:17.480
I am going to remove that so I am going to
start that curve in a little quicker.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.000
Now my hands can see a lot more than my eyes
can so I put my hands on it here to feel that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:38.160
little bit of a bump right there. I start
in back of the bump, rub the bevel. It feels

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:51.841
pretty good.
One last little ridge right here and that

00:01:51.841 --> 00:02:01.950
should do it. That looks pretty good, pretty
clean. I don't have any torn grain and that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.460
looks pretty good. We are going to next put
in a little tiny bead detail right in this

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.849
area here because this piece of wood is kind
of bland and so a little bit of a decoration

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.780
here will actually help it to look a little
bit better.
