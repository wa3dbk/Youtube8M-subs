00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.800
I’m going to show you one way of working
a picot edge.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.680
And this edge is really nice anytime you are
using a rolled hem.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.770
A rolled hem would be something you’d see
at the cuff of a cap, or the cuff of sleeves,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.600
or the bottom of a sweater.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.440
Anytime the hem can be turned, you can do
this edge.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.390
Um, go ahead and watch the technique, and
you’ll see that this can be easily substituted

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.870
into patterns for whatever edge they have
that might be plain, this is a nice little

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.690
decorative technique that you can apply if
you like.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.480
Let’s take a look.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.899
Here’s a little hat I knit up, and here
is the picot edge.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.280
It’s just a little detail that’s different
from a plain edge, and it’s really easy

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.890
to work.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.300
Okay.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.969
So I have this sample here, just plain stockinette.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.260
And to work this – you’re going to be
shocked, I think, at how easy this is.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.140
For one round or one row, this is the same
whether you’re working in the round or on

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.020
flat – with something flat.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.640
You knit two together, yarn over, knit two
together, yarn over, you work this pattern

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.100
across the whole row.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.090
For a round, like I said.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.760
Maybe is should demonstrate this.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.700
Knit two together is a one stitch decrease,
and to yarn forward, you pull the yarn forward

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.080
between the two needles which creates this
fakey stitch on the needle with a hole underneath

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.179
it.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:50.829
Okay, after you finish that row, you’ll
continue to go on and knit your piece.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.020
You might not want to seam or roll them hem
until you’re completely finished knitting.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.780
But I’ll bring in another sample here.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.780
This is what it will look like when you have
more.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.080
This will be the inside of the hem, and this
is the rest of my work, on the outside.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.319
But watch what magic happens!

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.240
When you fold that over and roll the hem,
you can see the edge!

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.440
Isn’t that great?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.970
And it naturally folds there because of the
yarn over and knit two together that we did.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:35.800
So to finish this up, I left myself a long
tail here, I’m going to grab a tapestry

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.920
needle.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.950
And it would work best for me if I actually
clipped these down to hold my seam together

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.570
like that.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.870
But this is such a tiny piece, I can easily
just hold it together.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.620
So I’ll pick up a little bit from the rolled
hem, and just grab the back of a stitch from

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.730
the rest of the work.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.960
This is really nothing fancy.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.180
I think it’s just whip stitch even.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.350
But the important thing is I’m not stabbing
through the work, so nothing will show up

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.190
on this side.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.170
Just make sure you’re consistent all the
way across with the way you’re seaming it.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.500
Very easy.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.080
And there’s the picot edge, partially held
down.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.960
Now, one more trick I want to show you.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.710
Back to the little hat.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.880
There is this design feature I added [laughs]
with this blue.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.430
And I made the pompom to match.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.350
But it was really just to make life easier
on myself.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.070
That’s why I added this blue stripe.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.850
This is what I did.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.580
I cast on here, I knit down, I did the picot
edge row, and then I continued knitting.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.520
And if I’m not mistaken, this was ten rows,
I knit another ten rows and did the blue stripe.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.290
The reason for that was so I had an easy guideline
for where I was supposed to be seaming this

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.290
down.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.450
And I wasn’t going to accidentally jump
up a row or jump down a row while I was seaming

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.450
it.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.640
So that was something that just happened to
work out well with this hat.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.500
[laughs] It was an easy enough thing to do,
and it made the seaming really simple.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.500
And that’s it.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.030
That’s one easy way to alter a pattern to
include a picot edge.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.430
[man voice singing off camera: How’s that
sound?]

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.130
[singing] How’s that souuuuund?

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.300
Is that a real song, or are we just making
[bleep]?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.349
[music]
