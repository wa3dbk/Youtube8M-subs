Hello. I am making five spice beef shin

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.960
Let's take a look at the ingredients

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.780
3 pounds of beef shin

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.420
1 litre of water, 50ml of high grade Shaoxing wine, 50ml of Chinese rose wine

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.020
1 tbsp of dark soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of light soy sauce

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.380
1 tsp of chicken stock, 1 tbsp of salt

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:49.100
2 shallot, 6 cloves of garlic, 3 slices of ginger

00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:51.614
30 grams of cane sugar or white sugar

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:00.300
We have a muslin bag, for putting in the 1 tsp cinnamon powder, 1tsp grounded cumin seed and 3 star anise

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.600
We need to blanche the beef shin first

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.420
Boil half a pot of water, then place the beef shin in

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.900
This is to remove the blood from the meat

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:35.040
Blanche for 2-3 minutes

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.720
Take out the beef shin and give it a wash

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.820
Pour in 1 litre of water into the pot

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.860
Heat up the pan, and place the muslin bag in

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.980
Add in all the condiments

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.740
Place the beef shin into the pot when the water is boiling

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.840
Cook for 1.5 hours when the water starts to boil, add in the wine

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.780
Use medium low heat

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:10.120
After cooking for 1.5 hours, we use a bamboo stick to pierce through the meat to see if it is cooked

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.260
If it can be pierced easily, this means it is cooked

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:26.140
Turn the heat off, cover pot with lid, and leave it for another 3-4 hours

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:37.100
Then take the meat out, let it cool down before putting it in the fridge overnight

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:42.941
So that the meat is hardened and can be sliced more easily

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.540
After keeping it in the fridge overnight, the beef is cut into slices

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.720
Please try it at home.  It is delicious with noodle soup and rice

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:59.986
Thanks for watching
