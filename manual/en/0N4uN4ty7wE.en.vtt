00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:03.668
Hello, this is Sandra with
the DisneyCarToys channel.

00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:09.875
And as you can see, we have a whole bunch
of fun Shopkins toys to play with today.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:13.208
Today, we're going to
celebrate Shopkins season two.

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:18.063
I have a little Shopkins blind basket
that we're going to open up and

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:23.258
in the center, this super awesome
huge Play-Doh egg and they decorated

00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:28.130
it to look just like Dribbles,
the cute little fuzzy baby Shopkin.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.043
Don't you love it?
I made it myself.

00:00:30.043 --> 00:00:34.799
And then we're also going to
open up a big Shopkins 12 pack,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:38.377
which comes with another
little fluffy baby.

00:00:38.377 --> 00:00:42.542
The Shopkins 12 pack is really cool,
so we're gonna open this up first.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.993
And I'm so excited, because we can
see ten of these Shopkins, but

00:00:45.993 --> 00:00:47.542
there's two hiding inside.

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:48.208
All righty.

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:50.333
Let's open up our 12 pack.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.500
I'm so excited.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.958
I love Shopkins.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.833
Especially the treats,
cuz who doesn't love sweet treats?

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:57.961
Let's get him out and

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:01.667
I'm excited to see this little baby
fluffy one that we get in here too.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:04.958
Oh, and here's our surprise basket.

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.625
So let's see what we have inside here.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:10.625
This is Cloe Flower and she's a rare.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:14.042
This Shopkin is common is Booty Freshener.

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:17.542
Of course, she's an air freshener.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:22.708
And from the Bakery Section,
we have Coco Lava, who is common.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:25.333
Next up, we have Coffee Drip.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.168
She's common and
she's on House Ware Section.

00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:34.458
And we have one little fluffy baby,
this is Gaga Gourmet.

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:36.208
It's baby food.

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:40.292
And of course, since it's nice and
fluffy, it's special edition.

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:41.875
And this one's a pretty funny one.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:46.250
It's a garbage can named Lisa Litter and
she's common.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.042
She's got a little banana
on top of her lid too.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.918
Oh, here's a rare one
from the pantry section.

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:56.250
This is Toffee Coffee.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.083
And this cute little one is
Garlic Rose and it is common.

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:03.708
Oh, and check it out, we got a shoe.

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:07.958
This one is common and it is Wedgie Wendy.

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.625
Oh, this one looks delicious.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:13.958
This is Waffle Sue and she's rare.

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.989
And now that we looked at the ten Shopkins
that we could see inside of the package,

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.542
let's open up our blind bags.

00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:20.708
Let's see what we got here.

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.875
Oh, sweet, laundry soap.

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:24.500
This is Wendy Washer.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.292
She's rare and she's from the cleaning and
laundry section.

00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:30.292
The laundry soap is super cute.

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:33.333
Let's put it aside though and
open up our next blind bag.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:34.292
I love these.

00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:36.750
Hm, this feels kinda like a shoe to me.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.292
Aah, no way, it's a special edition one.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.126
It's nice an glittery, this is cute boot.

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:43.875
Oh, I love her.

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:45.042
I love that it's pink too.

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:47.252
That's my favorite color.

00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:49.077
That 12 pack was awesome and

00:02:49.077 --> 00:02:52.875
we will be opening up our giant
Play-Doh Egg in a second here.

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.875
But first, lets open up the Shopkins.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:57.000
Woot woot.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.356
I love these little blind baskets and

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:02.708
hopefully we get some more
new season two Shopkins.

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:04.125
Just got to open this thing up.

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:04.917
Come on.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:05.583
There we go.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:06.833
One, two bags.

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:08.000
Sweet.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.167
And I might as well just
tear it open right now.

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:14.250
This actually kind of feels like
the waffle that we opened up earlier.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.750
This is Waffle Sue, so
now we have two of them.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.256
So let me put Sue to the side
here really quick and

00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:22.333
let's open up our other surprise bag.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:24.500
Ooh, what could it be?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.917
I'm hoping for something, like sparkly.

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:27.958
Let's see, though.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.083
Oh, it's a shoe.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.500
I don't think I have this one yet.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.167
Oh, this is cool.

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:32.750
It's like a little sneaker.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.458
Here's both of our Waffle Sues.

00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:35.726
It's like little twins,

00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:39.833
which is kinda cute and it's crazy that we
have two of them, because they're rare.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:43.042
And this cute little shoe
is called Stinky Wedge.

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:46.607
She's common and I kinda like her,
cuz her tongue is sticking out and

00:03:46.607 --> 00:03:49.208
these are like definitely
high type of sneakers.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:51.376
They're pretty trendy, right?

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:55.125
And now, we can finally open up
our giant Play-Doh surprise.

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:55.710
Whoa!

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.708
And it's purple underneath.

00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:59.708
That's really the only color I have.

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.583
[LAUGH] So let's see what's inside.

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:06.583
Let's crack this baby open and
whoa, there it is.

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.208
Whoa, this is super full.

00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:09.167
Look at all these toys.

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:10.458
Holy cow.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:11.751
I didn't think we had so many in here.

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.000
Oh, check it out.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.500
We have Elsa Pez, blind bangs, little
Fashem, new Kinder Surprise Eggs, Rabbids.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.167
Ooh, a little blind box.

00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:22.543
This is awesome.

00:04:22.543 --> 00:04:26.875
I figure let's start by opening
up the Pez here for our Pez Elsa.

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:27.667
How cool is that?

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:28.375
I love Pez.

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:30.917
This is actually my favorite flavor too.

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:32.500
So double win.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.000
Let me just load up
a couple of these here.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.795
I think my kids would actually
really like these too.

00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:38.708
I don't know if i have given
them to them Prez before.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:40.250
So, oh, this is cool.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.708
So let's just kind of tilt
her head back and oh, yummy.

00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:44.751
Pez, let's try it out.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.500
Oh, just as good as it's always been.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.000
Gotta love it.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.875
Now let's open up some more surprises.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.167
Here's Fashems, I love these things,
they're so fun.

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:56.333
I hope I get a new one.

00:04:56.333 --> 00:05:00.083
I already have, I think at least
half of this collection here.

00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:01.043
So we just get this wrapper off.

00:05:01.043 --> 00:05:02.617
There we go.

00:05:02.617 --> 00:05:03.670
Okay. Where, where'd it go?
Oh, here it is.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.209
Oh, we have this one.

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:07.958
That's okay,
I can give it to my sister or something.

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.417
This is a cute little mouse and woo.

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:11.458
Oh, my goodness.

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:12.000
Aah!

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.250
Look at its eye.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.417
That's so funny.

00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:17.417
It's super cute though,
I love the little hands.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.375
Let's see what else.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:22.458
Oh, look we got a little sucker,
a Frozen one.

00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:24.292
And oh, let's check out this.

00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:27.625
These Minecraft boxes
have been a lot of fun.

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:32.500
We got a little blind bag inside and
this feels pretty square.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.583
So let's see who we get.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.625
Oh, we get Creeper.

00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:38.833
He's cool, just like the box.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.708
Now let's open up some more surprises.

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:42.083
Oh, Hello Kitty.

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:43.833
This is cute little Hello Kitty.

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.500
Kinder Surprise Egg.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.920
Oh, that means we get chocolate too.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.875
Oh, milk chocolate and white chocolate.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:51.376
Fabulous.

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:54.250
And we get a pink little egg inside.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.250
Let me just open it up here.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.708
Man, I always have so
much trouble with these surprise eggs.

00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:00.708
I gotta like workout my fingers or
something.

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:01.583
Come on.

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:02.625
Oh, my goodness, get open.

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:03.167
There we go.

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:04.083
Aah!

00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:05.833
Oh, this is cool, like a two for one.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.795
A little Hello Kitty.

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:08.583
Let's take a look.

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:09.667
Oh, this is adorable.

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:14.405
It's two little Hello Kitties stuck
together almost like Siamese twins or

00:06:14.405 --> 00:06:17.875
something and
they're both mermaids holding stars.

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:20.583
Ooh, I can't wait to open
up some more surprises.

00:06:20.583 --> 00:06:24.335
We got this cool little
Palace Pet blind bag.

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:26.861
These are all of the Disney
princesses pets and

00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:29.333
let me just use the scissors
to get this open.

00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:32.043
Huh, no way, that's so cute.

00:06:32.043 --> 00:06:37.184
Its a cute little pink kitty that says
princess Aurora's kitty, from sleeping

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:41.875
beauty, and you can even see a picture
of her on the blind bag right here.

00:06:41.875 --> 00:06:44.625
Now what else do we have in this pile,
a little more candy.

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:47.546
Oh, even more candy,
my kids are gonna love that.

00:06:47.546 --> 00:06:50.335
Oh, sweet.

00:06:50.335 --> 00:06:52.583
Bobble Head Marvel Superheros.

00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:54.833
I've never opened up one of these before.

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:55.667
Let's see who we get.

00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:56.542
Oh, sweet.

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:57.458
Ironman.

00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:58.250
Oh, that's cool.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.292
His head is already bobbling.

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:01.833
Wow, this works really well.

00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:04.042
I really like this.

00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:05.375
Hm, now what should we open next?

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:07.083
Ooh, let's do these little Rabbids.

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:08.417
I used to play this game a lot.

00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:10.875
[LAUGH] And oh, cut off his mouth.

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:11.958
Who do we got here though?

00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:12.667
Oh, that's cute.

00:07:12.667 --> 00:07:14.875
[LAUGH] These bunnies are really funny.

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:16.125
It should have some
accessories too though.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.583
Let's put it together.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:18.958
Here's the bunny with a frying pan.

00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.168
I don't know if I trust this bunny.

00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:23.542
He looks like he's up to no good.

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:26.917
Wow, so check out all
the awesome toys we got today.

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:32.292
A whole bunch of Shopkins and also some
pretty cool toys in our blind bags.

So, in the comments, let me know

sneaker shoe that we got.
