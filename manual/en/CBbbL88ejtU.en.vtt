Hi, I'm Susan Paxton for Expert Village. Today
we're doing a centerpiece for your dining

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:17.350
room table, specifically fresh flowers. We've
chosen our dish, we've added our foam, added

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.289
water to the dish so that the flowers will
stay fresh as we work with them. And now we

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:35.030
need to add some greens. We try to green up
the edges so that this generic little bowl

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:44.820
doesn't show. If you had a prettier bowl,
a dressier bowl, you might not want to put

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.520
as much greens because you won't need to hide
the bowl. But with this one we're going to

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:03.449
take some little scraps of greens and just
insert them into our foam to give us a good

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:17.960
base for our flowers, plus help disguise the
bowl a little bit.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:34.750
These are just tops of leather leaf fern that
we've cut off of a larger piece and we just

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:48.390
take the little arms off as we go. Trim down
the stem so there is a fresh stem each time,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:02.689
and just put as much as we can around our
bowl. It doesn't take very long but it helps

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:10.550
to have some already around the bowl, and
you can always fill in after you put the flowers,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:27.560
you can fill in empty spots with more of the
fern. We're using just regular little pruning

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:40.670
shears to trim the stems. Anything can be
used, kitchen shears, any kind of gardening

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:50.750
shears can be used to do this, you don't have
to have expensive equipment to be able to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.489
do this kind of arrangement.
