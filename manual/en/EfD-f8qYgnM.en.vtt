Hi Everyone, Last week I asked you what decals you would like to see me use in this weeks video

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:13.188
A lot of you wanted to see different ways you can use your rhinestones. And some of you wanted to see easter themed tutorials

00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:20.515
so I combined the 2 and came up with this set of super easy decal only nail design. No drawing required.

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:25.112
You just need to place everything on the nail and that's all you have to do

00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:31.860
Last week's giveaway winner and new giveaway will be announced  at the end of the video. Entry conditions in the info box below

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.010
As always apply base coat to protect your nails

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:48.615
For this design, we're going to apply the base color one nail at a time. after you paint each nail, place the decals while the base color is still wet

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:59.245
For my Index finger, I did a cute little bunny rabbit. I used a mix of half pears and rhinestones to create this design.

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:04.665
Utilising the different shapes it comes in to piece them into a picture

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:08.592
Place 2 half peals to make the head and body

00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:16.210
Then I used a couple of tear drop rhinestones for the ears

00:01:22.412 --> 00:01:26.586
and a 2mm rhinestone for the button tail

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:33.568
Since there were still some room left on the nail, I used another tear drop rhinestone to create a little carrot

00:01:33.568 --> 00:01:39.893
And some 1.5mm green rhinestone for the stems. Super Cute Right?

00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:47.350
Once everything Is done, you can either leave it as it is or dot in some eyes with a dotting tool or a nail pen

00:01:52.627 --> 00:01:58.480
For my Ring finger. I pieced together a chicken to go with the easter theme.

00:02:02.824 --> 00:02:07.240
Again use a couple of half pears for the head and body

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.820
Then use a triangle rhinestone for the beak

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.850
and 3 horse eye shaped rhinestones for the combs

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.430
The body looks like an egg. How funny :)

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.950
For the remaining nails, I did a couple more bunny shapes with different colored ears

00:02:41.622 --> 00:02:48.880
And also made a little cabage using a horse eye rhinestone and 3 green heart shaped rhinestones

00:02:57.988 --> 00:03:03.120
When your done, apply top coat over all the decals to secure them in place and that's it

00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:07.556
