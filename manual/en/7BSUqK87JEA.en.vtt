00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.369
All I ever do is explain.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.830
But there's apparently no time for that.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.240
Okay.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.240
Just kidding.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.430
I am, after all, contractually obligated to
ramble on about pointless crap that never

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.850
really makes sense at first.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.560
(I like to think I'm rather good at it.)

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.870
In that respect, No Time to Explain should
be right up my alley.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.650
You bust into your own house (through the
wall, in a dramatic fashion, of course), inform

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.280
you that you're you from your future, where
OH CHRIST GIANT ENEMY CRAB.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.829
And then you're left to pick up the huge-ass
ray gun from the future and attempt to save

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.120
you from said giant crab, by travelling through
a series of time-space warps and eventually

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.930
having to fight off a huge spaceship firing
energy beams and missiles and whatnot.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:09.130
Fortunately, that huge-ass ray gun helps even
the score a bit.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.300
No Time to Explain is, at its core, all about
playing with physics.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.450
Your huge-ass ray gun serves two purposes:
to destroy obstacles and, most importantly,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.810
to provide thrust for new-age rocket-jumping
shenanigans.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.710
Having nailed down the physics, the rest of
the game is about platforming, getting from

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.740
point A to point B in one piece.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.310
(And maybe collecting some hats along the
way, because it's Steam so obviously hats.)

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.020
This will require combinations of running,
jumping, and thrusting, and potentially blowing

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.420
up obstacles or boring out a path, all while
you (not you you, other you you) screams out

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.490
mildly entertaining interjections, much like...
well, like a dude being gnawed on by shark

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.110
or absconded with by a giant enemy crab.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.210
It's... mildly entertaining, and often veers
into the absurd, but can quickly get to repeating

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.050
if you're having trouble with a certain chunk
of terrain.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:09.750
And... well, let's say I had trouble with
a certain chunk of terrain.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.700
No Time to Explain started out as a Flash
game, and besides the kind of minimalist graphical

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.970
style, it certainly shows in the controls.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.209
You move with the directional buttons, while
aiming and firing your laser is on the mouse.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.510
Which is fine for the majority of gamers,
but...

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.010
I'm on a laptop.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.820
Don't get me wrong, this laptop's pretty boss
for pumping out games, but No Time to Explain's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.450
controls kinda fall on their face when you're
using a cramped combination of tiny D-keys

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.860
and a touchpad.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.830
And unfortunately, there's no way to use an
actual joystick or repurposed controller.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.290
Presumably, this very issue will be taken
care of when the game makes its XBox debut

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.380
in the future, but for now kinda feels like
delicious fruit, JUST out of reach, through

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.560
no fault of my own.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.239
Still, for the frustration, it was a refreshing
romp through ADD-riddled stages, occasionally

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.260
switching up the mechanics like using explosions
instead of a continuous beam or, adding underwater

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.260
segments.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.950
Guess I'm actually going to have to use a...
guh... a MOUSE to get the most out of this

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.950
one.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.950
Man.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.530
Thought I was done with those.
