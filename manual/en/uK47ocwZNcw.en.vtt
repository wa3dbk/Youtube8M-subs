Hello, my name is Carolyn Dean, drcarolyndean.com.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.920
I'm a medical doctor and a naturopathic doctor
and I live in beautiful Maui.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.710
I've finished my 22nd health book, I have
a free newsletter and I also have an online

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.860
wellness program that you can join.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.950
And today in this series I'll be talking about
dieting.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:34.170
The Paleo, or Cavemen Diet, I do have to laugh,
because cavemen normally lived to be about

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.850
25 or 30 years old, so it can't pass as a
longevity diet from that standpoint, but there

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.719
are so many good factors about this diet.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.519
The premise is, and the main component is
Dr. Loren Cordain, he has a Ph.D. in health

00:00:51.519 --> 00:01:00.339
and exercise, and he's found with his research
that the digestion of our ancestors has not

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:08.090
changed from the time that they were eating
wild animals and picking berries, and he's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.810
proposed in a lot of his research and it's
been proven out that it can take away conditions

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.340
such as acne for example, and arthritis, and
some heart disease.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.609
By the use of a diet that focuses on high
animal proteain, moderate carbohydrates and

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.270
moderate fat.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.200
But it does exclude grains, and it does exclude
dairy.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.090
So it means a very restricted diet in some
terms.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.390
Dieticians are very critical of this diet,
but Cordain's view is that our digestive system

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.940
has not adjusted to grains and dairy, and
they may be the reason why so many people

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.229
have heart disease and arthritis and acne
and other problems.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.499
So for people with an O blood type, this might
be the best diet for you.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:10.800
There are people, A's, AB's, and B's, you'll
have to be very careful if you focus on a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.390
heavy, high protein diet.
