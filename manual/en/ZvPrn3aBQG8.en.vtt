00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Newton's Second Law of Motion.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.000
The royal king invites you to join the Grand Science Festival.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:17.300
Newton's Second law states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the unbalanced force in the direction of force.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000
Therefore, F is directly proportional to ma.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.500
Force applied by Newton causes the rock to move only slightly.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.500
Why don't you try to move the rock?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.400
Force applied by the horse causes the rock to move a greater distance.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Newton applies less force, less acceleration is produced.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Horse applies more force, more acceleration is produced.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Hence, force is proportional to acceleration.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Mass of Newton is less, therefore applied force is less.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.700
Mass of horse is more, therefore applied force is more.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:37.000
Therefore, force is directly proportional to mass.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Force is directly proportional to mass.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.800
Force is directly proportional to acceleration.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.300
Hence, force is directly proportional to the product of mass and acceleration.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.300
The End.
