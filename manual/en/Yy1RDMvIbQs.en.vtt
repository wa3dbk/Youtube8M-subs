00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:08.189
Shoulder pain is a very common complaint responsible
for millions of doctor visits each year.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.610
After back pain, it's the second most common
musculoskeletal complaint.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.830
Shoulder pain can result from literally hundreds
of causes.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.190
Nerves are ultimately responsible for signaling
pain, and the shoulder is surrounded by a

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.230
rich network of nerves.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.250
Many are on their way to other sites in the
body.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.860
Sometimes pain or injury in one area of the
body is actually felt in another area.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.610
This is sometimes called referred pain.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.430
Successful treatment of shoulder pain really
depends on identifying the cause of your shoulder

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.430
pain.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.270
In other words, an accurate diagnosis is the
most important thing.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.219
Pain in this anterior chest area certainly
can have referred pain from heart, lungs,

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.340
or GI tract.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.350
Certainly cervical issues can be referred
to this region as well.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.170
Typically, shoulder mediated pain does not
refer to the anterior chest wall itself.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.580
Once we take away the pectoralis major tendon
we also see the pectoralis minor and also

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.450
see a significant number of nerves that are
coming out of the cervical spine traveling

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:36.130
behind the collar bone or clavicle on their
way down the arm along the chest wall.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.450
So it's easy to imagine that pain in this
region can result from referred pain from

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.340
this rich network of nerves traveling behind
the coracoid and pectoralis minor.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.630
Tightness of the pectoralis minor can also
result in shoulder impingement.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.630
Typically, impingement pain is in this anterior
anterolateral area.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.609
But the most common cause of pain in this
region in many patients' and physicians' perception

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:18.709
is the rotator cuff.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:26.280
Here we see the anterolateral area after the
deltoid has been taken away, and we see the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.340
supraspinatus portion of the rotator cuff.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:43.400
The CA ligament which stands for coracoacromial
ligament, and this is a very important ligament

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.030
as it completes the circle of the shoulder.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.239
This ligament is also not apparent on an X-ray,
and when bone ossification of this ligament

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:03.680
occurs, this typically is called a spur because
that point appears to be out in space digging

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.349
into the rotator cuff which actually is a
misnomer.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.359
Anterior shoulder pain where the biceps goes
for a lot of people means biceps mediated

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:23.079
pain, but again this is a very nonspecific
area of pain and a lot of different causes

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.730
can be referred here.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.109
We can see a significant number of nerves
passing by the area of the biceps on their

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.269
way down the arm.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.849
And again, cervically mediated pain can be
referred here, pain from other chest wall

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:48.030
abnormalities, and certainly shoulder pathology
itself can also be referred as anterior shoulder

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.919
pain.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:56.180
The other part that can result in interior
shoulder pain is a problem with the subscapularis

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.089
which is the hidden part of the rotator cuff
because it's so often missed.

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:08.869
Occult shoulder instability can also present
primarily as anterior shoulder pain.

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:14.689
As we move on to the posterior aspect of the
rotator cuff here we see the infraspinatus

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:21.109
and the teres minor, and typically, pathology
here will result in posterior shoulder pain.

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:29.990
Again, posterior shoulder pain has a lot of
different causes, tightness, muscular strain,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.949
referred pain again from the cervical spine,
also referred pain in this region can come

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:47.150
from a pinched nerve in the shoulder like
the suprascapular nerve.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.810
Again we see a significant number of deeper
muscles connecting the shoulder girdle to

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.810
the remainder of the skeleton and a strain
or sprain in any of these can result in pain

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:08.889
in the upper back and posterior shoulder.

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.180
So it's important to see that the shoulder
girdle fits within the overall skeletal system

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.789
and you can imagine if there's abnormal curvature
of the thoracic spine that might make the

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:29.650
shoulder blade tilt forward further creating
impingement and shoulder pain.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.379
So it's important to evaluate all of these
things and any evaluation of the shoulder

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:42.900
includes movement of the shoulder blade and
overall mobility and balance of the muscles

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.819
anterior and posterior.

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:54.919
We come back to the CA ligament which I mentioned
is a very important structure because it completes

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:03.910
the circle and also limits anterior superior
migration of the humeral head.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:15.009
So when we evaluate shoulder pain or see ossification
of the CA ligament we really have to ask why

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.900
is the humeral head moving abnormally.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.970
What's causing weakness of the rotator cuff?

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.979
Is there occult instability?

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.500
Is there a nerve problem?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.410
Is there a rotator cuff tear?

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.030
Is there a labrum tear?

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.800
Resistant shoulder pain especially after a
previously failed shoulder surgery requires

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.229
a thoughtful comprehensive evaluation.
