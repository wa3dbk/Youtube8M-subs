00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.140
[Intro music]

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.310
[Intro music]

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.410
Assalaamu Alaikum and welcome to Titli's Busy
Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.070
You know how much I love strong taste in food

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.020
but Vietnamese Bo Kho is something else.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.720
Do make sure you get a license from the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.929
International Atomic Energy Authority before
you start this recipe, OK?

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.130
I hope I can survive the fumes long enough
to tell you that I've got

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.310
500 g of beef, cut up into bite-size pieces.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.610
3 chopped shallots.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.300
1 small onion that I've halved and then cut
into very thin slices.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.080
Some soy sauce, some nước mắm (nuoc mam)
sauce which is a fish sauce.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.890
A bunch of basil.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.040
Fresh basil.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.960
2 red chillies that I've chopped into pieces.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.500
3 cloves of garlic.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.210
Here I've got a tablespoon of ready prepared
lemon grass.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.689
It's better if you can get fresh lemon grass
and if you can

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.850
use 2 stalks, bruise them and chop them.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.980
1 tablespoon of turmeric.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.600
1 tablespoon of curry powder.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.630
1 tablespoon of brown sugar.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.080
4 star anise.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.070
A beef stock cube.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.360
*cough*

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.300
First thing I have to do is dry-roast the
star anise in a small pan

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.500
over a high heat for about 5 minutes.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.551
Then when cooled, grind them in a coffee grinder.

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:47.320
Then when cooled, grind them in a coffee grinder.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.320
Super.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.990
With the beef in a large bowl, add the turmeric

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.640
and mix.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.409
Put it to one side for about half an hour.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.880
In the pan I've got 2 tablespoons of sesame
oil.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.299
If you can't get sesame oil just ordinary
vegetable oil is fine.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.099
Add in the shallots,

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.900
Add in the shallots,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.300
the garlic,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.700
the garlic,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.209
the lemon grass

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.069
the lemon grass

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.140
and the chillies.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.660
and the chillies.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.080
Stir these around for a couple of minutes.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.230
Now add in the curry powder.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.090
Most but not all of the star anise.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.030
Keep a little bit back

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.020
and the beef.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.739
and the beef.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.580
Once the beef is browned,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.340
add in 700 ml of beef stock.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.020
3 tablespoons of nước mắm sauce,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.970
2 tablespoons of soy sauce

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.209
2 tablespoons of soy sauce

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.819
and the sugar.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.240
and the sugar.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.900
Bring it back to the boil,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.050
turn the heat right down and let it simmer
gently for 45 minutes.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.800
turn the heat right down and let it simmer
gently for 45 minutes.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.270
In fact I ended up cooking this for an hour
and a half

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.629
because the beef wasn't quite tender enough

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.739
which you can see it has gone to a beautiful
thick gravy.

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.459
Now I'm gonna add in the basil

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.220
Now I'm gonna add in the basil

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.490
and the remaining star anise.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.030
Mix it altogether

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.430
and transfer to a serving bowl.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.120
Garnish with thinly sliced onions and serve
with sticky rice

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.670
or a baguette.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.680
That will seem to pass off without incident.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.519
Bo Kho is a really intensely-flavoured dish.

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.280
I'm just gonna sneak a little bite.
