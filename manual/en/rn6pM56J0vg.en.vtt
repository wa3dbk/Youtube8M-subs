Hi, my name is Franck and

00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:12.763
 I am a scientist at EFSA,
working in the area

00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:14.945
of animal health and welfare.

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:18.225
Today I am going to talk to you
about animal-based indicators.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:22.636
A very specific aspect of our
work related to animal welfare.

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:25.880
But before I do that
I would just like

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:28.080
to briefly explain how
an organisation like

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.506
EFSA that deals primarily
with food safety

00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:34.087
has a role to play in animal welfare.

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:37.587
Well, in fact the answer to
this question is quite simple.

00:00:37.588 --> 00:00:41.062
We know that the safety of
our food chain can be

00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:44.488
indirectly affected by
the welfare of animals.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.084
This is because stress, injuries 
and poor welfare all together

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:51.780
can lead to infectious 
diseases  among animals,

00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:54.850
some of them being 
food-borne to consumers.

00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:58.178
One example of how 
animal welfare

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.678
might affect the food safety is
tail biting among pigs.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.178
This is a major welfare
issue on pig farms

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:10.679
and it is also a risk factor 
of increasing

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.961
the frequency of abscesses 
and infections in carcasses.

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:16.999
If you remember earlier 
I said I wanted to talk to you about

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.650
animal-based indicators; 
what are they and why are they so important?

00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:26.301
 ‘Animal-based indicators’
is a term used by scientists

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:29.419
 to describe the way in
which the welfare of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.501
an animal is measured, but
in fact it is a very basic concept

00:01:33.502 --> 00:01:37.940
and something we are probably 
all familiar with in our daily lives.

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:41.313
For example, when you measure your
body temperature you do this

00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:44.881
in the knowledge that 
this is a good indication of fever.

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:48.723
The same principle can also 
be applied by scientists

00:01:48.723 --> 00:01:51.223
when they assess 
the welfare of animals.

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.146
The challenge, and this 
is where EFSA plays

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:58.435
 an important role, comes
 in finding the most effective indicator,

00:01:58.436 --> 00:02:02.893
 or combination of indicators for
what we are trying to measure.

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:06.503
Now let's go back to our
example – tail biting.

00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:12.390
We know that this is an indicator of
poor welfare, but it is not very specific

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:14.719
because many different
factors can lead to tail

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.696
biting, making it
difficult to tell exactly

00:02:17.697 --> 00:02:20.552
what is affecting the pig’s welfare.

00:02:20.553 --> 00:02:24.239
And so, in all fairness, 
it may reflect only part

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.391
of the factors influencing
the pig’s welfare.

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:30.782
However, tail biting may
become an effective

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:34.554
indicator when it is combined
with other indicators.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:36.766
Taken together
they are likely to give

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.095
a fair overall assessment
of the welfare of the pig.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:43.333
This aspect of EFSA's
work reflects

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:46.812
a shift in the way in
which scientists

00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:50.793
also policymakers in Europe 
are considering animal welfare assessment.

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:55.571
It is a move away from a 
system that measures the environment

00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:59.792
in which the animal lives
– such as access to

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:03.257
water or food, or housing
– towards a system

00:03:03.258 --> 00:03:07.582
that will measure how the animal
itself will respond to the environment.

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:12.903
It is hoped that this will lead 
to a more effective and efficient

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:15.151
way of assessing animal
welfare, whatever

00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:16.283
farming system is used.

00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:20.337
EFSA’s advice in this area
 is designed to support the work

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:23.088
of the European Commission and
come soon after the launch

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:27.349
of the EU animal welfare
strategy 2012-2015.
