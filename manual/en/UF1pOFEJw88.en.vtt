[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.510
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.490
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.590
And today I'm here with Ryland.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.010
And of course, you
guys all know Brady.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.960
Now it's almost
Valentine's Day, so we're

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.760
going to do another
Valentine's hairdo.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.600
And we're calling this
one the CGH accent heart.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.670
You can see that Brady
even has a little accent

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.460
heart on his little rump.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.609
Poor baby, it's almost
Valentine's Day.

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.150

SO you subscribe to our channel.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.080
And now to begin this
hairstyle what I'm going to do

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.110
is take a little
section, just right here

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.240
on the side of her head.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.244
I'm doing it on the light
side of her part line,

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:52.410
because I think it just a
falls a little bit better.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.076
But I'm just kind of
making a rectangle.

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:56.100
And it doesn't have
to be exact here.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.310
It can just be close.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.019
And grab an elastic, just
a little clear elastic.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.310
And I'm going put that
elastic in right--

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.530
not totally cinched
down against the head,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.780
but just towards
the top of the head.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.224
And I don't want
the elastic in--

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:16.598
like can you see
how I still have

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:17.847
a little give in that elastic?

00:01:17.847 --> 00:01:19.620
That's how I want it to be.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.550
So you can see that I've made
kind of my rectangle shape.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.720
I'm going to pull this
down just a tidge,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.050
so that it's nice and relaxed.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.292
Now, I'm going to separate
this into three parts.

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:31.125
And there are going to
be three equal parts.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.597
So that feels about right to me.

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:37.805
And you can use a clip to
secure them out of the way.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.470
Or just have her hold one.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.250
I'm going to be working with
this right one on the far right

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.850
now.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.050
And I just going to do a
braid, just a regular three

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.660
strand braid.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.165
Just quick as you
can do a braid.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.830
When you get to the end
of each of the braids,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.666
go ahead and secure
it with an elastic.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.582
It's a little trickier
towards the ends here.

00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:10.509
Hang on.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.830
OK, so again, putting
the elastic in.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.072
And repeat this process till
all three of them are braided.

00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:23.870
I'm going to take rat tail comb.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.680
That's a comb with this
metal piece right here.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.070
And I'm just going to grab the
edge of the elastic like this.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.190
Now taking that
rightmost piece, I'm

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.242
going to flip it up and tuck
it back through that elastic.

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:38.990
See how I'm doing that.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.970
And then I'm going to go using
the same part of the elastic,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.480
just to the left side
now, and pull it open

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.590
and go ahead and tuck
the left side in.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.120
I'm going to switch to my--
this is not how I'm handed.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.170
Normally, I'm right handed
so this is awkward for me.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.240
But you can that I'm taking it
through and then pulling it up.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.195
So you just pull
it up, both sides.

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:04.720
I'm going to pull
them way up till it's

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.832
almost to the top of
that elastic, the loops.

00:03:08.832 --> 00:03:10.290
And you can see
that it's beginning

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.770
to form that arch that
we want with the heart.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.380
Now, you don't have to
use a third piece on this.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.600
We are doing it because it
really helps that gravity not

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.104
pull the heart down and get all
saggy by the end of the day.

00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:24.770
If you have that third piece, it
stays really pretty and formed.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.280
That's why we're using
that middle strand.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.620
So you take another elastic,
take it, form your heart.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.213
I don't want a huge
one so I'm just

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.650
going to do a half
heart right here.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.570
And go ahead and secure
it with an elastic.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.400
OK, there you have your heart.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.590
Now, the fun thing
about doing this style

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.400
with that middle
strand too is that you

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.020
go like this and kind
of pull and bunch.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.340
And it's going to give you that
really immaculate heart shape.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.750
So I'm just going to go until I
have that heart shape I really,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.840
that perfect, beautiful heart.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.170
And then when you get it
done, you can go ahead

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.754
and just released these ends.

00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:16.990
All three of them, and undo
the braid that you don't need.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.690
And you have, just blending
right into the hair,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.354
with this cute
little accent heart

00:04:22.354 --> 00:04:23.932
that's so perfectly shaped.

00:04:23.932 --> 00:04:26.140
And if you want, you could
put a little red of ribbon

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.990
or a white little
lace bow or something

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.960
to just kind of
accent that even more.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.880
OK, let's do the final spin.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.380
You can see this is a great
one for short hairstyles,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.860
like Rolando's.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.550
There you go.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.610
And there's just the
cute accent heart.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.948
Now to show you a different
version, we have Kamri.

00:04:44.948 --> 00:04:47.090
Here Kams.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.940
And her hair's obviously
longer, so on her hair

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.110
we did two accent hearts.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.520
You can see one, two.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.741
And then we just pulled it all
the way back into a faux fish

00:04:57.741 --> 00:04:58.240
tale.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.180
So this is a really fun version
if you have a little bit longer

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.250
hair to really play
around with this style

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.490
and find lots of
creative ways to use it.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.948
Be sure to give
this video a thumbs

-Bye.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.409
-And you can see that we have
our first heart in the hair.

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.200
Now, I'm just going to
go back and continue

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.926
repeating these steps down
through the center of her head.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.360
-Today I'm here with my
special friend, Jill Ehat.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.914
-Hi, guys.

00:05:44.914 --> 00:05:47.080
-So Jill and I have know
each other for a long time.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.020
We lived by each
other for awhile.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.350
And what else?

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.550
We have--

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.130
-Twins.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.930
-Twins.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.460
In fact, you guys saw her twins
in our Tinkerbell hairstyle

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.570
over on the Disney
style channel we did.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.320
They're such adorable
little girls.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.980
They these gorgeous
heads of blonde hair

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.250
that are just so cute.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.460
We wanted to just introduce
you guys formally to Jill

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.314
because you may see her
popping up on our channels

00:06:10.314 --> 00:06:11.219
once in a while.

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.718
-Hey.

00:06:11.718 --> 00:06:14.150
-Yay, Jill does

like sports, dance,
gymnastics, that kind of stuff.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.860
And her girls, their beautiful
blonde hair, but you guys

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.770

work with thinner hair

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.431
and like more fine hair.

00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:28.180
-Like baby's hair.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.230
-And that's exactly
what her girls are.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.440
And so, yeah, we just
