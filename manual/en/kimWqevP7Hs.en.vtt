00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.640
Here are some tips on what you can consider
in advance for your breast cancer surgery.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:16.390
So, a lot of times patients ask me what can
I do to prepare for surgery and it can really

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.550
depend on what you feel comfortable doing,
so I always say the #1 thing is to come in

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.072
healthy, so eat well, continue to exercise
and just live well so that you are in the

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:32.110
healthiest state beforehand, so you can heal
well after your surgery.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.060
The days leading up to your surgery, it's
important to keep good contacts with your

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.750
families and friends because you want to have
the best support system possible going in.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.440
It's a lot to go through on your own, so make
sure you keep good contacts with all the people

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.960
around you and then the night before your
surgery, there are some general things that

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.780
the nurse will probably go over with you including
nothing to eat or drink after midnight, make

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.460
sure you get some good rest and review all
of your medications with your surgeon beforehand,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.720
so you know which medications you can take
that morning of surgery and which ones you

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.710
should avoid taking.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.109
When you go to the hospital in preparation
for your surgery, it is a good idea that just

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:15.280
bring a book, bring a friend, have something
to keep your mind off of the procedure, so

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.170
that you are as comfortable and as calm as
possible.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.140
Some people will even bring some music with
them so that they can listen to it through

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.229
headphones as they are being put to sleep
by the anesthesiologist and that's a nice

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.540
way to meditate and relax and be calm as you
are falling asleep so that you are just as

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.369
comfortable as possible.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:46.420
