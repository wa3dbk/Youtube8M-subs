00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.360
For Expert Village this is Mitch Kaplan. In
this segment, we will be talking about the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.930
diatonic scales and how they are connected
and how you would improvise using them. The

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:33.770
first section that we would talk about is,
we would take the major scale, your C major

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:51.600
scale, again using C, D, E, F, G, A, B and
then C. Now what we do is again, we take the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.879
every other note just like what we did before,
we built the chords, we talked about our major,

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.309
we talked about our minor, our dominant and
half diminished. Well now, we are going to

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:14.300
see how that relates to the major scale. So
we have our one, three, five and seven, now

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:25.180
what we are going to do is just move up one
step at a time and with our keeping our hands

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:35.189
as exactly the same on the keyboard and what
this does is this produces the diatonic scale

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.979
going every other note. The first one, we
actually have our major seven. It is also

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:52.360
called the one major seven chord. The next
one, moving up one, keeping our fingers every

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:03.240
other step, we would create the minor seven
and this is called the two minor seven. It

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:12.320
is comprised of D, F natural, A and C natural.
In a D major scale you would have F sharp

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:22.390
and C sharp but because we keep it in consistent
with the major scale of the C, we created

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:33.590
a minor seven pattern. Moving up one major
step, we now have a minor seven. This is called

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:43.060
the three minor seven chord and what we do
is, again we start with the E. Now if we were

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:53.250
to have an E major scale, we would have four
sharps F, C, G and D but because this is consistent

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.030
again with the C major scale, we now have
what is known as the three minor seven chord

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:14.180
and it is a sadder sounding chord again and
this what it sounds like. So we use our E,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.769
our G natural, our B and our D.
