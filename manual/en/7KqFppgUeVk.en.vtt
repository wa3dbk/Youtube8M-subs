00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.440
What? Ah man! I can't take them all alone!
I'm gonna need some reinforcements.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.680
I know... I'll use this camera to record a video of me calling for reinforcements, just like sending a distress signal to call for backup!

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.600
Once I send this, then my friends will come to my aid and they'll save me!

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:13.880
And once they've defeated the rest of the minions here, I shall thank my friends and help them defeat Ronald McDonald!

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.480
Ah, there! we go! Well here goes nothing!

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.100
It sure is boring around here!

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.120
Wii!

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.900
I use rocket launcher!

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.980
See!

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.480
Hamburgers!

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.580
Kiss!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.940
I wonder what's for dinner?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.280
I use powerpunch!

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.920
Faces of Evil!

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.620
Milkshakes!

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.300
Die!

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.380
It buuuuuuurns!

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.300
No!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.180
Bloody sh*t!

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.920
Die!

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.200
We won!

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.660
Well done everyone! Ronald McDonald and his minions die!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.360
Come! Look, already America is returning to harmony!

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.940
The birds are crapping, isn't it
beautiful?

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.880
Huh?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.360
Look here comes Mario brothers!

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.200
What happened?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.500
Heheheh... nothing, we were
just about to have Burger King hamburgers for dinner!

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.120
Great!

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.140
HWOAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
