00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:01.741
- Hi everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley,

00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:03.935
and first of all, I am so
glad you're spending your

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:05.357
moment with me.

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:08.019
This is gonna be a few
minutes of just us time.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.031
It's just for us, OK.

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.062
Number two, I just wanna say,

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.643
you look incredible today.

00:00:14.643 --> 00:00:18.360
And number three, I asked you
guys to submit some dares,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.002
and I dare you to watch this video.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:21.997
Let's go.

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:24.699
Darya says, "Leak Troye's album."

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:25.837
OK.

00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:27.239
Troye might be mad at me.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.339
You guys know Troye Sivan.

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:29.941
He creates incredible music.

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.846
But would you guys wanna hear a preview?

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:34.065
I haven't asked him if I could play it,

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.118
but I guess I could just play it for you.

00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:37.154
You want that?

00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:38.474
Hold on.

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:40.018
Ready?

00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:40.811
He might kill me.

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.550
Don't kill me, Troye,
but here, OK, listen.

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:48.506
("Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley)

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:56.625
Man, Troye, this sounds like a banger.

00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:00.018
OK, Sid says to give you
guys a preview of "Binge".

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:03.716
And I actually just got
the first physical copy

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:05.362
of the book, my book that I wrote,

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:06.196
it's called "Binge".

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:09.283
This is literally the
first edition of my book.

00:01:09.283 --> 00:01:10.766
And I'm gonna through every single page

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.269
and figure out like, "Oh
this needs to be like

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:13.123
"moved down here,

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:14.484
"or this needs to be
like a little bit bigger,

00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:16.597
"or this like picture needs
to be a little bit something,

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:17.430
"or something that'll look good."

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.015
So I'm going through this book right now.

00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:20.620
I'm going page by page.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.509
This is like the biggest,
most intense thing

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:23.505
I've ever worked on.

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:24.907
If you haven't pre-ordered it yet,

00:01:24.907 --> 00:01:25.841
it's half off right now.

00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:26.938
Go to tyleroakleybook.com.

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:28.178
But this is my book.

00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:30.006
Like you guys just wanted
like a little preview,

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.103
this is the whole thing.

00:01:31.103 --> 00:01:32.383
This is my book.

00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:33.541
It's fucking heavy.

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.532
And honestly I am so excited
for you guys to read it.

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:38.885
I was going through it with
Joey last night, Joey Graceffa,

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:40.754
and I was like going chapter by chapter,

00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:42.623
and he was screaming at
some of the pictures,

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:44.492
and screaming at some
of the chapter names.

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:45.752
And some of it he was like,

00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:47.763
"You are not writing about that."

00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:50.201
I was like, "Why would I not?"

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.883
Crustyoakley says, "I dare
you to promote Audible."

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:54.061
OK.

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.134
So you guys know, I recommend
a new book every single month,

00:01:56.134 --> 00:01:59.242
and this month I am
recommending on audible.com,

00:01:59.242 --> 00:02:00.888
if you use audible.com/tyleroakley

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.107
you get your first book free.

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:04.606
This month I am recommending
"Intimacy Idiot",

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:06.902
which I have a physical
copy of, one second,

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:07.775
here it is.

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:09.015
It's by Isaac Oliver.

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:11.453
I read it, I loved it.

00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:14.378
It's got a Ken doll
peeping through a hole.

00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:15.557
It is so funny.

00:02:15.557 --> 00:02:16.918
I absolutely loved it.

00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:18.279
And you know when you read a book

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.454
and you're like, "I feel like
this would be so much better

00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:22.728
"hearing it from the person writing it."

00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:24.495
I feel like this would be
a great book to listen to

00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:25.207
the audio book of.

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:26.934
So if you want this
book or any other book,

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:29.169

downloadable titles,

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:30.712

00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:32.602
and get your first book free.

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:35.141
OK, so this next dare I
need somebody in the room.

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:37.600
Korey, come here.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.239
- [Korey] (mumbling)

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.619
- I was dared to hug you.

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:40.734
Come hug me.

00:02:41.874 --> 00:02:43.317
- [Korey] I was doing the--

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:44.211
- And to slap you!

00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:45.552
(screams)

00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:47.096
(laughs)
- [Korey] Did they really?

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:48.985
- Yeah, "I dare you to hug
someone and slap them."

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:50.188
- [Korey] That's so rude!

00:02:50.188 --> 00:02:51.550
- Oh my God, get outta here!

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.484
- Who's the bitch?

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:53.277
Andrea.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:54.821
- (gasps) You can't call Andrea that.

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:56.264
- She got me slapped.

00:02:56.264 --> 00:02:57.503
- We love you Andrea.

00:02:57.503 --> 00:02:59.148
- [Korey] That's a dirty dog dare.

00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:00.389
- I'm sorry.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.944
OK, so Jillian dares me to
prank call Ben J. Pierce.

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:05.568
OK, I'm gonna do it.

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:06.726
I've never prank called somebody.

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:08.474
And I hate when YouTubers prank call me,

00:03:08.474 --> 00:03:10.871
so I feel very hypocritical right now,

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.192
but let me call him.

00:03:13.412 --> 00:03:14.724
What am I gonna say?

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:18.876
I guess I can have him see
if he'll delete the video,

00:03:18.876 --> 00:03:20.989
which is, here I'll tell you in a second.

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:23.594
- [Ben] Hello?

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:26.215
- Benny.
- [Ben] Hi!

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:28.110
- Hi, are you busy?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.538
- [Ben] I can be free, what's up?

00:03:31.538 --> 00:03:36.028
- So, I'm doing like a dare
Tyler video later today.

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.974
I was gonna ask you, I'll call you later,

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:40.681
you might get a dare from me later.

00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:41.798
Is that OK?

00:03:41.798 --> 00:03:43.364
- [Ben] Yeah, yeah, OK.

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:46.902
- But while I have you on the
phone, I meant to ask you,

00:03:46.902 --> 00:03:50.637
so there's a part in the
video you just uploaded.

00:03:51.717 --> 00:03:52.749
- [Ben] Hmm hmm.

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.898
- There's a part where, like, OK,

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:57.279
you're gonna think this is stupid--

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.637
- [Ben] (laughs) OK.

00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:02.432
- But I feel like it's not flattering,

00:04:02.432 --> 00:04:05.400
like it's like a bad angle.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.654
Is there, like I know
this is gonna sound dumb,

00:04:07.654 --> 00:04:09.584
'cause like I just saw
.gifs of it on Tumblr,

00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:12.002
so I was like, "OK,
that looks really bad."

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.399
Is there anyway you could like delete it,

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.855
and edit it, and re-upload it?

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:21.490
And I'll send you like
the time stamp to delete.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.354
- [Ben] Yeah, I mean, you could,

00:04:24.354 --> 00:04:26.102
yeah I mean, it's not like,

00:04:26.102 --> 00:04:28.743
I could just copy and recover.

00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:32.705
- OK, so it's just like a minute of it.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:33.782
That would be fine?

00:04:33.782 --> 00:04:35.610
- [Ben] Yeah, yeah, totally.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.585
Just like send it to me.

00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:38.129
I can do it.

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.878
- OK cool, well I'll call you later today,

00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:42.477
I think during the,

00:04:42.477 --> 00:04:44.103
I'll text you before I prank you

00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:45.992
so you'll know when it's coming, OK?

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:48.471
- [Ben] OK, cool.

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:49.649
- Thank you.

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:51.945
- [Ben] (laughs) Bye.

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:53.754
- Wait, Ben, I'm kidding.

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:54.811
That was the prank.

00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:56.619
(laughs)

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:58.671
- [Ben] Oh, (laughs).

00:04:58.671 --> 00:04:59.625
Goodbye.

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:01.983
- Oh my God, wait, he's so nice.

00:05:01.983 --> 00:05:04.988
So we just filmed the collab
over on his YouTube channel.

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:08.178
Mari says, "Kiss the
closest thing to you."

00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:10.433
Well besides the book that I just promoed,

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:13.156
I guess I could just (laughs),

00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:15.370
don't ask me why I still have this

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.525
and why it's out in my living room.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.558
But, hello.

00:05:20.348 --> 00:05:21.019
(kiss)

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:22.197
(laughs)

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.919
Immy wants me to drink
a shot of lemon juice.

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.910
And I don't have lemon
juice, but I have lime juice.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.613
And I'm kinda concerned
because it doesn't have,

00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:32.335
like the expiration date
doesn't have a year,

00:05:32.335 --> 00:05:34.347
and I've lived here for a couple years,

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:35.687
so (laughing) I don't know.

00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:38.044
It says January 14th,
is that like next year,

00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:39.565
this year, the year before?

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:41.759
We'll see.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.480
Oh my God, wait.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.119
(burps)

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:52.721
I'm not even joking,
that is the tartest shit.

00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:54.124
And I think I have it cut in my mouth,

00:05:54.124 --> 00:05:56.236
and I think I sprayed the cut.

00:05:56.236 --> 00:05:56.927
I'm not joking.

00:05:56.927 --> 00:05:58.979
(laughing) Like, I could cry.

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.579
Stevie says to make out with a hot dog.

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:04.126
This is very mean girls, but.

00:06:05.236 --> 00:06:08.020
I don't want you to watch me, Korey.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.478
This is intimate.

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:12.225
Get out! (laughs)

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:14.359
- [Korey] I'm gonna
watch it on your channel.

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:15.720
- Oh thank you.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.991
(laughs)

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:20.349
Like with tongue?

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:22.181
No!

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:24.781
(laughs)

00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:26.264
(laughing) I can't!

00:06:26.264 --> 00:06:28.511
Oh, maybe the hot dog
will be their tongue.

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:32.603
(laughs)

00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:36.955

00:06:54.058 --> 00:06:55.530
Love you. Later.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.511
Deuces.

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.742
Mercy, mercy, boy.

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:03.627
It hurt.

00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:04.238
- [Korey] I believe it.

00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:04.846
- It hurt me.

00:07:04.846 --> 00:07:05.740
- [Korey] I have two canker sores.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.825
I'm not doing it.

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:09.953
I'm not doing it, you can't
make me! (Tyler laughs)
