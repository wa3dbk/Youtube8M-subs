Hi this is Emily Larew and in this segment
we're going to work on shoulder isolations

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.950
with the lower body moving back and forth.
So let's start with our feet. What you're

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.980
going to do is we're going to move side to
side. So we are going to start going to the

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.380
right using you're right leg we're going to
out together, out, in. Alright let's try that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.369
again, five, six, seven, eight. So you've
got right together right in. And you want

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.329
to just push off the balls of your feet you
don't want to go taking a step taking a step

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.340
and keeping your body even, you want to lean
over that right leg. So ready, five, six,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.770
seven, from the gap. One and two and let's
go to the left we're going to go out together,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:54.280
out together. So let's put them together five,
six, seven, from the gap one and two and three

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.100
and four, do it again five and six and seven
and eight. So I'm nice and light on the balls

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.450
of my feet and keeping my knees bent. Now
let's try, add the shoulder with it. We can

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.009
do this in a variety of different ways I'm
going to do a roll first and then I can do

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.950
a sharp movement as well. So we're going to
do the opposite shoulder with our foot. We

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:29.049
go roll two, three four, five, six, seven,
eight. So as I go out with my right, I bring

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.649
my left shoulder forward. So one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight. Let's pick

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:44.500
it up, ready five, six, seven so you've got
one and two, three and four, five and six,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.579
seven and eight. Awesome let's try the pop
now. So now we're going to do same shoulder

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.789
as leg, make sure it comes up to your ear
we're not rolling it. Ready, here we go, five,

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.929
six, seven, eight. We have one and two, three
and four, so we're just doing three shoulders.

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:12.980
Right, left right and left, right, left. Five,
six, seven so we go a one and two, three and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.530
four, five and six, seven and eight. Good
work! Again this move is going to cover the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.669
shoulders, the body, lower body, traveling.
