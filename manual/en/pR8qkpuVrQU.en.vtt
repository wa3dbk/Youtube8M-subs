00:00:01.155 --> 00:00:03.693
Let's have a better look at it.

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:07.064
This car won't beat MR-2.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.965
Mid-high speed cornering feels ok.

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:21.013
But it under steers here.

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:22.361
In tight corners.

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:27.695
To be able driving like that, it must be a
very well accomplished car, I suppose

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:34.179
But because it's got FWD layout there
are a few spots where it under steers.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.509
OridoSan gave it 100 points, correct.

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:42.314
The engine is very powerful with just
1800cc, the power is transferred via cross

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.927
geared transmission, it can be used as
a daily drive, it's very satisfactory.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.128
Compared to the older version,
which has different wheels and

00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:56.000
tires, the higher stability
makes the car more under steer.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.905
It's a braking under steer.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.898
When the ABS kicks in.

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.896
Maybe disabling the ABS would
eliminate the under steer, I suppose.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.149
Also the bigger tires,
if we try to change them

00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:09.401
to older version tires,
maybe it'll be better.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:15.320
I've brought with me the tires of older version,
let's try to put them on and try it out.

00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:16.767
O.K. let's do it.

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:20.384
What? Tire inch down?

00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:23.608
The response will get worse, won't it?

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:30.344
It doesn't...

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:37.102
differ much, is what people would
think, but the entry here is better.

00:01:37.882 --> 00:01:39.243
This entry is good.

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:41.937
It enters very well.

00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:45.678
When looking from outside,
the movement is good.

00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:48.990
The tires of older version
have a good sharp movement.

00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:54.360
But they get worn more quickly, right.

00:01:55.543 --> 00:01:59.700
Anyway I would recommend these
tires to anyone who wants

00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:03.810
to practice driving at circuit,
they're cheaper as well.

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:07.704
They're cheaper and good
for control practice.

00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:11.064
Though they still don't
induce an over steer.

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:16.014
If you want to over steer in the
same way as the older version,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
I'd recommend to disable the ABS,
it seems to interfere too much.

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:23.575
3000 USD tuning.

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:31.898
Let's welcome our tuning adviser who
will put together a tuning menu for us.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.533
Let's call him in.

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.805
The tuning adviser is this person.

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:40.573
I'm Hiromiko.

00:02:43.988 --> 00:02:45.243
This is hard.

00:02:45.478 --> 00:02:49.706
O.K. the tuning adviser is
KawasakiSan, welcome. Thank you.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.605
First the Integra R.

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:53.197
Right.

00:02:53.543 --> 00:02:57.391
There's no need to tinker
with the Inte R though.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.203
Anyway let's try to tinker with it.

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:03.182
First, we have here a carbon bonnet.

00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:06.010
Right, it's 12kg lighter than stock.

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.834
Because it's a FF car, there's
already a lot of weight

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.068
in front, so it's better
to have less weight there.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:16.186
Second, OEM cross gearing. Correct.

00:03:17.398 --> 00:03:24.663
It's the 4th and 5th gear of older version.
Swapping these two gears

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:31.526
while keeping the final gear of
newer version, that is the plan.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.622
This will make the car rev faster.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.529
Let's have a look at the ratio table.

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.625
This swap will make the
car more circuit ready.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:46.116
Although the 5th gear is not used
that frequently, only the 4th gear.

00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:49.721
Anyway this will make the car
hard to drive at a highway.

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:53.972
But when I think about it, maybe we even
don't need the 4th gear at this circuit.

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.758
Third, the brake pads.

00:03:57.993 --> 00:04:02.239
Because the car is light, the
normal pads are just enough.

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.465
Today the pro drives drive the car,
so we have the Image C2 for them ready.

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:13.542
The last point is, as a step
up, the lightweight rims.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.055
Using lighter rims will make
the car movements feel swift.

00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:21.420
That's the point. They
look very good as well.

00:04:22.213 --> 00:04:23.029
That's it.

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:26.319
Tuning procedure start.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.449
First it gets a carbon bonnet.

00:04:28.628 --> 00:04:33.960
Then the 4th and 5th gear gets swapped into
the transmission. It's a pretty tough task.

00:04:34.194 --> 00:04:37.460
The last thing is to change
the brake pads, and it's done!

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.366
Integra R 3000 USD tuning is completed!
