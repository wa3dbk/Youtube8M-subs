[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.320
There are three basic joints
in the wood working world.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.180
A butt, a miter, and a pocket.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.680
Hey.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.160
I'm Rob North, and today I'm going
to show you how to make all three.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.710
Let's start off with the butt.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.560
Now, a butt joint is
a very simple joint.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.810
As a matter of fact, it's
probably the most primitive.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.455
It's really just two pieces
of wood coming together.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:22.330
Boom, just like that.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.250
Nothing fancy to it.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.650
And you fasten them together
pretty much any way you can.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.440
Let me show you exactly what I mean.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.310
Now, as always, before you do
any work, protect your eyeballs.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.720
You only get one set.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.130
If you have a hold down on your miter
saw, and you're using the miter saw,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.050
you might as well use it,
because it's there for a reason.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.560
It'll keep that piece
in place without you

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.600
having to worry about
holding it down yourself.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.890
Now, the first thing I'm going
to do is make a 90 degree cut.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.770
[SAWING NOISE]

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:52.050
It's a good practice to let that
blade come to stop before you move it.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.910
Now, if they're going to
come together like this,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.360
you simply run a couple of
screws right through here.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.930
That does it.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.500
Or even a couple of finished nails.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.674
Now, the first thing you have to
do is do a little quick layout.

00:01:02.674 --> 00:01:04.840
Now, you might not think
is important, but it really

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.006
is, and let me show you why.

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.870
The thickness of this material
is about 3/4 of an inch.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.120
We're going to put a screw
through the end of this

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.310
that's going to come into this ingrain.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.280
If we don't pre-drill it, it's
going to split, I promise you that.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.740
It's going to split here and
it'll probably split here.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.150
We want to come right down
the center of that piece.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.310
So if this is 3/4 of
an inch, we're going

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.350
to put a 3/8 line down
here, that's going

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.090
let us know where to put our screws.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.690
Now, once you have that 3/8
mark marked on your piece,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.710
grab a six-inch combination
square, or whatever you have,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.110
set it for 3/8 of an inch.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440
What you're doing is you're
creating a line for you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.149
to reference as you're
making your holes.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.773
Without that, it's easy to go
off to the left and to the right,

00:01:43.773 --> 00:01:45.250
and that's not good times.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.601
Hold your piece in place and give
yourself your first pilot hole.

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.850
Now, I like to stop right
there because at that point,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.474
my bit has already gone through
this piece and into that piece,

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:55.505
but I want to countersink
it too, so I'm going

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:58.130
to hold that off of the edge of
the table and do it right here.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.702
[DRILLING]

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.450
That's going to give my
screw someplace to go.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.410
Now I've got to reverse the process,
put the piece back in place,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.030
and go in that screw
hole, or that pilot hole--

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.850
[DRILLING]

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.240
--and line that piece up just like that.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.300
Switch bits.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.146
Drive that first screw in.

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:25.110
Put the piece where you need
it, put the next screw in.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.620
Boom.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.440
Just like that.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.290
One, two, three, you've
got a butt joint.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.650
Now, a miter is pretty much a
butt joint, except it's angled,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.430
and when you cut it, you have to
cut that angle into the piece.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.340
Now, the angle you cut
is really dependent

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.450
upon you and what shape
you're trying to form.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.780
If you're trying to
make a 90 degree turn,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.730
like here, then what
you have to do is bisect

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.960
that angle, making it 45 degrees,
make that cut on each piece

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.250
and it comes together.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.015
Put your piece in your table
saw, again use your hold down,

00:02:57.015 --> 00:03:02.180
and swing your table to 45 degrees.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.470
[SAWING NOISE]

00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:08.280
Now the question is, how do you
put these two pieces together.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.270
We're going to use glue
and a couple of nails.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.640
Get some right on that
ingrain and rub that in.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.456
You're going to take that excess
and rub it into the other side.

00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:20.140
Now, what this is called,
it's called sizing the joint.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.539
Put it together, get
it where you want it,

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.830
spin it around so that you
can get your gun right there

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.170
and then put your eyeballs on your face,
and throw a nail right into this point,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.170
because you want that nail to come
through here and grab the other side.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.304
And fire.

00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:37.470
Put it this way, you want
to drive the nail that way

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.720
and tie it together the other way.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.546
Bim, bam, boom, you've
got a miter joint.

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:47.670
Now, the last one I'm going to show
you, it may be the simplest one of all,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.130
it's called a pocket hole joint.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.640
It's used a lot in furniture making
for a couple of different reasons.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.230
Number one, it's extremely
strong, but number two, it

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.862
allows you to use a mechanical fastener,
namely a screw, but completely hide it.

00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:00.070
Let me show you how it works.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.330
You have to use this thing
called a pocket hole jig,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.465
and the way this thing is designed,
it basically is a guide hold.

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:10.030
Can you see that there?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.230
And it runs at an angle
that's about like that.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.310
And so what happens is, when you
put a piece of material in here,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.580
lock it down, use this thing
called a step drill bit--

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.800
and what it basically is
just a regular drill bit

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.300
but it has a flat edge, called a
shoulder, and then a smaller point,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.170
which is the pilot.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.685
You put that in your screw gun, and
when you run it through your piece

00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:36.570
it'll cut an angled hole.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.060
So take the piece out and voila,
you have two pocket holes.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.370
Now, the way these things work,
they use these specialty screws

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.050
called pocket screws, with the shoulder
on them, to come through at that angle,

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.300
grab the flat hole we
drilled, and dig themselves

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.980
into the piece you're trying to joint.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.650
Get your piece in place.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.660
Doesn't matter where it is.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.770
Find that hole, drive it down.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.620
See that?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.750
Nice and tight.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.160
Completely concealed joint.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.470
Best of all, it's just a butt joint.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.042
Now you see it, now you don't.
