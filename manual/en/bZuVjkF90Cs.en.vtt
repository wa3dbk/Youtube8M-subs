00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.560
No one really knows where it actually got
started.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.010
Conceivably, it happened and began in Italy.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.060
It really gained prominence in the U.S. through
David Schomer, from Espresso Vivace in Seattle.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.180
The late 80's/early 90's was when he first
started discovering it and really getting

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.510
into it, and began teaching latte art classes,
and then published a book called "CafÃ© Latte

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.430
Art," which really kind of began this movement
that we see now.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.960
It's more or less assumed that if you're producing
specialty coffee, and doing a really good

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.790
job on your bar, you will be pouring latte
art.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.470
That really started, again, with Espresso
Vivace, with David Schomer in the early 90's,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.810
at least in America.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.220
Of course, several people along the way have
put their own stamps on it.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.880
People like Chris Deferio, a couple of decades
later came along, and started doing really

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.880
cool stuff.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.970
And later, Christopher Nicely, people like
that have really started taking it in all

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.970
new directions.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.010
It has evolved into a much different thing
than it was when it began.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
It began as a very basic way to intentionally
mix espresso with milk in a way that was recognizable,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.159
maybe in a heart or a dot.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.789
Now we can just do so much.

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.909
Everything is still the combination of a heart,
a leaf, or a dot.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.409
But arranging them in different ways, really
enables us to make some very intricate, very

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.560
interesting designs in coffee.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.289
There are several objective quality markers
in latte art, especially as judged in latte

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.350
art competitions.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.249
You want to see a crisp, white design against
a dark brown background.

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.460
If it's a design that should be symmetrical,
it should be centered and symmetrical.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.429
We'll demonstrate some asymmetrical designs
later on today.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.539
But if it's a heart or a rosseta or a tulip
these are designs that are made to be symmetrical

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.212
to themselves and symmetrical in the cup,
so you want to see a lot of that.

00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:54.310
Again, that crisp, white against dark brown.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.530
You don't want to see any beige.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.159
You don't want to see any what we would call
ghosting, would be not quite getting the design

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.659
in there, the way you want to.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.259
And of course, there are no latte artists.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.860
We are barista's, so as such this means that
we're creating delicious coffee, and we're

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.980
serving it very quickly to customers who came
to get a drink, and usually to leave.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.409
If a design takes a very long amount of time,
you're not doing your job as a barista, as

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.750
well as you could be, so speed is a factor.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.090
If it takes a very long time to produce something,
that means that someone has waited a long

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.709
time to get that very beautiful design, but
maybe the drink itself might not be as delicious

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.290
as it could have been.
