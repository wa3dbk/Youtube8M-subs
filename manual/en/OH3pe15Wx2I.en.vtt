00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Sue Ailsby's Training Levels 3A test

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:14.001
When trained together, 'crate', 'go bed', 'down stay' and 'sit stay' all teach the concept of 'stay' in any postion. 

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:19.002
crate: dog enters crate on one cue and remains quietly for one minute with the door closed.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:16.003
"Lucy, kennel!"

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:31.004
Time elapses

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.005
Near the end of the minute, Lucy lays down.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:48.006
Because this is only one step in the shaping process, I reward her while still in the crate and after I open the door so she learns to wait inside until released.

00:00:55.007 --> 00:01:01.007
down stay: dog downs while handler walks 20 feet away, styas for one minute, then comes back. One mild distraction.

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:01.008
"Flat."

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.009
Oops! That was three cues for down! Verbal, hand and body cues.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.010
Time elapses

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.011
The mild distraction.

00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:26.012
More time elapses

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:32.012
Here's an unplanned distraction.

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:43.013
"Yes!"

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:58.014
go mat: dog goes to mat from five feet away, one cue only, lies down with no fussing or additional cues for one minute

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:01.015
Time elapses

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:12.015
"Yes!"

00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:23.016
sit stay: dog sits and stays while handler walks 20 feet away, stays away for 30 seconds and comes back.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.017
One cue for sit, two for stay. One mild distraction.

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:28.018
time elapse

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.019
Lucy is sitting on a carpet so her front feet don't slide.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.020
A mild distraction.

00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:42.021
More time elapses

00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:50.022
"Yes!"

00:02:50.023 --> 00:02:53.023
Jessie was practicing 'go mat' while Lucy was tested.

00:02:57.024 --> 00:02:59.024
"Good girl Jessie."

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:09.025
Taught at the same time, 'front', 'heel' and 'finish' teach the dog that there are several possible positions near the handler, not just one default.

00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:12.026
'Front' and 'finish' also teach back end awareness.

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:18.027
front: dog hits center line of a ray diagram 3 times in a row out of 5. The dog must decide what is correct.

00:03:20.028 --> 00:03:20.508
click

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:25.519
click

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:28.031
I toss the treat to both sides to change her approach.

00:03:32.032 --> 00:03:32.512
click

00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:36.032
She has been so heavily reinforced for the right side approach that thus is what she prefers at the present.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:45.033
If I want her to be comfortable on my right side, I am going to have to put some time into rewarding her for being in that position.

00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:41.504
click

00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:50.504
click

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:58.505
finish: (also called a swing finish) dog is able to follow eye contact while handler pivots to left

00:03:57.506 --> 00:03:58.506
click

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:00.507
It would have been more ideal to feed her from my left hand

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:04.508
I am continuing to phase out handler body motion

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:08.509
She stays in position when she thinks the food is coming from the left.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.150
click

00:04:08.506 --> 00:04:11.506
heel: 180 degree turn with eye contact

00:04:10.507 --> 00:04:13.507
Here I do more than 360 degrees just to see if she can.

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:14.507
click

00:04:15.508 --> 00:04:21.508
'Retrieve', 'target', and my shaped 'trick' all are about using the target as a tool to teach other behaviors.

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.509
retrieve: dog nose atrgets four different objects including a dumbbell, one cue each

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:30.040
"Touch."  click

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:35.041
Notice the closed mouth? This si tough to get when she's excited.

00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:34.512
"Touch."  click

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:39.512
"Touch."  click

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.513
A lower value treat helps keep her calm.

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:45.514
"Touch."   click

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:50.515
"Touch."  click

00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:57.076
"Paw."

00:04:55.056 --> 00:05:00.116
target: dog targets a spot on the floor ten feet away with her nose or foot with no more than 2 cues

00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:00.517
click

00:05:03.518 --> 00:05:06.518
trick: dog performs a shaped trick of handler's choice

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:11.519
I chose this one as I wanted to reduce her tendancy of using her paws as a default.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.110
"Push!"

00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:08.631
click

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.100
'Contact' reinforces paw contact through shaping and back end awareness. it is also the early stage of teaching agility obstacles. 

00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:23.101
contact: dog walks flat board with a click on or immediately after the down contact

00:05:23.102 --> 00:05:23.542
click

00:05:27.063 --> 00:05:27.543
click

00:05:28.102 --> 00:05:32.102
Keep watching to see more level 3 behaviors!
