Mr.. Theodore twombly

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.939
Welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system. We'd like to ask you a few questions, okay?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.149
[are] you social or anti-social?

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.390
I guess I haven't been social in a while

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.840
How would you describe your relationship with your mother?

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.979
Thank you, please wait as your operating system is initiated

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.640
Hello, I'm here

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.610
Hi, hi. I'm Samantha

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.329
Good morning, theodore morning. You have a meeting in five minutes. You want to try getting out of bed. Yeah, too funny, okay good

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.870
[I'm] funny I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.880
Wanna learn everything about everything. [I] love the way you look at the world

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.259
[how] long before you're ready to date? What do you mean? I sign your emails that you've gone through a breakup

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.690
Well, you're kind of nosy

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.088
So was it like being married there's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody?

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.399
How do you share your [life] with somebody?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.740
I guess I've just been having fun. You really deserve that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.590
A long time since I've [been] with somebody that I felt totally at ease with

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.080
It's like to be alive in that room [right] now

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.840
First I put my arms around you

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.660
Wish I could touch you

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
How would you touch me?

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.029
Only [I'm] I was a crazy thing [to] do. It's kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.960
[Davey] what does a baby computer call its father. [I] don't know what data

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.170
You feel me with you right now

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.499
I've never loved anyone the way. I love you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.849
me [do]

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.849
Let me know how
