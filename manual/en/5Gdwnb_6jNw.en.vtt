00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.129
It's safe to say that the Monster Hunter series
has a lot of fans with the complex gameplay

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.220
revolving around improving yourself as a hunter
by learning about and finally defeating your

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.369
prey. For some, the time involved is simply
a chore and Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.680
by Capcom cuts straight to the chase, pitting
you against wyverns from the console series

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.480
with no preamble required.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.320
In a way the game feels like an abstract shoot'em-up,
placing you against boss after boss, each

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.300
with their own unique strengths, weaknesses
and attacks that must be mastered. Sadly,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.250
any sense of strategy is completely eliminated
by being able to tackle most of the creatures

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.450
by simply walking up to and attacking them
directly. Thankfully this only provides basic

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.970
progression and those looking to unlock additional
weapons and armor will need to study their

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.809
foes to dodge attacks, counter blows and 'break'
precious trophies from the wyvern you're fighting.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.130
The controls are simplistic and while the
game's combat initially resembles that of

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.940
Infinity Blade, the emphasis is more on your
mobility and less on specific tactical strikes.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.530
Dragging moves your character around the level
while swipes and taps initiate special and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.469
basic attacks in turn. Double finger swipes
will dodge you out of the way of attacks and

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.250
if you have an appropriate weapon equipped,
pressing down with two fingers will block.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.310
Annoyingly the gestures are prone to being
interpreted incorrectly (such as blocking

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.100
when you want to dodge, moving when you want
to slash), causing some good runs to go up

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.380
in flames for no good reason at all.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.840
Although the solo campaign may not present
too much of a challenge, the co-op campaign

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.810
(via Bluetooth) is something else altogether.
Fans familiar with these creatures from their

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.369
original incarnations will get to experience
the beasts at full force, making tandem combat

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.840
far more exciting.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.409
While the visuals certainly aren't completely
polished, the monsters and the monster hunter

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.659
are detailed enough, with weapons and equipment
changing your appearance appropriately. To

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.140
get the best scores you'll want to unlock,
craft and experiment with different weapon

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.220
types, but there's no major incentives to
dive in that far.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.049
Monster Hunter Dynamic Hunting isn't quite
the same as its console and hand-held brethren,

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.340
though jumping straight to the 'boss' fights
does make this an easier game to pick up for

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.890
newcomers and casual gamers. The fun may not
last for long, but battling epic beasts can

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.560
fill up the spare moments in the day.
