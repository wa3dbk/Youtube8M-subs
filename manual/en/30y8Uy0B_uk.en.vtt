00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.109
Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.549
I'm going to go over five basic fundamentals
that you should know for indoor rock climbing.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.679
One of the first fundamentals is just general
body awareness and being able to identify

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.340
your center of gravity.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.340
You want to use that to be able to keep your
weight in balance, which would be the second

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.090
fundamental, learning how to balance and shift
your weight.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.980
And once you've identified that center of
gravity, keeping that weight over your feet,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.120
so you're going to be pushing with your legs,
rather than pulling with your arms, which

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.140
brings us to the next fundamental, of climbing
with straight arms.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.570
Using this position is much more beneficial
as far as the efficiency of your movement

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.570
goes.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.510
Right now, with my arms straight, I'm not
taking any energy to pull myself in.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.430
You can see my left leg is bent here, so as
I initiate this movement up, I'll be pushing

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.510
rather than pulling.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.440
That allows for much more efficient motion.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.200
We also have two other basic fundamental techniques,
known as edging and flagging.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:15.290
Edging is when you're using your climbing
shoes to basically be edging on a hold.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.030
So, I can use both the inside edge and the
outside edge of my climbing shoes.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.540
Both should be applied frequently to change
your body position and help you move in balance.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.150
For example, I can use the outside edge of
my right foot here to keep my right hip close

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.510
to the wall, so that as I move up, that center
of gravity is going to stay over my let, allowing

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.700
me to push, rather than pull.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.450
I've also grabbed that next hold with a straight
arm, rather than with a bent arm, saving me

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.050
a little bit of energy.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.990
Flagging is a technique that's fundamental,
once again, for keeping your balance.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.940
Flagging comes in handy when all of the holds
are on the same side of your body.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.939
Right now, to stay in balance, it'd be a little
tricky for me to move without having my body

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.429
kind of swing around a little bit, which is
a big waste of energy.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.670
So, with one foot up, with my right hand and
my right foot inline, I can flag my left foot

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.660
to help keep that center of gravity better
aligned.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.709
What that would look like while moving, would
be either flagging in this direction to keep

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.209
that center of gravity centered over my foot,
or if I switch hands and feet, I can flag

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.590
in the other direction to highlight the same
principle.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:50.590
All right, so that was five fundamentals for
rock climbing indoors.
