00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:01.659
Hey everybody!

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:07.200
Michael Gebben here and I'm super excited
to be with you on another rockin' Wednesday.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.500
So I hope all of you guys had an awesome first
week of 2014th.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.429
And I gotta say, I appreciate every single
one of you guys.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.220
The messages coming in have been blowing me
away.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.220
We've got a lot of new subscribers recently
who have been super awesome.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.440
Coming in from actually an interview that
I wanna share with you guys.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.960
I was interviewed on Jonathan Fields' "The
Good Life Project."

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.789
Jonathan is an amazing, amazing human being
and I had the honor to be interviewed by him

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.930
in New Year City back in September.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.630
And he finally released it on December 25th
on Christmas Day.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.270
I've been getting a lot of super awesome feedback
from that so I really wanna share that with

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.270
you guys.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.620
And any of guys who actually found me from
that, I encourage you to go check out all

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.930
the other videos that I've done in the last
6 or so months.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.789
For all of you that haven't seen it, I'm gonna
link it up in the description and right here

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:01.789
if you click on it.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.440
And I really want you to watch it 'coz it
ties in with my story today which I'm gonna

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.350
keep short so you can enjoy that interview.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.810
So, my grandpa, writing things down and consistency.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.570
Well, I've actually been walking with my grandpa
for a little over a year, almost a year, almost

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.810
every single day, Monday through Friday at
the mall.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.520
The whole story is actually explained in that
interview which is why I want you guys to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520
watch that.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.380
But I'm gonna tell you just a little bit.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.100
So, I've been doing that for almost about
a year and one of the biggest things that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.710
my grandpa says is to write things down.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.300
Write things down.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.600
He's been journaling for a very, very long
time.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.260
I think over the last 34 years, he's been
journaling, he keeps track every single day

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.600
of how many steps we take, how many miles
we walk.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.800
We've walked like 700 or 800 miles in the
last year which was incredible.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.080
It also showed you how little things, every
single day (we walk for about 45 minutes)

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.060
can add up to big things over time.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.831
So actually, I have a notebook here, right
here, a little, old, simple notebook that

00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:11.390
you can get at the store for a couple of bucks
and a simple pen.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.440
And I find myself, when I don't write things
down, I'm not as productive.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.500
I don't remember things as much.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.860
Like, when I write things down and I cross
them off like a To-do list, it's so, so helpful.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.510
And I find that things that I write down tend
to happen more.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.990
There's something in like the subconscious,
I don't know all the specifics about it.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.030
I'm not the person to talk to about that but
I just know that the power of writing things

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.500
down is just incredible.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.980
So I encourage each and every single one of
you to just go out and buy a notebook.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.320
Start writing down your thoughts.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.320
Start journaling.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.040
Start writing down your To-do and crossing
those things off each and every one that you

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.040
get done.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.230
I've started that again here, January 1, writing
things down, writing down my daily to-do list

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.980
and crossing them off and I'm so much more
productive.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.260
So, and then as my grandpa says, all these
stories that we have and all these things

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.990
that happen in our daily lives, so important
to document those things and to write them

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.300
down for generations to come to enjoy.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.200
And so finally, consistency.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.270
Here is something that I want all of you to
think about no matter what you're doing, whether

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.680
you wanna become great at something, whether
you wanna become known for something, but

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.240
you just wanna stick out, whatever it is,
I want you to think about consistency.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.970
So, my grandpa always says now when I have
to go out of town or I go somewhere, he says,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.650
"All these people keep coming up to me, all
over the place at the mall, when you're gone

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.260
saying, 'Where's your grandson?'"

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.850
Now what I find interesting is the simple
fact that, think about it, if I didn't walk

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.350
there five days a week, let's say I only walked
there once a month, once every couple of months,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:04.070
do you think, that people would ask, "Where's
your grandson?" if I didn't do that consistently

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.530
all the time?

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.990
They wouldn't.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.970
So if you're out there and you have a business
or you're trying to get a job or you're trying

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.810
to get better at anything, whether it's learning
how to juggle, whether it's learning how to

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.040
crochet, I don't know what it is for you.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.620
But the reality is, if you wanna become great
at something, you wanna become known for something,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.190
you want people to talk about you, then you
have to do things over, and over, and over

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.190
again.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.440
That's how you get great at something.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.030
Not by doing something once.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.060
People don't remember, well depending on what
it is, I guess there's a few scenarios out

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.630
there but overall, it's that consistency of
somebody doing something over and over and

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.660
over again.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.430
And sometimes, it's the craziest things.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.760
It's not even something that's, I mean it
can be good, bad or indifferent.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.240
But that person, you know what, you guys are
on Facebook or whatever it is, you've got

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.640
that person you might even complain about
them because they're always driving you nuts.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.220
But it's because they consistently do something
over and over and over again and then you

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.470
talk about it.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.010
If they only posted something once every six
months, you woudn't talk about that person.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:29.510
So, apply that to your life and how that,
you know that consistency could make a difference

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.810
and even getting in those habits and rituals
of writing things down every single day, of

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.949
doing something every single day even if it's
a small, tiny, tiny step every single day.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.000
It's that consistency that makes a massive
impact.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.400
So everybody, I encourage you to watch the
interview.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.730
I'll link it up here again and again in the
description.
