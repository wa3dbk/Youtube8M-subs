00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.511
&gt;&gt; Elephant painting at the
Melbourne Zoo forms part

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.147
of our environmental or
behavioural enrichment.

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:19.285
The elephants have a range of
things that they do as part

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:23.189
of the fun activities that they
do, and paintings form one part

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.258
of that [inaudible
background conversations].

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.462
You'll see their eyes sort of
light up as they're walking.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.996
And they'll be like,
"Oh cool, painting."

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.631
And they like to sort
of slapping around.

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.867
They're holding this thing
that looks like a little twig,

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.969
and it's making colours
on a piece of paper.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.538
And it's just -- you can see
they really enjoy doing it.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:40.773
On the odd occasion,
they'll come in

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:41.707 line:92%
and they'll go, "You know what?

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:42.808
I don't feel like
painting today."

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:43.509 line:92%
And that's fine.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:44.510 line:92%
They just turn around

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.212
and they'll walk
away, and that's fine.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.713
They don't have to
do the painting.

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:50.116
We've had our big boy who's
walked in, and you know,

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.684
there's a bit of mud or
something, "I don't feel

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.085
like standing in the
mud and painting."

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:53.886 line:92%
So you know what?

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:54.987 line:92%
"I'm cool."

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:56.455
And he'll walk away
and he doesn't have to.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.757
So we don't force them
to do anything like that.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:01.127
And it's a fun activity,
and it's just for --

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.996
part of one of the enrichment
things that we do offer.

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:06.232
Obviously it's really fun
for people to see as well,

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.135
and the public get to see
the incredible colours

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.003 line:92%
and the amazing paintings.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.506
And it's also unique
to each elephant.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.508
They all have their
own painting style.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.610
[Inaudible], for example,
tends to sort of dab the piece

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.545 line:92%
of paper with a paintbrush.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.715
Others, like En Garde [phonetic]
have these really big up

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.316 line:92%
and down brush strokes.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:26.819
Some of them are a
little bit more careful

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.087 line:92%
with where they paint.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.523
They sort of they tend to,
okay, I'll get the paper.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.024
Some of them are just,
"If I paint your hand,

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.359
then I'll paint whatever
I feel like."

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.660 line:92%
[Laughter] and it's just --

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.529
they just tend to sort of go
off the page a little bit.
