Okay folks in this clip we're going to learn
how to draw a battle android. Now what exactly

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:12.600
is an android. An android is a human shaped
or human designed robot, obviously. So, what

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.870
you're going to want to do first of all, is
start out by establishing dimensions and what

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.660
I mean by that is clearly define where everything
is supposed to be and really at this point

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.250
I would hope that you sort of already brainstormed
and decided exactly what your android's general

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.310
appearance is going to be. I would suggest
sticking to a relatively human shape simply

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.890
because that is what an android is supposed
to be, supposed to be a human shaped robot,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.380
that is essentially what an android is. So
really come in and define exactly where all

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.620
the dimensions are, get your general outline
going. It's okay to add a few details at this

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.640
stage, I would say. I wouldn't go into too
much detail yet, simply because you're still

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:13.720
kind of trying to figure out where everything
is.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:30.640
Really just kind of establish the general
pose. I'm putting my android in a position

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:44.730
of attack, that he's, I'm going to make him
look like he's firing at his enemy. I'm going

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:57.070
to make it seem like he has some sort of a
weapon on top of his outstretched arm there,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:27.180
a little laser blast there. Come in and establish
where all the different body parts are. The

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:38.230
fun thing about drawing an android is, you're
allowed to obviously borrow from basic human

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:48.660
designs and when you're drawing this robot
creature. It's fun to kind of take certain

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.420
physical attributes of human beings and then
apply them in an unusual way to your robot.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.420
What I would do is at certain point I would
come in, I would really start to define things

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:09.819
like the face, you obviously don't want it
to make it look too human because if it does,

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.840
that spoils the illusion of it being a robot
and you want to clearly make sure that everyone

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.710
understands that it is in fact a robot. Obviously,
you are free to do just about anything you

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:49.270
want in terms of design. From here on out
it's really all in the details. Kind of go

00:03:49.270 --> 00:04:04.459
in there and really make sure people understand
the mechanics of it all and the shapes and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:11.569
you could, at this point you can get into
some pretty crazy detail too. You can, you

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.709
know, add wires and tubes and all sorts of
crazy things to make it look, you know, more

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:30.000
machine like. So, go in and really add some
detail,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.520
but once you've kind of gone over everything
and you're happy with it and really at the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.310
end of the day what it ought to be close to
looking like. This is a general, you know,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.570
look for a battle android and obviously you
are the designer so you may do whatever you

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.889
wish. This is my definition anyway of what
a battle android might look like.
