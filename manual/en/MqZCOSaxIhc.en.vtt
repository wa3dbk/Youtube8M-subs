00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.080
Welcome to Weygand Hall our new 500 bed residence hall.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.080
The building has two elevators.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.980
And right through here is what we call the formal living room.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.840
This is a really great place for students if they're waiting for friends to come down from upstairs.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.900
It has a widescreen TV, it has Blu-ray DVD and the table gives an option to hook up their gaming system, so we anticipate this will be a pretty popular place.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.060
Here we are in one of the main lounges and game rooms in Weygand Hall.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.940
One of the things the architects were trying to achieve in this space when they designed it, and I think they were successful, is to

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.169
utilize glass in the windows to give the students the feeling of being both indoors and outdoors at the same time.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.260
So you can see that there's glass on both sides of this lounge

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
and there's trees and ferns planted outside to give you that nice tranquil

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.809
feeling of being in the woods while also being inside where you can study or play games or watch television with your friends.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.320
We are standing on the fifth floor of Weygand Hall in the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.979
Residential Learning Communities pod area. We're in one of the pod lounges which is intentional lounge space

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.009
that is created on the floor. It belongs to the suites that are here on the floor so the students,

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.879
instead of just recreating within their suites, will come out and build a community together or invite a faculty member up for a meeting or

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.148
to come talk to students. And they can host programs, events, and meetings right here in their living space. The

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.528
university is encouraging the students to decorate the space and design it to make it their own

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060
and make it really belong to them and their community.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.269
One of the great things that the architects did in the design and building of this...

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.500
of Weygand Hall is they incorporated the students input into it a lot.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.320
They brought our students together at one point last year, they ordered a lot of pizza and said "come give us some feedback on how

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.180
we want to design the courtyard."

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.949
So the students... a group of students came in and met with the architects and said,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.289
"we would like an area where we can kind of gather and come together." So they put... they clustered some of the benches together

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.690
so students can sit in groups and gather or have meetings. And then they said, "but we'd also like some quieter areas."

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.510
So they

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.890
planted some trees and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.489
built in some areas where you could sit and quietly read a book by yourself and hang out or eat your lunch also if you wanted to.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.399
And then they also made sure that they kept a walkway clear so that traffic going from the parking garage

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.539
through Crimson Hall and into University Park could walk through unimpeded also.
