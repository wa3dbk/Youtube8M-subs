00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.129
encouraging and also

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.119
perhaps indicative of the future

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:18.750
fast food in retail workers now in saint
louis

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.640
saint louis missouri walked off the job
on wednesday in the third major strike

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.799
at its kind in recent weeks you'll
recall that we had one

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:27.179
just uh...

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.999
well i guess who's a month ago you new
york city

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:37.999
uh... and it was just like uh... oh
uh... a week or two ago in chicago

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.740
and these are workers without you need

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.680
they're being organized by these sort of
of groups this advocacy groups that are

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.710
starting to crop up

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.660
uh... they are striking in saint louis
as they did hear everyday didn chicago

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.760
and i think in new york for a fifteen
dollar-an-hour wage basically a living

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.390
wage

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.369
in saint louis they want a former union

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.050
current hourly minimum wage in uh...
missouri

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.720
he is seven dollars and thirty five
cents an hour

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.590
that makes new york looking really bad
actually up

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.700
i am agin living in new york city or on
uh... was seven fifteen seven fifty yes

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.230

fifteen cents an hour probably does not

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.510
help you out in the aircraft

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.860
but a on a angela harrison a mcdonalds
employee striking on wednesday

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.490

kit to be fully stocked all the time

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.870
she'd like to see uh...

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.960
some six days

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.900
she's worked in the calls for
three-and-a-half years

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.130
yet makes only seven seventy five an
hour just fifty cents more than uh...

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.890
the weight she started at

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.150
so she's gotten a

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.970
uh... i guess that's about thirty nos

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.009
uh... six sixteen percent

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.879

that is ridiculous

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.040

hairs yes when you get up around a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.379
quarter

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.479
we get twenty five cents a year

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.589
increase in your salary that's pretty
good

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:40.659
i'm still focusing on just how close
their minimum wages to new york's than

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.069
that

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.889
