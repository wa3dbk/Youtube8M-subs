00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.740
Hey everyone its Blue Duckie.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.620
And I'm super excited to bring you another
new Zelf review.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.200
And this the new Crystal Gemz line.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.710
And this is the Moonicorn unicorn zelf.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.000
Which I love the name.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.599
So we'll look at the box and unpack Moonicorn
and check out the crystal cloud stable accessory

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.660
that comes with Moonicorn.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.310
So look at the front of Moonicorn's box.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.420
Which I like.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.960
I just noticed on this border, drawing here.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.120
That the crystals are changing colors and
the shape.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.330
Depending on which Zelf you get.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.310
And since we have Moonicorn here.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.710
It has horse shoes.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.390
Which is pretty funny.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.300
And her zweet dream spot is crystal cloud
stables.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.160
And a look at the artwork.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.910
Crystal gemz is the line.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.829
And Moonicorn unicorn zelf.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.200
And Moonicorns power is sweet dreams.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:16.400
Here is look at the back of the box which
um, the backs of the box for all the um, Crystal

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.510
Gemz Zelfs are the same.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.880
And you can read the paragraph about the Crystal
Gemz Zelfs.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.190
And here is a look at the Crystal Gemz collectors
leaflet.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.640
You can see all the characters in the Crystal
Gemz line.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.049
There is three new characters.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.780
And three repeat characters.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.330
And you can read more about Moonicorn the
Crystal Unicorn Zelf.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.600

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.810
This pretty protector sleeps in her crystal
stable keeping her friends safe and filling

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.030
their heads with sweet dreams.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.690
No nightmares here, just some dreamy horsin'
around.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.640
Her zelf power is sweet dreams.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.220
Her birthday is Dreamcember tenth.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.750
And her fabitat is the Crystal Cloud Stables.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.320
Her is the back of the leaflet which you can
see the little paragraph and the same artwork

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.770
that was on the back of the box.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.810
And here is a look at the Crystal Cloud Stables
accessory that comes with Moonicorn.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.730
Its like a stabled gate with these awesome
clouds everywhere.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.850
And its purple translucent plastic with sparkles.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.230
And then at the top of the gate there is a
moon and star.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.650
And then you have these little gates that
open and close just like so.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.330
Its really, really cute.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.290
I love it.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.620
I really like this sparkle.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.510
Extra sparkly uh, material that they use.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.920
And here is a closer look at Moonicorn.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.110
Who has a bright yellow eyes.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.700
And these tall horse like ears since she is
a unicorn.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.400
And it looks like she has little earrings
in this pink crystal and her body is a dark

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.930
purple with blue and pink accents.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.319
And you can see the little blush on her cheek.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.000
Really, really cute.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.880
Um, and she has a pink crystal horn.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.440
Then moving down into her body.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.030
You can see her little belly gem that is a
blue color and it is a horseshoe.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.910
And in the middle of it.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.129
And she has this cool pink crystals on the
leg and you turn her around and she has this

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.629
awesome pink.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.530
Really, really curley tail that is made out
of like a hair.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.269
So its not molded tail.

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.290
But its hair tail.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.519
Which for her is very cute.

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.629
And it has her little Z for Zelf mark.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.430
And the horse shoe.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.769
And then her hair is this very soft cotton
candy pink color.

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.130
Really soft.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.470
So overall I think she is adorable.
