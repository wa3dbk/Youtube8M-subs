00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.580
Matt Prior: Welcome to Autocar's highlights from the 2013
Geneva Motor Show. One half of the story at

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.580
Geneva is the McLaren P1, the spiritual successor
to the F1 supercar of the early 1990s. The

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.740
P1 is laden with tech, and its 727 horsepower
twin-turbo V8 is coupled to an electric motor

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.900
that boosts total output to more than 900
horsepower.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.680
That's good for 218mph, but the really groundbreaking
development is in the aerodynamic package

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.860
which can generate 600 kilograms of downforce
even at speeds well short of its maximum.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.940
That's as much as many Le Mans racers. It's
light too, at only 1400 kilos, but it does

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.940
wear a full-size price tag of some £866,000.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:06.119
Only three examples of Lamborghini's Veneno Supercar,
created to celebrate the company's 50th anniversary,

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.119
will be built, each at a cost of €3 million
plus local taxes. The 740-horsepower Aventador

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.910
base supercar is described by Lamborghini
as a street-legal racing car. Yes, they are

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.270
all sold.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.820
There's something a touch more mundane now: This
is the Honda Civic Tourer Concept, which previews

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.080
a production version due later this year.
What's interesting, honestly, is that Honda

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.940
is likely to target class-leading rear accommodation
in this car.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.710
The fuel tank is located beneath the front
seats and the torsion beam rear suspension

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.740
takes rather less room than the multi-link
suspension of most rivals. The production

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.030
version will arrive in September.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.950
This is the slightly hard-to-pronounce Rolls-Royce
Wraith, the most powerful, and Rolls-Royce

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.280
claims, most dynamic car the company has ever
produced.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.640
Ostensibly, the Wraith is a coupe variant
of the Ghost, but that definition sells it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.600
a little bit short. It's actually shorter
of wheelbase and in length, and it's lower

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.759
and wider than the Ghost it is based on. Rolls
says the interior uses Phantom grade leather,

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.330
too.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.340
The most significant thing about it is that
it is stiffer to reduce body roll and it is

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.239
much more powerful. It has some 642 brake
horsepower. Get this; the car uses GPS satellite

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.230
navigation data to read the road ahead and
help put the car in the right gear for an

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.230
upcoming corner. Clever stuff. Expect it to
cost £215,000 when it goes on sale in the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.189
autumn.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:41.730
Few things get car enthusiasts excited like
the prospect of a new 911 GT3, but this one

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.499
hasn't arrived without a spot of controversy.
For one, there is no manual gearbox option,

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.319
and two, it is heavier than its predecessor.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.319
Here we are; the 1430 kilo PDK-only GT3. There's
more: PASM variable dampers and a rear-wheel

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.200
steering system are also standard. Then this
is a GT3. There is still a limited slip differential

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.519
and a 468 brake horsepower, 3.8-litre flat
six arrives, and it revs to more than 9000

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.459
RPM.

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.689
Besides, it's not as if Porsche is on bad
form at the moment, so this might be a slightly

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.459
different kind of GT3, but we suspect those
with a requisite £100,000 are unlikely to

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.950
be disappointed.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.309
When AMG and Mercedes go about making their
first ever hot hatchback, they don't do things

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:36.309
by halves. At 355 horsepower, the A45 AMG
is the most powerful hot hatch ever built.

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.439
Fortunately, AMG has had the good sense to
fit 4-wheel drive with that, which is coupled

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:47.540
to a 7-speed dual clutch automatic, making
it good for 0-to-60mph in a sprightly 4.6

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.489
seconds. We reckon the A45 will be priced
at £36,000 or so. That's more than BMW's

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:00.489
135i, but should prove less than the next
generation Audi RS3. Production is imminent.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.599
BMW has done to the 3-series what it has already
done to the 5-series and created this, the

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.819
3-series GT with coupe-ish hatch-y looks and
mirror state practicality. The GT is longer

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.690
overall and has a longer wheelbase than the
saloon on which it's based, and therefore

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.989
has nearly 3 inches of extra leg room in the
back. If that floats your boat, it's worth

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.910
telling you that it goes on sale late this
spring, priced at around £1500 more than

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.720
an equivalent 3-series touring model.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.979
Alfa Romeo is re-entering the lightweight
2-seat sports car market with this, the rather

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.979
gorgeous 4C Coupe. The 4C weighs around 1000
kilograms and has 237 horsepower from its

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.889
1750cc 4-cylinder engine. A carbonfibre tub
with aluminium sub-frames front and rear provide

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.949
the chassis. Production will start this summer.
Expect a price around £50,000, hopefully

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.550
even under it.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.479
The Bertone Jet 2+2 is being created to celebrate
both Aston Martin's centenary and the 60th

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.080
anniversary of collaborations between Aston
Martin and the Bertone styling house.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.259
In effect, it is as you can probably tell,
a shooting-brake variant of the Aston Rapide,

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.960
and is mechanically identical underneath with
a 470 horsepower V12 motor. If you think it

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.900
looks rather splendid, you're not alone, but
don't get too optimistic. It has been commissioned

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.169
as a strict one-off by an Aston Martin collector.

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.180
Officially, this is a concept car but it wouldn't
take such a stretch of imagination to see

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.180
this FT86 concept as a production variant
of the GT86 coupe. Power and the near 50/50

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.759
weight distribution of the coupe should remain
unchanged, but weight and body rigidity would

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.900
inevitably suffer. Will it make production?
Watch this space.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.840
Here is the second half of the big Geneva
story: LaFerrari, or The Ferrari. McLaren

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.129
says it likes to under-promise and over-deliver,
but Ferrari has no such qualms about the statement

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:08.129
it makes. It is claiming 0-to-186mph in this
car. Its 300kph will take just 15.5 seconds,

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.870
1.5 second faster than McLaren suggests.
Ferrari however, declines to comment about

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.169
its top speed, mumbling something about it
not really mattering. Like the P1, LaFerrari

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:27.169
is a hybrid, but here it has a 6.3-litre naturally
aspirated V12, making 789 horsepower alone

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:35.469
at more than 9000 revs. That's joined by a
161 brake electric motor for a grand round

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:41.759
total of 950 horsepower. Ferrari says this
is a 2-year project and first deliveries are

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:48.759
likely to start in the autumn. Just 499 LaFerraris
will be built, each at a cost of £1,040,000.
