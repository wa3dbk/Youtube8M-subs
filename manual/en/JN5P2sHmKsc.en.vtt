00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.460
The Prince is back, baby.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.539
That’s right, after the conclusion of the
Sands of Time Trilogy, Ubisoft decided to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.310
create an all new Prince.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.640
Well, that didn’t go over too well with
fans, so they decided to dust of the old Prince

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.350
and bring him back for a new adventure.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.719
Coincidentally right around the same time
the Prince of Persia movie was coming out.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.829
Funny how things work out like that.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.329
But bringing back the old Prince was both
a good and bad thing as it is great to see

00:00:47.329 --> 00:01:08.000
him return but does feel like this tale is
a little squeezed in.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.360
This game takes place right after the events
of the Sands of Time but before Warrior Within.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.140
Because the Prince rewound time at the end
of Sands of Time, everyone believes him to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.390
have no battle experience where in fact he
has an adventure of it.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.399
So they sent him to visit his brother Malik
to learn the ways of battle from him.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.230
But when he arrives, his brother’s city
is under attack and the Prince must take the

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.460
final on combat because even his first class.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.080
The gameplay continues the longstanding tradition
of the Prince of Persia series, with major

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.860
emphasis on platforming, puzzles and combat.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.149
The platforming feels as solid as ever, with
the Prince running along walls, balancing

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.450
on beams, and sliding down banisters.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.320
The new twist, and there is a twist, is the
Prince now has the power to control water.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.700
He can freeze it to create poles to swing
on or wall to shimmy up.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.560
This gets really creative when you have to
constantly be switching between freezing and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.420
flowing to create a path through the large
detailed worlds.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.000
This is also the major focus on the puzzles,
having you use it in interesting ways to open

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.980
doors and move on.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.610
Also the Prince again has the powers of the
Sands of Time, allowing him to rewind time

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.090
itself if he makes a mistake, which becomes
very handy.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.020
The combat has seen a major change.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.310
Instead of an elegant dance between combatants,
the screen will fill with hordes of enemies

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.690
and you will just mow through them.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:48.730
It is much less satisfying than other games
in the series and quickly becomes a chore.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:58.910
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands is a
fun Prince game with amazing platforming and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.900
again a beautiful world, but suffers greatly
from a strange side story and very repetitive

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.900
combat.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.319
Fans of the series will dig it but it will
not stay in their minds like other games with

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.680
the Prince.
