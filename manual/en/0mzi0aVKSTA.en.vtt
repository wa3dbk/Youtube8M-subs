00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.350
Chiropractic is a healthcare profession that
focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.370
system and nervous and how those disorders
effect your overall health.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.110
The chiropractic adjustment is the essential
part of chiropractic care.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.780
Chiropractors will examine your spine and
your overall musculoskeletal system and look

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.050
for places where there are restrictions, misalignments,
or restriction in range of motion that is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.000
causing muscle spasm, inflammation and nerve
irritation.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.130
The chiropractic adjustment is very specifically
designed to adjust these restricted areas,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.000
or what chiropractors call subluxations, with
a very gentle and very specific thrust to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.020
restore the normal range of motion and neurological
function.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.120
The adjustments can vary depending on the
technique that is used.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.329
Sometimes a traditional chiropractic adjustment
is used on the spine where a little release

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.780
sound is heard.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.790
These release sounds are not associated with
any kind of pain, and in fact most people

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.229
report that they feel relief almost immediately
after the adjustment, or the hours or days

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.520
after the adjustment.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.929
There are other chiropractic techniques that
are utilized that are very gentle or non-force,

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:24.560
that might involve a gentle stretching sensation
or a gentle holding or just a light contact

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.319
being made on the spine.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.430
And these techniques are also very effective
at reducing subluxations and restoring the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.759
alignment of the musculoskeletal system.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.969
Your chiropractor will choose techniques that
are appropriate for your body type and your

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.689
condition, and you may notice that your chiropractor
will change techniques for different circumstances

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.780
and as your healthcare progresses.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.200
Your chiropractor will primarily adjust your
spine, but all of the joints in the body can

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.789
be adjusted very specifically, including shoulders,
elbows, wrists and fingers, hips, knees, ankles,

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.069
and toes.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.520
It's really important that chiropractors look
at the entire, we call it the kinematic chain,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.489
how one joint affects the other joint.

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.360
Because this allows the allows the musculoskeletal
system to function optimally, and it also

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.720
allows your nervous system to be functioning
at a very high level.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.920
Adjustments are often accompanied by other
therapies.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.920
Your chiropractor may use heat or ice, electronic
muscle stimulation, cold laser or low-level

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.730
laser, and they may recommend therapeutic
stretches or other exercises to improve your

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.950
condition.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.720
It's important that you follow the recommendations
of your chiropractor for home care, as we

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.349
want to make sure that what's happening at
home is supporting what happens in the office.
