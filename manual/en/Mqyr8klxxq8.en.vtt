00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:16.000
I'll confess that it feels strange travelling in the company of those strange creatures.
Take it easy, with the amount of lead in him he won't be a danger to anyone.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.300
And did you discover anything in Marianito's village?
Nothing!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:41.000
Those poor guys are literally terrorized by a monstrous being and to hear them tell it he's an evil spirit that shows up in the night. But from the description that they gave he resembles your ape, covered with thick fur and with lots of teeth and claws like a wolf.
But the difference is that the one they see goes around wrapped in a large cloak.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.100
And how do you know about him?
You're not telling me anything new. They said the same things in Cavallo Zoppo's village.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:58.000
Could Thomas' father be a victim of those monsters?
Right now I don't know how to respond to that Kit but I'm convinced that once we arrive at the house of the doctor many mysteries will be clarified.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a pity that Valance and his indian friend left us without telling us anything.
Yeah, a real pity.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But surely that have accomplices around the house and I don't think it'll be too difficult to drive them out.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.300
I'm coming! I'm coming!

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.000
I'll let you in.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.500
What the devil! That man on the horse is Valance! He's dead!

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.500
What do you think? You weren't expecting that your ring leader would return home as a corpse?
No, I,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.500
You were thinking that we'd be in his place, right?
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.000
Close the door and come with us in the horse stables.
Sure, sure, as you wish.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:56.300
As you see it's not only the corpse of your friend Valance. Faithful Kaiva also wanted to follow his boss into the afterlife.
Devil!
But the surprises still aren't finished.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.500
Now raise the other cover and look what's under there.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
My God!
Surprised?
Well, you can say that again.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.000
Have you ever seen one of those?
Never! Ahhhh!

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
Heck! You must have detached his jaw.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.000
Get up you ugly idiot.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'll repeat the question but if you start telling me lies I'm gonna knock your teeth out.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.300
Have you ever seen an ape like that one?
Never! I already told you. Ahhhh!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.500
I warned you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
A damned hard head, eh?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Okay, since I don't want to scrape my knuckles on your head of granite, let's change the music.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.000
You! You!
Just a minute Willer! What are your intentions?
Come on, let him do what he wants!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now I'll take out all the bullets out of the gun except one.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Close it up.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Make it spin.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.000
Then arm the trigger.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.000
Now if I pull the trigger there's a five out of six possibility that the gun doesn't fire a bullet.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You're crazy. I, I, NO!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now I'll point the gun at your ugly head and try my questions again but you're in trouble if you repeat the lies.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.900
No, no! You can't!
Oh yes I can!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Well, come on, I told you that you have a five out of six probability being OK.
Embers in hell!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
No Willer!
Thomas go wait outside if this show it too much for your delicate stomach!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.800
Back to us my friend. Where have you seen a big ape like that one? Go! Respond!

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.800
I, I haven't,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.700
Decide or I'm pulling the trigger!

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.000
Nooo! No, no, enough, I'll tell you everything!

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.800
See Thomas? You were worried for no reason.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.200
Okay friend, get comfortable and tell us everything.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.900
It all started with a request from Dr Stevens for Valance.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:04:00.500
He was the one who requested that the dead bodies of the man-apes should disappear. We're talking about some young indian sheep herders that in the course of some of his experiments were transformed by mistake into monstrously evil creatures.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.000
They were equipped with incredible strength

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and tremendous agility.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.500
What's your intention Valance?
Have you noticed the strength of these monsters?
And so?

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.500
Come on Kaiva! If we're able to tame him and make him obey he could become very useful to us.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.000
You're thinking that?
Properly trained they could do all the robberies we could want. We just have to open their cages.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And how do you plan to get control of them?
A prod and whip with food as a reward.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I spent some time in a circus and I gained some experience with wild animals.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.200
And didn't Dr Stevens ask you to get rid of them?
He won't ever know and we'll get rich thanks to these man-apes.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.400
And so Valance started to control them using a prod and whip like the animal trainers in the circus.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.000
Kaiva and I were outside the cage with guns ready to intervene.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.300
One time one of the man-apes was killed.
Devils, what a story.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.900
After a while they obeyed his every command.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.500
And after having subdued them what did he do?
He started to use them in robberies.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:21.000
Valance constructed a special wagon to take them out of Dr Stevens house before each hit to bring things back.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.600
Their agility permitted them to climb walls of any building...

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.000
...and with their strength they could unhinge any iron grating.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Then we started to attack the convoys and stagecoaches that were transporting valuables.
And nobody sounded a warning?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
When the man-apes were seen we made sure there weren't any survivors so that their existence wouldn't be known.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So you were the famous gang that nobody was able to defeat!
Yes. We made some pretty good hits.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.500
And nothing ever went wrong?
It happened more than once and you know something about the last time.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:11.900
I'm talking about the two man-apes that were killed by the Mexican that was driving the wagon with silver. It was Valance e Kaiva that made their corpses disappear so that you wouldn't see them.
How many man-apes were killed up to now?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.900
Since we started to use them in robberies we've lost four of them without counting the two this evening.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.800
Four? My goodness, how many of them did you have?

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:31.900
In the course of the year Dr Stevens handed over about ten and Valance kept them all alive.
The doctor never ask what you did with them?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Sure but he trusted Valance because he told him that he took the man-apes far away from the house and burned their corpses and buried whatever the flames left behind.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Where did he keep them imprisoned?
Under the floor of the warehouse there's a vast underground cellar that Dr Stevens never utilized.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:03.000
Valance constructed cages and kept them there, one per cage because if they were put together they would have killed each other.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.500
How many of them are still in the cages?
The last two.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.200
Quick! You have to show them to us.
