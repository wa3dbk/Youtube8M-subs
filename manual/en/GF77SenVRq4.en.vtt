00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.487
Camcorders aren't cheap but they're incredibly
important. So when it comes time to rent or

00:00:03.487 --> 00:00:05.880
buy one for your production, knowing what
to look for can save you money and help you

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:14.850
get it right the first time.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:38.500
2.Segment Overview - With thousands of camcorders
to choose from, finding the most suitable

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.260
one for your project can be both mind-boggling
and extremely frustrating. To help you quickly

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.850
sift through all of the hype, we'll show you
what to look for such as quality optics, battery

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.860
technology, inputs and outputs, recording
media, and controls. Using this information,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.490
you should be able to quickly find a camera
that will help you to make your documentary

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.490
a reality.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.571
The first place to start with any camcorder
purchase is to figure out how your documentary

00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:05.909
will be distributed. If you'll be making the
documentary for internet use, a camera that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.520
films in standard or high definition should
do the trick. On the other hand, playing your

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.969
film in front of theater audiences will require
a camera that costs 10,000 dollars or more

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:20.899
and can shoot in resolutions of 2048x 1152
pixels or above. This is because theater owners

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.789
don't want to disappoint moviegoers by showing
footage at resolutions lower than film. This

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.850
requirement limits the options for cameras
to models that are fairly expensive. That's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.429
why if you plan on releasing your documentary
in theaters, it would be best to include more

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.590
money for cameras in your budget. Otherwise,
you'll want to consider releasing your project

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.289
on Blu-Ray or the internet instead where you
can keep your camera budget below 10,000 dollars.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.689
Of all the parts of a camera, the sensor is
the most integral. It is where the magic of

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.789
turning light into electricity, then into
ones and zeroes happens. That's why it's really

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.529
good to know what makes a sensor great.
i.There are three factors to look for in a

00:01:55.529 --> 00:02:02.319
sensor: size, resolution, and speed. Cameras
with larger sensors are expensive for a reason.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.619
Larger sensors give you a shallower depth
of field, which can help you to keep the focus

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.150
on your subject, and give off less noise in
low light. This is incredibly useful for documentaries

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.500
that require a lot of night shooting or indoor
shooting where light may be scarce. The best

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.560
sensors are those that are close to 36x24
mm across, which is the size of traditional

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.200
35mm film. This is also because most lenses
are built for 35mm sensors which gives you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.210
a much wider image. Interestingly enough,
many DSLR cameras that can shoot video have

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.357
much larger sensors than camcorders that with
similar costs. This is typically because these

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:30.357
cameras lack many of the features that professional
camcorders can offer such as XLR inputs. However,

00:02:30.357 --> 00:02:31.357
there are ways around the limitations of DSLRs
and due to their film-like images, many cinematographers

00:02:31.357 --> 00:02:32.357
are opting to use DSLRs instead of traditional
camcorders in their productions.

00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:33.357
ii.Resolution is another important factor
in good sensors. Since most televisions display

00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:37.750
images in the 16x9 aspect ratio, you'll want
to make sure your sensor can capture widescreen

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.630
footage. It's also best to get a camera that
can film at a 1920x1080 resolution. This is

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.380
because it's always easier to shrink a high
resolution image than it is to make a low

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.880
resolution image look good. Another advantage
of filming at 1920x1080 is that it is very

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.740
close to the 2K resolution that most theaters
require. With a little scaling, this footage

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.980
should be accepted in these theaters. In this
way, you won't have to break the bank to shoot

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.120
a documentary that will be playable on the
big screen.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.530
iii.Lastly, the speed of a sensor is another
important factor for your camera. This is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.810
because the faster the sensor images are processed,
the higher the frames it can shoot per second.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.190
The advantage here is that with a higher frame
rate, you'll be able to record high quality

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.510
slow motion footage for your documentary.
Finally, since all Hollywood films and high-end

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.660
documentaries shoot their video at 24 frames
per second, you'll want to make sure the sensor

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.910
you choose can shoot at that frame rate. This
way you can give your documentary the "film

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.100
look" that audiences have come to associate
with high-end productions.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.060
Many documentary crews frequently find themselves
either on the road or away from power sources

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.220
so having a long lasting battery can be a
lifesaver. Most batteries are rated in milliamps

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.440
per hour. This means the higher the mAh, the
longer the battery will last. If you will

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.600
be going on a shoot at a location without
power, it is a good idea to purchase several

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.900
high mAh batteries. Most people find that
it's better to spend a few hundred dollars

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.870
on batteries than to not get the shot you
need to sell your documentary.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.810
The next factor to consider is the inputs
and outputs that your camera has. Some of

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.300
the most important inputs to have are XLR
inputs. Most professional microphones use

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.150
XLR inputs so by not having one on your camera,
you'll be limiting the microphones you can

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.070
use. When it comes to outputs, it is essential
to have an HDMI, composite, or HD-SDI port

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.570
so that you can use an external monitor while
shooting. External monitors help several people

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.180
to see a preview at the same time and allow
an operator to easily determine focus. If

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.200
you plan to have producers or directors on
your shoot, having these outputs are a necessity.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.340
It is also good to have either FireWire or
USB outputs on your camera for computers that

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.540
do not have card readers.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.450
There's nothing worse when you're in a hurry
than having to wait. That's why it can be

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.010
very helpful to record your footage on either
SD or CF cards. Both of these formats are

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.560
fairly inexpensive, can be put on your editing
computer faster than real time, and can capture

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.610
more footage than mini-DV tape. You can also
capture directly to hard drives, but with

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.910
a lack of moving parts, SD and CF cards are
still the medium of choice.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.410
Lastly, it's important to make sure that the
camcorder you rent or buy has a bevy of external

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.010
controls. It can be very frustrating to have
to browse through a menu to do the simplest

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.800
of corrections so the more you can do externally,
the better. Of all external controls, the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.520
most important are a ring for focus, zoom,
and the iris, and a dial for shutter speed.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.400
Including these features on camcorders makes
them more expensive, but the time they save

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.280
on a shoot makes them worth every penny.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.260
Though all of these factors are helpful to
have on a camera, there are still instances

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.330
where smaller can be better. Big cameras tend
to intimidate people and attract attention

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.260
so for interviews and large crowds, a smaller
camera is best. Also, if you're planning on

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.160
doing a lot of travel, having a more compact
camera can help you to conserve energy. Even

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.510
so, with the right cases and good planning,
having a larger camcorder with many of the

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.980
features we covered will always work best.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.139
New cameras come out almost every day. So
hopefully, with the information we've shown,

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:56.699
you'll be able to find a camera that can take
your documentary to the next level.
