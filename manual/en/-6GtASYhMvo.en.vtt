00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Narrator] We've been considering sensor-less planning in a deterministic world.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now I want to turn our attention to                                    partially observable planning

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but still in a deterministic world.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Suppose we have what's called local sensing,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that is our vacuum can see what location

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it is in and it can see

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
what's going on in the current location, that is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
whether there's dirt in the                                                                   current location or not,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but it can't see anything about

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
whether there's dirt in any other location.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So here's a partial diagram of the--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
part of the belief state from that world,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and I want it to show

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
how the belief state unfolds

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
as 2 things happen.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
First, as we take action,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so we start in this state,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and we take the action of going right,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and in this case we still go

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
from 2 world states in our belief state

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to 2 new ones,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but then, after we do an action,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we do an observation, and we have the act

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
precept cycle, and now,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
once we get the observation,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we can split that world,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we can split our belief state to say,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
"If we observe that we're in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
location B and it's dirty, then we know

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we're in this belief state here,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
which happens to have                                                                    exactly 1 world state in it,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and if we observe that we're clean

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
then we know that we're in this state,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
which also has exactly 1 in it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now what is the act-observe cycle do

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to the sizes of the belief states?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Well in a deterministic world,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
each of the individual world states within

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a belief state maps into exactly 1 other one.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's what we mean by deterministic,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and so that means the size of the belief state

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
will either stay the same or it might decrease

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
if 2 of the actions sort of accidentally

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
end up bringing you to the same place.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
On the other hand, the observation

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
works in kind of the opposite way.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
When we observe the world, what we're doing

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is we're taking the current belief state and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
partitioning it up into pieces.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Observations alone can't introduce

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
a new state--a new world state                                             into the belief state.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
All they can do is say,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
"Some of them go here and                                                                  some of them go here."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now maybe that for some observation

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
all the belief states go into 1 bin,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and so we make an observation

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that we don't learn anything new, but at least

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
the observation can't make us more confused

00:02:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
than we were before the observation.
