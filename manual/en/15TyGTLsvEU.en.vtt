[slow piano]

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.840

I actually met Robbie
when I was 11 years old.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.400
To be partners on stage is great.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.340
We already have so much chemistry
that it just feels so natural.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.400
Maybe if we had to hate each other
that might be trying to fake it, but

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.400
[laughs]

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.680
we could probably do that too.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.100
[both laughs]

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.140
(FAIRCHILD)
We've been off and on
since we were 14.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.300
(PECK) The timing was just right this time.
(FAIRCHILD) So it goes way back.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.377
(FAIRCHILD)
I started communicating
with the press department

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.700
with the New York City Ballet,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.960
and we made up a
fake photo shoot in Paris.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.200
My favorite spot in Paris
is the top of the Sacré-Cœur.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.780
As soon as we got there,
it started raining.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.720
She started complaining,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.300
because she thought we were
gonna be late for the photo shoot.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.700
(PECK)
Then he got down on his knee

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.960
and I just started crying
and the whole thing.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.180
And then it got sunny
and we could see everything.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.240
[smooch]

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.920
(PECK) Now you have lipstick.
(FAIRCHILD) Aw man.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.900
(PECK)
We do this in "Fancy".

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.440
This is actually a
Jerome Robbins ballet,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.880
called "Fancy Free."

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.040
It is one of the
funest ballets to dance.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.780
The great thing about a partner

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.220
is that you can do things
that you can't do by yourself,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.440
so if you feel like you're
dancing on air,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.020
you're definitely on the right track.
[laughs]

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.140
Lately we've gotten
to dance together a lot.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.520
(FAIRCHILD)
Christopher Wheeldon choreographed
a new part on us,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.120
and we're extremely excited.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.280
(PECK)
First two weeks, you're basically
all I'm dancing with.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.300
(FAIRCHILD)
I know.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.520
(PECK)
Uh oh.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.920
So there's this moment,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.660
in the new Christopher Wheeldon
piece that we're dancing together,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.220
that goes like...

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:54.140
that,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.700
and when we were in the studio,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.600
pre-engagement,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.580
you know working on it,
and then we come back,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.540
one with her ring on it,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.860
and he just stopped
and he goes,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.380
"Oh! I didn't even plan it,
that's so sweet, I had no idea!"

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.000
(PECK)
This spring season is featuring an
American Music Festival.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.920
We've got some great ballets coming:

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.100
"Fancy Free," um...

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.900
(FAIRCHILD) "West Side Story."
(PECK) "West Side Story."

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.820
(PECK)
"Stars and Stripes" goes,
"Who Cares?"

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.240
(FAIRCHILD)
I think it's a huge blessing,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.640
a huge treat, to get to share

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.020
something you've worked
your whole life for,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.040
you know, dancing, you get
to share those moments

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.500
on stage with someone you share

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.480
every other moment in life with.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.160
I think that's so rare.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.240
(PECK)
It's really special,
especially at this time.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.260
(FAIRCHILD) Mm-hmm.
(PECK) Yeah.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.900
[PECK laughs]
