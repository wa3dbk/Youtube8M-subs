00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.860
Germany's Romantic Road, the next leg of our journey, can't be done by train. It's best explored 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.710
by rental car. We'll have this car for two days

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.099
 and drop it in Munich.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.759
You can arrange your car rental before leaving home.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.439
Prices vary dramatically from month to month,

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.820
country to country, and from company to company, so shop around.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.849
Even if you don't plan on driving, bring your license.

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.629
Your American license generally works just fine.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:35.250
It's fun, and it's easy, to rent a car on a whim.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.050
There's nothing exotic about driving in Europe.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.840
While the British drive on the left,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640
everyone on the continent drives on the same side as we do in the USA.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.060
Filling the tank here, whether diesel or gas, is like filling the tank back home.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.010
Except it's Euros and liters rather than dollars and gallons.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.300
Figure four liters per gallon.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.980
Don't overreact to Europe's high cost of gas. Over here, cars get great mileage,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.989
and distances are short.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.780
Rental cars come with a basic insurance policy,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.370
but the deductible can be really high.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.520
You can pay extra for zero deductible, for your peace of mind,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.480
but first, check with your insurance company at home to see how well you're already

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.750
covered in Europe.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.370
When driving, to cover long distances in a hurry,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.810
use the freeway.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.540
This is Germany's autobahn.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.520
Like most of Europe, Germany's laced with these super freeways. And around here,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.690
fast driving is considered a civil liberty.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.540
On the autobahn, you'll learn quickly —
the fast lane is used only for passing.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.540
Cruise in the left lane, and you'll have a Mercedes up your tailpipe. 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.950
Here and throughout Northern Europe, the autobahn is toll free.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.400
In France and countries south of Germany, these super freeways usually come with tolls.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.630
Learn some navigation basics.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.659
In Germany,

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.909
"zentrum" means "center"

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.810
A giant letter "P" means parking.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.690
And this icon means autobahn.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.309
Color coding and arrows point you in the right direction.

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.049
And while many travelers go through their entire trips thinking all roads lead

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.430
to the town of Ausfahrt,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.649
"ausfahrt" is German for "exit."

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.529
This sign means traffic circle or roundabout.

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:29.749
Merge safely into the circle and take the exit for the direction you're heading.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.769
If you're not sure, relax,

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.769
take an extra loop, and explore your
options.

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:39.999
Entering a new town 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.279
— this is Dinkelsbuhl — it's safe to
assume that the church spire marks the center.

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.489
and the tourist office is nearby.

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.769
Old town centers are increasingly
difficult to drive in —

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.589
one-way streets or closed to cars entirely.

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.129
Drive as close as you can and find a place to park.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.949
Confirm you're parked legally.

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.719
Your time's valuable.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.569
Just pay to park.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.539
Know the key road symbols. They're the same
throughout Europe. No parking anytime.

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:11.539
No traffic allowed. Wrong way — don't enter.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:15.259
This means no cars or bikes from 8:00 till midnight.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:16.629
No passing.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.139
And you know this one.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.029
Make educated guesses.

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.359
With this one, be ready for anything.

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.829
I navigate by town names because road
numbers on maps often don't match the signs.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.339
Distances and speeds are in kilometers.

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:39.799
On this road, 80 kilometers an hour.

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.159
A kilometer is 6/10 of a mile.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.419
To change to miles, cut the kilometers in half, add back 10% of the original.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.559
So, 80 kilometers per hour would be

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.889
40 plus 8 — 48 miles per hour.

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.189
Beware — photo speed traps
can be really expensive.

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.269
And those with rental cars are billed by mail. Save time and avoid

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.129
wasted car rental days by picking up and dropping off your car 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.879
in different cities

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.709
like Rothenburg and Munich.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.079
When using a bigger company

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.809
with many branches, you can generally do this
anywhere in the same country

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:17.859
for no extra charge. While dropping a car in a different country usually comes 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.139
with a high fee, it can also be a great convenience.
