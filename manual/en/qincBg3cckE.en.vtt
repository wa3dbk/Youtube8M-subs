00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.089
Hi everyone

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.349
This my review of the Ravelli
professional sixty five inch carbon

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:10.929
fiber tripod.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.949
I've had this tripod only about a month

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.029
so it won't be a comprehensive review.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.140
I'll try to point out some of the
features and give you a quick overview

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.069
and hopes that it will help you make
your purchasing decision.

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:28.109
Ravelli provides a soft lightly padded
carry bag that opens at one end has an

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.750
external utility pouch and two adjustable
length straps that could be adjusted from

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.140
19 inches to 37 inches.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.380
They also include a spare base plate.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.910
Thanks lightweight construction, the entire
package ways in less than four pounds

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.790
It's not going to be the sturdiest
tripod especially when fully extended

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.800
but when weight is a consideration

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.600
you'll have to make some concessions.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.860
Ravelli has thoughtfully included a
column mounted spring loaded hook that

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.900
will allow you to add weight to the
tripod for added stability.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.630
Two foam rubber pads cover the legs with
one leg left uncovered.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.800
Typically you would grip these legs, or hoist them on your shoulder,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.280
so a third foam pad is generally unnecessary

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.290
The central column is height adjustable
with a twist of a single rubber 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.510
friction knob

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.880
 and extends about one foot high.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.369
In order to maximize your tripod
stability it should be the last resort.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.590
went raising the height of the tripod.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.360
A grey plastic pushbutton

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.990
at the top of each leg

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.320
allows you to lock the legs at two preset angles

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.690
or fold them completely for compact
transport.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.380
The default friction on the legs is a bit
stiff,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.140
but you could loosen them up with a 5/32nd inch hex key.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.159
A detachable three-way ball head weighs in
at about ten and a half ounces and

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.140
stands about three three-quarters inches
high

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.540
the largest knob allows you to adjust your camera angle and tilt,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.430
while a smaller knob at the base controls the
pan friction.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.010
A knob near the base plate blocks the
plate into place and a silver safety

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.610
lock button keeps the plate from
slipping off head accidentally.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.429
For portraits, the ball head cut-out allows
for vertical camera orientation

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.479
Overall the panning is smooth and highly dampened.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:20.439
You could even uses for light video
camera in a pinch but only for smooth 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.829
panning motion.

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.859
The Ravelli tripod represents a good
balance of price and performance.

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.329
With careful use of handling it should
last a long time.

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.649
If you need something more sturdy that
will stand up to a heavier camera longer

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.959
zoom lenses, and  frequent travel

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.169
this probably isn't your best option.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:43.370
However, if you are looking for a carbon fiber
tripod at an aluminum price,  it's hard to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.949
beat the Ravelli.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.529
Thanks for your time and happy shooting.
