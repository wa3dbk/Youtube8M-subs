00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:02.752
- Thought that like it was
more like 2010 that like women

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:06.026
were being objectified,
but I feel like it started

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:07.963
earlier than I thought.

00:00:12.725 --> 00:00:14.002
- Well I was born in '96.

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.428
I kind of missed the whole 90's thing.

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:17.171
- '98.

00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:18.750
- I was born in 1998 as well.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.888
- I love Wu-Tang Clan.

00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:21.366
- [Male Teen] This what high
school is supposed to be like?

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.739
- [Female Teen] I hope so.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.437
- You know I never
really thought about the

00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:27.612
naughty private school girl
until I saw this video.

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:28.250
- Right.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.725
- I wish school was just dancing.

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:30.665
- [Female Teen] I know.

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:32.790
- It's like a dirty high school musical.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.502
I love this song 'cause it was on Glee.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.617
- Why is his hair white?

00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:37.882
- [Male Teen] Oh my god.

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:38.776
(female teen giggles)

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:40.505
- [Female Teen] Oh and she's
like, there's no problem,

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.143
this little girl just
picked up my underwear.

00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:43.466
- Reminds me of Anaconda.

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.557
- [Female Teen] But, but...

00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:45.637
- Anaconda if it's Diane.

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:46.682
- But a little more like tame.

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:48.365
- He's just saying thong a lot.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:49.944
- [Female Teen] What are those gloves?

00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:51.279
- Lots of, ah...

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:53.926
- [Female Teen] Oh, that was
kind of twirking, sort of.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.365
- See what's funny is
that like in the 90's,

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:58.195
all their like bathing
suits was really scandalous.

00:00:58.195 --> 00:00:59.553
And now it's normal.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.389
- Oh my god.

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.466
- [Female Teen] Wow, this
is next level graphics.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.802
- Yeah, why is everything blue?

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:08.742
That's what I wanna know.

00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:10.285
I mean I just wanna know what, you know,

00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:11.644
gave them the inspiration this song.

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:12.643
- Maybe they're bluists.

00:01:12.643 --> 00:01:14.721
- [Female Teen] The special
effects are really bad.

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:17.043
- [Male Teen] Whoever edited
this must just have been

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:19.445
like, ah, my life is over at this point.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.824
- Oh, oh, oh, frosted tips
guy, he's gonna getcha.

00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:24.426
- [Male Teen] Those are
coming back, I feel it.

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.458
- [Male Teen] Alright
Missy Elliott, The Rain.

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:28.257
Don't know a lot about Missy Elliott.

00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:29.464
- [Female Teen] What does she do?

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.129
I don't, is it a girl?

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:34.670
- She's wearing like a black satin suit

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.528
that kinda looks like a trash bag.

00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:38.697
- Do people think this is normal?

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:40.032
- [Male Teen] I'm still
amazed by her hair.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:40.868
Seriously like-

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:41.947
- Just the weave, you know?

00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:42.853
- I thought it was a hat.

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:46.348
- I don't believe that this
is a serious music video.

00:01:46.348 --> 00:01:47.706
Like I feel like this is a parody.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.030
- [Female Teen] Ah, this song is so good.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.854
She's like a leopard in the desert.

00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:53.096
- [Male Teen] Her clothes
look like my bedspread.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:54.548
I used to have that when I was a kid.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.231
- [Female Teen] I feel like
this is like if you went out

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.390
like this in the 90's,
like people would just say,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.295
yeah, okay.

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:00.910
- Why would she go off
in the desert by herself/

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.361
- Song is really annoying actually.

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.226
- It's like Taylor Swift,
but with leopard print.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.350
- Yeah, I would say 90's
videos are, I don't know,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.369
much more abstract than current-

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.933
- Yeah, 'cause now it's like, oh,

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.776
let's stick a butt in there.
