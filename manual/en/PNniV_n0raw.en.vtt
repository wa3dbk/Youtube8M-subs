00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.868
Oman with some water because sea trade is
incredible

00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:03.997
River, no mountain, we'll manage

00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:07.458
Vineyards up north, learned Archery for Artemis

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:08.687
Need more cities

00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:10.027
Travel to the mountain

00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:13.688
75 turns for one Library, 6 for the other

00:00:13.688 --> 00:00:15.438
Take to the sea!

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:17.098
Watch out for work boats

00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:18.598
Exploring the isles

00:00:18.598 --> 00:00:19.798
Third city says hello

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:22.628
From there, more Settlers appear

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:25.938
Also George wants to trade - something about
teeth

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:28.008
Instant advanced archers

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:29.588
Also need a granary right away

00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:32.117
How to get Notre Dame

00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:34.348
Step one: hurry production

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:35.348
All done.

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:36.658
Easy to expand more.

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:40.578
It seems peaceful but Machu Picchu will be
ours eventually

00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:42.438
We burn it to the ground!

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:43.477
Spoilers.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.768
Distribute more hammers along the coast

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:48.448
Used a Great Engineer to get another Great
Engineer

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.698
Then used that Engineer for the Globe Theatre

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:53.098
But Austria got it first!

00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:54.817
So I got 500 bucks instead.

00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:55.907
Good enough.

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:58.527
Markets and castles - no Education yet

00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:02.218
Scratch that, we're learned, even got Astronomy

00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:04.738
Navigation spells doom for all

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:06.688
Hope no one gets seasick

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:07.688
Close your eyes and shoot

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:09.468
That was easy!

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.448
It can't be that simple.

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:13.448
Intimidation!

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.448
It worked.

00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:16.368
Well enjoy your town while you can.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.908
Mecca isn't Arabian for long.

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:22.298
Building boats, opera houses, and harbor replacements

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.868
Then again, the World's Fair should be dominated

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:26.608
Golden Age - because gold

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:28.268
Also war again

00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:30.107
Gotta have some Mecca of our own

00:01:30.107 --> 00:01:31.458
We are you!

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.128
Here comes a Zoo!

00:01:33.128 --> 00:01:34.668
Good job, crew!

00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:35.878
Don't let 'em take it back

00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:37.478
Sounds like a plan, man

00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:40.158
Calm waves again, this can't last

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:42.078
Hunt for plunder-ables

00:01:42.078 --> 00:01:43.078
Found some!

00:01:43.078 --> 00:01:45.938
I made 600 dollars- ask how!

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.518
Minor warmonger?

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:48.788
Reasonable

00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:50.538
Gonna go for for the title

00:01:50.538 --> 00:01:52.438
Then raze the prize

00:01:52.438 --> 00:01:54.978
Everyone loves razed prizes

00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:56.578
Engineerin' for Oman

00:01:56.578 --> 00:01:58.678
Messed with Texas

00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:00.288
Might need some Seattle

00:02:00.288 --> 00:02:01.768
Mmm fresh roasted

00:02:01.768 --> 00:02:03.188
He says stop

00:02:03.188 --> 00:02:05.058
She says "are we fighting?"

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.527
I say ya

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:08.757
And that's how the siege began

00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:11.117
Not my fault, I was just passing through

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:13.557
Whenever they pass through they become us

00:02:13.557 --> 00:02:17.367
A quick war for the books - silly lady, doesn't
know who she's messing with

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:19.507
Look at our amazing Tourism!

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.507
Uhh, I gotta fix that

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.578
We'll keep cool with fridges in a few turns

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:26.167
Also unleash submarines

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:27.938
Can't forget about Culture

00:02:27.938 --> 00:02:30.108
Tourism organized, yet horrendous

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.658
Then again, art is subjective

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:37.007
Cathedrals are scary

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.647
As is country on country violence

00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:40.737
F-words

00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:42.408
For surrounding Austria

00:02:42.408 --> 00:02:46.138
Along with Privateers, Submarines, and Chandler

00:02:46.138 --> 00:02:48.367
Could you BE anymore terrified?

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:52.018
San Francisco reached out for Wine and Bananas

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:54.298
Rationalism done so free meds

00:02:54.298 --> 00:02:56.867
Next stop, death from science

00:02:56.867 --> 00:02:59.328
Not sure who's the bigger threat

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:01.097
Well we're the biggest threat

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:02.158
Even got a Kremlin

00:03:02.158 --> 00:03:03.977
It was the Kremlin

00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:06.018
Soon: the ability to build nukes

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:07.018
So Settle all the Uranium

00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:08.268
And do some building

00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:10.067
This is the radioactive town

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:13.007
Actually Chicago looks a bit radioactive too

00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:15.528
This bit of America isn't a problem

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.317
Just sink everything

00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:19.757
They don't dare venture south

00:03:19.757 --> 00:03:21.877
That arrangement is fine dude

00:03:21.877 --> 00:03:24.347
We really have more important things going
on

00:03:24.347 --> 00:03:26.817
And eventually must destroy Austria

00:03:26.817 --> 00:03:28.317
Start by nuking it

00:03:28.317 --> 00:03:29.317
She didn't like that

00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:33.498
But, I just, this is, ugh

00:03:33.498 --> 00:03:34.498
Don't ask.

00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:38.287
It's only been like 15 turns but ok - Archaeologistics

00:03:38.287 --> 00:03:41.787
A violent Cultural win should be do-able

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.667
Not gonna bother with space

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:47.528
Gonna leave the planet in the fall - until
then, visit us on Earth

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:51.367
Then visit America - where our jeans are available

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:54.267
Austria and Arabia aren't quite fashionable

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.257
Geometry was never my thing

00:03:56.257 --> 00:03:57.947
Excelled at the games though

00:03:57.947 --> 00:03:59.737
Fancy Castles are alright

00:03:59.737 --> 00:04:01.817
Great Scientists are expensive

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:05.248
Would be easier to just have two opponents

00:04:05.248 --> 00:04:07.248
Do I take out red or green?

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:09.817
The Austrians don't like being bombed

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:12.197
She offers up part of Arabia

00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:14.487
Let's take all of Arabia

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.147
Nuclear missiles kill

00:04:16.147 --> 00:04:17.647
Was a one-two punch

00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:19.517
See - so much easier now

00:04:19.517 --> 00:04:21.748
The video of the destruction was destroyed

00:04:21.748 --> 00:04:24.348
No one needs to see that sort of stuff

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:26.498
Everyone look at our Holy Buildings!

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:28.278
And watch the skies for bombs

00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:30.697
Missile Cruisers assault Salzburg

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:32.237
Maria assaults back

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:34.697
War text aside, we're alright!

00:04:34.697 --> 00:04:36.398
More than alright!

00:04:36.398 --> 00:04:38.348
You could even say we're Popular

00:04:38.348 --> 00:04:40.357
Now Vienna needs a makeover

00:04:40.357 --> 00:04:42.528
I'll simply have to takeover

00:04:42.528 --> 00:04:43.528
I know!

00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:44.568
More missiles.

00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:45.568
Come on!

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:47.678
I wonder if she'll discuss a ceasefire

00:04:47.678 --> 00:04:48.678
Nope

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:51.017
Well... move in the XCOMS?

00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:52.648
Sounds like a great idea

00:04:52.648 --> 00:04:55.667
They are ready for action - Vienna is ours

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:58.538
Looks like the last bit of Austria will be
American

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:01.137
At which point, we will win - thanks George!

00:05:01.137 --> 00:05:02.318
Wave goodbye to red

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:05.038
And hello to Cultural Victory

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.947
Oh hey high scores

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:07.928
But it's July!
