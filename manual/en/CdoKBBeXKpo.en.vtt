00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.773
- Hi again!

00:00:01.773 --> 00:00:05.429
So today's video we are going
to be metallic blocking.

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:07.525
I've been adding metallic accents to

00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:09.497
all of my accessories this season,

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:11.893
and I've been having some amazing results.

00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:14.622
So, I'm here to share
it with you guys today.

00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:16.294
These are pretty easy to recreate,

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:18.712
and very inexpensive if you have like

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:22.228
shoes or a purse to recycle.

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:23.992
Okay, so to recreate this look,

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:26.842
you would need some scrap
papers, masking tape,

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:30.329
a tape measuring ruler,
spray adhesion promoter,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.384
metallic spray paint, and
lastly a gloss spray finish.

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:38.759
Okay, first step, and that
is to clean the surface

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:40.582
of where you will be painting.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.962
So take out a damp paper towel or towel,

00:00:42.962 --> 00:00:45.040
and clean that nicely.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.164
And also make sure that you
wipe away all the moisture.

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:49.580
So once that's fully dry,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.906
what you're going to do
next is take out your

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:53.709
tape measuring ruler,

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:56.858
and now you are going
measure where you'd like

00:00:56.858 --> 00:00:59.680
your metallic accent to be placed.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.061
So for my demonstration,

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:05.601
I am using my pumps, and I
like it to be two inch in.

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.086
So what I'm going to do now is take out

00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:10.725
a piece of masking tape
and mark where my line is.

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:15.378
So now I know for sure that
both shoes should be even,

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:18.411
and I'm going to mask around that area.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.682
Next thing I'm going to do
is take out my scrap paper

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:22.167
and wrap it around my shoes.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:23.560
If you have something bigger,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.763
then maybe you want to use more paper,

00:01:25.763 --> 00:01:28.599
but one sheet of paper is
enough to cover this whole shoe.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:29.643
So I'm going to cover the area

00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:32.592
where I don't want the paint to spray.

00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:37.121
In this example, I am
adding the metallic accent

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:38.536
to this purse.

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:40.560
So I'm gonna pretty
much do the same thing.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.996
Measure throughout the purse,

00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:44.005
and then lay the tape down.

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:45.235
Cover the rest of the area

00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:48.395
where I don't want the spray to hit.

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:51.813
In this next step, you want to make sure

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:54.867
to do this outdoors in
a fully ventilated area

00:01:54.867 --> 00:01:59.282
just because the fumes from
these sprays are pretty toxic.

00:01:59.282 --> 00:02:02.993
I am taking out my
spray adhesion promoter,

00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:05.380
and this is basically like a clear primer.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.646
It helps keep the paint onto the surface.

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:10.794
Now, what you want to do
is shake it up really well,

00:02:10.794 --> 00:02:14.198
and then spray it about a
foot away from your object.

00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:17.155
And let it sit for about one to two hours.

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:18.932
So after that's set,
you can start to spray

00:02:18.932 --> 00:02:20.585
on the metallic paint.

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:21.555
Before you do so,

00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:23.715
I recommend for you to
shake it really well.

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:27.048
And then spray on a piece of
paper or something like that

00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:31.130
before you spray on the
actual shoe or item.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.234
And then, once you spray on the item,

00:02:33.234 --> 00:02:35.317
keep it about a foot away for two,

00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:36.985
and spray really lightly.

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:40.665
I kind of made the mistake
of spraying a lot on at once,

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:42.981
and it took forever to dry.

00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:45.417
So don't make that same
mistake that I made.

00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:46.332
Spray it on lightly,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.327
and then let it sit for
about a couple hours

00:02:49.327 --> 00:02:52.326
before you spray on the next set of paint.

00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:55.292
And do this for about two more
times after the first time.

00:02:55.292 --> 00:02:57.185
So three times all together,

00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.415
and then let it sit overnight.

00:02:59.415 --> 00:03:02.109
And the next morning you
could spray on the gloss.

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.382
You want to let that sit
for a few more hours.

00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:07.262
Let it sit for about, I would say

00:03:07.262 --> 00:03:10.990
give it a good three hours or so.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.255
And then you can start to remove the tape.

00:03:38.275 --> 00:03:41.449
If you have some part where
the paint bleed through,

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.050
then just basically take
some nail polish remover

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.702
and a Q-tip and then you can
remove the unwanted paint off.

00:03:48.702 --> 00:03:50.400
So that is pretty much it guys.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.811
I hope you guys enjoy this project.

00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:53.778
Thumbs up for more,

00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:57.244
and remember to have fun creating.
