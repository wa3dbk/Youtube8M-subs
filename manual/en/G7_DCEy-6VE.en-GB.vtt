00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi everyone, today I am making a snack, a beef jerky with Shacha sauce.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You'd better choose a lean cut for this dish , not very tender, and better use the cut without too much fat and grain.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You can choose round or shin cut.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
As for the condiments, the big part is Shacha sauce, and I also add in a little turmeric root powder to compliment the flavor. Itâ€™s optional.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
First off, cut the beef into 2cm chunks and then blanch.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In a pot, add in the meat and water, make sure the beef is submerged under water. Cold water is fine.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Bring it to a boil, and then take out the meat.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And then rinse under running water to clean.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now peel and cut onion into quarters.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Cut ginger into slices.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now let's cook the beef. Add beef, onion and ginger slices into a pot.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Pour some cooking wine.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Pour in hot water, and make sure everything is submerged under water.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Bring it to a boil and then turn down the heat to low. Cook for about 30 minutes until tender.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now the beef are tender, and take out onion and ginger slices.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Transfer the beef broth into a container.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You can save this for other dishes as a beef stock.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Just leave a little in the pot.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Add in Shacha sauce.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And some sugar, and then turn up the heat to high to reduce the mixture.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Stir once in a while to evenly coat the beef with sauce.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Cook until there is only oil left at the bottom of the pot, add in ground pepper and turmeric root powder.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Mix well, and turn off the heat.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now, preheat the oven to 80C/176F.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil. Arrange the beef on the pan. Make sure your roasting pan is large enough to have all the beef on in a single layer without overlapping with each other.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Now pop them in the oven.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Cook under 80C/176F, fan mode, for about 1-2 hours.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
If your oven doesn't have the fan mode, just leave the door slightly open, so the beef will be dried quickly.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The time needed really depends on how do you like it to cook.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Since my beef has been cut into chunks, so I like it to be little tender, not too dry, so they won't end up very chewy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You can also use other condiments if you like, for example, you can make five spices beef jerky with five spices powder, hot and spicy beef jerky with chili bean paste.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Play and twist with your imagination. I hope you like this chewy little snack, the beef jerky with Shacha sauce, and thanks for watching.
