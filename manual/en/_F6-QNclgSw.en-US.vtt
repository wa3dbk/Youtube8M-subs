00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:37.720
already famous everywhere

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:51.420
cook rice into porridge

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.600
if it doesn't, what does it feel like?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.640
bone crying

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.160
In the tomb

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.220
my mood is grieving

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.540
Because my love was cut off by him

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.680
Already promised to get married Tuesday

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.920
But now my love changes love

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.900
Shame that my heart can still be held back

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.260
But my name is what people say

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.360
I'd better go to a deep tomb

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.160
In order to finish history without memories
