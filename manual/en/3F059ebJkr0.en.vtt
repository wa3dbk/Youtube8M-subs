GRACE FRAGA: So Chantelle, now we've finished
painting, we've finished designing the--what

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.261
we wanted to do on this T-shirt, what is the
next step? CHANTELLE TIBBS: The next step

00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:11.190
is to make sure that everything that we've
added, everything that we have touched up,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.870
make sure that everything is completely and
totally dry. But before we put the dryers

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.380
on, we're drying the last touches, we're going
to take this tweener out in the middle. GRACE

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.260
FRAGA: The famous tweener. CHANTELLE TIBBS:
So, I've got the tweener. I'm going to take

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.500
this tweener out so that it dries. GRACE FRAGA:
It sounds like wiener. CHANTELLE TIBBS: It

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.740
sounds like--I don't know what the rate is--this
is an X-rated show. GRACE FRAGA: Oh, no. I'm

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.890
talking about the... CHANTELLE TIBBS: No,
I was kidding... GRACE FRAGA: ...hotdogs.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.149
What? CHANTELLE TIBBS: Oh. GRACE FRAGA: Wow.
CHANTELLE TIBBS: I'm sorry. My mind always--see

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.859
it went to the gutter. But look at my company
name. GRACE FRAGA: Mine too. I'm just covering.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.079
CHANTELLE TIBBS: Look at my company name,
and aren't you surprised? GRACE FRAGA: Yeah,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.079
WearMeNaked.com. Check them out. CHANTELLE
TIBBS: Dirty mind. GRACE FRAGA: This is so

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.859
cool. CHANTELLE TIBBS: All right. So, we're
going to turn the dryer on here. We're going

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.999
to make sure that we dry everything. This
isn't going to take as long to dry as the

00:00:53.999 --> 00:01:02.600
others. GRACE FRAGA: All right. So we're finished
drying the T-shirts with the hair dryer, and

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.470
before we go I want to see what are some of
the tips that you have for people when they're

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.600
hand painting a T-shirt? CHANTELLE TIBBS:
Okay. This is the--the tips as I've mentioned,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.770
you're using a lot of paint. You want to make
sure everything is completely and totally

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.100
dry. With the situation where you're using
a lot of paint, even if it's dry make sure

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.380
it's dry. My advice, just hang it up for a
bit. Hang it up by a window. Make sure. You

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.070
can never dry it too much, because you don't
want to create a problem and then it's bleeding

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.550
all over the place. That's not right. GRACE
FRAGA: Exactly, it's not right or it gets

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.410
on your shirt or whatever because I feel like--it's
a little wet still even though you kept drying

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.910
it, it still seems to be where the paint is
thick. CHANTELLE TIBBS: Yeah. GRACE FRAGA:

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.730
It still looks like it's wet a little bit.
CHANTELLE TIBBS: Yeah, it takes a little while.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.900
So, yeah, you want to make sure that it's--make
sure it's 100% dry before you put it on. It's

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.110
very, very, very, very important and I can't
stress enough, make sure that before you do

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.890
all of this drying, take your tweeners out.
I've had nightmare situations with that.
