00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:04.159
- [Orange] And welcome to the
second track, Toad Harbor!

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:06.061
- [Apple] The place where I
will be kicking your butt.

00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:08.092
- [Orange] If only you
could reach it. (laughs)

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:09.211
- [Apple] Was that another small joke?

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:10.599
- [Orange] I think you
underestimated how much

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.998
Mario Kart I've played, little buddy.

00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:15.083
I've got Toad Town track
ingrained into my muscle memory.

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:16.886
Later loser! (laughs)

00:00:16.886 --> 00:00:18.771
- [Apple] Ah, whoa! Holy cannoli!

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.322
You took that first turn perfectly.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:21.932
- [Orange] I know, that's what I'm saying.

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:24.442
- [Apple] I might be in a
little over my head here.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:26.493
- [Orange] Said the little
apple wading in the shallow end.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.421
(laughs)

00:00:28.421 --> 00:00:29.880
- [Apple] Ooh! What's this?
What's this? What's this?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.237
Oh! It's a boomerang!

00:00:31.237 --> 00:00:32.433
Watch out world!

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:33.266
- [Orange] Why?

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.799
- [Apple] Well,
specifically, look out, Toad,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.393
'cause I've got yo number! Whoo-ya!

00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:38.503
(laughs) Right in the back of the head

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:40.901
- [Orange] (laughs) Good job. Aw, man.

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:42.278
Boomerang is such a weird word.

00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:43.111
- [Apple] It is?

00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:44.582
- [Orange] Definitely.
Say it a bunch of times.

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.355
It gets weirder and weirder
the more you say it.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:48.403
- [Apple] Boomerang. Boomerang.

00:00:48.403 --> 00:00:49.236
- [Orange] Boomerang.

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:50.069
- [Apple] Boomerang.

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.902
- [Orange] Boomerang.

00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:51.735
- [Apple] Boomerang.

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:52.568
- [Orange] Boomerang.

00:00:52.568 --> 00:00:53.401
- Boomerang.
- Boomerang.

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.234
- Boomerang.
- Boomerang.

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:55.067
- Boomerang.
- Boomer--

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:57.688
- [Apple] Oh yeah, there it
is. It just got weird. (laughs)

00:00:57.688 --> 00:00:59.538
- [Orange] (laughs) Yup,
told ya so. (laughs)

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:01.169
Hey whoa whoa hey whoa!

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:02.096
Whoa! What just happened?

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:03.722
- [Apple] You just got annihilated, dude.

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.206
You just got knocked out of the lead.

00:01:05.206 --> 00:01:06.522
- [Orange] Wha? I was in the lead?

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:07.355
- [Apple] Sorry.

00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:08.719
- [Orange] Oh yeah? Well
what place are you in?

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.779
- [Apple] Uh, I'm in none
of your business place.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.787
- [Orange] (laughs) Thought so.

00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:15.173
- [Apple] Whatever. I'm
catchin' up. Oh no, maybe not.

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:16.546
- [Orange] Time for a short cut.

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:18.512
- [Apple] Seriously? How do
you know this track so well?

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:20.684
I had no idea you were
such a Mario Kart ringer.

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:21.942
- [Orange] Yeah, well I'm
a ringer with yo' fingers

00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:24.018
that's a really great singer (laughs)

00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:24.851
Hey, you wanna hear me sing?

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:25.684
- [Apple] No.

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:26.711
- [Orange] You sure? I'm really good.

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:27.544
- [Apple] No thank you.

00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:28.377
- [Orange] I kinda want to.

00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:29.210
- [Apple] I could tell.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.651
- [Orange] All right. Lap two.

00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:31.913
- [Apple] Oh oh! Don't look now Orange,

00:01:31.913 --> 00:01:33.246
I'm hot on your tail.

00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:34.714
- [Orange] I couldn't even
look even if I wanted to.

00:01:34.714 --> 00:01:35.547
(laughs)

00:01:35.547 --> 00:01:37.096
- [Apple] This is where
little Apple turns the table.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:40.054
It's where I dive into
the ocean. Gosh darn it.

00:01:40.054 --> 00:01:42.318
- [Orange] (laughs) Aw, man.

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.517
I totally spun out and
did a dance. (laughs)

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:46.022
- [Apple] Okay, Mario Kart,
give me something good.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:47.587
Give me something really really good.

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:49.004
Stop giving me mushroom!

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:49.837
- [Orange] Laughs

00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:50.670
- [Apple] Find a round.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.686
- [Orange] I hate it when that happens.

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:52.519
- [Apple] It's not fair.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:53.650
- [Orange] Power ups are my specialty.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.686
Let's get something good. Oh yeah!

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:57.176
I got a piranha plant. Eat it.

00:01:57.176 --> 00:01:58.715
- [Apple] Oh yeah? I'm gonna
get something good this time.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:01:59.996
I gotta get something good.

00:01:59.996 --> 00:02:01.445
Yes! Yes, I got a star.

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:04.815
Oh yeah, I wanna listen to the music. Shh.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:05.725
- [Orange] You know, I
can sing that for you

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:06.760
anytime you want, right?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.593
- [Apple] Orange, don't.

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:08.522
- [Orange] What? I'm a really good singer.

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:09.355
You know that, right?

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:10.188
- [Apple] Orange, I'm trying to listen.

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:11.021
Aw, man. It's over.

00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:11.854
- [Orange] That's all
right. I can sing it for ya.

00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:13.408
- [Apple] No.
(Orange sings tune)

00:02:13.408 --> 00:02:14.640
- [Apple] Stop it.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.620
(Orange sings tune)
- Oh you screwed me up.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.180
(Orange sings tune)
- Knock it off!

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.574
- [Orange] (laughs)

00:02:19.574 --> 00:02:20.597
- [Apple] You're totally ruining it.

00:02:20.597 --> 00:02:21.878
- [Orange] What? Am I
getting into your head?

00:02:21.878 --> 00:02:22.930
- [Apple] No. No you're not.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.687
Wh-whoa! I didn't know
I could do back flips.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:26.520
- [Orange] You can?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.827
- [Apple] Yeah. I just did
another one, too. Oh yeah.

00:02:28.827 --> 00:02:29.705
- [Orange] Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:31.541
But I can do a triple
trombone Zamboni flip.

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:32.563
You wanna see? (laughs)

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:34.268
- [Apple] That's not a
thing. That's not a thing.

00:02:34.268 --> 00:02:36.200
Uh oh. You got ink on your screen.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.033
- [Orange] What's that now?

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:38.306
- [Apple] You got ink on your screen.

00:02:38.306 --> 00:02:39.829
Aw man, I'm an idiot.

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.627
- [Orange] Yeah, you should
probably pay attention

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:42.567
to your own screen. (laughs)

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:44.215
- [Apple] Man, that's what I
get for trying to help you.

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:45.340
- [Orange] All right.
Give me something good.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.774
Give me something good.
Give me something good.

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:49.026
Oh yeah! More bananas.

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:50.226
- [Apples] You've got to be kidding me.

00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:52.144
- [Orange] Spinnin'
bananas. Spinnin' bananas.

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:53.464
Spinnin' bananas everywhere! Spinnin'!

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.147
- [Apple] Oh please
give me something good.

00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:58.233
- [Orange] Yeah, eat
that, Toad. How's it feel?

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:00.565
- [Apple] Ugh, all right! All
right. I got a gold mushroom.

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:02.800
Here we go. I'm gonna
blast my way over to you.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.837
I'm gonna catch up with you.

00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:04.670
- [Orange] Yeah right.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.298
- [Apple] Here I come. Blasted.
Blasted. Blasted. Blasted.

00:03:06.298 --> 00:03:07.131
- [Orange] Yeah, keep on dreaming.

00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:08.916
- [Apple] And I'm just,
I moved up one place.

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:09.749
- [Orange] You moved up one place.

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:10.710
- [Apple] I moved up one place to ninth.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.840
- [Orange] Now you dropped two places.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.673
- [Apple] Now I'm in
11th. How did this happen?

00:03:12.673 --> 00:03:14.368
- [Orange] Only you
could get a gold mushroom

00:03:14.368 --> 00:03:15.715
and actually drop two places. (laughs)

00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:18.376
- [Apple] I'm gonna
drop you! Just you wait!

00:03:18.376 --> 00:03:19.327
- [Orange] What am I waitin' for?

00:03:19.327 --> 00:03:20.848
- [Apple] You're waitin' for the pain.

00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:22.751
And it's gonna come pretty soon.

00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:25.135
- [Orange] Those sound like
idle threats to me. (laughs)

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:26.493
- [Apple] Gosh darn it.

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:28.474
Every time I come this way
I always run into the wall.

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.628
Every single time.

00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:32.168
- [Orange] Green shell, green
shell. I'm gonna call you Mel!

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:33.242
- [Apple] Let me guess,
you're calling it Mel

00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:34.276
just because it rhymes?

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.939
- [Orange] No. I'm just calling
it Mel for a spell. (laughs)

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:37.772
- [Apple] Stop it.

00:03:37.772 --> 00:03:38.789
- [Orange] Wave to the pretty people.

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.223
Winner winner chicken dinner.

00:03:40.223 --> 00:03:41.056
- [Apple] Stop gloating.

00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:42.010
- [Orange] Wavin' wavin' wavin'.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.666
Hey there, how's it going? I'm the winner.

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:45.029
- [Apple] Oh yes. I got a
gold mushroom. Let's see.

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.118
I gotta catch up. I gotta get
a little bit higher place.

00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:49.077
Ah, oh no.

00:03:49.077 --> 00:03:50.048
- [Orange] (laughs)

00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:51.683
- [Apple] And with one last
t-boning of a street car,

00:03:51.683 --> 00:03:53.793
the worst race of my life
comes to a bitter end.

00:03:53.793 --> 00:03:54.817
- [Orange] What? Are you giving up?

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:56.432
- [Apple] No, I'm finishing
the Flower Cup, Orange.

00:03:56.432 --> 00:03:57.567
I have my pride.

00:03:57.567 --> 00:03:59.389
- [Orange] 12th place pride. (laughs)

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.222
- [Apple] I'll win the next race.

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:01.481
I still have a trick or two up my sleeve.

00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:03.000
- [Orange] Problem is
you've got no sleeves.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.608
You're naked. We're all naked.

00:04:04.608 --> 00:04:05.879
Have you ever really stopped
and really considered

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.963
how naked we all are? Like all
the time. Naked! Naked naked.

00:04:08.963 --> 00:04:09.796
- [Apple] Okay, moving on.
