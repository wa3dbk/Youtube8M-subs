00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.200
Daniel Berlant (VO):
Firefighting aircraft play a critical role

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.549
in supporting the fight against wildfires,
and CAL FIRE’s fleet remains ready year-round

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.559
to answer the call. The department has the
largest firefighting air fleet in the world,

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.830
but when the state is plagued with major wildfires
all at the same time, CAL FIRE is able to

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.650
call upon the military to help provide additional
aircraft.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.570
Ray Chaney – Battalion Chief, Air Operations:
When we have the fire sieges or these mega-fires,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.290
if you will, our ability to call upon Navy
and Marine Corp aviation is critical.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.850
Berlant (VO):
And to ensure this critical interagency cooperation

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
is ready for the peak fire season, firefighters
train each year with the California National

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.150
Guard, the Marine Corps and the Navy, giving
them a chance to work together to hone their

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.890
tactics and coordination. In mid-May Camp
Pendleton was the home to one of this year’s

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.890
trainings.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.780
Berlant – Camp Pendleton, San Diego County:
These military pilots are some of the best

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.120
in the world. They’re used to flying in
dangerous and hazardous conditions as they

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.930
fly combat missions overseas. But today’s
training will help these pilots prepare for

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.300
the battle against wildfires.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.899
Berlant (VO):
And part of the preparation involves military

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.110
pilots adapting to and practicing the unique
skills required for wildland firefighting.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.370
Tom Humann – CAL FIRE Helicopter Pilot:
When you get down to the nuts and bolts of

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.181
flying a helicopter, dropping water and picking
water up is a skill set that a military pilot

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:16.320
just isn’t used to doing.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.690
Berlant:
In addition to practicing this crucial skill,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.450
military pilots also become integrated into
the communication used during a wildfire.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.210
Tom Humann:
What’s unique is you saw one controlling

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.110
helicopter flying with all the military helicopters.
His sole job, in addition to coordinating

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.440
the fire, is also to provide that communications
link with the folks on the ground and other

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.440
folks in the air.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.360
Berlant (VO):
Experts say that it is essential that these

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.500
skills are developed now, before the peak
season begins.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Colonel Mike Naylor – Marine Installations
West:

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.760
It’s better to work it out when you’re
not in the heat of battle, as you might call

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.900
it, fighting the fire, so you work out any
issues or problems you might have.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.630
Berlant (VO):
And because CAL FIRE’s mission doesn’t

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.390
end at wildfires, officials also take the
opportunity to plan for coordination during

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.600
other types of emergencies.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.500
Ray Chaney:
We’re also, in these training sessions,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.750
when we talk to folks, we’re looking at
other incidents. Whether it be an earthquake,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.530
flood, tsunami, whatever the case may be,
whatever emergency CAL FIRE responds to, the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.110
relationship we have now with Navy and Marines
is going to pay off on an all-risk mission

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.611
no matter what we do in California.

00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.420
Berlant (VO):
When disaster strikes, no emergency response

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.200
agency can stand alone. Coordinators and partners,
like the National Guard, United States Marine

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.340
Corp and Navy play a vital role in helping
CAL FIRE protect the people and property of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.030
California. From Camp Pendleton in San Diego
County, Daniel Berlant, CAL FIRE TV.
