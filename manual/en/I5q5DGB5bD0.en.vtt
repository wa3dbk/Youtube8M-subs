Hello! My name is Ron Sanders of Personal
Touch Custom Auto World. This is my assistant

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.599
Sean Whitlock, and on behalf of Expert Village,
we are now going to apply the film to the

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.209
windows and cute the patterns. Again, we sprayed
the soap and water solution, what this allows

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.230
us to do is to apply the film, cause the film
to stick, and to maneuver it into position

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.810
as we cut the film. When cutting the film,
as Sean also has, he first squeegees it down

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.630
to make sure that it doesn’t move. This
allows you to get a sharper and straighter

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:43.391
cut, using the edge of the glass. He’s now
using his blade, using the edge of the glass

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:52.920
as the template, and he’s cutting the exact
shape of the window. Now, this may vary depending

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.500
on if the car has window frame or doesn’t.
This car actually does not have a window frame,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.010
which makes it easier, but still you have
to make a precise cut because you want all

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.490
your edges to be even. Be very careful because
these knives are very sharp. Always round

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:22.060
the edges, that makes it more difficult for
the tint to peel. After cutting the top and

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.630
the side, Sean will then slide the tint up,
usually a quarter of an inch. This allows

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.940
the window to be completely tinted with no
gaps at the top or bottom. Standing rule of

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.450
done is at the top. As long as you can see
daylight through the edge, it’s low enough

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.240
so that the window can roll up and down without
causing the tint to interfere with the window

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.140
track, which can also cause the tint to peel.
After cutting the pattern, he now squeegees

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.150
it down. You notice these objects here that
are looking like fingers; we call those fingers.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.099
What he’s getting ready to do is heat those
fingers out. That concludes the application

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.209
of the window film segment.
