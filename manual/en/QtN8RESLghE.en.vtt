00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.600
Super Black Bass is Super Back Bass on the
Nintendo 3DS.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.890
The series spans more than two decades and
seven platforms, one of the longest-running

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.560
fishing games in the pond.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.460
That said, my first experience with the series
was the 2006 DS release.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.340
And let’s just say...that’s a fish better
thrown back.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.309
You know, catch and release.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.329
Or better yet, not catch at all.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.610
So its history aside, Super Black Bass hasn’t
been great in recent years.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.820
And if you were hoping for a better catch
on the 3DS, well...I mean, it has 3D.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:09.710
So there’s that.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.000
Super Black Bass 3D is—obviously—a fishing
game.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.620
Pick a pond, find a spot, cast your line.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.920
It’s kind of an old-school fishing game
in its approach.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.150
Of course, it’s kind of an old-school fishing
game in its look and feel, too.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.409
Which is to say...it’s not very pretty and
it doesn’t play that well.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.840
You can join fishing tournaments, you can
free fish...but no matter how you play, the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840
game works the same way.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.920
You move around the pond by tapping squares
on a map.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.431
Once you’re there, you can turn to the left
or right.

00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:45.590
And when the radar shows you’re looking
at fish, you cast.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.189
Now the interface for all this stuff is kind
of clumsy, but the problems really start when

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.520
you cast.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.619
Or throw your 3DS.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.799
You know, same thing.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.490
See, casting is done by flicking your system.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.850
You can throw forward, you can make a shoveling
motion...these translate to different kinds

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.050
of casts in game.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.660
Now, the problem is that the motion recognition
is inconsistent at best, but also...it’s

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.660
a handheld.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.380
I mean, this would be silly on home consoles.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.720
But on a handheld?

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.080
It’s just pointless.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.340
Sadly, things don’t improve much after you
cast the line.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.290
The fish in this game are incredibly picky
about biting.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.870
Now, there’s something to be said for realism,
but look, there’s nothing fun about waiting

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.790
five to ten minutes before you get a bite,
and then struggling with the fish another

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.380
five minutes...only to find out, “Oh.”

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.330
“It’s just a minnow.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.100
That fought like a freaking marlin.”

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.130
And part of that struggle comes from the controls
themselves.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.720
Reeling in a fish is much more complicated
than it needs to be, a laborious combination

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.439
of holding down buttons, then tilting your
system to lessen the tension...it’s just

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.000
a real chore to play.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.430
To its credit, though...the game actually
has a nice amount of content.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.310
There are more than 30 species of fish, as
well as changing seasons and weather conditions.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.480
There’s a lot of stuff in your tackle box,
too.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.959
You can upgrade your gear, use all kinds of
different lines and lures.

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.750
If you’re looking for a fishing game on
the 3DS, Super Black Bass 3D certainly is

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.350
one.
