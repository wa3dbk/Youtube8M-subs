00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.340
Hey guys, this is Pogomurphisk here and I’m
going to show you how to make a doorbell on

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.340
your home.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.139
Uhh, this isn’t necessarily an aesthetic
decoration, but it is a decoration nonetheless.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.380
And, umm, let’s give a demonstration first.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.490
So…

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:30.789
And I added a little jazz note in there because
I accidentally put one of them off pitch.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.649
I think it’s this guy here, he’s the culprit.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.909
Umm, I’ll just show you how I wired this.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.769
So I just put a bit of redstone right below
because this powers this block right next

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.640
to it.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:57.879
And then I reversed the signal because I would
then reverse it again leading up to here.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:11.820
So there’s a, a torch right here that’s
now off because the signal leading up to this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.820
is on.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.130
So, I put that there, this powers the block
above and, well unpowers the block above because

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.500
it reverses the current.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.049
And so now this is unpowered.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:38.700
And when I hit the switch, this lights up
and the song plays.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.820
Yay!

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.549
And, umm, making the.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.600
Well, I guess you’re wondering what this
dirt here is for.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.590
So, note blocks, which is what I used for
this need one block above of breathing room.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.250
But, that’s it, you could put them 20 blocks
below ground and you could still hear them,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.659
because you can hear them from about 40 blocks
away no matter what is between you.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.799
So, I think that’s pretty cool.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:17.319
So, regarding how I wired this circuit, um,
it’s in series I guess.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.000
Aww shoot.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.620
It’s in series I guess, so it just goes
through each of the note block individually

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.239
and has repeaters in-between them.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:35.389
These signs next to each of the not blocks
are the number of right clicks you need to

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:41.310
… oh I already got it… to, um create that
certain note.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:54.810
So, C, G, G, A, G, B, C. Okay, yeah, that’s
what it is.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.150
C is 6 right clicks, B is 5, G is 1, and A
is 3.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:13.140
So, I guess if you wanted to make this certain,
uhh, set-up, you could do that.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.250
Um, the repeaters, um, that determine the
spacing in-between the notes you have to play

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:30.960
with, because not all songs that we know are
uh playing straight eighth notes, they’ll

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.519
often play them swung.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.700
You’ll know about that if you play jazz.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.079
So you basically have to do it by ear.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.010
There’s no certain formula.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.079
If you put different blocks under… awww
shoot.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.239
If you put different blocks underneath it’ll
change the sound.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:54.260
If you could hear that at all, one of those
was a bass note.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:06.739
This note right here underneath.

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:13.230
I made this in series, but you could use a
pulse circuit, like I have here.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.920
Um, I just didn’t want to do it because
I’m not really good with redstone, so if

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.769
you figure that out, cudoze to you.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.480
I think that’s it, um, see you guys later.
