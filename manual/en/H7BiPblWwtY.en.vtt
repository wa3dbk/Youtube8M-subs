UK Career Center Resume Tips Video TEXT
Kody Kiser, Videographer, Amy Jones, Producer

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.280
SOT (Christina Mapes): "I've been looking
and it's slim pickings but I'm definitely

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.280
trying."

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.200
SOT (Bryan Bulkley): "It's really, really
competitive and you worry about how good everyone

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.960
else is and how you compare to everyone else
and how you set yourself apart."

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:32.169
SOT (Theresa Mickelwait): "To help yourself
standout on your resume, you need to work

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.879
on branding yourself in the resume.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.860
Everything in the resume should support why
you're a good match for that position.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.340
The most relevant thing should be listed first
and foremost, so, your most relevant experience

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.340
at the beginning.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.450
You want to keep things fresh and new so everything
on there should be probably less than five

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.570
years of your past experience."

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.089
SOT (Theresa Mickelwait): "The chronological
format is a typical format, but you can create

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.040
a separate section called relevant experience
or create tailored sections like if you want

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
to highlight your marketing experience because
you want a marketing job or accounting experience,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.840
or your interpersonal skills.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.090
You can create a separate section and put
that before the rest of you work experience.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.360
Employers will look for mistakes.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.329
If you have a misspelled word or you use words
incorrectly, that's going to be an automatic

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.619
toss into the trash."

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.649
SOT (Francene Gilmer): "Resumes gone wrong,
sending the wrong resume to the employer you're

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:39.820
intending to send it to employer A and you
put the name in the cover letter and you intended

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.950
it for employer B. "

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.429
SOT (Theresa Mickelwait): "Some of the horror
stories that I can share with students come

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.729
from my experience in human resources and
recruiting when I was working with my recruiting

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.899
manager.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.479
I would go through hundreds of resumes a day
and bring her the four or five best ones I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.170
could find and I thought these people have
experience and skills that might work for

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.659
this position.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.060
But she would take less than thirty seconds
to look at a resume and toss it in the trash

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.790
and then end up narrowing it down to one of
those that I picked out.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.330
Seeing that, I can help students see the importance
of your resume."

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.940
SOT (Christina Mapes): "It's not as scary
as a lot of students might think.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.760
I know the future is a scary thing its unpredictable
but this definitely helps brush up on your

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.550
skills and interviewing and resume critiques
and everybody here is so nice and everybody

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.790
here wants to help you.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.040
Nobody is trying to scold you."

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.420
SOT (Bryan Bulkley): "Having this resource
on campus gives everyone direction."
