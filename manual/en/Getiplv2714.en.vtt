00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Countdown for the Lumia 900: the start can't be far away when Nokia makes a press event for it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So the Lumia 800 get's a big brother.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The display is now 4.3 instead of 3.7 inch.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So the device is a little bigger and thicker of course.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's why the Lumia 800 has a better grip, the Lumia 900 isn't designed for small hands.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This will be a matter of taste. But customers aksing for bigger displays.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Here comes the Samsung Galaxy S III into the picture: it has a 4.8 inch panel.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:30.000
As you can see these 3 inches are a big deal: that matters!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But if you compare both devices the S III isn't much bigger at all!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Only when both devices are standing on the bottom you see a difference of a little less than 1 cm.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But this does not concern the width. And that's the point: because the width determins if you'll find a device handy or not.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Last but not least the S III is a little thinner.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000
No big changes from the Lumia 800: camera with 8 mega pixels, 2 LEDs, same design.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:35.000
On the front you'll find a sencond camera with 1.9 mega pixels so you can do video telephony now.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Especially because Skype has launched it's final version for Windows Phone recently.Tango app is pre-installed.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's an AMOLED panel as on the Lumia 800, again with the "Clear Black" technology.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So you have an excelent viewing angle of almost 180 degrees like IPS on the iPhone 4S.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Nokia compares "Clear Black" with polarized sun glasses, means you have less relfections.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The resolution stayed 480 x 800 pixels, so the density goes down in the same ratio as the display is getting bigger.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:20.000
That is not based on a decision of Nokia, it's given by Microsoft and the requirements of Windows Phone.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Nevertheless the letters are big enough to read and in the settings you have big letters.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But you might see differences while looking at photos or videos - that's something to check in the final test.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Even if you can't see it: it's the new OS version 7.5 Refresh, better known as Tango.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But except tethering (using the phone like a modem e.g. for a notebook) there is not much difference.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Coming to the USB slot: it has no cover any more. And the micro SIM has got an other kind of slot, you'll need a pin to open.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But it's still a slot for micro SIMs only.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:06:08.000
16 giga bytes internal memory. As it's a unibody case again you have not slot for memory cards and a fixed power cell.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000
RAM stayed at 512 mega bytes, so it's really a Lumia 800 with a larger screen.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
LTE like in the US model won't come to Europe.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So the only question is: when will it come? I guess it will take just a few weeks (means: in June).

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Recommended retail price is 579 Euros including vat, so street price will be something around 500 Euros.
