00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.190
welcome to beginner fingerstyle guitar
lessons

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.269
this is lesson number two if you haven't
seen lesson number one yet

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.309
go to the link below take that lesson
first

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.712
and then come back here let's get
started with lesson number two

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.300
so if you recall in our last lesson

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.660
we learned this picking pattern
starting on the 4th string

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.800
 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.150
 so I hope you've been practicing
and then we learned a form of a D chord

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.700
which was this 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.700
keep this figure (middle finger)  out a way to show
you what I'm doing

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.170
you should
have this finger up here

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.880
 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.210
just out of the way for right now

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.040
were eventually gonna learn this 
now I'm couple people have written into

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.580
me and they said that their hand is
hurting back here

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.810
well if your hand is hurting that means
you're doing it wrong okay

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.150
so couple things that could be wrong if
you having a while tension in the back

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.190
of your hand here

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.090
you've got to make sure that you're holding your hand correctly

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.120
your left hand - your
thumb should be down here

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.200
okay and your

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.320
fingers should be right below the fret

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.229
so I'm not really pressing that hard
if you're really pressing 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.290
digging in.. that means you're doing it
wrong

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.830
The further away from the fret

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.650
for the notes and I'm trying to do.. you have to press harder

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.930
to get the notes out because what's
making the note

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.930
play is by freting it just below the
fret

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.950
okay so if you're pressing really hard 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.770
that means you're doing it wrong okay... so
nice n Easy

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.759
the next thing we're going to do now is
we're gonna go and learn another chord

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.020
okay so I said in the last lesson this
is six

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.190
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.410
on the 4th string we're gonna go with
our middle finger

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.410
we're gonna go up to frets we're gonna
play that now

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.629
and then with our ring finger

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.480
we're gonna go up to frets on the 3rd
string and play that now

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.299
we're going to try to playing together
okay now when you put your fingers

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.170
together here

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.879
my fingers are fat and everybody's
usually are (well, maybe not) but it's impossible to get both of 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.819
 your fingers right below the fret

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.959
so this one right here 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.810
your middle finger has to be back here a
little bit

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.069
but if you have your hand in a good
position nice and relaxed

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.459
no tension 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.540
you just strum this from the fourth string
all the way down

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.990
very pretty chord

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.400
now the reason I'm teaching you these
particular chords is because what we're

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.950
going to be doing is we're going... I'm gonna show you

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.350
a song when I learned when I was just
starting out playing

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.849
and its really pretty 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.370
you're going to be able to do it because
they're very easy chords ...so now

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.760
with that picking pattern that we
originally learned

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.250
and this is from...

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.319
if you recall we had the D chord

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.319
we were forming the D chord 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040
 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.350
and that was going from the 4th to the
first string  so what we're going to

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.780
do is going to take our hand

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.240
and just move it down one more
string starting on the 5th string and

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.630
ending on the second-string

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.230
and what we do is we're going to do
that same exact pattern

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.010
only instead of being here it's right
here

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.890
 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.329
no court on the top (left hand) yet

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:20.329
 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.940
 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.930
 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.699
now if you haven't  practiced that pattern
that I showed you go back to lesson

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.479
number one below again

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.090
and work on that pattern first and then
when you're

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.509
 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:45.200
it would be this 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.220
when you can play it fairly fast 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.380
like that tempo maybe even a
little slower if fine

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.720
then come back to this lesson okay... but
importantly

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.170
you get that picking pattern

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.540
that's in the trillion songs okay so all
we did was we moved

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.090
this over to here.. so now with our

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.220
left hand we're gonna go and play that
Chord that I showed you

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.010
which is both fingers up 2 frets

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.150
on the 4th and the third-string

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.610
the middle finger is on the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.530
second fret of the fourth string

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.720
the ring finger

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.550
is on the 3rd string 2 frets up

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.390
 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.340
And it's a form of an A chord.. very
pretty so if you play that pattern

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.450
holding that chord down it sounds like
this

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.730
 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.540
 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.030
slow I'll do it 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.440
 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.569
 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.019
 

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:10.379
okay so that's it... practice that lesson
