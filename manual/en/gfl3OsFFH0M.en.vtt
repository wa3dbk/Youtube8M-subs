00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:10.759
Hofstra Arboretum is part and parcel of the
whole campus and its 250 acres, so that is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.859
the size square footage-wise, but it also
takes in all of the highways and streets and

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.420
everything that you see. What qualifies us
as an arboretum is the fact that we've been

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.240
a member in good standing for about 25 years
now with the American Public Garden Association

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.240
and his is a pretty prestigious group that
was created many years ago. There are 625

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.569
taxa of trees, and now an arboretum is a collection
of trees as opposed to a botanical garden

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:46.079
which is a collection of all plants. They
could be anything from tropicals and the annuals

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.030
and the display beds that you have with herbacious
perennials and stuff, but Hofstra is an arboretum

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.030
because we're trying to follow the original
William Hofstra who was a lumberman and that's

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.060
how he made his living and he collected trees
here at his summer home at Hofstra, so we

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.510
thought an arboretum would be more fitting
rather than just being a botanical garden.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.220
And so we have a collection of trees that
number in the thousands, there's probably

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.800
close to twelve thousand trees, but there
are 625 distinctly different ones out of those

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.820
twelve thousand. That's hard to say, it's
like asking which is your favorite child or

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.460
something like that, you know. Planting, I
probably have a favoite tree which is the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.740
katsura in the pinetum close to Heger Hall
on the south side of Heger Hall. It's the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.740
oldest tree, it's from Japan, it's Cercidiphyllum
japonicum, it's 120-125 years old so it's

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.340
pretty magnificent when you go up to it and
you see it's 13 feet around, it's got quite

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.230
a stature to it. But as far as plantings go,
there's a lot of little niche plantings on

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:02.230
campus, and things that, little venues we've
kind of created around campus that are just

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.890
for comfort but also asthetically pleasing.
I think of things like the horse on West Circle

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.219
Road and the planting of the native blue stem
grasses that grow in the Hempstead Plains,

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:25.359
which is what Hofstra was built on, so this
is one of the native grasses, and the horse

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:30.409
is kind of grazing in the grass, it's made
out of hofseshoes, a thousand horseshoes that

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.719
make up this piece of sculpture, and that's
also a good part of the arboretum as well

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:41.719
is the sculpture. Man and women's art work
as well as mother nature's. The best time

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.980
to plant is probably the fall for woody plants,
trees and shrubs. Spring is also good for

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.329
a little bit more tender things, things that
you wanna get a jump on and have them make

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.450
a good set of roots before they go into the
winter. Now we're looking at today where it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.639
could get down into the 20's. You probably
don't want to be planting when the ground

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:12.730
starts getting hard, so fall is a good time
as I said for the woody plants, and mostly

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.260
for here on campus when you're looking to
fill a spot with a plant, whether it be for

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.560
a building and you need a lot of plants or
you just need a replacement plant for something

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.560
that has died or you want to replace or redo
the specific landscape, anytime you can get

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.919
that plant is really the right time to plant
it. Plants these days come in pots as opposed

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.840
to the old days they used to be in fields
and you had to ball and bulap them, and it

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.150
could only be done at a certain time of the
year. Nowadays we have everything from trees

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.999
and shrubs down to small perennials and grasses
and all, they're all in plastic pots, so if

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.159
you can find them, you can plant them. As
long as the ground isn't frozen you're all

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:00.459
right. The conifers on campus probably come
to life in the winter time, particularly when

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.099
it's snowing out. And our pinetum which is
a collection of 110 different kinds of conifers,

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.219
and when I say conifers I mean the angiosperms,
it's the pines, the spruces, the larches and

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:17.870
the firs, you know the Christmas trees and
the everygreens. But that is probably one

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.520
of the biggest attraction. Another thing in
the coming months is the Witchhazels which

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.370
bloom at an odd time of year, most people
would think you walk it by in February, and

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.410
we have dozens of them on campus now. They
come out in full bloom in February, you get

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.020
a mild week or two in February, and they come
into bloom. They have a good fragrance to

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.540
them as well, so those are really nice. There's
a couple of edgeworthia plants that also,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.540
very fragrant, yellow flowers, they bloom
late Februarly early March. There helebores

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.560
are also called Christmas rose or Lenten rose
because they bloom between Christmas and Easter

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.650
and so these things come out in the middle
of the snow they're in full bloom, so it's

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.480
pretty cool. One of the big features at Hofstra,
because we are Dutch, we do a lot of tulips,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.730
I thnk that's something that we look forward
to every spring. In April come out the daffodils

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.820
and we probably have 250-300,000 daffodils
that over the years we've planted. We might

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.190
plant 8-10,000 a year, but the daffodils come
back year to year so these things in April,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.980
even in late March sometimes you can look
forward to thousands of daffodils. But then

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.770
the tulips come into bloom, and there's so
many different colors and so many different

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.240
varieties and they're in little pockets thoughout
campus, that that's certainly something to

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.240
look forward to. Sampler garden, which is
our collection of the tulips, there's about

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.620
150 different varieties that'll all be labeled,
there'll be a brochure and a sign for them,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.810
and it's between the south side of Dempster
and the north side of the Dean Law Library.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.860
They're planted out this time of year and
then in the spring they come up, so last week

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.640
in April first week in May, you can go there
with the brochure and mark off the red one

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.150
that you like or the parrot tulip that you
like or the French tulip or the lily-flowering

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.080
tulip. So it's an education in all the different
kinds of tulips from species and the early

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.900
ones right up until the late blooming Mayflowering
tulips. So you can see what you like and it's

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.330
something to consider planting yourself in
your own home and you would know the names

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.830
of what you like and then you'd be a little
more educated on what to ask for and what

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.720
to look for when you go shopping the following
fall.
