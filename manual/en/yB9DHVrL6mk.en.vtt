Daddy Brad: Did you know that tornados are
more common in the United States than in any

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.030
other country? We average nearly 1200 a year,
have 80 deaths and 1500 injuries. And they

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.730
can occur in all 50 states. Stick around and
we'll find out what needs to be in your severe

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:25.400
weather preparedness kit. 
This episode is brought to you by BabyBjorn.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.910
Be prepared for fatherhood. BabyBjorn. Even
if you don't live in a tornado-prone area,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.640
severe weather like floods and hurricanes
and blizzards can affect many parts of the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.980
United States. We talked to Kally Masino from
Radio Shack about some weather gear that you

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.300
need to have on hand to keep your family safe.
Kally: We have a whole host of products to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.430
help families get ready for weather preparedness.
And the first one I'm gonna talk to you about

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.750
today is a weather radio. I'll give you the
reason why I recommend this one. You're would

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.630
enter your zip code. That's gonna significantly
reduce the number of false positives that

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.710
you're gonna get. So when you watch the weather
and you see that huge square that you block

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.890
out, most weather radios may alert you if
you're in that giant square. But it may be

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.350
hours before that weather gets to you and
it may never get to you. The other piece that's

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.940
great about this is, it has Sky Warn in it,
which is gonna give you and your family an

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.130
additional 8 minutes of warning. So this is
a portable power device. It's a lithium battery.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.430
You're gonna charge it through the USB device
in your computer. And then it will charge

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.600
iPhone and iPod. It's gonna give you an additional
6 hours of talk time. The great thing about

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.920
this battery is that it's a lithium battery.
It's gonna lose less than 5% of it's power

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.229
per month. So once you charge this up, throw
it in your weather prep kit, it's gonna be

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.950
charged. Even if it's six months later, it's
still gonna have at least 50% of its battery

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.710
life. Now we're gonna move into flashlights.
The first one I'm gonna show you is the Icon

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.329
Rouge. This is a black aluminum flashlight.
It's waterproof. So it can drop into a meter

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.020
of water and it will still work. And it's
also gonna last for 90 hours on these two

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.330
batteries. And then the last one I want to
talk to you about is the Blackout Buddy. But

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.849
you're gonna plug it into your outlet. On
a normal day, it's going to serve as a nightlight.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.590
However, if the power was to go out, this
flashlight on the top is gonna go on. It will

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.080
help light you down a dark hallway to your
weather prep kit. You can pull it out and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.650
then it will serve as a flashlight for you.
This, along with any other Red Cross branded

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.330
product in our stores, if one of your consumers
purchases this, a donation goes back to Red

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.141
Cross. When you get your weather prep kit
ready, if you have a family, we ask that you

00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:54.050
engage your children in helping you test the
flashlights, make sure that all the batteries

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.239
are working. It gives you a great opportunity
to show everyone what your family's plan is,

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.410
to show them where the kit is, and just to
talk about it in general, so that if something

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.709
does happen, hopefully it's reduce the fear
and anxiety that they experience during that.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.640
Daddy Brad: Wow, now those are all great things
to have to keep your family safe and prepared.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.120
Another thing you might want to think about
is get one of these thumb drives and scan

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.910
and save all of your important family documents
on this. And then throw it in a safety deposit

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.769
box. So if anything happens to your house,
you'll have all your important docs ready

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.580
to go. We'd like to thank Radio Shack for
showing us all these cool gadgets. And also

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.700
would like to thank BabyBjorn, Oexo-Tek certified,
safe for your baby, BabyBjorn. We'll see you

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.739
next time here on The Lab.
