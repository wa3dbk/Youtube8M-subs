John: Heyis,guys.

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.149
John here, with RealTruck.com.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.060
I'm going to show you how to install the Black
Armour tailgate mat.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.049
One of the really unique things and really
neat things about this tailgate mat from Black

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.140
Armour is of course, the fact that it's got
this nice diamond plate appearance.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.390
This tailgate mat, half inch thick, made from
100% recycled vulcanized rubber, which means

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.390
all them old tires and stuff that you take
off your vehicles, guys, don't worry about

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.960
them going to the landfills because they get
turned into really cool stuff like this that

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.590
you can put back on your truck.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.680
This is a pretty simple thing to install on
your truck.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.280
Pretty much all you need to do is, and what
I would recommend do, if you're going to put

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.870
this on some type of permanent way, that you
clean your tailgate real good.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.720
Put a good coat of wax on the underside, just
to help protect it down the road.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.690
Also, if you notice when you open up your
kit, there's no installation material or anything

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.100
like that, and the reason for that is because
Black Armour designed this so that you can

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.530
install it in any manner in which you want
to your tailgate.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.470
What we're going to do, which works really
well, is we're going to take some self-tapping

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.420
screws, and we're going to drill some pilot
holes in this.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.690
And then, we're going to attach this with
self-tapping screws, which is really going

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.530
to hold it on here and keep it in place.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.440
Also, if you use some type of hardware like
that, you want to make sure that it's a flathead

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.640
of some sort.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.870
So that way, nothing gets caught up on it
when you're dragging stuff in and out of your

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.870
truck.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.060
First thing we're going to do is...Of course,
we already got this in here.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.480
We got it lined up where we want it.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.780
So the next thing we're going to do is start
drilling some pilot holes, so that we can

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.620
put our screws in to attach this to the tailgate.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.479
Just measure this out, and it's 59 inches.

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.011
So that tells me that what we need to do is
go 29 and a half would be center.

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:58.170
So we're going to put a mark right here at
29 and a half, because that's where we're

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.450
going to put one of our holes for one of our
screws.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.201
[00:02:03] And then what we're going to do
is we're going to come over here, and we're

00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:12.249
going to go an inch in on this side, put one
an inch in from here.

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.329
Same thing over here.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.689
So we're at 59.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.609
We're coming here to 58.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.609
Put a mark here.

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:20.609
Okay.

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.930
So we've got it spread out here for where
we're going to put the screws.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.730
But I think what we're going to do is we're
just going to go in between these two spots,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.260
as well, just to give us a little more hold
ability.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.010
So we're going to put one in here at 43 and
three quarters and another one here at 14

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.010
and a quarter.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.830
And that'll just kind of divide it up a little
bit, so that it's all evened out across.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.930
So we'll take our tape measure off.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.519
Now, just so you guys know, what we're going
to do is we're going to do the same thing

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.529
across the bottom.

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:59.109
Although across the bottom, we probably won't
use as many screws because when the tailgate's

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.769
up and it's hanging, all the pressure's going
to be on this top.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.569
All the weight's going to hang off the top.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.549
We've got our holes drilled out.

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.629
So the next thing we're going to do is we're
going to add our screws in that we're going

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:28.799
to be using to hold this down.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.029
The next thing we're going to do is we're
going to go ahead and measure down the bottom

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:40.459
side of it here and do the same thing we did
up here at the top and get this thing all

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.459
done.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:53.180
So let's get those measured out and done.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.069
[00:04:07]

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:07.849
Okay, guys.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.430
There you have it.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.989
That's how quick, simple, and easy it is to
install this Black Armour tailgate mat onto

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.530
your truck.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.209
And I don't know about you guys, but I think
this thing's going to work out really well.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.419
So until next time remember, happy motoring.
