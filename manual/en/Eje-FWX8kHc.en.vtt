00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.000
One of my passions in life is woodworking.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I think probably because it fulfills that caveman instinct that I have,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and a lot of men have, to provide for their families.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.900
Often times projects that I take on in the workshop fulfill a need that we have in the house.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.500
But there is something else that has quickly
become a passion of mine as well.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.000
Gardening.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And probably for a lot of the same reasons
as woodworking.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.300
It feels good to be able to put a dinner on the table where most of the ingredients came from here, the backyard.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.000
But, like for many people our space for growing food is limited.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So recently I have tried to look for ways to get more out of the space that we do have.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I figure, a vertical herb garden would be a good way to do that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
When you think of materials for any outdoor project,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
probably the first thing that comes
to mind is cedar.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And why not, its rot resistant properties are well known.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.500
With that said I've chosen some scrap pine left over from previous projects.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.550
I'll cut four pieces with a fifteen degree angle for the legs to start.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.000
Yes, untreated wood will decompose
over time, even cedar.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.700
However, wooden planters built out of untreated wood, will probably
last a lot longer than you think.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.120
I'll mark out every nine and a half inches
or so on both sides of all four legs.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'll need twenty cleats about five inches
each.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.500
I off set the marks on each side of the legs
by about an inch and a half, to give me the angles that I need for the shelves.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.600
I am not using any glue in the planter portion
of this project. Over the years as different

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.880
parts wear out, I want to be able to easily
replace pieces of the planter.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.000
Now that the legs are done, I need some back slats.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.500
For my deminsions I'll need about 14 board feet.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I already have one of the planter boxes done.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.869
So for the second one I'll place the
sides on top of each other to make sure the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.900
widths match after I'm done putting the
back slats on.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.500
Tack them with brads just to hold them in
place.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Check for square.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.100
Tack the other side.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.000
Drill pilot holes

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Screw them in place.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.749
I'm going to flip each box on their sides
and place a board across the bottom to mimic

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.000
the ground so I can get the angle right.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Cut some leg braces on the miter saw.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.430
Now I thought it would be nice depending on
the type of plants we have at the time

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.500
if we could easily move the vertical herb garden around the patio

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.500
so I'll build a frame out of this extra two by six.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
After cutting a couple pieces to length,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I'll rip them in half.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.600
Cut some half lap joints on the band saw.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.639
On a project like this I really don't measure
joints like this, I'll just eyeball it.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.000
As I said I'm not using glue on the planter
portion of this build.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I'll use it here because if the base needs replacing I'll just replace the whole thing.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I've moved everything to the back patio
so I can attach the bottom frame and the casters.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.500
These are 3 Inch locking casters.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The little guy was so eager to help his dad I had to find him a job.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Obviously cedar or some other resistant type of wood would prolong the life of a project like this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I figured the cost of cedar in my area for this would run about $300.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.500
This was free for me as all of the material came from the pile

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.200
of wood I have sitting in the back of my garage.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.000
and any replacement parts I may need, well...

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
those will be free as well.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.500
Its hard to argue with free.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.000
Oh, I did have to buy the casters.  Those were three dollars each.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So I guess I spent about twelve dollars on the project.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.200
