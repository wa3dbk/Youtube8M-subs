Welcome back for rythmpig.com. I am Scott
Swearingen. Well I am going to show you how

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.290
to hold your hands and get the sound out of
the drum and then show you another basic rhythm.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:33.970
So you have the middle and you have the song
part and you have the slap part of the rhythm…

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:42.350
To get the sound that you want, you do not
hold your hand flat like that… that will

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.250
get the sound… but a better way to do is
to be able to cup your hands just slightly

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.460
not… not like this, but just like this.
So that when I hit it I have got a little

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:04.040
air pocket in between me and this drum…
and now you can see that and see how I am

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:13.330
holding my hand with a little bit of arch
to it. It gives me a better sound than if

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:22.280
I just do a straight slap. So
when you get out to hear, you are going to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.819
be using more this part of your hand because
it is nearer to the rim instead you are going

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:34.289
to have to be using the basic rhythm knuckle
to the fingernail. There is on the middle

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.240
it is more sort of the palm, then you get
out here you end up with this part of your

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.830
finger. When you get the slap, it is pretty
much just that top knuckle, top finger bone

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:57.300
actually. I am holding this because I broke…
slit my finger… So you can either learn

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:09.890
to play it with two fingers or three, three
is easier it is up to you, later on you will

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:29.390
learn how to do like this…
