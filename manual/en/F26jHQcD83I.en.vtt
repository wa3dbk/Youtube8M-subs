00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.440
you remember lewis when we had ray
comfort on the show but this is a guy

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.510
who is obsessed with morality

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.250
or what he calls morality i invite you
to check out

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.350
and then we politics dot com if you can
click on interviews you can listen to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.220
anil old interview we did with him

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.280
he did a book that was kind of

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.670
cole written there somehow involved with
kirk cameron who is this child actor was

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.950
also now in a vendor list i think it was
young growing pains i don't even

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.160
remember what show he was on lewis when
he was you know when he was a kid

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.940
no i did okay you'd recognize if you're
some kind of curly hair

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.250
he is coming out with a book

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.450
it's actually not that he's coming out
of the book for the unwritten fiftieth

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.740
anniversary of the disp distribution of
darwin's origin of species

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.200
parrot cameron is going to distribute of
of slight version

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.800
that is different in the sense that as
an introduction

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.410
written on a creationist introduction
and then introduction

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.900
was written by none other than our
friend ray comfort who i'm trying to get

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.940
back on the show to talk about this is
going to be in november i think he is

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.950
going to come on

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.100
this is the guy who came up with
something called the ben and uh... you

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.439
read

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.870
of evolution

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.920
and let me actually play for you what
that is because it is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.630
but absolutely

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.470
amazing

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.600
and he says that from from a banana and
actually i have abandoned here so for

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.290
our

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.119
maybe politics t_v_ audience will be
able to demonstrate

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.759
what ray comfort is talking about

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.270
he says from palo banana is made

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.630
we can be completely sure

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.100
that god does exist

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.479
he proves it

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.050
okay so let's take a listen to this

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.020
and see what we can't make to get has
details i was scared

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.310
however

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.210
behaviorist nightmare every study a
well-made ben-ami you'll find the file

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.050
site

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.229
left the rangers

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.290
i'm a close eye too which is

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.590
dulu henry would be good for them to
find in a fast side withdrew gruza

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.779
nucleoside two groups a banana and a m l

00:01:56.779 --> 00:02:01.110
perfectly made one for the other
fundamental but there are no plans

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.530
mighty god is made with and then slip

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.490
surface

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.209
as alberta mechanism would come to
school so clearly yellow just right

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.269
she went

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.309
if you go to the top of it on a to fight
is with us so we can make is place it's

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:20.049
head of the top senegal displays of tab
at the top which i would said the

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.509
conscience sounds good in your face
designer level which is why dependable

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.349
as preparations

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.230
notice how gracefully excessively human
hair

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.159
notices a point of the properties of
entry just arrived safely in the mail

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.779
estuary easily digested as he told her
to have to face to make the whole

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.879
process so much easier

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.719
so sick at the hall of creation
testifies the genius of god's creating

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.059
art

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.319
cesium i finished my banana out here

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.609
that is great comforts proof that that
that that

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.099
damn good bana by the way louis items
f_y_i_

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.200
that is is proof

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.479
that god exists because the banana has
as he says these three ridges on the top

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.599
two ridges on the bottom and i may be
politics t_v_i_ aides concede that we

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.069
went through this this little
demonstration

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.059
it has a tab that you can use to open it

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.209
and it points at your face

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.229
it just makes sense god made this

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.730
what he is a mentioning

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.159
and what i'm sure he would rather you
not now

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.000
is that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.599
the banana itself has evolved

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.850
and if god made this banana

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.790
then he made it

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.379
pretty damn recently because bananas
years ago look very different than an is

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.840
and many people may not notice were
domesticated five to eight thousand

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.220
years ago most likely by some people in
papua new guinea wild bananas look

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.620
completely different they haven't none
of the care characteristically he's

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.319
mentioned and if you look up a picture
of a banana number one

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.569
the outside is not smooth

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.889
the entire things like a big block it's
not easy to feel

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.189
the inside is not just made of
nutritious

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.540
fleshy fruit it's filled with very hard
and very stiff seeds banana seeds

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.740
this has nothing to do if you believe
that god created the original banana

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.729
it is absolutely nothing to do

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.090
with the spanish if anything

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.780
this banana proves the opposite of ray
comforts the area proves that

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.659
not only have humans evolved

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.680
but the phone has evolved to anticipate
is completely true

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.360
that the manner has evolved farmington
domestication over thousands of years

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.539
so white but if by god he means the
people in papa new guinea that

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.639
domesticated the banana

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.520
maybe i would agree

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.920
also bananas don't turn yellow normally
in the wild dog they're usually stay

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.810
pretty green pickard return your because
this trade with

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.349
some type of chemical or some type of
compound it

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.179
that makes them turn more yellow it's
not a fact that as americans here well

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:48.729
rather one of the things he says that
has a natural indicator of green it's

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.819
not ready yellow it's ready

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.009
black you waited too long so you're
saying even part of how you i think that

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.029
they've been is deterrence somewhat
yellow but probably not

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.029
i mean this thing is almost

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.360
completely alo

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.499
right amir banana or never work with on
the wild all of this is evolution the

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.450
same evolution that he says doesn't
exist

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.979
that simply doesn't exist okay

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.810
that's just a reminder who ray comfort
is let's move on to this new this new

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.490
introduction the introduction from a
video that was recently posted youtube

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.509
kirk cameron lays out a plan to kind of
subvert darwin day on november twenty

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:23.220
second

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.479
there's just an excerpt from the video
that correctly now

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.669
on thursday november nineteenth just a
few days before the hundred and fiftieth

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.330
anniversary of the world

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.199
thousand copies of the special
publication will be freely given our at

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.909
those top fifty universities

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.770
this is a beautiful three hundred and
forty-eight full-color congregation

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.759
darwin's famous organised bc sparked
that will be given away

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.150
on a hundred and fifty anniversary of
the book okka

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.630
they claim this is a very special
edition and what's special about it is

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.840
endl it'll include an introduction
explaining adolf hitler's

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.000
undeniable connection to the theory of
evolution and highlighting darwin's

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.529
racism and his disdain for women

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:09.750
it also it expose what they call many
hoaxes of evolutionary theory

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.590
well presenting

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.039
they balanced view

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.949
of creationism in part of that balance
would be that god created this because

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.189
it fits into people's hands this panera
break that's part of of it

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.559
uh... so local logic here is

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:25.769
this is the only logic i could think of

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:30.159
because hitler used evolution is part of
his evil plan meaning he knew that if he

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.199
killed people he didn't like

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.820
the people that were left

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.340
because of evolution

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.819
would create

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.830
more people that look like that

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.000
hitler used evolution

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.869
but that's in the evenings that

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:43.940
somehow

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.139
someone who

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.379
invents obama

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.720
and then drops it

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.270
their complicity with whoever invented
gravity so to speak because hey

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.610
they needed that gravity to drop a bomb
otherwise that bomb would've just sat in

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.529
space

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:58.500
so instead of trying to disprove

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.439
ruba theory of evolution

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.550
they're just making wild accusations
about

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.990
darwin and you know be related to hitler
and just trying to discredit him instead

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.310
of actually disproving the theory right
now i don't know for sure that that's

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.900
the argument that's going to be made it
it it is true that

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.770
for hitler's planned to be possible
meeting for hitler to think

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.770
i'll get rid of everybody who's not
blonde hair blue eyed

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.860
and then only they will breed and then
that will lead to this race of people

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.119
who are blind in thailand like

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:31.960
it is true if to believe that that's
even possible you need to believe in

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960
evolution

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.570
if you don't believe that evolution is
just

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.389
leading kill whoever he wants were
thought to have the exact same mix of

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:40.240
people people will still look

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.720
like id like hitler did

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.920
and like others who are dark haired
short so on and so forth because

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.869
evolution does exist

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:50.200
it is no more complex it hitler was no
work implicit

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.569
with darwin

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:53.560
from my from my research

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.440
then somebody who relies on gravity to
drop bombs is complicity with the

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.669
creation of gravity

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:03.809
i don't know what what other ways there
look at it and i really don't know

00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:07.099
well now you know i don't uh... and i
don't agree with what you were recovery

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:11.029
says so im i'm agreeing with your
initial hua han hoping he will come back

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:15.049
on the show and i think is people his
people have told me that he'll come back

00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:16.129
and he will he will talk to us
