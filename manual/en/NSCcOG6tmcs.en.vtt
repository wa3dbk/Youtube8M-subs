00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:15.629
"I don't think anyone understands like how
much time actually goes into it."

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:23.590
"Band spends I think 68 hours during what
we call early week.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.390
Now, early week is about 10 days long, but
in the course before the first day of school

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.010
we spend about between 64 and 68 hours preparing
for the first football game preparing to perform

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.010
for them."

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.930
"Even such simple things as like making a
box and playing a tune takes an entire week

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.930
to learn."

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.420
"It is a class, it is a one hour class, it’s
the most intensive one hour class you'll ever

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.420
take."

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.171
"We do six hours of rehearsal a week, and
then it's about 8 to 10 hour game day."

00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:58.010
"Game days are crazy long."

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.600
"You know, we’re there before everybody
else, even before the football team, and we

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.780
like that its fun, and we are the last ones
to leave."

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.410
"We have to be there around four and a half
to five hours before the game even kicks off.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.960
We have to rehearse a little bit, we have
to go around and play for all of the tailgaters,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.270
play for the cat walk when the team shows
up.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.680
We do the parade before the game, the rally
in the alley."

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.770
"We have to do pregame."

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.820
"When you first get out there, when you first
do that run on, it's a real adrenaline rush.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.250
You're just like I just have to hit my spot
I just got to get there.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.460
Then you turn around and play your first note,
and you look up, wow."

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.170
"There's 70,000 people looking at you going,
oh hey look they're making, they're spelling

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.350
Kentucky, or they are making the state of
Kentucky.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.890
You don't want to be that one guy who messes
up Kentucky."

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.390
"You know we get everybody supercharged, or
we can play a really good tune, or even just

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.410
play the fight song and get all the fans standing
up and clapping and ready to go.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.050
I think that's a big part of game day."

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.789
"We have to be in it the whole game, we have
to be supportive.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.360
You know if the game is not going our way.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.049
We have to be the first ones to cheer and
support in the play."

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.120
"As long as we stay in it and keep people
pumped and stay in the game, we're worth something.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.209
The football team really feeds off that energy
and they really want us to bring it."

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:35.950
"You will see the band explode and the drum
majors even explode.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.519
We're like yes, scored a touchdown, and then
we are like oh we have to play the fight song

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:46.829
so get ready to say go."

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.900
"You have to be ready to go, because everyone
is going to expect the fight song when we

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.040
score a touchdown they want to sing the words
they want to clap along."

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:04.090
"And so when you have that uniform on, then
you've got to make sure that whatever you

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.980
do you are making all those people proud."

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.129
"When you look back on it you're like I was
a part of something, you know something big,

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.670
something that not everyone gets to do."

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.430
"Knowing that you are part of a big tradition,
a long tradition of people before you who

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.090
have, who were in your shoes, you're keeping
that legacy going."

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.799
"We are always wanting to get better, that’s
the thing, you never want to be complacent."

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.620
"I'd like to see it become one of the best
college marching bands in the country.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.840
And we've got a great university and we've
got a great athletic program.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.099
So I think we need a marching band that we
can say is one of the best in the country

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.099
as well."

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.069
"When you want a goal and you want to achieve
it, you are going to put everything into achieving

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.510
that goal so it makes you work a lot harder."

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.889
"70% of the marching band doesn't receive
a single scholarship dollar to be there."

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.049
"They're doing it because they want to and
they like to.

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.040
You just can't find a better group of friends.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.280
All of my closest friends are in marching
band with me."

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.730
"You're going to know them forever.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.970
You're going to keep in touch."

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.809
"You can't find better people anywhere else."

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.870
"That's probably the biggest thing you take
away from it."

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.399
"That makes marching band for me."
