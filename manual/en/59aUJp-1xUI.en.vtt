Episode 4: Sun-Standing Celebration
Translated by: Anatoly136UA

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.640
For some reason I don't like this day of 'Sun-Standing'...

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
C'mon, Twilight. Everything is fine. I like this.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.440
And, by the way, what are you expected from this fanatics?

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.800
Welcome to the Summer Sun-Standing Celebration.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.740
And now let's welcome a Mayor Mare!

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm a Mayor Mare and I greet you all on our Celebration of Summer Sun-Standing.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.900
And now finally, after many years, we can without any problem see a movie.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.680
This videotape we got from our distant ancestors. A thousand years ago!

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.980
They said to us: a thousand years will pass away and only then you can watch this videotape.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.080
And we waited for thousand years. And now time to watch this wonderful movie.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.940
I hope, you have a popcorn, my dearest friends.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.040
I'm against it! Don't watch it! Don't watch!

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.820
Or Lunar Horse will come and bring with herself night-time forever!

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.720
What a nonsense?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.300
Lead away this crazy one.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.500
How she even can thought that we will watch this movie, without any sacrifice!

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.160
Lead our victim this way.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.160
Can I? Can I be a victim? I want to be a victim!

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.220
No, indeed.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.380
'coz victim is Derpy Hooves.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.620
Oh, why is she so lucky? Why no I? Why they can't take me as a victim?!

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.820
Let's get started!

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.740
And from this day, you will be a victim.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.340
And you will wash the dishes...

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.280
...and bring food to pony.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.460
So, go to the kitchen, woman!

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.660
- It's been so cruel... Spike!

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.300
We need to get out of this place before they start watch this movie and something bad will happen'!

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.580
You mean, I'm bought the tickets in vain, Twilight?

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.680
I'm here to watch the movie!

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.400
What the heck?

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.820
Some sort of stupid adverts!

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.240
Let's movie, now!

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.700
And what is that on screen?

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.340
It's a Lunar Horse! She will come out from screen! Be afraid of her. It's a Lunar Horse!

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.640
And here we go...

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.060
Wow! 3D without glasses!

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.060

Wow! 3D without glasses!
