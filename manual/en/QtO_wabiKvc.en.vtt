00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.930
Hi this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:10.160
On today's episode let me show you how to
create custom ringtones on your iPhone.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.570
Now ever since the launch of the original
iPhone you can create custom ringtones on

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.580
your Mac and sync them over to your iPhone.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.689
But with Garageband for iOS starting last
year sometime with an update you were able

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.789
to create ringtones on the iPhone using the
Garageband app and save them to your iPhone

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.410
with no computer involved.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.150
So here I am in Garageband on my iPhone and
I'm going to just create a new song here and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.150
I'm going to create something very simple.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.700
You can use anything to create a ringtone.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.720
A guitar strum would be nice.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.870
A couple drum hits.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.800
You can use say the keyboard for instance
to do it.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.780
Just record anything.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.970
Just to make a unique sounding ringtone.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:05.040
I'm actually to go in and use the microphone
to do it.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.100
Which might be the most interesting option
because I can just record my voice saying

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.210
something as a ringtone or any sound I hear
in my environment.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.251
So I'm going to go into the Settings here
and I want to turn off the metronome but I

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:21.580
can leave the count-in so I know when I'm
ready to record.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.380
I'm just going to record my voice for this
ringtone.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.070
"Ring Ring."

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.680
There I've got just that as the ringtone.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.930
I can play it back to hear it.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.790
Now I can apply a filter to it here.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.920
I can also go into the editor here and do
various things with it including, of course,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.740
adding new tracks and maybe instruments, background
music, all sorts of things to spice it up.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.650
But for this example I'm just going to keep
it simple and just have my voice saying ring

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.650
ring.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.120
So the next step is I want to exit to the
editor here and go back to My Songs.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.270
Once I'm here I want to select.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.500
I can hit the edit button or I can just tap
and hold over My Song there and all of them

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.889
jiggle, and I've got the outline over the
song I've just created.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.049
Now I can tap the Share button.

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.420
Under Sharing I can go down and see I can
share as a ringtone.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.930
So I'm going to select that and I can change
the name to anything I want.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.019
So in this case I'm going to call it test
ring.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.040
Then hit export.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.219
It will export very quickly.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.349
Now the options I have now are interesting
because I can say OK or Use sound asï¿½.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.349
It tells me that the ringtone is now ready
to go to my computer when I sync with iTunes.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.760
This is how Garageband originally did it.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.239
But in addition to doing that it also put
it in the ringtones for this phone.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.989
I can also hit Use sound as here and I can
use just my standard ringtone, my standard

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.489
text tone, or assign to a specific contact.

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.700
So I can do that right here without ever leaving
Garageband.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.260
But I am not going to do that here in Garageband.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.659
I want to go and get all my options.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.819
So I'm going to go back to Settings here.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.810
Under Settings I'm going to go to Sounds.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.180
Under Sounds I've got all the different options
where I can assign ringtones; ringtone, email,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.930
voicemail, Facebook posts, all sorts of different
things.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.900
So I can assign to any one of these.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.329
Say when I get a new email I'm going to go
in here and I've got all of my alert tones

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:38.040
and under alert tones I've got ringtones here
at the bottom and if I look I can see there

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.459
is my Test Ring.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.360
So I can set it to that and the same thing
if I want it to go to ringtone things appear

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360
in a different order.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360
Ringtones appear at the top.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.569
So there it is under the first set of ringtones
on my custom ones and I can set it to that

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.569
as well.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.569
So think of the possibilities here.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.959
It is very easy to use Garageband to create
drum hits, piano or guitar cords and to use

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:03.959
those as ringtones.

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.409
Assign those to different contacts or for
different things.

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.790
You can record your own voice and even record
your friends voice on your iPhone and use

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.980
their voice as the ringtone for when they
call.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.359
You can use Apple loops and all sorts of different
things in Garageband.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.729
Anything you can do in Garageband.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.380
You can even import music from your iTunes
collection.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.150
When you import it says that certain music,
protected music, music in the cloud can't

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.120
be imported.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.120
So in my experiments a lot of different music
that I had just worked fine in Garageband.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.770
So you might want to play around with that
and then you can take some of your favorite

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.889
songs and use those as ringtones or at least
snippets of those as short ringtones and assign

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:44.949
them to things on your iPhone.

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.500
Of course this also works with the iPad and
iPod Touch.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.960
Anything that can run the latest version of
Garageband.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.660
I hope you found this useful.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:25.979
Until next time this is Gary with MacMost
Now.
