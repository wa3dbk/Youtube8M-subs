00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.329
Hi, I'm Karen, for Expert Village. I think
what we'll do is, I'll show you how to make

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:13.570
the heart and maybe we'll put a frog, in the
middle of the heart. To make the pop-up section,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.860
you take your second card stock, or paper,
and you fold it in half and you take your

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:31.511
pattern and just wrap it around, like that,
and we're going to cut that pattern out. Make

00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:43.150
sure you don't cut your tabs off, you need
those tabs.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:53.410
And that's our base heart and now if you want
the frog to be sticking out, you need to do

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:01.500
two layers of hearts, so I'm going to cut,
the second layer of heart, like this, just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.329
about a quarter inch in and you cut just to
about where the tab is and stop, then go to

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:21.999
the other side and do the same thing and then
just bend that, like so, and that's going

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:36.329
to cause a little pop-up, so this will pop
forward and that heart will pop backward.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:46.479
To make our frog stick out, "it's a little
big here," we'll stick him on the heart, it'll

00:01:46.479 --> 00:02:08.300
just come off there and then we'll just cut
around him and then take the X-Acto Knife

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:21.739
and we'll just, cut him out, remembering to
leave him attached. I'm going to leave him

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:45.000
attached, at the knees here and you take your
X-Acto Knife and cut that all around, the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.739
little frog. "Let me see how it's coming here,
I'm just going to poke out".
