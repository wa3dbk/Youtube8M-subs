00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:18.030
In 
Stargate you fight for the freedom of a people

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.630
who are slaves to an alien posing as a god,
sounds pretty cool, right?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.330
But what I’m about to say is the end-all-be-all:
you play as Kurt Russell.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.970
Do I even need to say more than that?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.620
Kurt’s back to killing aliens once again
after his rampage in John Carpenter’s The

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.620
Thing.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.360
Sadly, though, he’s left his beard at home.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.320
Which is a problem because it’s a pretty
well-known fact that Kurt’s beard is like

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.620
Samson’s hair; it gives him all his powers
and without it he’s vulnerable.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.850
So things are about to get serious.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:59.120
And I mean his beard has its own Facebook
page for f…

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.900
Beardless Kurt is Jack O’Neill, the colonel
of a Special Forces team sent through an alien

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.259
device capable of transporting matter thousands
of light years in an instant, A.K.A. the Stargate.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.000
In spite of the sci-fi keystone that is the
Stargate which holds this story together,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.530
the narrative is actually more archaic and
less scientific.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.210
In place of the technologically advanced planet-cities
of Star Wars or the Citadel of Mass Effect,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.290
Stargate instead takes place on another world
that feels eerily like ancient Egypt with

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.600
dunes and structures that fit the time period.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.890
And this is where you’ll be doing your action
platforming as you trigger click through tyrannical

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.810
overlords while aiding the natives in a rebellion
to overthrow the false God-King Ra.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.110
To reach Ra, O’Neill will be given various
tasks through the campaign, like gathering

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.920
bomb parts and supplies to rescuing captured
members of his squad.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.440
Most of these missions consist of adventuring
across an overworld to find different doors

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.890
or cave entrances, and then entering the doors
and caves to look for objectives.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.010
Sometimes after finishing these missions,
O’Neill will be given a choice of where

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.619
to go next, each direction will change stage
progression a bit.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.670
Going in and out of corridors and choosing
the different pathways leads to a slight sense

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.450
of free-roaming adventure, but nothing that
breaks too far from linearity.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.280
Still, it’s a welcome addition.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.040
Another welcome addition is the different
weapon mods scattered throughout these environments,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.060
like liquid cooling to stop overheating or
bullet spread.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.760
Besides his machine gun, O’Neill can also
toss grenades, which are plentiful but absolutely

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.120
necessary; especially when fighting the very
difficult bosses.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.480
Between hanging, shooting, grenades and machine
gun mods, Stargate can make for some suitable

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.689
action while also showcasing its gameplay
diversity during the tougher encounters.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.029
Gameplay also has occasional flight stages
that break up the on-foot gun-toting.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.719
These flight stages usually have O’Neill
shooting down other enemies or collecting

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.180
fuel to reach far off bases.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.010
Flying missions aren’t as fleshed out as
the platforming or gunning, but it does add

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.269
a nice change to pace.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.269
From the death gliders and staff lasers from
jackal-headed enemies to Kurt Russell and

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.290
James Spader’s portraits delving out dialogue;
the game stays pretty true to the movie.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.469
It’s not the best video game adaptation
ever, but it’s got good animations, sound

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.540
platforming and decent shooting.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.230
What it doesn’t have is Teal’c or Sam,
but that shouldn’t stop any fan of action

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.180
platforming or Stargate from trying this one
out.
