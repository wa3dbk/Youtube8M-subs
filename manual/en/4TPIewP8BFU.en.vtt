00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.410
So I've got my pizza dough completely ready
for the oven, but if you don't want to make

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.170
a conventional pizza, you can always turn
to making a calzone.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.930
It's that little half moon-shaped and it originates
from giving people lunch to go to work with

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.820
and be able to carry a pizza on the go.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.890
It's like a little pocket, so it's super easy
to make.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.070
You just grab a little olive oil, get it right
on the bottom of your crust.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.050
Always do this, whether you're making pizza
or calzone, it will always just keep a lot

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.420
crispier and give a little bit of extra fat
and unctuousness to that dough.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.420
Beautiful.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.350
A little bit of salt, awesome.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.540
So now it's completely up to you.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.760
So I have a little soppressata.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.440
This is what I would take to lunch, if it
was my dream world.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.039
So kind of just cut this up.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.039
You don't have to.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.160
You can just lay it in there.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.140
Just kind of crumble this all on one side.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.809
Leave a little space between this side, and
everything else, okay?

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.070
I have a little bit of broccoli, this is going
to kind of steam inside the pocket, give me

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.659
just a little bit of veg.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.530
Same with my beautiful little zucchini here.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.490
Awesome, and then just some torn basil.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.799
Awesome, really fragrant, right?

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.659
Don't have to worry too much about that.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.460
Little bit of extra salt over the top and
then I'm just going to tear up just a little

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.200
piece of mozzarella.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.680
I'm just building it high.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.399
You can see I'm not kind of building out so
much.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.180
I really just kind of want it all in a pile,
again, leaving a little bit of a lip here

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.219
on the end, okay?

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.060
So now I want to actually make the pocket
and the way you do that is really simple.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.070
You just take your dough and you fold it right
over the top.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.939
So you kind of start with this half moon,
and you start by just kind of pressing around

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.180
it, and then I'm just going to kind of pinch
and fold.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.180
Pinch and fold.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.409
You don't have to do it this way, you can
do it a million different ways.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.610
You can kind of go the other way, if you wanted,
so it shows just a little bit prettier.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.560
All right, so just kind of pinch and fold.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.070
Pinch and fold and keep it rustic.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.099
Keep it looking homemade.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.319
Then at the very end, I kind of use this as
a tail and I pull it out and just kind of

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.040
squeeze it really tight, so you have kind
of this nice little package here.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.970
Then when workers would take this to work,
usually it was the wives cooking.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.890
They would put their initials in it, so they
knew which one's which.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.830
So you also know what's inside your calzone.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.540
So since I'm making this for How Cast, I'm
putting the little H right in the top of my

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.280
pie.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.860
Perfect, so there's my calzone.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.159
You want to kind of give it a couple of holes,
just to kind of let the veg breathe, and then

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.069
I'm going to move this whole thing to a piece
of parchment.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.519
Then that piece of parchment is going to get
one more brushing of oil right over the top.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.750
This is going to really help brown it, give
it that nice sheen.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.989
That's great.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.340
Then I like a little cheese, a little Parmesan
right over the top.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.640
It kind of bakes into it, makes the whole
thing look a little bit more sexy, gives it

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.240
a little bit more character.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.860
This is going in the oven about 450 degrees,
for about 15 minutes until the outside is

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.700
like a shell.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.349
The inside, all the veg is steamed, the fat
from the soppressata has wiggled throughout.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.540
It's amazing.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.730
Quick little dish on the go.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.470
All right, so if I was an old-school wife
in Italy and I was cooking for my man who's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.350
going off to work and I was making a calzone
for him, now is the time I would check it.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.870
It's been about 15 minutes, 450 degrees.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.519
Yes, it even got a little charred here, that's
awesome.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.989
You get a little smokiness.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.860
It kind of looks like it came out of a brick
oven.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.090
Just kind of peel the paper away.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.090
Awesome.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.520
All right, and normally you want to let this
calzone kind of just set up, for about 5 minutes.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.650
You can see how much steam is in there, that
cooked the broccoli.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.420
That kind of broke down the soppressata, but
I'm going out there today, so a great way

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.500
to serve this is just grab a little knife.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.601
Listen to that.

00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:14.920
That is amazing and if you look inside, that's
insane.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.440
So a little bit of finishing oil right over
the top, just to give that whole thing just

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.940
a little bit more unctuousness.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:30.160
Good amount of Parmesan and if you love a
calzone or just looking for a way to take

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.910
pizza to work with you, check out this recipe.
