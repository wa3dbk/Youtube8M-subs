00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.699
the question is

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:08.699
weidel most salon and spa websites
generate more customers for their owners

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.409
was a good question and i'm glad that
you ask

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:18.150
stossel on spot websites typically don't
generate new clients

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.440
because they're not built correctly from
the detail

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.290
there's a lot of of functions and
features that need to be in their to

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.620
generate getting more salon clients there's 
website is winding is being found on the

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.560
internet

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.830
and the second thing is what you are
fine

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.520
converting that client

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.140
into harasser could convert at visitor
intial client

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.540
so those two functions need to be in
place to generate clients if you have

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.440
one you're missing the other is not
going to work and most websites are not

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.990
built correctly with both of those
features and functions in place other

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.140
adults who looked great

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.950
us so you can show your friends and
family how called nice awareness that

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.860
you have

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.090
well when it comes right down getting more salon clients so those are websites

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.710
need to be dealt from the get go so they
can be found on the internet

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.520
and once they are found not convert the
visitor into a quiet

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.900
it is there that uh...

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.219
in a lot of people think

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.659
website is

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.330
is a business

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.970
although it really is the delivery
mechanism for your

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.000
so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.080
electronic

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.400
delivery system

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.930
so your message

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.240
still has to be direct response driven

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.120
in order for people to

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.680
respond

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.600
so we find all the time

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.640
slots policy of the screws so it's
impossible i wanted to go

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.030
they're not threatens faster so someone
does find it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.090
than i did

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.740
results from it

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.420
uh... divorce getting more salon clients

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.830
tatoo

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.590
two-step process godfather photos

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.609
uh... characteristics

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:14.599
to converted visitor to rape

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.979
artists you wanted a from haitians well

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:22.929
if you're caught the domain name for
your website is the name of your

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:24.189
business

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.629
you're using clients st

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.489
because the name of your business has no
relationship with the

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.169
search words that are being put in

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.420
these search engines p

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.139
cruel and that's uh...

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.659
bang

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.189
corporals many there

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.400
your name has no relevance to what
people are searching

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.059
your services in your city

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.719
that you live in the democratic area
they have relevance

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:59.189
so with that being said if you are using
their domainname

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.829
that is the name of your business you
are losing you are not getting the

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.299
client's that sheet from

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.029
dated

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.509
the beautiful thing about the you know
that we're going to go

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.339
is doing a search

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.859
a lot for your product or service

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.029
the services that you offer in their out
there looking

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.019
if you're not being filed

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.379
if you don't have that threatens busted
site

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.159
that they're going to competitors so
really want to get this straight dozens

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.329
of characters

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.069
that's for the future

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.120
right and let me add to that out what
you're thinking of i'll

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.180
the search engines and this disrepair

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.870
when you don't sit down content-type and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.409
let's use school as an exam

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.069
you type in something that you're
looking for

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.699
google considers you any customer of
their s

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.989
the results that come off in your search
are the businesses that google is

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.559
recommending

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:03.679
to you

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:10.009
based on what you try ten double yellow
box there product rule

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:15.899
so when your website is below cassidy
bill it from captain don

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:17.009

be on there

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.360
to capitalize what you can and that
process

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.099
so when you get all that writing you
continue to do wind and and

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.259
and uh...

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.740
put together what the search engines are

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:52.390
uh... by a search engine so there are
some personal consumers are

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.190
the people who are sitting down to sleep
u_s_

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.169
probably thousands of times sit down and
type in something that you're looking

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.969
on the internet so that's a really
 getting more salon clients
