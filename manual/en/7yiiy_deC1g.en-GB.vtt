00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:08.950
Welcome to Nishamadhulika.com

00:00:09.463 --> 00:00:11.487
Today we'll prepare Fafda.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.986
Fafda is a Gujrati recipe,

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:16.647
In there, it is a 'street food'.

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:18.821
and is very famous.

00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:20.649
Fafda can be eaten

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:21.997
for breakfast

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:25.946
or as snacks.

00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:29.421
So let us begin.

00:00:29.807 --> 00:00:31.076
The ingredients are:

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:33.459
Gram Flour - 2 cup

00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:39.940
Oil - 5 tbsp (a little more than 1/4 cup)

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:42.825
Carom seeds - 1/2 tsp.

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:46.567
Sodium Benzoate - 2 tsp.

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:51.695
Salt - 1/2 tsp. or according to taste

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.682
and Oil for frying the Fafda.

00:00:55.074 --> 00:00:56.417
For preparing the Fafda,

00:00:56.617 --> 00:01:00.281
first we'll knead the dough.

00:01:01.017 --> 00:01:03.905
We've taken the gram flour in a large bowl

00:01:04.276 --> 00:01:05.705
&amp; this 1/3 cup water;

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:09.050
to the water we'll add

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:13.769
sodium benzoate, 2 tsp.

00:01:14.193 --> 00:01:15.697
add salt as well

00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:18.047
and will mix them.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.364
If we don't have Sodium Benzoate,

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:24.927
then we can use baking soda instead.

00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:26.699
But Baking Soda,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.929
should be a little more than 1/2 tsp.

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:33.828
We'll mix Sodium Benzoate and Salt in the water.

00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:40.208
To the flour, add crushed carom seeds.

00:01:40.807 --> 00:01:42.035
The flavor becomes very nice

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:46.056
and add oil as well.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.172
Mix every thing well.

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.298
And now

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.678
add the water

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.055
knead a little tight dough.

00:01:58.992 --> 00:02:01.074
Should be softer than Poori dough

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.347
and harder than Parantha dough.

00:02:04.747 --> 00:02:10.767
We'll knead the dough for 6-7 minutes.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.751
So we've kneaded the dough for 7 minutes.

00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:21.308
and greeze it.

00:02:21.813 --> 00:02:26.710
Now we'll cover the dough and keep it aside for 1/2 hours.

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:29.637
then we'll make the Fafda.

00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:34.410
30 minutes have gone by

00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:36.978
and our dough is ready.

00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:40.784
So now roll we'll roll the dough.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:45.545
This is our rolling board

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:49.570
and on it we will roll the Fafda.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.249
We'll cut the dough into little lumps.

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:55.390
We've shaped the dough into a cylinder.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:03:04.098
Now we'll cut it into small 1 inch long lumps

00:03:06.294 --> 00:03:08.089
We'll take one lump

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:13.547
and we'll shape it longitudinally

00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:14.500
like this.

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.971
Now place it on the board

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:20.503
and press with your palm.

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:24.026
Now stick one end to board by pressing it

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:29.797
and elongate the remaining part by pressurizing it longitudinally.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.791
To remove it we'll use a palate knife.

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:38.660
Although for it specially, there is a utensil.

00:03:39.308 --> 00:03:43.851
So we'll roll our Fafda like this and keep it aside in a plate.

00:03:44.521 --> 00:03:53.341
We'll shape the lump long; press it, and elongate e longitudinally.

00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:56.483
we'll use the palate knife to remove it.

00:03:56.683 --> 00:04:01.803
So we'll repeat the processfor all the Fafda.

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:06.511
So first let us prepare 4-5 fafdas like this.

00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.397
and then we will fry them.

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:15.288
The oil is hot now. But to check the oil,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.813
drop a little dough in it.

00:04:18.322 --> 00:04:22.969
The dough should get fried immediately and start floating on the oil

00:04:23.177 --> 00:04:26.580
the should be this hot.

00:04:26.908 --> 00:04:27.991
The oil is hot,

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:31.009
put the Fafda in the oil to fry it;

00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:49.171
the fafdas have been fried.

00:04:49.668 --> 00:04:56.123
they look very crispy; their color has changed a little;
now strain them out.

00:05:27.997 --> 00:05:30.696
Let us fry them.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.020
Add as many fafdas the cauldron can accommodate.

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:41.702
Immerse them in the oil by using a strainer,

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.619
so that they get fried well.

00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:46.683
They've become crispy,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.298
color has changed,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.992
they're ready, take them out.

00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:55.970
All our fafdas have been fried.

00:05:56.602 --> 00:05:58.594
Fafda are ready.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.971
They're really nice.

00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:04.477
We've kept their size small;

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.972
because generally we don't havebig cauldrons in our houses.

00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:14.266
The market have longer fafdas.

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:17.595
We've to be a little careful,

00:06:17.895 --> 00:06:24.048
when you're kneading the dough, it should be too damp or dry;

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:30.075
the dough should be harder than Parantha dough and softer than poori's.

00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:36.617
If the dough is too hard, then you'll have to use a lot force.

00:06:37.148 --> 00:06:41.579
And if it is soft, it gets rolled easily.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.969
While frying them,

00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:46.499
keep the oil really hot.

00:06:46.763 --> 00:06:49.437
There must be smoke rising from it.

00:06:49.718 --> 00:06:53.087
To check the oil, drop a little dough in it,

00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:57.905
it should immediately float.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.790
If it does, the oil is hot enough.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.995
Fry the Fafda in this oil and it will get fried quickly.

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:09.318
Savor the Fafda with Gram Flour Chutney

00:07:09.564 --> 00:07:14.765
but if isn't available, then serve it with Green Coriander Chutney.

00:07:14.965 --> 00:07:17.280
Or with a pickle

00:07:17.748 --> 00:07:21.717
or with fried green chilies.

00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:25.656
