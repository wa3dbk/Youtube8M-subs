00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.040
We’re back in Kubinka, this time in front of the IS-4.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.920
Develoment of IS-4 started in November of 1943, although production didn’t start until 1946: It missed the war.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.320
The idea was to try to take into account any defects or improvements from IS-2, and to incorporate any captured enemy technology.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.440
As a result, you’re going to see a few things which do link to IS-2,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.000
but you’ll also see some very novel features which don’t exist on any other Soviet vehicles of the era.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.480
We’re going to do this in the typical fashion, exterior first, have a look at the suspension,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.200
go around up to the engine deck, move forward onto the turret and then move inside.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.840
We should get a pretty good overview of the vehicle that way.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.720
One of the first differences you’re going to notice with IS-2 is the front slope.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.960
IS-2 had a sort of stepped front slope, with an almost vertical driver’s port, this was deemed something of a weak point.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.080
Part of the design parameters for IS-4 was that it was supposed to withstand the German 8.8 L/71 cannon.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.320
So what they did was made a single glacis, they added additional armor protection for the driver,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.360
and that was deemed sufficient.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.360
Other features on the front slope, nothing too unusual, you have the standard service light and horn.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.280
The two little plates in between the tow hooks, those are, I’m told, service markings.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.600
Every time the tank went in for service or modification, they would engrave the update onto that.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.240
The only other last thing to note is that the fenders are spring loaded,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.080
you can actually lift them up and they’ll hold in position, which seems to be a bit of an excess to me, but what the hey.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.040
So, the fenders. Soviet over-engineering at its finest.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.800
You undo a latch here,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920
and simply they get locked into position.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.960
Now, why exactly they felt the need to put this particular creature comfort on the tank I’m not entirely sure.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.200
I have to say, if I was going to put life improvements,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.080
spring loaded fenders would probably not be number one on my list of priorities.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.280
No particular surprises when you get to the running gear.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.480
You basically take an IS-2 and add an extra set of roadwheels, we now have seven pair per side.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.400
Torsion bar, again.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.400
A point to note, the bump stops do exist like other torsion bar vehicles, but unlike, say,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.040
an American vehicle, there are no shock absorbers or friction snubbers to stop the rocking effect of the torsion bar.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.200
They simply rely on mass.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.000
The wheels themselves, they have cast serial numbers so you know who made them.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.680
Lubrication, they’ve actually pulled off a bolt on this one, that’s how you add your oil, put the bolt back in and away you go.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.760
Track tension, similar again to the other ISs, there’s a locking plate, you kick the locking plate out of the way,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.080
you then get your big wrench and crank the screw forwards or backwards to extend the idler wheel forwards or backwards.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.720
Track: The same as pretty much everything else on the IS series,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.440
the only difference here is that we now have a center guide on every individual track link instead of the more typical alternating version.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.400
Single pin, kept in place by a clip and a couple of washers.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.360
The last thing to point out is that the sideskirts are a mid-life modification, they were added in the 50s,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:51.240
and unlike, say, the IS-3, the side hull doesn’t angle out to the side, it’s a simple, angular step.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.000
There is absolutely nothing of interest on this side of the tank whatsoever

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.520
because they had to leave room for the unditching log, which would be mounted here.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.920
Moving to the rear of the tank, things get a little more interesting again.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.720
Each fender could hold two cylindrical 90-litre fuel tanks, side by side.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.440
These are not attached to the fuel system, they are simply to be pumped or siphoned into the internal fuel tanks.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.720
To the rear center are the mounting points for the MDH smoke generators.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.520
MDH, I’m told, stands for “Small Naval Generator”. Simple enough.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.640
They are equipped with a quick-detach for the driver, he can just pull a lever and the things will fall off,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.400
if, for some reason, he needs to.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.720
To the front of that is the large access port for the transmission housing.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.680
It looks like to open it up, you have to do a lot of unbolting of bolts,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.680
and it’s a big piece of metal and it looks like you need two or three lads to open it up

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.160
Seems very inconvenient to me, I wouldn’t want to be doing it routinely.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.240
The gun travel lock, of course, for holding the gun.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.280
You’d spin the turret to the rear if you were, say, undertaking railheading

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.520
Spinning the turret to the rear performs two functions: Firstly it reduces the overhang so the overall length of tank is reduced,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:17.120
and secondly, it’s a good crutch, it stops the excess of load on the elevation mechanism

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.400
due to bumps or whatever as they’re simply locked in place.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.080
As you move to the rear, we have the convoy lights, marker lights, and not much else.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.760
As we come to the left hand side of the tank, we now have room for two stowage boxes: No log.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.440
Exhaust, one on each side, of course, you may have noticed as we went around the far side. And then we move up onto the turret.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.120
Turret has mounting points for gun maintenance equipment, lots and lots of handles for the tank riders:

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.560
Tank riders were the infantry that would ride on the tank, and then when they got into combat they’d bail off to the side and go on on foot.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.840
We suspect that this is the intercom system for the infantry commander to speak with the tank crew

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.320
as the tank crew would likely have been buttoned up.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.240
Which does beg the question, if it’s dangerous enough for the tank crew to be buttoned up,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.760
why in God’s name would you be riding on the outside of the tank.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.720
However, I don’t get paid to make those decisions, next stop, engine deck.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.880
As you get up on the engine deck, the obvious thing that you’ll see here are the circular radiator fans, shamelessly stolen from the Germans.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Outside of that, not too much.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.880
There is the central port here for the cooling.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.520
There are two fuel tanks.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:41.080
The left fuel tank is 295 gallons, the right is 115, giving you a grand total of 410, which will get you about 170 kilometers.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.240
If you traverse the turret to one side, there is an access port for the engine itself,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.400
you can lift it up, it hinges sideways, and you can see the top of the V12.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:00.600
Moving forward, casting mark on the turret, and again the loader’s 12.7 mm Dshka,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.760
which goes to quite a significant angle of elevation very easily.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.920
Blade sight, optical sight.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.400
I’m told 60 rounds in the magazine.
