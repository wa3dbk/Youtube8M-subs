Our topic for today is Introduction to Light.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.310
Light is a form of energy that enables us
to see all the things around us.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.280
The main source of light on the earth is the sun.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.000
Plants are able to prepare their own food
using sunlight.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.480
Some other objects also give out light.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.000
They are known as luminous objects.

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:27.540
For example, bulbs, lamps, candles, etc. are luminous objects.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.190
While there are some objects that do not give out light.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.360
They are known as non luminous objects.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:57.430
For example table, cloth, bag, utensils, etc. are non luminous objects.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:08.320
Non luminous objects are generally of two types, transparent objects and opaque objects.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:16.890
Transparent objects are those that allow light to pass through them, like glass, water etc.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:27.000
While, opaque objects are those that do not allow light to pass through them, like wood, stone etc.
