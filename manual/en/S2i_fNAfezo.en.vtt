Hey guys welcome back to my channel. Today I'm going to be showing you how to go from frizzy

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.130
to smooth and shiny hair

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.980
using my go to DIY hair mask, now lets get started

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.200
This is what you'll need

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.150
first you're going to need some honey which is great for locking in moisture and shine

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.160
and help soften your hair. Coconut milk is a key

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.440
ingredient  for smoothing your hair it reduces frizz and prevents shedding as well as promotes

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.060
Hair Growth

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.730
Yogurt is going to thicken the mixture as well as add some much needed protein

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.070
castor oil is one of my all time favoirte oils

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.239
its amazing for hair growth. Now it's
time

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.630
to mix it all together

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.950
I add equal parts honey and castor oil

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.250
then I poor in a whole can of coconut milk and whisk in

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.050
2 spoonfuls of yogurt

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.680
Mix well and poor into a empty container, I'm just using a  empty carols daughter

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.070
conditioner bottle

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.730
because of the pump its easy to use

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.550
Now, to tame this hot mess

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.320
But sometimes you like the crazy hair, but sometimes you don't

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.780
but you really do but wherever we're
gonna fix it

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.050
start by sectioning off your hair into top and bottom sections

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.790
put a few pumps in your hand and work through your hair from root

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.150
to tip

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.459
I recommend putting a towel down because this can get a little messy

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.440
It is a runnier consistency

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.690
I like the massage my scalp with the mixture as well

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.800
Now that you have fully saturated the hair go grab a

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.479
Plastic bag out of your plastic bag underneath the kitchen sink

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.420
and wrap your hair in it to lock in heat

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.910
I like to lock in even more heat by using a towel on top or a turbi twist

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.590
is my favorite go to. And it makes it extra hot under there

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.900
now that you're looking real fancy

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.000
with your head wrapped up tight, we are going to let that sit

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.820
for

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.420
about an hour or so, and rinse out

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.180
Once that's all finished you'll have smooth hydrated

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.790
frizz free hair. Do this once a week to keep frizz at bay

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.680
and alter the measurements based on your specific hair needs

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.920
