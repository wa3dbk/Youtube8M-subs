00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:19.250
It’s time to confront a major threat to
our global environment: cows. Yup – turns

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.449
out that livestock are a major contributor
to greenhouse gas pollution. Right up there

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.550
with cars, planes and trains.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.399
And at the rate we’re producing beef worldwide,
emissions from cows – along with other harmful

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:40.229
practices in beef production – threaten
to mess up our climate, land and water. Big

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:41.620
time.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.550
On average, Americans eat three times more
meat than people in other countries. From

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.839
the end of World War II to the mid-1970s,
beef consumption per person doubled. The U.S.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.749
is now the largest beef producer in the world.
Our beef industry is a powerhouse worth $74

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.249
billion a year and providing millions of jobs.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:08.731
Today, more and more Americans are choosing
chicken and pork, even tofu. But much of the

00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:10.960
meat we eat is still beef.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.490
Let’s look at an all-American food: the
hamburger. On average, we eat about three

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.560
burgers per week. So let’s see: If all 313
million Americans eat three burgers per week,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.150
that’s 156 burgers per person per year.
All together, that’s more than 48 billion

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.790
burgers every year.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.710
A quarter-pounder at a fast food joint costs
3 or 4 bucks. That’s pretty cheap. But what

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.031
we don’t pay for at the counter, we end
up paying for in other ways. What are the

00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:42.860
hidden costs?

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.830
First of all, cows take up a lot of space.
Worldwide, livestock use 30 percent of the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.580
earth's entire land area – that’s counting
pastures and land used to grow grain for feed.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.120
We use about eight times as much land for
feeding animals as for feeding humans. And

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.890
in places like Brazil, acres of forest are
still being cleared for livestock – which

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.060
creates pollution and also removes a perfect
sponge for absorbing carbon dioxide.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.359
And did someone mention water? It takes about
1,800 gallons of water to make a single pound

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.720
of grain-fed beef – that’s about four
times the amount for chicken and more than

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.939
10 times the amount for a pound of wheat.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:28.629
Why does it take so much land and water to
feed cows? Well, for one thing, cows eat a

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.629
lot.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.909
During the first six months, a calf eats and
eats and eats. When it’s about 700 pounds,

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.640
it’s sold at auction – usually to a feedlot,
which is like a very crowded cow city.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.480
At the feedlot, the cow continues to eat and
eat and eat. At most feedlots, cows eat a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.799
mixture of soy and corn.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:56.400
This whole feed system’s pretty new. Before
the 1970s, cows ate mostly grass. Then Congress

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.189
passed a farm bill that changed everything.
The government started paying farmers to grow

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:07.629
feed crops like corn and soy. It also helped
pay for more fertilizer. So, voila: Now corn

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.079
is in everything from sodas to cereal. And
most of the country’s 90 million cows now

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.139
get corn for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.840
Unfortunately, cows are built to digest grass.
Corn can make them bloat with gas, and cows

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.079
make a lot of gas.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.799
This is no joke.

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.120
See, cows are ruminants – meaning they create
methane gas when they digest food. Chicken

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.620
and pigs don’t. Methane has 21 times more
climate-changing power than CO2. In America,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.120
cows produce more greenhouse gas than 22 million
cars per year.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.269
America’s cows create about 500 million
tons of manure in a year. That’s three times

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.870
as much as we humans do. Cow manure also creates
nitrous oxide, which has 300 times the global

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.499
warming effect of CO2. Cow manure is responsible
for two-thirds of all the nitrous oxide pollution

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:05.499
in the world.

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:10.829
There’s another source of nitrous oxide
in a cow’s life cycle: fertilizer. We Americans

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.459
use 17 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer
to grow feed for our cows.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.810
When runoff from fertilizer and manure flow
into rivers, and then to the ocean, they create

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.110
huge algae blooms, which suck the oxygen out
of the water and leave dead zones where no

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.610
life can survive.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.821
Anyway, back to the feedlot. Once the cows
are fattened up, they head to the slaughterhouse.

00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:39.660
Slaughterhouses create about 30 million pounds
of contaminants a year – mainly nitrates

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.740
and ammonia used to disinfect meat.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.230
From the slaughterhouse, the beef is shipped
to big processing centers, where California

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.650
beef is mixed with Texas beef and Colorado
beef. One burger patty can contain the DNA

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.340
of more than a thousand cows. That means a
single case of E. coli could easily spread

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.250
to thousands of burgers. Trucking all that
beef around creates pollution, too.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.900
This isn't an exact science, and the numbers
vary depending on how the cows were raised.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.940
But a single quarter-pounder clocks in at
about 6½ pounds of greenhouse gases. That

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.830
might not sound like much, but with Americans
eating three burgers per week, that’s more

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.120
than 158 million tons of greenhouse gases
per year – about the same amount of greenhouse

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.210
gas as 34 coal-fired power plants.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.270
It’s not the cow’s fault. It’s the system
we’ve created to mass-produce beef that’s

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.210
the problem. Too many burgers take a toll
on the environment. They can take a toll on

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.110
your body, too.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.910
This is the recommended daily diet. And this
is how most Americans actually eat. We eat

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.860
way too much meat, grains, fat and sugar,
and not enough fruits and vegetables.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.870
Many studies show that eating too much red
meat can lead to heart disease, high blood

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.960
pressure and, in some cases, diabetes. The
hidden costs add up.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.890
One research group figured the cost just in
greenhouse gases, water for growing cattle

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:11.030
feed and health care at about $1.51 for every
burger. Multiply that by the 48 billion burgers

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.230
Americans eat every year, and that’s more
than $72 billion. We don’t pay it at the

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.990
store or at the fast food joint. But we pay
it in other ways.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.450
So what can we do?

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.220
Well, we don’t have to give up meat to change
our impact. Cutting out just one burger per

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.700
week would remove as much greenhouse gas pollution
as taking your car off the road for 350 miles.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.990
If all Americans ate no meat or cheese one
day a week, it would have the same climate-change

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.500
prevention effect as taking 7.6 million cars
off the road for one year.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.000
And while it's more expensive, grass-fed beef
does less damage to the environment.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.240
Even the smallest choices make a big difference
– to the environment, to our neighbors,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.260
to our health. In the U.S., people are starting
to eat less meat. But the rest of the world

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:06.830
is eating more. Just imagine: What if all
1.3 billion people in China ate three burgers

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.560
a week – like we do?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:36.540
Could our planet keep up?
