00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:04.015
- Hey Ashly.

00:00:04.015 --> 00:00:04.916
- Oh, hi.

00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:06.085
- How was your weekend?

00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:07.258
- My weekend was great.

00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:09.801
I went hiking with my, Clayton.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.134
- That's your dog, or what?

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:14.967
- No, it's actually, well, it's him.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.937
- Oh.

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:21.699
The guy with the shirt
that's too small for him?

00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.949
- I think it's just more
that his muscles are too big.

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:27.291
- Yeah, I think they are too big.

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:30.779
He can't scratch his own back,
it's kind of stupid, right?

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.277
- (laughs) You're right,
I'm gonna go help him.

00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:34.047
Hey.

00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:35.702
- Hey, Ashly, how's it going?

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.028
- [Ashly] What are you doing?
- [Clayton] Bring it in.

00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:41.041
(intense music with bass beats)

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.663
- So there I was, vomit frozen in my beard

00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:48.764
from the altitude sickness,
and here comes mama polar bear,

00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:53.303
looks at me, nods, and just walks on by.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:54.257
- [Girls] (laugh) No, no.
- Yeah.

00:00:54.257 --> 00:00:55.973
- That is insane.
- Mm hmm.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.553
- This one time at the zoo,
I was throwing up a lot,

00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:02.702
because all I had to eat
that day was ice cream.

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:04.922
Uh...

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:06.173
And...

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:09.801
It was in front of a
polar bear exhibit, so...

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:12.705
- I love polar bears, man.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.526
- Aren't they the best?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:15.949
- [Girls] Yeah, so cute.
- [Clayton] Yeah, I know.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.871
- Hey, uh, who's that new guy?

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.309
- This guy, Clayton.

00:01:22.113 --> 00:01:23.658
I heard he's anti-vaccination.

00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:24.829
- [Blue-Haired Girl]
Well, you know, that's a,

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.172
that's a trend, you know.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.848
- He also took a big dump
in the bathroom, so...

00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:30.107
- [Clayton] This is too easy
- [Ashly] Oh my god, come on.

00:01:30.107 --> 00:01:31.563
- [Clayton] You can't guard.
- [Ashly] It's not my fault

00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:32.619
that you're 6'7.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.676
- Cross over clean!

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.128
- Okay, where am I?
- What am I supposed-

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.718
Hello, foul!

00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:38.511
- This is how you play basketball, ugh!

00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:39.671
(laughs)

00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:41.809
Wah-moo! (laughs)

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:43.124
Wah-moo!

00:01:43.678 --> 00:01:46.104
(laughs) This isn't basketball.

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:47.787
(music abruptly stops)
(high-pitched tone)

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:50.800
- Oh my god.
- Are you okay?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.742
What happened?

00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:52.732
- Ow!

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:57.225
(intense music with bass beats)
