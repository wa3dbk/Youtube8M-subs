00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.549
This is a how-to guide for using the S.O.A.P.S.Tone
strategy to analyze literature and speeches.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.280
SOAPSTone can be used to analyze how the different
parts of a composition lead to greater meaning

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.019
and understanding.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.380
SOAPSTone can also be used as a planning device
for your own essays.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.480
The S.O.A.P.S.Tone acronym stands for speaker,
occasion, audience, purpose, subject, and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.500
tone.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.660
Look at each piece individually at first,
then bring them all together to enhance your

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.390
understanding of the text.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.200
The speaker is the voice that tells the story.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.500
If there is someone identified as the speaker
in the piece, see if you can make some assumptions

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.199
about him or her.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.260
Can you tell what social class the speaker
belongs to?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.079
Can you tell if the speaker has any political
bias?

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.760
What gender is the speaker?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.519
How do all of these things play a role in
the passage as a whole?

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.129
Occasion involves the time and place of the
piece, the context that prompted the writing.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.540
Think about what might have prompted the author
to write this piece.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.970
What event led to its publication or development?

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.280
The group of readers to whom the piece is
directed is called the audience.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.430
Sometimes the author identifies the audience
directly, and sometimes we have to make assumptions

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.900
based on what the author says and the words
he uses.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.160
We also need to consider the occasion in this
case.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.630
The purpose is the reason behind the text,
why the author is writing.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.400
Think about the author's language and any
literary techniques he or she employs.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.890
Think about how the speaker feels and how
he or she wants the audience to feel.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.250
The subject of the piece can be stated in
a few words or phrases and should be supported

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.290
by evidence from the text.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.180
Think about why the author chose this subject
over all of the other subjects to write about.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.850
Tone is the author's attitude toward the subject.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.390
When evaluating the tone of a piece, look
at the word choice and images the author uses.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.090
Also consider the sentence structures the
author uses as well as any intended irony

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.500
or satire.
