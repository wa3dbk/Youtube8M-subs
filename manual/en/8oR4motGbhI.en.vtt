Hello my name is Jose Zuniga, I'm representing
expertvillage.com. I'm going to guide you

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:10.360
on the steps that are necessary to clean the
interior of a car. What we basically need

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.700
is warm water in the bucket, we are going
to add a little bit of drops of dish detergent.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.300
That tends to the work. We are also need our
q-tips they are going to come in hand later

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.279
on when we are not able to reach with a sponge
in certain areas and we need a old tee shirt.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.080
This is going to do the work. So what we are
going to start with is lets get the center

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.000
of the car right here the console. One thing
that you need to consider is as you are cleaning

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.760
spot check all the time. Also dry as you go
dry as you go get every single corner. There

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.230
we go. Get all these little stubborn. There
we go I'm telling you this is going to be

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.280
like a new car. Also our q-tips come in handy
in this particular areas that we are not able

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:11.670
to reach with the brush or . 
Wow look at all that dirt I'm telling you

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.789
these are life savers. So we are going to
get the dash board now. Dry as we go. Don't

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:27.060
forget the radio we tend to get finger prints
there. There we go. Get this area nice and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:39.960
clean and you dry. Don't forget the sides
here of the seats. Most of forget the little

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:51.139
pocket here. This is great. The rest of the
door. Lets not forget underneath the seat

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:57.430
and right over here spot check, clean and
wipe and of course the paddle breaks we tend

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.350
to forget there. Spot check and clean. This
is great this car is going to be like brand

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:19.030
new. Hit the steps out here. This is great.
Spot check, wipe, get the side, great. There

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.030
we go. Wow that wasn't that bad was it? Come
on lets do the rest and this is how we clean

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.510
the interior of a car.
