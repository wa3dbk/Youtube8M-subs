00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.290
Narrator:
Birders from around the world flock to the

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.170
Texas coast each winter to catch a glimpse
of the endangered whooping crane.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.180
The birds migrate here from Canada, a flight
that almost ended 50 years ago.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.450
[Lee Ann Linam] When we first started keeping
track of whooping cranes there were only 16

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.260
to 20 left in the wild.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.390
As conservation and protection efforts began
in the 1940s and the 1950s, we just saw this

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.340
very slow but steady recovery…now we’re
hoping to hit 300.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.480
Narrator:
As their numbers increase, it appears whooper

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.300
behavior may be changing.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.070
[Lee Ann Linam] Last year was an unusual winter.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.329
Some our whooping cranes made it to their
traditional wintering grounds and other whooping

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.910
cranes chose to stop over in different locations
in the state.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.480
We actually had three families spend the winter
in the Austin area.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.649
Narrator:
Biologists want to understand this change

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.510
in behavior and are asking for the public’s
help in gathering data.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.530
[Lee Ann Linam] We started a new Citizen Science
Project we’re calling Texas Whooper Watch.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.090
And we’re encouraging Texans to be on the
lookout for whooping cranes in migration

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.560
Narrator:
The site has a simple reporting form, along

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.850
with pictures to help you ensure what you’re
seeing is really a whooping crane.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.909
Whoopers are about five feet tall with black
wingtips.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.890
They fly in small flocks of two to six and
have a distinctive bugling call.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.440
If you are lucky enough to spot this rare
bird, keep your distance.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.460
[Lee Ann Linam] The disturbance that close
observation can cause means that the whooping

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.000
crane has less time to feed and be successful
in producing a chick for the coming year.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.390
Narrator:
Texas is one of the few places you can see

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.390
whoopers.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.440
They arrive in late October and start the
long flight back to Canada in the spring.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.119
[Lee Ann Linam] Very majestic looking and
also kind of bearing a lot of mystique just

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.790
because of those pair bonds that they form
for life and the courtship displays and the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.820
really haunting bugling calls.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.960
So they capture the public’s fascination
and they really provide us with an inspiring

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960
kind of comeback story

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.730
Narrator:
For Texas Parks and Wildlife, this is Abe

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.920
Moore.
