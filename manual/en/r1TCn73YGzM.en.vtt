00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.590
I'm going to vacuum the whole carpet today.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.509
We're also going to give it a steam clean.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.040
High temperature is the best way to steam
clean your carpet, getting rid of all those

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.040
nasties.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.040
You want your place to be hygienic at all
times.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.040
I know that I do.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.869
We are going to use a Rug Doctor, and we are
also going to use a wash and and an anti-foam

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:21.970
at a high pressure.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.779
If you have a large family and pets, obviously
you'll be doing it three, four times a year

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.359
if not five or six and the average home needs
it, at least, twice a year.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.990
We've got a vacuum cleaner, We've got our
ingredients for our stain cleaner, lukewarm

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.150
water that we need for our stain cleaner.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.060
To start off with, we are going to vacuum
the room thoroughly to get rid of all dust

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.070
particles and anything that's large.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:57.160
I've got a really good vacuum cleaner here
which helps.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.450
For spots and stains around your carpet, what
I tend to do is find all the areas I want

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.370
to work with, get close to it, to the stain,
work with it.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.150
After a few minutes we've worked the spot
and stain on the carpet.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.380
Now I'm going to work the stain inwards by
use of a damp cloth.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.380
You can use a sponge also and work all around
the room.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.260
Now I've completed all the spot staining after
a few minutes, and I'm ready to vacuum one

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.810
more time and give it a steam cleaning.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.049
I got my carpet cleaning machine here with
my bucket of lukewarm water and my chemical

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.049
solutions.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:46.820
So what we do is we take the canister out,
like this, add nine litres of lukewarm water

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.820
in here.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.530
With the carpet detergent we need two-thirds
of a cup.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.990
After add those two ingredients, we also add
a third of a cup of of anti-foam inside our

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.580
canister and we're ready to go.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.780
From our exit door, we have to use the furthest
point and work backwards from there so we

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.700
have access to move outside the room after
we've completed.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:18.340
I'm going to turn on the carpet cleaner and
move backwards.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:28.260
And the conclusion of the carpet cleaning,
give two to four hours of drying time and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.750
don't bring any furniture inside in that period
of time.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.860
I'm done for now, I'm going for a cuppa.
