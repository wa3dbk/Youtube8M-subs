00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.300
The first segment of Three Wonders, the strange
ahead-of-its-time compilation game for arcades,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.240
is a side-scrolling action platformer featuring
Lou, that big-nosed dude.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.320
Who apparently hangs out with frogs, who give
him quests.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.640
I’m not about to judge.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.230
Apparently there’s a magic playing card
that’s actually a map to a flying device

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.360
called the Chariot, which is not only a suitable
endpoint for a game like this but an excellent

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.220
segue to its SHMUP counterpart, fittingly
entitled “Chariot.”

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.940
So begins a brief - but well-executed - run-and-gun
adventure, complete with giant bosses, a bevy

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.110
of guns, and a desperate longing for a second
player to cover your six.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.660
Unfortunately, while the game encourages you
to plunk in another quarter and double-team

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:09.120
this challenge, I was alone in the studio
that night so I had to fend for myself.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.000
First off, I want to know what’s Capcom’s
obsession with blowing armor or clothes off

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.670
of their arcade protagonists.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.830
It happened in Ghosts ‘n Goblins, it happened
in Black Tiger, and it’s all over Midnight

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.110
Wanderers.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.110
We get it, you only get two hit points.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.740
Apparently clothes are optional when searching
for the artifact that will save the world.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.160
What’s even weirder is that Lou loses his
gun when injured, and apparently has to throw

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.500
all his bullet-arrow-weapon things.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.680
With his hands.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.010
Which is kinda impressive.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.920
Lou can upgrade his armaments with bombs,
weird horizontally-traveling discus thingies,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.460
and a projectile that looks like he Got Equipped
With Quick Boomerangs.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.080
He’s also got options, in the SHMUP sense
of the word, weird floating-spirit things

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.460
that hang out in his vicinity and provide
supporting fire.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.030
It’s a great game in its own right, even
if this toybox-castle level feels kinda like

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.500
Clown Man’s stage from Mega Man 8.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.250
And that seems to underline the theme of the
Three Wonders games: each of the sub-titles

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.459
in the compilation are fleshed-out and, individually,
quite good; they’re just on the short side.

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.879
Which seems counterproductive, given the standard
arcade mantra of “TAKE EVERY QUARTER THEY

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.920
HAVE.”

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.280
But it’s obvious that Capcom weren’t willing
to sacrifice quality when they were providing

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.280
quantity.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.970
(Or challenge, for that matter, as this over-water
section is pleased to demonstrate.)

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.750
Heck, for 1991, just being able to jump and
fire downward was a revolutionary concept.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.220
Three Wonders never saw much attention here
in the states - no one’s falling all over

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.300
themselves to put it on a list of arcade superstars
like NBA Jam or Mortal Kombat - but looking

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.620
back, it’s obvious this game was a step
ahead in terms of design.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.270
So let’s give Midnight Wanderers the credit
it’s due: it might just be a third of a

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.950
larger whole, but it does its best with the
short period of time it has.
