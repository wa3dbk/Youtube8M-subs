00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Hello, and welcome to the Hohner Harmonica Workshops.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500
Workshop C02: Cleaning

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.500
From time to time it's necessary to clean
your harmonica.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.200
This is both for hygienic reasons and also to
ensure that it continues to function optimally.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.200
In order to perform this job you need the
following tools from the Hohner Service Set:

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.800
The Reed-Lifting Blade, the Screwdriver,
the Cleaning Cloth, the Slide Lubricant,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.500
and it's very helpful to also use the
mouthpiece cleaner which you can order

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.000
separately from the Hohner C-Shop.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.000
Gabi's going to show you how to do this using
a Super-64 Chromonica.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.000
The first step is to unscrew the coverplate
screws.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.400
Through playing you'll find that a residue of
dried skin and dried saliva accumulates on the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.800
inside leading edge of the covers.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.900
It's a good idea to remove this from time to
time and you can do that by spraying the cleaning

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.000
cloth with a little of the mouthpiece cleanser
and then wiping off this deposit.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.500
The next step is to remove the mouthpiece and
slide assembly and as you can see Gabi is

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.000
unscrewing the two screws one at each end of
the mouthpiece

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.400
and when they are completely loosened she
loosens them by hand and then lifts off the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.000
complete mouthpiece and slide assembly.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.000
The Super-64 has a 3-Part slide assembly.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.500
As you can see when taking it apart it's
important to not lose the buffers which fit

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.700
over the screws to stop the slide from knocking
into them.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.700
These are small and rather fiddly.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.300
Should you ever lose a buffer or should you
see that they're worn out which may very

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.300
easily be the case if you've been playing the
instrument for several year then contact your 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.500
local music retailer for replacements or log
onto the Hohner C-Shop.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.000
Now Gabi is going to clean the mouthpiece and
the slide assembly starting with the mouthpiece.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.900
First of all you have to remove the screws of 
course but try not to lose them.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.200
After cleaning the mouthpiece we clean the blank.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.800
The blank actually sits behind the slide against
the body of the instrument.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.200
And after cleaning the blank she then cleans
the slide itself.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.366
When cleaning the slide assembly it's very
important to make sure that you do not bend

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.500
either the slide or the blank and this is the
reason why Gabi was cleaning them against the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.500
table to avoid tensioning the metal.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.900
In order to clean the reedplates it's necessary
to remove them from the body of the instrument.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.500
This requires the posidrive tip of the
screwdriver so Gabi is turning the head

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.500
around in order to be able to unscrew
the reedplate screws.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.400
When removing the reedplates it's very important 
to first of all loosen all of the screws evenly.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.800
Don't just take one out and leave the others in.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.000
Loosen them all and then remove them one after
the other when they've all been loosened

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.200
to the same amount that they come out easily.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.500
Now that all the screws have been loosened,
remove them one after the other.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.500
When all the screws have been removed then
it's possible to lever off the reedplates

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.000
using the fingernail.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.900
The supports which hold the covers up come
off with the reedplate and are quite easy to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
then remove from the plate itself.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Perfect.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.500
When taking the reedplates off, be careful
that the slide-spring does not jump out

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.500
of its mounting because it can be fiddly
to get it back in again.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.300
Now the next step is to clean the groove
of the front edge of the reedplate which

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.200
you do with the cleaning cloth and the
cleaning fluid.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.400
It's only necessary to remove and clean the
reedplates if there really is some kind of

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.400
malfunction of the instrument like for example
a rattle from a loose windsaver or if it

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.516
is not airtight.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.500
If it's working properly then don't
take the reedplates off because it's

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.200
not necessary.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.850
Just as a residue of dried saliva can build
up on the inside of the covers or on the edge

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.000
of the reedplate, it can also develop
on the reeds of the slots themselves.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.500
In order to remove this it's necessary to
plink the reeds with the reed-lifting tool

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.500
and this is what Gabi is doing here.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.400
This is an essential step whenever you work
on reeds, whatever you're doing whether

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.500
you're cleaning them, off-setting them, 
or tuning them, you should regularly

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.900
plink the reed.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You lift the tip with the reed-lifting tool
and let it snap back into the slot.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.400
This has the effect in this instance of
removing any tiny encrustations on the

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.700
side of the slot and make sure that
the reed can vibrate freely.
