00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello and welcome!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.529
This is going to be the first in a
series of videos explaining how to play

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:16.000
ice hockey. We're going to start with the most basic of the basics so if you have no idea how to play hockey, you're in the right place.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.200
The best way to learn a new sport, or any game really, is probably first to understand the court it is played on and some of the basic nomenclature.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.140
The first thing what's look at how a hockey rink is set up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.210
Ice hockey is unique because obviously it is played

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.090
on a surface of ice. There are many
variations that you'll see like roller

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.000
hockey on roller blades or deck hockey where players running.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We'll be looking at ice hockey, although many at the rules will apply regardless that the way you're playing.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200
The first thing you notice about the rink is that it is a mirror image;

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.000
Both sides are exactly the same.
There are a lot of lines and dots and circles, so let's break them down.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.800
First is this red line in the middle,
which is shockingly called 'The Red Line.'

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.400
Admittedly it's not the most creative name the world but you can appreciate its simplicity. (/sarcasm)

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.000
The red line doesn't come into play a ton, so for now all you really have to know is that it is called the Red Line and it is in the middle.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
To get slightly more complex, we have 'The Blue Lines.'
There are two of them.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If you're color blind I apologize for how boring this must be so far, but we'll come back to the blue lines in second.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.200
If you've watched even thirty

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.360
seconds of hockey, you probably understand
that the point is to shoot the puck into

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.540
goal. 'The goals' or 'the nets' are at either end of the rink.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.460
A hockey net is 4-feet high by 6-feet wide.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.400
If you live in the 99% of the world that isn't the United States, that is 1.2 meters high by 1.8 meters wide.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.250
Our final lines that run across the surface of the ice
are the 'Goal Lines.'

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.000
This is the line puck must cross over in order 
to be considered to be in the goal.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.000
But it also extends the entire way
across the rink for a few other reasons that will look at in future videos.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.400
In front of each goal is a half circle
area that is painted blue.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.200
This is called the 'goal crease.' Goalies do
not have to stay in the crease, but they

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.739
will be there most the time.
So the crease kind of exists to designate the goalies' area.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.470
Directly behind the net are two red lines

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.790
that along with the goal line form a trapezoid shape.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.569
My lines are drawn a little crooked, but you get the idea.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.989
This area was only added a few years ago
in an attempt to keep goalies closer to the net.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:51.800
When they're behind the net the goalie can only play the puck--he can only shoot or pass it--when he is between those lines, inside the trapezoid.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.400
The final element the rink is the faceoff spots. In sports like soccer or basketball, when the ball goes out of bounds,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.900
play will begin again with somebody passing the ball back in bounds.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.200
The way that play is restarted in hockey is called a 'faceoff.'

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.280
You will see this happen quite a few times every game.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.190
A player for each team or stand on either side in the face off dot

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.500
and their teammates will stand behind them. 
Then the referee will drop the puck between them.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.650
each player will try to pass the puck
back to one of their teammates

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.900
and then play will continue on from
there. The significance that these nine

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.799
red circles on the ice have when it
comes to faceoffs,

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.319
is the every faceoff will take place at
one of them. The game will start at

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.140
the dot in the center, on the red line, but after that

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.799
a faceoff could happen at any one of them.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.000
And that's really the rink: Red line, blue lines, goal lines, the goals the creases, trapezoids, and the faceoff spots.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.400
These four circles that you see and the "L" lines inside of them are only there to tell players where to stand during faceoffs

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.500
in each zone. They don't have much
to do with what happens during the play.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.540
Speaking of these zones, I did say we'd
come back to the blue line,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.300
and we'll get to everything in more
depth and future videos, but as I mentioned the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.000
goal of hockey is to shoot the puck
into your opponent's net.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.810
The blue lines divide the surface into three areas:

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.000
First, we have to establish that our team is trying to score in the goal on the left side.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Regardless of the direction we are shooting, the area between the blue lines is called the 'Neutral zone.' This beige area here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.500
Because we are going toward the left, we are said to be attacking that zone.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.860
So everything to the left of the left blue line is called the "Attacking zone."

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.100
It might also be called the 'Offensive zone.'

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.280
Our third zone is on the right, which
contains the goal that we're defending,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.780
and so we call this area--the green down
here--the 'Defensive zone.'

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.000
Ideally a team would spend most of their
time with the puck in the attacking zone.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
because 1) the more our team has the puck the better, and 2) the further the puck is from our net, the better.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.150
"Our net" being the one which we are defending.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:15.100
To get an idea of the scale how big is this? In the National Hockey League, or the NHL, which is the highest level play in the world,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.400
the rink is 200-feet long and 85-feet wide.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.200
There a few differences in places other than United States, usually the rank is a little bit bigger.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:36.200
I won't get into the exact sizes, but you can
find a pretty easily on Wikipedia or another web site.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.300
The next element of the rink is the benches, which is where the players sit during the game.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.000
During play each team will have five players plus their goalie on the ice.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.940
These players can change at any time, even while the puck is in play.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.500
So one player will skate over and hop onto the bench,
and another guy will jump off the bench and onto the ice.

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:03.000
This will happen very quickly and it might seem confusing at first when five guys are jumping on and five are jumping off at the same time.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.200
Opposite the benches are smaller benches called the 'Penalty box.'

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.000
Players who commit a foul during the game have to sit in the penalty box for a certain amount of time.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.360
Usually 2 or 5 minutes, depending on how bad the penalty was.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.300
The penalty box is kinda like being put in timeout, only everyone is 6-feet tall, 200 pounds, and has a beard.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.229
While a player is in the penalty box,
his team cannot replace him on the ice.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:35.000
So instead of having five players skating
around they the team will only have four until that penalty is over.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.800
But to get back to the rink, here's a
photo of one in Canada taken from behind one of the nets.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:48.900
You can see the ice and a few of the lines. One thing we haven't noted yet is the boards and the glass around the rink.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:56.700
The fans a hockey game or very close to the rink because they're separated from the players by a piece of Plexiglass.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.860
If you don't know what Plexiglas is...

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:07.400
I think 'Plexiglass' is more the brand name,
but it's basically like a two-inch thick piece of hard clear plastic.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.979
So it's not really glass, it's much harder
to break.

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.400
So here are our fans and they sit behind the
boards, which are about 3.5-feet high.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.490
There is usually a yellow stripe along the
bottom of the boards, so you could see

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.240
where the ice stops and the boards start.
And above the boards are the glass, which

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.660
usually go up to about eight feet tall.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:36.000
And as we saw in that photo above the glass behind the goal there is a netting wraps the whole way almost up to the roof of the arena,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.650
just to keep the puck from flying into the crowd and hitting anyone.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:48.800
So if you did not understand what all the lines and areas in a hockey rink were were before watching this video I hope you get it now.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.860
If not, leave a comment and I'll get back you.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.000
And if you do get it, then we can now
move on to actually learning how to play the game.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.930
I'll see you next time and thanks for watching.
