00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:13.051
In this tutorial, you learn how the movie trailer that precedes every movie on this channel was created.

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:17.834
You will not be using the same assets though but rather starting from scratch.

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:23.044
This will allow you to work on a simpler scene which always makes learning easier.

00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:30.220
In this first movie, you start with the basic scene setup and then move on to work on the details subsequently.

00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:33.216
Start or reset 3ds Max.

00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:40.443
In the Units Setup, make sure the System Units are set to Inches, which is the default.

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:46.558
Set the Display Units to Meters, as it's easier to get a sense of scale that way.

00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:54.884
Ultimately, you will be using Mental Ray to render this project, so you may as well set Mental Ray as a rendering engine from the start.

00:00:55.356 --> 00:01:01.645
This can be done in the Render dialog, which can be accessed from the main toolbar or by pressing F10.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.990
In the Assign Renderer section, set Mental Ray as the Production Renderer.

00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:14.104
If you are a regular on this channel, then you would know that I favor rendering in the 16x9 HDTV format.

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:18.675
Set the rendering resolution to HDTV (video). 

00:01:24.848 --> 00:01:27.093
Close the dialog when done.

00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:32.771
In order to frame the view better, enable Show Safe Frames in the Perspective view.

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.441
This way, you get a better sense of what's being rendered.

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:41.855
You are now ready to create the needed components. You'll start with the water surface.

00:01:42.257 --> 00:01:47.218
It's easy enough to place in the scene, use a simple Plane object in the top view.

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:51.881
Make it 2m x 2m in size, 

00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:59.788
and use the Move tool to relocate it to the center of the world, at [0,0,0]

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.751
Name it "Water Surface". 

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:10.466
If you need to, change its wirecolor.

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:17.112
That's fine for now although you will need to adjust its density later, when you create the animated ripples.

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:21.511
Next, you'll create the path for the animated arrow.

00:02:21.998 --> 00:02:30.872
Note that there are multiple animated arrows in the trailer, and that each apparent arrow is actually made of two arrows traveling together.

00:02:32.434 --> 00:02:38.328
Since you're only learning the concepts here, you'll focus on creating one arrow and one path.

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:47.532
Using the Line tool, create a line in Corner/Corner mode, centered on the water surface, only a tad wider.

00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:55.128
You only require two clicks. To ensure the line is straight, hold Shift down after the first click.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:59.719
Center the line to the world at [0,0,0] 

00:03:03.998 --> 00:03:08.019
and then rename it "Arrow Path".

00:03:12.746 --> 00:03:16.320
Again, change its wirecolor if you need to.

00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:22.672
In the Modify panel, go to Segment mode.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.340
Select the single segment that makes the line. You need to subdivide it in order to create the bounces.

00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:38.007
Lower in the panel, set the Divide value to 11 and then click the Divide button.

00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:42.886
This adds 11 new vertices to the line that are equidistant.

00:03:44.273 --> 00:03:54.963
Go into vertex mode and select all vertices except verts #4, 6, 8 and 10.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:05.400
Move the selected vertices about 0,1m vertically. Keep an eye on the transform type-ins for reference.

00:04:06.056 --> 00:04:11.761
With the upper vertices still selected, right-click and set them to Bezier mode.

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:17.425
Reset their tangents to ensure a nice, flowing upper trajectory.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.696
The lower vertices are set to corner to provide a harder bounce as the arrow hits the water.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.500
Exit sub-object mode when done.

00:04:27.178 --> 00:04:32.872
Adjust the Perspective view to get a better look at the contact points between the path and the water.

00:04:33.337 --> 00:04:36.393
This is where the ripples will eventually take place.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.228
Here, you will be dealing with just one path but keep in mind that the trailer has many.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.110
Also, the paths in the trailer are more irregular and zig-zag a little bit.

00:04:47.797 --> 00:04:52.557
That can be achieved by moving vertices horizontally, not just vertically.

00:04:53.304 --> 00:04:57.505
Again, we'll keep it simple for now and leave the path pointing in one direction.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.103
With the path in place, you next work on the arrow object.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.397
This is what you do in the next movie.
