00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:10.400
Man.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:20.539
It’s Roguelike o’clock again?

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.640
Awright, lay it on me.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.949
Give me more roguelikes, and I’ll continue
to slam face against them.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.300
Today we have Hack, Slash, Loot, a game that…
well, the title says it all.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.460
Guess my work here is done.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.800
I’m hittin’ Taco Bell.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.379
Awright, I’m back.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.790
And they all laughed when I installed the
Chalupa-bot 2000 in the commissary.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.790
Where was I?

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.790
Oh, yeah.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.469
Hack, Slash, Loot is a roguelike where you
do exactly what’s on the tin because they

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.539
really boiled this one down to the basics.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.109
After choosing between the fighter, archer,
or mage characters, you’re dropped into

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.730
one of several stories, either selected by
you or at random, stuck in a tiny room with

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.180
barebones equipment, and given a huge dungeon
to explore.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.530
In other words, the prototypical roguelike.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.299
It doesn’t really try to make any big strides
in the genre, rather, it just works at solidifying

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.950
what roguelikes do best: grid-based, hacky
slashy combat, and obsessive-compulsive item

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.750
collection.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.520
Don’t begin to think that it’ll be easy,
though; roguelikes rarely are.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.399
The halls and rooms of these dungeons are
absolutely lousy with oozes, bats, lizardmen,

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.759
goblins, kobolds, trolls, minotaurs, dark
elves, basically just beat your head against

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.329
a D&amp;D sourcebook for twenty minutes and you’ll
get the picture.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.979
Your recourse is to slash, shoot, or cast
through them (depending on what you feel like

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.969
equipping at the time), then wading through
their mangled carcasses to get to the next

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:51.969
door.

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.560
Along the way you’ll find a bevy of chests
(some of which will probably turn out to be

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.590
mimics, just sayin’), bookshelves, desks,
and other treasure-hoarding spots that hold

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.680
scrolls, potions, or various pieces of gear.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.369
There are a number of stats to juggle as you
gear up: Do you sacrifice a point of defense

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.440
for two of offense?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.340
Is that boost to your magical ability worth
the vulnerability to necrotic damage?

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.290
Silver sword, or non-silver sword?

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.790
In any event, the most important thing to
remember is this: If you get a regeneration

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.400
effect, from a Troll scroll or whatever, you’ve
more or less got the whole game in your hand.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.040
Hack, Slash, Loot’s simple pixel-based design
straddles that comfortable line between “retro”

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.120
and “tricks we’ve learned since retro
was new.”

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.470
It’s not afraid to put on a bit of flair
at times, though the sound effects and music

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.340
stay rather minimal over the course of the
adventure.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.560
The controls are, admittedly, optimized for
the mouse-user, though you can adapt rather

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.000
readily to using the number pad and keyboard
if you prefer.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.590
(And I prefer.)

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.379
It’s instantly accessible, brings just enough
challenge, and always keeps you guessing as

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.900
to exactly what you’ll be up against.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.430
While it might not have a recognizable license
like Pokemon or Final Fantasy or whatnot,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.459
it’s an awesome entry-point into this unforgiving
genre of danger and calculated risk.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.069
The same kind of calculated risk inherent
in ordering a chili cheese fry griller from

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.610
the Taco Bell when you know you’ll be in
public later that day.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.290
Who says video games don’t prepare you for
the real world?
