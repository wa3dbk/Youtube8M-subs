00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.289
lessons

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.280
let's take a minute to get your
strap attached

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.280
and adjusted just right. 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.949
Most guitars have two metal buttons for connecting your strap

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.949
there is usually one at the bottom and one
here at the opposite corner

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.820
not all guitars have the strap buttons in these exact locations

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.670
so you might have to adjust accordingly.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.740
Now, let's attach the strap to the bottom
button. If your strap has this thing you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.259
slide to adjust the length

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.619
you might want to attach the end closest
to that thing to the bottom

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.630
so it doesn't dig into your shoulder
then you just attach the other end to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.360
the other button

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.890
make sure the strap doesn't fold back over
the button

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.079
or get twisted up you want the strap to lay flat. The slits in the strap might be a

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.030
little tight

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.780
so it might be tough to squeeze the
buttons through at first especially if the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.579
straps is new.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.110
now just take a minute to adjust the
strap

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.110
once it's in a good place you are ready to
rock

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.450
To play standing

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.689
you'll want a guitar strap attached. The
strap goes

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.950
over your shoulder around your back and
the guitar just

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.190
rests against your stomach. It might be
tempting to try playing with a guitar

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.400
hanging extremely low or high

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.000
but it can get uncomfortable fast

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.630
you want the guitar somewhere between
chest and stomach level with the neck

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.660
tilted slightly upwards

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.860
you might need to adjust the strap to
get a good angle. Let the strap do the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.350
work

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.930
you don't want to be holding a guitar up while you're trying to play. Now

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.960
let your forearm rest lightly against
the edge to the guitar

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.040
and you're ready to play. Of course
everybody's different

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.090
so that exact position and angle of the guitar will vary from person to person

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.090
If playing feels awkward or hurts you might
wanna stop and adjust

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.050
There's a couple of different ways to
hold your guitar

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.830
while you're sitting down. We'll show you
how it works for a right-handed player

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.180
so if you're playing lefty you need to
reverse it. Let the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.440
indent on the lower side at the guitar
rest on your right leg

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.980
it can lean back against your body you
want to balance the guitar without having

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.400
to support it with your arms

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.430
because they're gonna be busy playing.
Then you just let your forearm rest

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.980
against the edge the guitar

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.670
you can try resting the indent over your
left leg

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.630
with the back end of the guitar resting
against your right leg. You'll need to raise

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.480
your left leg up with the big book or a
small stool

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.880
the same principles apply here keep the
guitar balanced

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.380
so you don't have to muscle around with
your arms and again

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.380
just let your forearm rest against the
edge of your guitar ready to play

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.560
