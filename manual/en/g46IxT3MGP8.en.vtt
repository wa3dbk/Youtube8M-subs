00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:58.263
Got any suggestions?

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.381

- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.

00:01:05.204 --> 00:01:07.204
Kick his balls.

00:01:08.824 --> 00:01:12.593
Yeah, but I don't wanna
destroy future generations
of charitable dogs.

00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:14.595
Don't worry about it.
I got three dobermans.

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:18.399
If I didn't kick them
in the balls regularly,
I'd never get anything done.

But he's gotta be close
to finishing by now.

We're ready for you now.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.844
Okay.

00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:38.503
I feel so used.

00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:42.373
Thanks for your help.
For, at least,
your good intentions.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:46.911
I recognize you.
Oh, did you go
to columbia high?

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.314
No, not from high school.
From tv.

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:52.083
Didn't you play
the retarded quarterback?
Yeah.

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:54.352
Are you
really retarded?

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:57.638
No, I'm not.

00:01:57.706 --> 00:01:59.707
Cool.

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:03.444
Great job, man.
I mean, I thought you
were really retarded.
