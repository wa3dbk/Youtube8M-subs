&gt;&gt;KAT: Fashion usually focuses on looking great for a night out.

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:22.500
But if you’ve got a family it’s just as important that you look great on a day out!

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:27.500
So, we are going to bring you some key tips in dressing your family in style.

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:36.500
I will be showing you how to get these great looks.

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:43.500
So I’m going to start with the basics and I’m going to get Kelly to help me.

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:50.500
Put her in a stripy T-shirt and a floral dress and you notice that the tones work brilliantly together. 

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:58.500
Choose separates like this cardigan for example and they can all work together.

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.500
It’s going to make your life so much easier.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.500
I love the little elbow details on this, giving it a designer edge.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.500
What do you think of that Kelly?

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:10.500
&gt;&gt;KELLY: I like it!

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:14.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: It looks super cool!

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:16.500
I have finished off with some blue woollen leggings.

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:24.500
And these really cute ankle boots which will keep her feet nice and warm in winter.

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:28.500
All in all Kelly, is it a thumbs up?

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.500
Good! Now is it Dad’s turn do you think?

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:33.500
&gt;&gt;KELLY: Yep!

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:50.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: So what we’ve done with Dad is to take a classic day time piece like the Lumberjack shirt that all guys look great in but what I’ve done is to mix it with something a lot more fashionable and a little bit more interesting, the chino. 

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:56.500
I’ve gone for a grey simply because I think it’s a really cool colour but there are loads and loads of colours to choose from.

00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:02.500
I think it gives a very smart finish and what a great alternative to boring old jeans.

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:12.500
I’ve finished off with some suede brogues because smelly trainers aren’t appalling to anybody! It’s time to ditch them. Put them in the bin. It’s all about the brogue.

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:16.500
So now you have a day time look that’s perfect for any occasion.

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.500
Now it’s time to meet the misses.

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:29.500
Fashion needs to be functional when you’re with the kids and it also needs to comfortable. But I know that doesn’t mean you don’t want to be stylish.

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:37.500
I have spoken about polar necks before and they’re going to be big news for autumn/winter and this one is stylish and warm and you’re not going to have to worry about your cleavage.

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:47.500
Now all mums love a legging, but the chicer choice is the Riding Pant. Always make sure they are full length, you don’t want any gaps ladies!

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:53.500
They look a little more stylish and they are just as easy to wear as your lovely leggings.

00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:59.500
Now if you want to smarten it up I suggest a Heritage Blazer.

00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:04.500
Now always look for a blazer with a single button simply because it’s far more figure flattering.

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:09.500
It’s going to draw you in at the waist and create a really beautiful silhouette. 

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:13.500
Now of course, every mum needs a brilliant bag. 

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:27.500
This one’s wicked because it’s going to sit across the body leaving you hands free for the kids but it’s also going to fit in all 
those kiddie essentials you need on a day out.

00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:34.500
We have sorted out all the basics for all the family.

00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:40.500
Now I’m going to show them how to wrap up warm and still look great!

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:46.500
Now quilting has been big news all over the cat walks and even guys can look super cool in it! 

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:52.500
I’m going to go on a similar vein for Kelly.

00:03:54.501 --> 00:04:02.500
As you can see, the navy blue works really well with the dress and the stripy T-shirt. It brings the whole together, creating that capsule wardrobe.

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:06.500
It’s like weight and it’s practical so it’s going to be great for her playing in.

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:13.500
Capes have made a massive comeback this season, there going to be perfect for our mum.

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:23.500
Now the brilliant thing about this cape is that it’s really light weight and it fits snuggly in your handbag so you can whip it out when it gets a little bit colder.

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:25.500
Also there are two ways to wear it.

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:31.500
The first is as a scarf. Really easy to wear and it looks simply stylish.

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:41.500
Alternatively you can wear it as the cape style. This is going to look really smart, it’s going to add chic edge to your day time look.

00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:49.500
I love it like this because it looks really sophisticated and has that lovely heritage winter feel to it.

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:56.500
So I hope you can see just how easy it is to pull together a great family look for any autumn day out.

00:04:57.501 --> 00:05:01.500
