00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.740
All right, the last step for the marguerite
pizza--it's got a really fancy name, but really

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.860
it's not a very fancy pizza at all. This was
our homemade sauce, and this is sort of the

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:24.730
charm of this pizza, is how rustic the tomato
sauce comes out. We let it reduce for those

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:35.530
ten to fifteen minutes. We don't want it too,
too thick; otherwise the dough will just be

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:44.289
far too wet and saturated. This will give
you a nicer texture than just that store-bought

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:55.639
tomato sauce, which is all even, evenly pureed.
This will give you real chunks of tomato.

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:04.200
Okay that should be about right--still got
some leftover there. And of course, lots of

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:20.570
mozzarella cheese, grated that freshly. You
can leave as much or as little crust room

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:33.570
as you like. I'm going to put lots of cheese
on that. And, to finish this pizza, get it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.370
right into the corners there, that's probably
a good amount of cheese. And then what makes

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:49.299
this look like it came right out of the restaurant
is if you pick out the most beautiful basil

00:01:49.299 --> 00:02:01.079
leaves to decorate it with. See we've got
a beautiful leaf right there... decorate it

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:17.740
just like that. Maybe we'll angle that one
just so. Maybe just two more. And this is

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.080
ready to take to the oven.
