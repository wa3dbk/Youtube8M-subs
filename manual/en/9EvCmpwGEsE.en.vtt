00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.460
G'day everyone.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.870
My name is Daniel O'Grady and welcome to another
Wasabicars video.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.080
I hope you are all doing well.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.361
The channel, for those of you who are coming
across this for the first time, car-spotting

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:21.361
in Japan.

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:24.050
And, today I'll be doing neither of those
two things.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.240
Oh, no.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.610
I will be car-spotting.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.739
I'll be car-spotting in Australia.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.369
Oh, man.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.920
Car-spotting in Australia because when I was
in Australia I saw plenty of Mopars.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.530
Well, American Chryslers and Australian Chryslers.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.940
A bunch of them.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.100
I think all were pretty impressive.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.530
That's what I want to talk about today.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.699
Straight up front I want to say, on this channel,
and regulars will of course know, mostly Japanese

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:50.699
stuff.

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.420
But, it's car-spotting; could be anything.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.179
I spend a lot of time defending Japanese cars
from people who aren't fans.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.239
I do preach car love here.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.000
It would be ironic and sad if the people who
like Japanese cars complained about the muscle

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.280
cars or the American cars.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
That would be very sad.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.280
So, hey.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.090
If you don't want to watch it, don't watch
it.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.280
I do hope you enjoy what's coming anyway.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.549
So, are we good?

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.549
Okay.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.320
The first event that I want to talk about
is a hot-rod show that I went to.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.250
There were a few cars in the show, but also
just surrounding the show there were some

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.270
great ones.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.560
The first one is this 1971 RT Challenger.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.010
On the hood it says 440 Magnum.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.590
And the condition is breath-taking.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.880
Really, really nice car.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.460
And, that colour.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.000
Is that colour Plum-crazy?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.550
I know Mopar colour are famous.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.340
But, Plum-crazy, I think that's it.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.740
And then, when I entered the gates, the next
Mopar I saw was a Charger.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.810
1968, Black.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.170
Super neat, super clean.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.240
Blue stripes on the back.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.170
I didn't head around the back of the car,
I should've.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.700
I wanted to see the rear, the tail-lights.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.680
I love the look of the '68 tail-lights, but
that's all I got, guys.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.840
Just those photos.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.830
Next, was a couple of Aussie cars.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.360
Two yellow hardtops.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.120
The VF, you can see that front.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.320
The VF, the grille sticks out.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.620
And then there was the VG, which has a flatter
front, rectangular headlights.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.730
Also at this show was another one.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.510
Based on the VG Valiant, was this.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.720
I think it's not a Valiant.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.730
Technically it's a Chrysler.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.440
But, it's a VIP.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.340
Slightly longer wheelbase.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.440
Luxury edition.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.980
At the show, that was it.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.110
But, that was not the least of things.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.920
As I was spending some time exploring old
neighbourhoods that I used to visit, I saw

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.590
a Charger on the back of a trailer.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.590
Charger?

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.590
Challenger!

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.590
Challenger on the back.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.080
Looks like we got ourselves a hangin' Pa.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.780
Saw a Challenger on the back of a trailer.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.990
The number-plate said Hemi.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.010
The badge on the hood says 426 Hemi.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.510
Numbers matching?

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.900
I doubt it, but who even cares?

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.450
The guy, he was taking it somewhere.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.870
And, I interrupted what he was doing.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.590
I said, G'Day, mate, I live in Japan.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.590
What's up?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.590
What's the deal?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.120
He said, mate, I've got to move all my cars
because the land is being reclaimed by the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120
government.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.260
They're taking it, I've got to move everything
within 30 days or they will scrap everything.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.040
That's the story, right?

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.120
There's a video of this, and it's really hard
to hear what's going on because it was so

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120
rushed.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.261
I couldn't catch it.

00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:59.810
I was just...

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.870
Anyway, let's go through this.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.290
Inside the garage there were 1 2 3 4 5 6 cars.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.200
Down the bottom, there was the brown R/T Hemi,
1968 Hemi.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.380
Behind that/in front of that/in the corner,
whatever the hell, a black Charger Drag-spec.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.210
He said it had a top-fuel engine, and you
can see there's some R/T bits on it at least.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.810
Up in the roof, plenty of gold up here.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.689
I couldn't catch everything but I believe
this is what he said of them.

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.960
There's an R/T. An R/T Hemi.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.740
And, out the back was a '72 Challenger, so
that's what this guy's got hanging around

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.740
in his roof.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.479
Amazing, wouldn't you say?

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.510
I think so.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.790
Okay, guys.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.810
I think I'm done.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.639
Question of the day.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.199
It's not for everyone, but if you do have
a favourite muscle car what would it be?

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.600
My definition of muscle-car it doesn't matter
which country it comes from, but most likely

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.949
it's an American muscle-car.

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.150
I think my all-time favourite muscle car..

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.830
I love the HQ, the HQ Holden.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.659
It's a Kingswood, it's a two-door, 350 Chev.

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:24.189
It's not going to wipe the floor with a Hemi
anytime soon, but I just love it, love it

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.270
for what it is.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.270
Nice and simple.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.240
350 chev in a HQ Holden, in a GTS; love it.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.240
Okay, guys?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.750
So, let me know your favourite muscle-car.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.050
I don't care which nationality.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.050
Just let me know, okay?

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.050
Thank you very much everyone.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.050
Take it easy.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.052
See you.
