00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.110
Satisfaction by THE ROLLING STONES !!!

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.600
Great tune, based only on three chords, E7 , A7 and B7

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.400
The intro is played by the bass guitar and the lead guitar

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.940
This is the lead guitar part

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.880
Because the riffs I show you in this course are for acoustic solo guitarist, mostly for those who want to accomapany a singer or play solo, 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.640
...it's good to play 2 parts simultaneously 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.820
and to play the bass part at the same time

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.940
If I accompanied this tune and played only this part.....

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.540
That wouldn't be good and sound very limited

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.260
So I add a few notes from the bass part....

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.800
The bass plays this......

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.580
I don't need to add all those notes although I can :)

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.840
For stressing the chord change from E7 to A7, I only need an E and A in bass.

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:01.115
So I add them

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:06.041
oops :)

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:16.020
Again the guitar part only......

00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:22.154
And with the bass notes

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.980
I add the A note on the E string on the 5th fret, I can't play the open A as I already play the lead guitar melody on the A string

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.440
Now it sounds like two guitarists playing at the same time

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.480
The chorus starts

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.360
E or E7 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.200
Here's a little movement on the way to A7

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:54.000
Another little movement, this time on the way back to E7 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.600
You probably noticed that I throw another chord over the A major chord, it's a very common move 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:12.080
its A major and then D major with the A in bass

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:48.400
B7 and another little melody over the chord

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.320
The whole thing slowly..............

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.400
Good luck!
