00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.660
The brilliant light was blinding, but Zechariah
suddenly realised that the light was coming

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.330
from the figure standing with him at the altar.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.470
After a moment, he took a chance and looked
through the fingers of his hand.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.199
A being towered above him, shimmering at the
side of the altar.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.400
Zechariah staggered backwards, terrified by
this awesome presence.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.690
‘Don’t be afraid, Zechariah!’

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.940
The voice was overpowering, it invaded his
mind and reverberated through his whole body.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.190
He shrank back, trying to get away from the
noise.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.659
‘God has heard your prayers.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.330
Your wife will have a son and you will call
him John.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.730
He will be a great servant of the Lord and
the power of the Holy Spirit will be with

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.910
him from his birth.’

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.520
Zechariah looked up at the shining figure.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.850
‘An angel,’ he thought, as he dropped
to his knees.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.860
‘This is an angel of the Lord.’

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.890
‘John will lead many people back to the
Lord, with the same power and spirit as Elijah.’

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.820
Zechariah thought of his wife back home, so
sad about being childless, but too old to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.110
have a child.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.570
‘But how can this be?’ he asked the angel.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.490
‘We’re too old to have children.’

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.260
‘I am Gabriel!’ thundered the angel.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.780
‘I was sent to tell you good news, and you
have not believed me.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.200
So you will not be able to speak until these
things have happened.’

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.620
Light shot around the altar and Gabriel shimmered
out of sight.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.520
Zechariah sat on the floor of the Temple.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.710
He was unable to move.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.189
He opened his mouth to call for help, but
no words came out.
