00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.230
Hello guys, and today I'm going to talk to
you about the quest markers and log entry

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.200
bug that's found when creating mods.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.430
If by some chance you're unfamiliar with this,
what it is is.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:21.980
You- well after finishing speaking to an NPC
Your quest starts up.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.980
The Objectives show.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.730
But when you go into the quests tab.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.130
You'll notice that the... [clears throat]
sorry the log entries don't show up and the

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.590
quest markers do not work.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.850
The issue cause-
shut up!

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.969
The issue caused by this is well.. the game
for whatever reason why just can't update

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.989
certain things.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.350
It can't update log entries and it can't update
the aliases.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:02.390
So if I enter, SQV and than my quest ID GSQ01
into the cons-console command.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.130
You'll notice that the aliases have not been
filled.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.149
And because the aliases have not been filled
the quest markers don't work.

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.590
And to get around this.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:27.070
All you need to do is to load up a clean save.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:46.170
So-an- that's exactly what I'm going to do
here.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:57.200
My game always loads slower when I have FRAPS
running I hate it!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:10.739
So now, we are going into Bendu's house.

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.810
Just breaking in.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.390
See him sitting there.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.700
We're going to talk to him again.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.909
Quest starts, Objectives show and what do
you know, the log entries show up.

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:40.650
If I toggle that as active even the quest
markers work.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.340
And you'll notice that this time when I enter
SQV into the console command all of the aliases

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.120
have been filled.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.310
And here's a neat trick if you just want to
see, want to make sure that the uh- the log

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.370
entries look the way you want all you'll do
is that you will enter setstage the quest

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.810
ID and the stage you want into the console
command so I'm going to do 20.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.560
And you'll hear see hear, that the log entries
work.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.959
We're going to do that again except I'm going
to hit 30.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.049
We return to Bendu.

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.049
Now I'm going to kill Bendu.

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.370
And yeah I'm going to do it again one more
time for stage 40.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.050
And there you go you just completed a quest
just by using the console command.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.280
So anyway yeah, that's probably need to do
to fix it.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.959
Have a beautiful life guys.
