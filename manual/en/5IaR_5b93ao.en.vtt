00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.840
HOW TO GET THE BEST OUT OF THE DRIVING RATIO?

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.320
I'm Michael Christensen, I'm a Porsche race driver

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.060
How I started was seeing the first race

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.570
of my life in Le Man 1999 and in 2000 I started karting just for fun

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.850
This year I will drive 24 hours of Le Mans
with Porsche Team Manthey

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.420
When you have the Porsche ignition key in
your left hand

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.220
you know it's going to be a good day!

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.480
Do you hear that sound? Really nice!

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.280
That is what Porsche is like!

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.200
Like the Avis Driving Ratio for me the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.040
perfect road has the right combination of straights and tight bends, faster corners, slower corners

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.080
It has to be predictable and somehow a little bit unpredictable

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.580
The science behind the Avis Driving Ratio
is very interesting and I 'm looking forward

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.060
to test it here in the Black Forest

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.480
To do the perfect start you have to press the "Sport plus" button

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.040
You have to press the brake and you have to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.410
go flat out on throttle and then you release the brake

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.140
Do you feel that acceleration? It's really
good! Perfect gear shift!

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.780
To perform the perfect acceleration you have to steer absolutely straight and you have

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.260
to shift at the right time to use the maximum power that you have got from the car

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.480
One thing about the flat-6 boxer engine is
that it has a unique sound and you will always

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.409
recognise a Porsche when the flat-6 engine passes you

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.060
To do the perfect corner you find the brake point, the brake pressure, you steer in and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.280
you look to get your apex in the middle of
the corner

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.360
Then when you are there you try to find the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.720
acceleration point and you go on the power to the exit

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.680
The Avis Driving Ratio of 10:1 is perfect

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.529
for me because it allows me to have a look around

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.580
enjoying the braking into the curves, accelerating out again

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.800
It's a good combination of relaxing and enjoying the car and the curves
