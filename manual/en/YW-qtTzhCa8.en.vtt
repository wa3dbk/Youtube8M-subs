00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.780
The screen flashes and we can hear a ticking noise

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.340
many of the older Plasma TVs have these failing IPMs

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.100
This here is the y-sustain  board 6870QYC004D

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.074
check the voltages indicated on the panel sticker

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:33.595
measure them here on these fuses

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.240
They are ok

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.520
we remove the YPPD-J016E (near the brownish area on the PCB)

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.180
removing them takes some patience

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:53.334
Q4 has a hole in the die

00:00:55.517 --> 00:00:57.917
we replace Q4 and Q2

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.500
first remove the silicon protection

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.240
use a sharp knife (not the kitchen knife like I did)

00:01:07.213 --> 00:01:11.193
remove the bonding wires too

00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:17.476
and then scratch the die from the trace

00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:22.822
be careful not to short aluminum substrate with the trace

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.620
it's done

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.440
we check all the power diodes

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.180
checking the gate driver is not necessary, I'm assuming they are ok

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880
that's the IGBT we use

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.340
get them from ebay, Aliexpress or other electronics distributors

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.040
the whole board needs to be heated to about 170C otherwise it would be very difficult to solder parts onto them

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.300
solder pads are cleaned and tinned and IGBTs are soldered onto them

00:02:25.816 --> 00:02:27.276
it's done

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.698
replace these two caps too, they are on the gate driver power supply side

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:40.316
apply a layer of thermal compound between the IPM and the heatsink and reassemble

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:46.348
a test to see if it's ok.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.720
It's working. Spent $4 on this repair and luckily there is nothing else broken.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.260
thanks for watching
