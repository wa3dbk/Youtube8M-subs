Girl guy pig- go

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.360
There once was a holy war that pitted holy nights against these weird demon looking things

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.960
then the Kingdom was like

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.900
Oh, no, we need help

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.700
so they created the seven deadly sins with me as the leader.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.000
kid: why are you telling me this

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.060

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.600

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.280

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.360

What are you doing Here?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.300
Well after all the seven deadly sins went their ways

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.060
I went looking for you, but I wasn't able to find you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.190
but luckily I was told by a little boy that if I waited at the end of the fog

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.820
Il be able to meet you again.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.520

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.040

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.940

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.360
i think it's around 5

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.080
that makes it...

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.580
ten years.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.880
And it's gonna take another ten to get rid o' ya

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.380

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.640

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.540

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.500
This is probably the worst day of my life so far

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.220
But it'll all be worth it when I get my pot of gold.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.980
What are you talking about, sweetie? There's no pot of gold

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.520
you and your cute, delusional fantasies.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.680
Hawk (os): oh, you're one to talk

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.880

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.160
there's no pot a gold

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360
nope

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.860
Well, we found one of the seven deadly sins

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.040
and she's a giant.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.640
A gaint pain in my arse

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.260
if there is a god..

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.920

oh my God a leprechaun.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.620
So that little orphan boy was right .

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.360
if I went to the end of the forest I'd be able to find a gullible

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.660
Leprechaun with a pot of gold.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.040
I'm not a leprechaun, you daft basterd

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.260

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.680
You still have the voice of an angel.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.760
