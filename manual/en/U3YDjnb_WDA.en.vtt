00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.190
So in the bottling process this is where we
add all our fruits and flavors and as you

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.179
can see we have fresh ginger, fresh blueberries
are in season, fresh strawberries are chopped

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.690
up, we got lime and this is part of the peel
with a little pick as possible, there is dried

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.650
cranberries. We also have organic jams and
jellies which are great for flavors especially

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.640
in the winter when fresh fruit isn't available
and this here is elder flower which I like

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.820
to do is elder flower tea particularly in
the winter as elder flower is a common remedy

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.560
for upper repertory so I'll make a cold press
tea while I'll put some of this in a tea ball

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.770
at let it sit for 20 minutes and once that's
done I'll put a portion of that mixture into

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.190
Kombucha in the bottle and then I'll add the
Kombucha on top, that way I'm not only getting

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.730
the benefits of the Kombucha but also of the
elder flower. Which is great in winter. So

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.520
here are our bottles I just collect what ever
bottles happen to be around the house, this

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.850
one here is a wine bottle and different things,
and now we will make flavors. What flavors

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:17.119
sounds good, (it's not quit boiling) so alright
what flavors do we like? How about strawberry,

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.970
ginger, okay ginger, strawberry so generally
you want to do about a little layer of fruit

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:35.130
on the bottom just kind of eye ball it. Push
that in there, mush it on in now Kombucha

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.200
is a probyotic which like yogurt means that
it puts the healthy and friendly bacteria

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.670
back into your system unlike an antibiotic
which kills everything this merely tries to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.220
bring your body back into balance naturally.
And these flavors, flavors aren't' necessary

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.229
I just find that there fun and delicious and
creative, I'm always looking for different

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.240
things that I can make flavors out of so there.
Once we add our fruit handy dandy funnel and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.259
yes it's made out of plastic but it's momentary,
here we go I'm going to pour it in and I'm

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.700
and I'm going to pour it in I'm going to want
to leave a little space on top because it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.491
is naturally carbonated. It is going to need
some room to breath as it will continue to

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.840
fermenting once it's in the bottle. Here we
go, a little more, there we go that looks

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:34.640
good and now we're on to the next bottle.
Here's the lid, now these while you can consume

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.690
them immediately the flavors will taste better
once they had a day or 2 or even up to a week

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.180
to set. You can also put these in the refrigerator
again the fermenting process will slow down

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.480
once it's in the refrigerator but it will
continue.
