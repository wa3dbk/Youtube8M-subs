00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
The Rokkō Mountains,
tinged with a crimson hue

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.840
The breathtaking autumnal colors
enchant many people every year.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.850
The mountains’ granitic layer
produces natural riverbed water.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.030
These bountiful springs then
flow into the neighborhoods of Kobe.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.900
The famous Miyamizu mineral water
flows down to Nadagogō,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.900
Japan's best sake brewery,
where it is made into pure Nada sake.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.220
At Nadagogō, many sake breweries still compete with
their traditional skills to make rich-tasting,
genuine sake to this day.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
We paid a visit to a museum
where one can learn how to make sake.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.430
After cleansing, the rice is steamed at 100 degrees.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.400
This process is called mushi-mai.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.750
Like Miyamizu, Yamadanishiki rice is
essential to make quality sake.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.120
This huge "cannon" barrel is
used to transport Miyamizu.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.000
Steamed rice is then allowed to
cool at room temperature.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.070
Fine craftsmanship is apparent in each process.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.570
Kōji rice malt is produced in a hot,
humid room called a muro.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.780
Kōji is produced painstakingly
all through the day and night.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.090
Steamed rice and kōji are then stirred
together with a paddle stick.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.870
Brewery workers sing to the time
and prepare moromi unrefined sake.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.780
Several processes later,
the sake is stored and put into casks.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.190
Boisterous yet delicate,
sake brewing is compared to a real sword fight.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.300
Sake can also be tasted at the museum.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.460
Sake enthusiasts are sure to be thrilled.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:36.140
Nada sake contains two things: nature’s blessings
and time-honored techniques passed down by
brewery workers under the tōji chief brewer.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.900
One cannot help but enjoy the sake
down to the last drop.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.320
The port of Kobe is truly beautiful at night.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.800
Tonight is a night to enjoy everything
that makes Kobe special.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.900
Savoring real food in the most comfortable
and hospitable space.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.000
Daiginjō sake with no added alcohol
from Nada and exquisite Kobe beef.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.900
Ours is a restaurant under the concept of
"produce locally, consume locally,"
and we promote food made in Hyogo Prefecture.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:36.900
We serve Kobe beef in three different ways:
grilled (steak), steamed in a basket (seiro-mushi),
and boiled (shabushabu).

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.100
All courses use our specialties produced here in Hyogo,
including rice, vegetables, fruits, and tea.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.850
We hope you will enjoy Kobe beef with
varieties of Nada sake, the pride of Japan.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.700
Well-acquainted with Kobe beef,
top chefs prepare steaks skillfully.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.900
Perfectly cooked Kobe beefsteaks
impress gourmets everywhere.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.900
Garnished with locally grown fresh vegetables,
the dish is complete.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.060
No words are necessary.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.960
One can simply indulge in Kobe's finest cuisine.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.970
With a rich environment,
Kobe is a fashionable cosmopolitan city.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.970
Here is yet another proud
offering from this fine region.
