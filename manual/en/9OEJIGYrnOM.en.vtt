00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:23.650
Don’t freak out, guys.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.609
It’s been 30 years now since E.T. nearly
destroyed the entire industry.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.609
Alright?

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.320
Times change, wounds heal and Atari didn’t
make this one.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.269
That’s reason enough to give E.T. a shot
at redemption.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.859
Plus, it’s the anniversary of the movie...available
now on Blu-ray.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.469
Hurry up and buy one!

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.539
Before they get buried in a landfill.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:53.190
It’s E.T.: The Green Planet for the iPhone.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.899
I won’t mince words here.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.709
I hated the original Atari game more than
almost any other game ever, but I love the

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:01.769
movie and the characters.

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:08.229
So...I’m anxious to play it, but I’m reflexively
cautious about any game with tiny brown aliens

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.229
and Elliot.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.310
And then I start playing, and I’m like,
“Hey, it’s pretty, it has an original

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.549
premise...it’s early, but I think I’m
digging this thing.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.990
You should’ve done this 30 years ago, E.T.”

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.710
And then he’s like, “E.T. phone your credit
card.”

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.409
Wait, what?

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.290
So The Green Planet picks up in the moments
right after the movie.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.200
E.T. lands on his home planet, having just
left Elliot, to discover that Earth wasn’t

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200
such a bad place.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.240
His own planet is suffering some kind of environmental
catastrophe.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:52.409
And it’s a good thing he’s finally back,
because only his healing touch can save them.

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.479
So it’s a little cartoony...uh, especially
the elder E.T. at the bottom.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.829
But it’s kinda cute and it does work.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.430
I really like the concept.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.670
It’s sort of like a Farmville thing where
you’re planting these alien flowers and...whatever

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.039
the hell those things are.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.170
And you can even go visit your friends’
gardens—online, a little friend code, good

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.170
stuff.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.739
It’s just that...the exchange rate from
Earth to the Green Planet must be insane,

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.940
because alien gardens are f*cking expensive.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.920
Let’s be clear.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.940
This is a free game, but it’s not.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.011
And if you’re going to have enough nutrients
to plant plants, you’re eventually going

00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.011
to have to buy them.

00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:34.989
In fact, you’re eventually going to have
to buy everything.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.520
I sank almost ten dollars into this game,
buying various resources to grow and buy new

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.670
seeds, and it lasted about an hour before
I hit that wall again.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.860
Oops, you’re out of healing touches.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.980
Either wait three days for nature to take
its course...or, uh, buy another five dollar

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.980
pack.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.379
F*cking interplanetary capitalists.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.290
E.T. has come a long way since the infamous
disaster of 1982.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.731
Atari would have you believe it was a weather
balloon, but I know better.

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:05.700
I know it was more than that.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.260
This game is more than that, too...but it’s
also dollars and dollars more.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.780
And dollars.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.040
Elliot.
