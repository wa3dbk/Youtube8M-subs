00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
Several weeks have passed since the beginning of the fall semester.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:18.100
 I want to give you a brief update on San Diego State's budget situation and what, “through a glass, darkly,” we see ahead.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:28.400
Even after a 40 percent increase in fees San Diego State has lost $47m in two years. 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.500
These are base-budget, long-term cuts to which no one-time fix can be adequate. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.400
Consequently, we have tried to make base budget reductions in response.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.100
Most painfully, we have reduced the number of employees (principally through attrition and non-renewal)

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.700
and are in the process of reducing our enrollment.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.900
Where is California headed from here? Current signs are not good:

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.700
California's unemployment rate rose to 12.2 percent in August;

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.700
State receipts continue their downward trend;

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.310
The California Department of Finance estimates that California will start its next fiscal year with

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.210
a deficit of $7 billion, absent corrective actions.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.410
What can we do to minimize the damage?

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:32.010
We are marshalling our reserves and our furlough savings against the possibility of a mid-year correction.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:42.510
And, of course, given the trends I mentioned earlier, the prospects for next year's regular budget cycle are worrisome at best. 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.710
Consequently, we are being very cautious.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.410
Among the most difficult, but necessary, decisions we've had to make is to reduce our enrollment. 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:03.110
With this year's reductions and those to come, SDSU will have 4,600 fewer students by next fall.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.910
For many years, we've been forced to turn away CSU eligible applicants from outside our service area, 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.710
now local-area students are affected as well.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.120
All prospective students will apply to pre-majors (or undeclared)

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.320
and will compete for the number of slots in that pre-major based on their CSU eligibility index.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.220
We will continue to honor the Sweetwater Compact and the City Heights Collaborative Hoover High School agreements.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.720
And we will give extra eligibility index points to students from our service area

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.220
 as part of our continued commitment to local access.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.220
It is too soon to know what our cutoff point will be

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.420
(in effect, it is a function of qualified applications versus available spots),

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.320
or the number of points that local students will receive,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.020
but our goal will be to maintain our ten year averages for diversity

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.820
and for local vs. out-of-region first-time freshmen.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.630
For more information on these new admissions policies,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.730
I encourage you to visit sdsu.edu/enrollmentinfo (one word).

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.330
As SDSU manages its increasingly limited resources our challenges include:

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.230
Maintaining as much accessibility and academic excellence as possible;

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.030
Preserving our diversity;

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.130
And, continuing to improve our graduation rate

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.230
which is now above the national average and among the best for urban public universities.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.330
Faced with these Draconian budget cuts

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:03.330
we are struggling to preserve these advances and to maintain the forward momentum that we have achieved.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:14.430
Thank you for your hard work and many sacrifices in support of San Diego State and the future of California.
