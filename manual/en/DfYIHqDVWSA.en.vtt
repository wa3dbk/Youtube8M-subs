00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.430
Lindsey Barnes, MBA 2011: "Leadership Labs
is a transformational experience. One of my

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.250
issues that I've faced before I came here
was being conflict averse. When it came to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.209
talking to someone about their performance
or just an overall difficult conversation,

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.821
I didn't know where to start. Then I learned
about the leadership labs program here at

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.960
the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.619
The leadership program is a program that places
you with seven other MBA 1s, and you simulate

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.680
real life executive environments: layoffs,
hiring, firing...it's different from sitting

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.500
in a classroom and learning about how to talk
through these conversations. It's about actually

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.120
practicing it so when you face it in real
life, it's not a surprise. Some of my best

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.860
friends have come from that groupâ€¦that environment
where we've been pushed to challenge ourselves

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.820
time and time again.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.260
So the Leadership Labs culminates... into
not your typical final exam. It's called the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.829
Executive Challenge where the School flies
back hundreds of its top alumni. CEOs, partners,

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.251
managing directors from all these firms across
the globe, and these executives challenge

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:19.950
you with real life cases. I actually won the
case, and now I'm a leadership fellow! I'll

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.249
be a second year MBA who steps in and trains
first year MBAs on those exact same skills

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:34.109
that I was looking for prior to coming to
the Stanford GSB.

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.939
Naturally with a Stanford MBA you're going
to be placed in situations where you're expected

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.770
to lead. I, for instance, want to work in
general management with large corporations.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.840
And I know that there's a stereotype for what
a CEO or for what an executive looks like...and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.009
I don't naturally fall in that category. I'm
a female. I'm African-American. I'm short,

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.159
(laughs). But with these leadership skills
there's going to be no doubt that I'm fit

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.939
to lead these organizations."
