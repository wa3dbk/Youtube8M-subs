00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.470
We're going to take our knowledge now, and
pick up the pace a little bit. I like to say

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.929
everything we've learned as we stood still
and moved to the walk, will work at the jog

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.599
and the lope. We know that our legs control
everything behind the girth, and our hands

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.700
everything in front of the girth. We have
learned about our direct and indirect rein,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.650
and balancing our horse. However, when we
go to jog and lope, a lot of new riders find

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.980
that this becomes much more difficult. Our
rider right now is going to jog her horse,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.450
asking for that bend through the body using
our inside leg and a little bit of a direct

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.450
rein as he jogs a nice circle. We're going
to try to keep his hind quarters in line as

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.310
he creates that C shape, or the arc, and we're
going to dry to give the horse the benefit

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.649
of as little pressure as possible. So, we
may start out with just the most gradual,

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.649
easy kind of circle, and then increase the
balance and the bend by asking for more in

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.600
the way of pressure off our leg and our hand.
Everything we do at the walk will work at

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.609
the jog, and we want to keep that horse forward
moving nicely into their bridle. Now we'll

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:15.329
ask the horse to go to the lope, looking first
for the correct lead, and then beginning to

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.009
package this up so that we get a horse that
is going to keep and maintain the bend of

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.709
the circle as they lope along on their correct
lead. Our rider needs to, will work on trying

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:31.639
to keep the most quiet, forward movement at
the lope as we bend, and ask this horse to

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:37.420
remain balanced. This horse and rider team
have a little ways to go yet, till we create

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.799
that nice, organized package, but we can see
the beginning as this horse starts to figure

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.109
out that it's a better position if they use
their bodies in that balanced fashion. We

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:54.060
can look at how the right hind leg is stepping
underneath him. We can see the flection through

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.279
his neck and his body, and that's going to
bring this horse to be more balanced as we

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.179
finish up with our loping exercise.
