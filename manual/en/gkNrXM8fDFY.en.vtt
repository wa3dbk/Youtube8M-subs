00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.030
This game about the zombie apocalypse is literally
called Zombie Apocalypse.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.789
If a Google search of a game's title returns
anything but the game you're searching for,

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.630
there's a problem with that title.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:40.170
This is...Zombie Apocalypse.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.250
Much like its title, Zombie Apocalypse's gameplay
and presentation seep into the generic realm;

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.860
in this case, a place populated by other top-down
arena shooters like Robotron 2084 and Smash

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.860
TV that aren't, well...Robotron 2084 or Smash
TV.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.239
If you went even deeper, you would find that
Zombie Apocalypse isn't even a unique, zombified

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.019
take on the genre, as there have been plenty
of other, similar games before and since.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.630
All that being said...it is kinda fun, but
whether or not it's worth it is totally dependent

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.930
on how tired you are of generic zombie games.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.630
Like those arcade greats, Zombie Apocalypse
takes a, well, arcade approach to zombie-killing

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.630
action.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.920
Waves after waves of the undead are mowed
down through 55 days and seven areas, items

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.909
are temporary and pop up randomly, and there's
a big emphasis on high scores.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.491
There's not much depth here; no upgrade system,
a very loose story, and unremarkable graphics.

00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:40.640
That being said, the zombie designs are relatively
creative.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.030
Grandma zombies that throw knives and pregnant
zombie mothers that birth flying insect creatures

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.550
stand out the most, but Zombie Apocalypse
does a good job of introducing new types of

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.310
zombies as the game progresses...to about
the halfway point.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.409
After that, the game gets to be what I like
to call "I just want to finish and/or quit

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.110
this game" repetitive.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.110
Throw in the ridiculous one-liners and sounds
the characters throw out every single level,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:11.090
and playing too much Zombie Apocalypse at
one time gets to be painful.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.600
It may not seem like I liked Zombie Apocalypse,
and on a fairly objective level, I guess that's

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600
right.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.040
But as I said, it is kind of fun in the moment
and in short bursts.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.660
The arcade action is a fun way to step away
from more story and gameplay-intensive games,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.280
and spin around in circles with a flamethrower.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.930
Determining the worth of a new pick-up, such
as a shotgun, and whether it's worth trading

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.250
out your current weapon, such as a flamethrower,
is about as deep as the game gets, and that's

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.750
alright for a time.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.000
And once you figure out that you can actually
shake off most zombies that attach to your

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.489
one-hit character, with a few exceptions,
the game gets to be a much more enjoyable

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.060
level of difficult.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.751
Even then, some deaths will feel cheap and
frustrate to no end, especially when you had

00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:54.599
a good score multiplier going.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.110
Ultimately, Zombie Apocalypse is decent.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.349
There's not much personality to the game,
try as the kung-fu antics of one of the characters

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.930
might.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.120
Some of the zombie designs are creative, even
if every boss fight is against the same boss.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.900
And the gameplay itself is unremarkable if
not somewhat fun.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.770
Personally, I think that this one can be skipped
if you're incredibly tired of the undead tropes.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.810
But if you're in the mood for even more zombie
killing action, Zombie Apocalyse is a decent

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.810
experience, and I would think an even greater
one in co-op.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.120
Because we all know that murder is more fun
in groups.
