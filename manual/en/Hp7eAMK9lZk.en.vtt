00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.820
This ladder snake relentlessly pursues its prey, 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.720
against which it will launch a ferocious and fatal attack.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.920
&nbsp;Thanks to olfactory sensors in its tongue, 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.800
it detects a mouse trail that will lead it to its burrow.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.600
Once the entrance has been located, 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.760
it simply needs to be attentive: 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.260
dinner could be hiding anywhere.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.700
After the fatal blow,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.580
 this constrictor snake immobilizes and crushes its victim, 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.140
until its heart stops.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.220
The reptile then swallows its prey whole:

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.540
 it will take at least a week for it to be completely digested.
