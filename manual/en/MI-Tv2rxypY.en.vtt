Hi, this is Joelle Meijer.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.420
I will show you how to make a little apple
with egg cartons.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.210
It's September and it's time for the apple
harvest.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.110
Making a little apple is a good way to integrate
an art project

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.439
with a lesson about the seasons.

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.180
We will make the apple with a recycled egg
carton.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.640
For one apple, you will need to cut two cells
of an egg carton.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.880
I always begin by separating the cells with
large scissors

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.550
and then I trim the edges with small scissors.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.300
To create a little apple, put white glue on
the edge of a cell

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.230
and then glue the two cells together by matching
them as closely as possible

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.680
and let dry.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.899
Then paint the apple in the colour of your
choice.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.200
But here I will give you a little tip.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.930
If you make a red apple, I suggest you first
paint the apple in white.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.879
The red paint is partially transparent

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.120
and the gray of the egg carton comes through
the red paint.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.780
I apply the same logic with other colours,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.310
I generally find that it gives better results.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.270
So start by applying a coat of white paint.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.660
When the paint is dry, apply a coat of red
paint.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.200
Then, with a pin or a thick needle, make a
hole in the top of the apple.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.530
To represent the stem, cut a small piece of
brown pipe cleaner

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.540
and slide it into the hole.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.680
Glue it in place with either some white glue
or using the glue gun.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.960
Take green construction paper, draw the shape
of an apple leaf and cut it out.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.920
If you want to give a little volume to the
leaf, make a notch in the middle,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.170
put a dot of glue on one side and slide that
side over the side with the glue.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.290
Hold in place for a few minutes with a clothespin.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.900
Glue the leaf to the base of the apple.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.670
And voilÃ ... you have your first egg carton
apple...

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.560
Now, I showed you a red apple, but you can
make yours the colour you want:

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.080
yellow, green, or even a mixture of colours.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.110
If you want to make a red and green apple,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.300
I suggest you paint the apple green and then
paint over it.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.950
To do this step, I use a stencil brush, I
take a little bit of red paint

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.810
and I remove the excess paint by rubbing the
brush on a piece of wax paper.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.200
When I see that there is no trace of liquid
paint left,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.590
I rub the brush on the apple to add a little
burst of red on green.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.930
Now let's have a little bit of fun!

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.640
As you know, sometimes you can find a worm
in an apple.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.340
At least, if you pick them yourself.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.220
In supermarkets, it doesn't happen very often.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.340
To create an apple with an inhabitant,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.540
make a hole on the side of the apple with
a pin or a needle.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.180
Take a piece of lime green pipe cleaner, about
half a pipe cleaner,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.120
that you fold in half and twist.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.460
Slide the pointy ends into the apple.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.310
Glue two googly eyes on the other end.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.010
Is that not cute?

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.450
As a class project, you could put a few branches
in a pot

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.170
and hang the apples made by the children.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.100
It's a nice group project for the class.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.819
I wish you a good harvest of apples with your
class!

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.569
Do not hesitate to send me pictures of apples
produced by tiny hands

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.430
and I will post them on my blog.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.070
