me easy steps today I'm going to share

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.519
with you

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:15.960
Samsung Galaxy s4 active it's

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:22.550
AT&amp;T phone and the screen is not working

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:27.510
the digitizer if I can start it

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:31.769
it's vibrate and blue light came on

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.829
as you can hear it it's working but

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.890
digitizer is totally dead the volume key

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.309
is working you can hear it if I can

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.550
press down so if I press the menu button

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:54.449
and you can hear so it is

00:00:50.550 --> 00:01:00.329
responding it's working volume working

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.760
and if I press the power button and you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.850
can hear the beep so looks like it's

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.540
locking it so the screen is not working

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.960
so how we can fix the screen I will

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.590
share with you do you see the tab you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.380
put your nail up there and you open it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.350
the things you need philips screwdriver

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.750
a regular screwdriver I'm using another

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:35.100
screwdriver which has a magnet this is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:39.090
strictly optional 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.649
screws we need to remove and 4 hidden

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.560
screws so altogether 12 screws

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.810
remove the battery put it in the safe

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.619
place let's remove the screws this is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.600
the reason I use it the magnet so I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.799
don't lose this close is the last one

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:03.119
number 8 so so move the other four

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:11.100
screws they are hidden they are hidden

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:15.410
under these tabs 1 2 3  4 the easiest way

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.510
to remove these get a straight small screwdriver

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.400
just put it on the side and just press

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.550
it like this and it has a little glue it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.070
will pop out so once you t ake it out

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.190
we're going to use a Philips screwdriver

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:37.710
the small one and we're going to remove

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.740
that screws so we're going to remove it

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.810
one then I'm going to remove the other

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.180
three on the corners so all the four

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.370
screws has been removed and those are

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.290
small tiny tabs is the shiny one and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.180
that that has a double-sided tape on the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.100
back so make sure you don't lose it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.670
put your nail right up here at the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.810
bottom edge and just to try to pry it

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.030
out so once you pull it it pops out then

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.240
you just take the whole thing out I'm

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.580
going to concentrate on the screen cable

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.150
which one is at this one so I'm going to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.340
make sure that this one look  loose

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.540
possible reason is when the phone has been

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.510
dropped and this cable can get loose so

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.980
as you can see this cable is the loose

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.520
it's popped up so I hope I cross my

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.560
finger because this is the problem

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.890
because as you see the volume was

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.980
working everything seems to working only

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.580
the screen wasn't working so let's put

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.580
this one back

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.680
once we put it back you hear the snap so

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.590
it's very important you aligned it then

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.290
you press it nicely before I do anything

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.930
I wanted to test it so let's put the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:06.720
battery and then we start it

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:09.330
I hear the vibration bingo the Samsung

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.110
Galaxy s4 active the screen is working

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:20.329
make sure that it starts yes it's

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:23.760
starting up so it's working fine

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:29.160
yes it's fully functional so that's how

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:32.850
it's easy to fix your black screen or no

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:37.110
screen on s4 active so make sure that

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:40.290
this is the cable has issue so once

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.260
your phone drops or any other reasons

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.480
wear tear if this becomes a loose

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.530
that's what do you make sure you take it

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:52.229
out you just blow the contacts and a

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.600
press it back again and try it and

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.960
you have nothing to lose except

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.990
everything else to gain all button up so
