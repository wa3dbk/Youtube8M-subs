Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of one of my most popular books the natural

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.660
hair Bible and founder of howtoblackhair.com
for these videos I answer the questions that

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.520
you all send me via email so any of you have
any questions you would like for me to answer

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.400
be sure to check out the description box below
for additional information so this video is

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.030
because of an email Winnie he sent me Winnie
he emailed me because she says that over time

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.930
she's noticing that her hair is getting shorter
as she wants me to give her some help on how

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.150
to eliminate the shedding that she is experiencing
so Winnie the very first thing that I want

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.500
to do is tell you the difference between hair
that is breaking and hair that is shedding

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.460
so that you can know the difference and then
I'm going to give you some haircare tips as

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.229
well that you have to start incorporating
so the very first thing that I want to state

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:06.260
is the hair that is damaged or that is breaking
will break off near the ends but hair that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.680
it shedding sheds at the roots all of us need
to shed hair it's apart of our hair's growth

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.830
cycle some hairs are growing while some hairs
are resting while some hairs are coming out

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.420
this is the natural growth pattern of how
all of our areas in each person is going through

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.930
different phases with different individual
pieces of hair so over time you're going to

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.000
notice that every day your shedding hair which
means they are actually losing a hair from

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.640
the root every day we lose on average about
80 85 to about 100 strands a day so every

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.910
day you are going to see some long strands
and you going to see strands are the length

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.130
of your hair that is perfectly healthy and
natural but on the other hand Winnie you said

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.740
that your hair is getting short over time
which means that your suffering from breakage

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.100
and that leads me from my next tip my next
tip is that one of the most common forms of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.250
breakages i split ends so hopefully you understand
that if you want to be maintaining healthy

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.649
hair you have to keep your split ends clipped
if not you gonna have hair that's going to

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.450
short over time is the look all ratyy and
its going to look see through and its not

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.840
gonna look too flattering so you have to make
sure that you cut off your split ends so that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.891
way you can keep your hair healthy the next
tip that I am going to recommend is that you

00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:27.700
totally have to eliminate harmful ingredients
from your hair care products so if you're

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.450
using products that are filled with silicones
that are filled with sulfates with the petroleum-based

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.310
ingredients you have to throw them out and
you have to use quality products that is not

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.959
going to weigh your hair down silicones are
only useful under high heat situations so

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.510
if you're applying a lot of heat to your hair
I highly suggest that you use the silicone

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.180
something heavy-duty that is going to protect
your hair from becoming damaged and burned

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.980
to no return so what I want you to do is make
sure that you educate yourself on the type

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.870
of products that you need to keep your hair
healthy and if you want everything step-by-step

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.680
in detail with regimens and graphs and pictures
and things to help you to make sure to pick

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.099
the right products and incorporate a regimen
I highly suggest that you check out my book

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.569
the natural hair Bible or the black hair manual
if you specifically want help on hair products

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.970
and then the last thing that I am going to
say is that what I want you to do is make

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.569
sure that you're limiting the amount of time
that you are styling this is one of the most

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.050
common tips that I always suggest because
number one its something that a lot of people

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.450
overlook because it seems like well Im not
using heat or not using this or that so is

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.640
fine if I'm doing if Im doing a twist out
every single day that's a big problem because

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.780
it's going to make your ends weaker which
leads to breakage and another reason why I

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.910
want to make sure that you are only are doing
your hair styles as infrequent as possible

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.530
is because you dont need so much manipulation
on your hair to preserve a good looking style

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.050
keep your hair braids or twists until your
next washday so they are not always having

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.590
to detangle your hair and comb your hair all
the time just to maintain the look so thanks

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.400
for your email those all the tips that I have
to help you in your specific situation on

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.190
how to get over the fact that your hair is
getting short over time because the number

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.639
one thing that stuck out to me was the fact
that you probably have a lot of split ends

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.680
that you need to cut so incorporate any tips
that apply to you as well as anyone else was
