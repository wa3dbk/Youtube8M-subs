00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.033
A holiday meal can be
challenging to prepare

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.734
because there are many
foods being cooked at

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:16.467
different times
and temperatures.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:19.233
It's easy to forget that
food safety is the most

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:21.400
important ingredient.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.800
Four simple steps can
help ensure that harmful

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.967
bacteria won't be a guest
at your festivities.

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:33.100
- Clean, Separate,
Cook, Chill.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.100
Clean.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.033
Start with
clean hands,

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:37.633
cutting boards
and utensils.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:40.533
Dirty hands and surfaces
can spread bacteria

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.266
throughout the kitchen.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.433
Always wash your hands
with warm water and soap

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:49.333
for 20 seconds before
and after handling food.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.867
Clean your cutting
boards, knives,

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:54.200
and countertops with
hot water and soap after

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.934
preparing foods.

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:57.800
Separate.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Using the same cutting
board for all foods can

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.734
spread bacteria.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.934
Use separate cutting
boards for fresh produce

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:08.233
and for raw meat,
poultry, seafood and eggs.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:11.734
Keep raw meat or poultry
away from raw vegetables

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.834
and other foods that
won't be cooked.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:17.900
And don't put cooked food
on platters that held raw

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.700
meat or let cooked food
come in contact with raw

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.800
meat, poultry
or their juices,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.967
because the juices may
contain harmful bacteria.

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:29.600
Cook.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.533
Keep in mind that you
can't tell it's done

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.333
by how it looks!

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.166
Cooking to the safe
temperature kills harmful

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.266
bacteria.

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.000
A basic for preparing
any meat, poultry,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.633
casserole or side dish
is a food thermometer!

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:46.000
If you use a food
thermometer you will know

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
when your food is safe,
and you won't overcook it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.800
or undercook it!

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.100

cooking temperatures at

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.800

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.000
Chill.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.400
Make sure leftovers

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.066
get put in the
refrigerator within two

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.600
hours of the meal - that
includes your leftover

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.633
pumpkin pie!

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:08.166
Keep your fridge at
a safe 40 degrees F.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.500
or below.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.200
And remember to use or
freeze leftovers within

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.400
3-4 days.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.967
This holiday season, we
want everyone to be food

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:22.500
safe!

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.133
