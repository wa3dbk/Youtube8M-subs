00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
hello everyone welcome to easy steps

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.389
today I'm going to be showing you my

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.480
Mercedes ML class w164 chassis I've

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
gotten sadly the check engine light I've

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.930
had it for a while now

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.020
the code is p0400 which pertains to the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.689
EGR valve under the engine covers the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.340
EGR valve is in the passenger back

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.070
there's a lot of causes that can be

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.520
doing it but the main two are clogged

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.190
pipes or broken rubber and pipes that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
are going bad so we're going to work on

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
this and let's see we can get this fixed

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.879
today so I've taken out the EGR valve as

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.329
you can see here it is we're going to be

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.969
cleaning up the carbon buildup inside

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.800
you can use any throttle body cleaner so

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.890
you are going to want to spray this

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
thoroughly to get all the carbon out

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.649
make sure you have something under

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:09.210
because it's going to get real dirty

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:13.560
and messy so here's after results it's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.439
much more cleaner now we're going to put

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.350
this back in also you are going to want

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.030
to clean out the EGR valve pipe since

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.030
it's hard to take it off just spray

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.570
inside is it so here's two of the pipes

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.670
that were connected to the EGR valve as

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.329
you can see this is one of the things I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.119
can trigger your check engine light the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.729
heat does crack it up it's just wear &amp; tear

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.189
and it starts going bad over time you

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.680
want to replace these what's with the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.259
new piping so after reinstalling the EGR

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.320
valve putting everything back we're

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.160
going to go take it for spin

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.050
and let's see if the check engine light

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.170
comes back on after it's cleaned out

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.320
just by turning on the car I can notice

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.030
a big difference between the sound I was

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.260
having before versus what I'm having

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.050
right now I erase the P0400 code it

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.180
was 2 codes showing so let's see what

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.640
we get now I've one code which is

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.670
P0400 it's still coming but PD

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.260
so as you can see the check engine light

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.170
is gone this code just means that P0400

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.820
the problem was there before

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.150
hasn't came back yet it hasn't

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.600
reappeared so just keep driving it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.270
around and try it again after you drive

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.760
50 60 miles plug your scanner back in or

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.680
get it scanned and if that PD if that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.709
code is gone that means you're all ready

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.350
to go so that's how simple it was to fix

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.530
your P0400 check engine light code

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.420
I have driven the car about 50 miles

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.510
already I'm going to drive another 50

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.269
more just to make sure but I think most

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.709
likely it is gone so if you've enjoyed

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.540

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.150
correcting your EGR valve please give
