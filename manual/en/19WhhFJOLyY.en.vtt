[Intro music]

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.520
ANNOUNCER:
THIS is Capitol TV.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.800
[Music]

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.700
JIMMY:
Greetings fellow citizens of Panem, 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.900
I’m Jimmy Wong...

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.169
ASHLEY:
And I’m Ashley Adams. We represent District 9

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.250
whose bountiful harvest of grain helps
feed our great nation.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.649
JIMMY:
Naturally, we are also skilled at working

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:36.790
with the flour we mill.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.010
And so today, the Capitol has given us the
distinct privilege of sharing 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.520
a special recipe with you.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.960
ASHLEY:
We’re all fans of Peeta Mellark, proud victor,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.810
and now, Special Counsel to President Snow.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.780
But, did you know his family runs a renowned
bakery back in his home district?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.800
The Capitol has generously offered to share
one of Peeta’s precious family recipes

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.760
with us all.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.220
JIMMY:
So, grab your mixing bowls and ready your

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.610
measuring cups, because we’re about to show
you how to make Peeta Mellark’s own apple

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.610
goat cheese tarts.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.359
Depending on the district you’re in, it
may be difficult to find some of these ingredients.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.260
But, the good citizens of Panem are endlessly
resourceful, 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.480
so we’re sure that you’ll find a way.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.479
Let’s begin.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.439
ASHLEY:
To hit the ground running, we’ve already

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.369
prepared the puff pastry dough.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.619
You can make it up to a day ahead of time.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.770
Roll out the pastry dough onto a floured surface.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.210
Then, cut out four circles, about four inches
in diameter

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.020
and put two of the circles on a lined baking sheet.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.119
JIMMY:
We’re gonna cut out smaller circles from

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.369
the center of the remaining two, leaving us
with rings.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.340
ASHLEY:
Beat a single chicken’s egg and use it to

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.700
brush the outer edges of each circle on the
baking sheet.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.860
JIMMY:
Next, place your pastry rings on the top of

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.189
each circle.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.360
ASHLEY:
Let’s prepare our filling.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.209
JIMMY:
First, mix the goat cheese, the juice of a

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.259
lemon, and salt in a bowl.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.110
Then, spread the mixture inside the rings
of the chilled pastry rounds.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.909
Overlap your apple slices on top, melted butter,
and a quarter cup of honey in a small bowl,

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.159
and brush that over the apples.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.220
Last but not least, sprinkle them with allspice.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.650
Now, if you don’t have easy access to allspice
in your district, you can replace that with

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.200
a pinch of ground cinnamon, a pinch of ground
cloves, and a tiny pinch of ground nutmeg.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.080
ASHLEY:
Now, it’s time to bake them.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.680
 Set your oven to 190 degrees.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.280
That’s 460 for those of you that use Kelvin,
and bake until the apples are tender and the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.290
pastry is golden…about 35 minutes.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.540
In the meantime, we took the liberty of preparing
some of the other Mellark family recipes,

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.150
such as pastries, cobblers, and rustic breads,
which will all be offered as a gift to our

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.909
local Peacekeeper garrison.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.769
It looks like our tarts are ready.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.730
Ooo, those look wonderful. But, we’re not
quite done yet.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.439
Drizzle one tablespoon of honey over each
of the tarts.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.709
JIMMY:
There you have it. Apple goat cheese tarts

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.390
that look just as delicious as the ones from
Peeta’s bakery.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.299
Love your labor, take pride in your task.
Our future is in your hands.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.100
ASHLEY:
And don’t forget to register for updates

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.810
from Capitol TV...it’s mandatory.
