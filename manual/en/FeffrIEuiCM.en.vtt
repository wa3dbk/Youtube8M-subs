00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.298
- Hi, we're Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:02.298 --> 00:00:03.250
- And we're gonna try out

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.433
one of our favorite swimming toys.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.594
This is the Lil' Fishys,

00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:07.801
they tend to go really fast.

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.611
This is the swimming squid.

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:14.162
â™« Rainy Day Dreamers â™«

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:19.898
- We have tried out the
Robofish, the Aquabot,

00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:20.943
a whole bunch of these Fishys.

00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:23.567
The Lil' Fishys are some
of the craziest ones

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:25.471
because they run on regular batteries,

00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:26.562
not hearing aid batteries,

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.652
and they go crazy in the pool.

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:30.077
It's nearly pool time!

00:00:30.077 --> 00:00:31.616
Ximena's very excited, less than a month--

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:32.568
(Ximena cheers)

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:33.682
- (laughs) We will be swimming.

00:00:33.682 --> 00:00:35.199
Today we're just gonna try this out

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.204
in a container of water.

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:37.481
It's about 10 dollars for this,

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:38.596
as you can see,

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:39.571
it comes in different colors

00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:41.544
with different personalities.

00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:44.099
And if you're interested in
it but can't find it locally,

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:46.119
we will put a link to it
down below this video.

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.324
As I mentioned, the Lil' Fishys do use

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:49.648
regular full-size batteries.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.250
What kind of batteries do we need?

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:53.191
- Two triple A.

00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.352
- Two triple A, yes?

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:55.582
- I love these batteries

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:58.903
because (mumbles) you just have to press

00:00:58.903 --> 00:01:01.607
and it shows you how much
battery is left in it.

00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:03.256
I just love that.
- She loves that.

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:06.019
Ok, with the other Lil' Fishy,

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.293
that's more like a regular swimming fish,

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:10.268
remember there was the issue,

00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:12.009
you would twist it, there
were no screws, right,

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.519
you just twisted it and opened it.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:14.563
And it was a little disconcerting

00:01:14.563 --> 00:01:17.210
because that's the same way
you would turn it on and off.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.743
But if you turned it too far,

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:20.484
it would open, and if you're in the pool,

00:01:20.484 --> 00:01:21.459
the water could get in,

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.268
so we didn't care for that design feature.

00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:28.217
What's the thing here trying to tell me?

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:30.307
"Blub blub blub" (laughs)

00:01:30.307 --> 00:01:32.759
What in the world is
that supposed to mean?

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.509
"Blub blub blub"

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.128
- I think that means when you
take it out it would start.

00:01:37.128 --> 00:01:38.573
- Really?
- I don't know.

00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:39.510
Let's see.

00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:41.231
No.

00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:42.485
- Oh there's a message inside.

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:45.985
"You will meet a handsome stranger."

00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:47.085
No what does it say here.

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:49.941
"Avoid placing this toy
close to hair (laughs)

00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.845
"because hair might become tangled."

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.841
Oh is it with a little blade in there?

00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:54.468
(Ximena murmurs)

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:56.581
- I thought this was going to swim

00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:58.717
like a squid or an octopus like that,

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:00.984
but apparently not, it just
goes crazy like the fish.

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:02.493
This is going to be wild, Ximena.

00:02:02.493 --> 00:02:03.538
Are you prepared for this?

00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:05.128
Oh!

00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:07.253
- It's just a cap on top.

00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:09.066
- Is that waterproof?

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.052
Let's show everybody
what we're looking at.

00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:12.352
So here's what we're looking at.

00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:13.458
We've got how many of these, you said?

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:14.781
How many tentacles?
- Seven.

00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.035
So it's not an octopus.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:17.312
- Alright, to be technically correct,

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:18.682
it is not an octopus.

00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.074
And sorry, this is a little embarrassing

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.885
to show you this part (laughs)

00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:25.525
but there is a propellor in here,

00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:26.633
and it does have this around it,

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:27.934
so you won't chop your finger off,

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:30.581
but you can see how if
you had it near your hair,

00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:32.461
the hair can go in and get
wrapped around that propellor.

00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:34.969
That would probably be painful.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.385
We haven't quite figured
out how to open it yet.

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:37.430
And then show the...

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.936
the skull cap, like Darth Vader had.

00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:44.259
It's gotta be right there so
they'll be in focus together.

00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:46.170
If you remember Darth Vader
could take the helmet off

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.935
and there was the brain inside!

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:50.373
Well it's kinda like that here.

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:54.287
We'll figure this out and
then explain it to you.

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:56.237
Turns out the design of this Lil' Fishys

00:02:56.237 --> 00:02:57.096
is a little different.

00:02:57.096 --> 00:02:58.838
Instead of simply
twisting it to open it up

00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:00.672
and access where you can
put in the batteries,

00:03:00.672 --> 00:03:03.040
this one you actually have
to undo a couple screws

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.410
and take that...

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.547
Darth Vader brain off,

00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:07.787
and then the batteries go in here,

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.714
and we found out the on/off switch,

00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:11.525
sorry again for showing you this,

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:12.802
is down underneath.

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:15.317
It's on this side,

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:19.232
this little rubberized
piece is the on/off switch.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.878
Ximena has put the two triple
A batteries in place here,

00:03:21.878 --> 00:03:22.923
we're about ready to start it up.

00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:26.197
All he needs back is his skull!

00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:27.706
So shall we...

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:29.842
pop that off of here?

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:30.715
Here we go.

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:33.037
Attach that firmly.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:35.450
By the way, (laughs)

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.238
we also in reading the
instructions found out

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:42.230
this is a jellyfish, not
a squid or an octopus.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.857
Time to try this out!

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:45.413
So why don't you turn that on first,

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:46.365
we'll see how loud it is,

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:48.662
see if you feel any breeze
blowing from it or anything.

00:03:50.474 --> 00:03:52.911
(toy buzzes)

00:03:54.073 --> 00:03:54.695
Oh!

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.251
I thought you were pushing
the button again and again,

00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:59.944
but I see, that's what
creates the pulse, the motion.

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:01.964
Oh let me see that light, Ximena!

00:04:01.964 --> 00:04:03.125
- [Ximena] Oh what light?

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:05.726
- [Parris] Yeah look at that!
(Ximena laughs)

00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:07.792
Wow, does it change colors?

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:08.651
I can't tell.

00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:09.888
- [Ximena] I think it does.

00:04:09.888 --> 00:04:11.425
Wait, give it a minute.

00:04:12.937 --> 00:04:15.350
Yeah, it changes colors.
- [Parris] It changes colors!

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.697
I'm loving this!

00:04:16.697 --> 00:04:19.112
Ok, now do you feel any breeze blowing

00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:21.329
from the fan when it's on?

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.587
- [Ximena] A tiny bit, yeah.

00:04:22.587 --> 00:04:24.404
- [Parris] Ok, this is interesting.

00:04:24.404 --> 00:04:26.914
Red, too, wow!

00:04:26.914 --> 00:04:29.329
Now I have no idea how crazy
it's gonna go in the water,

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:32.045
so be prepared to close the lid, ok?

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:34.646
Alright, drop him in!

00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:36.989
(toy buzzes)

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.811
Oh I like this!

00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:45.575
It's just like a jellyfish!

00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:46.551
- [Ximena] It is!

00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:47.410
- [Parris] Now he's not gonna swim

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.917
all the way around the pool but...

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:51.382
I mean, like the other fish, side to side,

00:04:51.382 --> 00:04:54.215
but this is really, really nice.

00:04:54.215 --> 00:04:56.351
- [Ximena] Yeah.

00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.582
I especially love the colors,

00:04:57.582 --> 00:05:00.110
because you know, nighttime.

00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:04.930
And you can see this color much better

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.507
than the other nighttime Lil' Fishy.

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:08.413
Not Lil' Fishys.
- [Parris] Oh yeah,

00:05:08.413 --> 00:05:09.945
that was the latest Robofish,

00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:12.732
they added a little LED in the head,

00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:14.768
a little yellow LED.

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:15.906
It's good.

00:05:15.906 --> 00:05:17.299
I think the battery
will last a while, too,

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:21.455
because the motor and the
propellor don't go all the time.

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:24.311
And the spinning effect is
nice, too, look at that!

00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:26.123
This is so much like a jellyfish!

00:05:26.123 --> 00:05:26.928
- I know!

00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:27.741
- [Parris] I give them lots of points

00:05:27.741 --> 00:05:29.850
for doing a nice job on this toy.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.405
- Five stars.
- [Parris] Yes.

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:32.450
Now a good thing about this,

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.565
as I was mentioning,

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:35.422
is I think the battery will last a while,

00:05:35.422 --> 00:05:37.907
because the motor's
not going continuously,

00:05:37.907 --> 00:05:40.902
however, I think it keeps
going until you turn it off

00:05:40.902 --> 00:05:42.156
or the batteries die,

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:44.060
so if you leave it out in the pool,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.360
it's just gonna keep going all night

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.591
until the batteries wear out.

00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:48.843
The thing with the Robofish, remember,

00:05:48.843 --> 00:05:50.468
is after four minutes it shuts off,

00:05:50.468 --> 00:05:52.744
and then you've gotta dry it off a little,

00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:54.323
put it back in, and it swims around

00:05:54.323 --> 00:05:55.042
for another four minutes,

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:57.062
so the batteries won't
go out as fast on that.

00:05:57.062 --> 00:05:58.316
What did you wanna say about this?

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:01.265
- This is the best water toy

00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:02.519
I have ever seen,

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:04.910
it's like the best toy of the Robofish

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.071
and Lil' Fishys...

00:06:06.071 --> 00:06:08.228
- You're that impressed?
- Yeah.

00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:09.693
- And we realize you're really not getting

00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:12.062
the full effect of it here
in this small container,

00:06:12.062 --> 00:06:14.546
because I think it would drop
down further in the pool.

00:06:14.546 --> 00:06:15.753
It would probably go down further.

00:06:15.753 --> 00:06:16.775
- And it does go to the side,

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:17.913
because before it started to,

00:06:17.913 --> 00:06:19.143
it looked it laid down,

00:06:19.143 --> 00:06:20.212
but it kept trying to go,

00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:22.324
so it's just like a jellyfish.

00:06:22.324 --> 00:06:23.834
- And it would move around the pool.

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:25.784
And we'll be trying it out soon enough!

00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:26.434
- Yeah!

00:06:26.434 --> 00:06:28.315
- We'll bring all the latest Robo,

00:06:28.315 --> 00:06:29.569
everything that goes in the water,

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.310
bring it down to the pool
and give it a tryout,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.541
probably next month.

00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.095
So the Lil' Fishys
jellyfish rises to the top

00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:36.465
of the charts for us, right?

00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:37.556
This is a really good one.

00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:38.856

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:43.454
We'll be back trying this out
in a full-size swimming pool

00:06:43.454 --> 00:06:45.311
along with all those other swimming toys.

00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:46.751

â™« Til the weather ends

00:07:06.278 --> 00:07:08.530
â™« And you don't have to go too far

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.457
