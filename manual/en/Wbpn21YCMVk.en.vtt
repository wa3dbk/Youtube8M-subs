00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.490
00:03
COMM: For most people old age is time to kick

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.760
back and slow down, but not fort granny Pat
Reeves.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.300
00:09
COMM: The oldest female powerlifter in Britain.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.650
00:13
PAT: There is no age limit.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.640
That's one of the wonderful things about powerlifting.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.570
00:18
COMM: She may be just 4ft 9.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.870
but the pint sized 69-year-old makes light
work of 50 kilo weights, and despite surviving

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.189
cancer, has no plans to stop.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.510
00:29
PAT: You can keep going for as long as you're

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.510
alive.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.450
00:34
COMM: At home in dudley, dedicated Pat works

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.120
out three times a week and sticks to a strict
raw food diet.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.890
And it certainly seems to be paying off.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.790
00:44
PAT: I have won just about all the titles

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:58.030
going, um divisional, commonwealth, Europeans,
World's and both as full power and singles.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.720
I'm three kilo off my world bench record.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.949
01:01
PAT: Here is my latest trophy, this increased

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.790
the world deadlift in the 50.5 kilo class
in Dusseldorf on the 8th of June 2014.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.720
01:13
COMM: However intentional competition winner

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.850
Pat wasn't always the picture of health.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.930
In 1985 she was diagnosed with a brain tumour,
then ten years later doctors discovered she

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.350
also had bone cancer, Osteosarcoma.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.340
01:29
PAT: It was very tough, but I was also tougher

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.790
after those ten years so very much prepared
to take it on again.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.570
I was always told that there was no way I
would ever make sixty.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.500
Even my private consultant said that I wouldn't
do that, whatever I did.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.840
01:45
COMM: But instead of opting for traditional

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.500
treatments Pat decided to fight the cancer
by radical changing her lifestyle.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.850
01:52
PAT: Powerlifting helped me I guess because

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.890
it was another focus for me, initially, one
of the biggest changes I did do was not so

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.250
much diet, was to take up exercise.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.230
Because thats something that I never did.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.531
I took up bodybuilding because I realised
that the running was only working me from

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.531
the waist down.

00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:20.560
02:18
COMM: Incredibly the disease went into remission.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.250
02:21
PAT: I've never met anyone who said you're

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.660
too old for this, except a doctor many years
ago.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.560
He said you're too old to lift, give it up.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.260
That was probably eighteen years ago.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.600
It's great proving people wrong.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.170
02:40
COMM: And Pat's still going strong, despite

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.130
suffering three heart attacks and three mini
strokes caused by the cancer.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.380
02:47
GREN: To see her perform, is quite something,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.730
it's very, very much an eye opener, she is
known all over the world, she's able to accept

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.630
what fate throws at her and fight back, very
inspirational.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.880
03:05
COMM: Pat's cancer has now been in remission

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.880
for more than two years.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.570
She's written a book about her experiences,
and she even coaches powerlifters half her

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.570
age.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.160
03:15
PAT: How do I feel about old age?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:26.730
As I said I think it's fantastic, given the
alternative, I don't think about my age, I

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.450
just keep going.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.129
So I think it's the old adage of age is just
a number.
