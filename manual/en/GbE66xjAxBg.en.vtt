00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.228
Welcome to a "Swiss in Norway".

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:14.386
Today in this spacial show, we have a very special guest.

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:17.522
He is the most famous Swiss skier in Norway.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.407
Dario Cologna, welcome.

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.832
What are your goals for the ski world championship?

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:32.244
I had a good season and I'm leading the world cup.

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:37.299
I have high expectations, the goal is to get one medal.

00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:45.163
I think I'm on the way.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:45.198
Do you have experience with tracks around Frognerseteren?

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:54.432
I never run on them, but I was there in summer several times with trainer Fredrik Aukland who lives nearby.

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:57.857
So I know a bit how it looks like.

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:04.606
You have several competitors like Petter Northug.

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.045
What's your relation to him?

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.829
We know us well from the world cup.

00:01:12.797 --> 00:01:16.191
We respect each other. He is always a strong opponent.

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:22.284
About the training: How's your usual training routine.

00:01:22.862 --> 00:01:28.138
I go training around 9:00 for the first time, about two hours.

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:31.897
Then lunch, some relaxing in the afternoon.

00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:35.836
Then around 15:30 again a two hour training.

00:01:35.837 --> 00:01:39.022
Now before the world championship it's more quite.

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:44.088
It's more recuperation than training, so that we're ready when it starts.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:50.263
Do you train also in the dark like the Norwegians? With a lamp on the head?

00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:57.424
In Switzerland it's fortunately bright enough to train during day.

00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:04.093
But before the season we're often here in the North,

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:10.670
so we have to train in the night, since it becomes dark really early.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.266
What's the difference in the cross country skiing philosophy between Switzerland and Norway?

00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:19.827
In Norway it's a big tradition.

00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:22.920
It's sport number one here.

00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:28.898
During the race the people are really excited and have a party.

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:34.397
They go camping in the forest before the race. It's very special.

00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:39.895
In the Switzerland it's not that ankered. That's the major difference.

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:42.098
They stand on skis since they're very young.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.427
They do ski before they can walk. - Exactly.

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:54.561
Since your often in Norway, you certainly had Norwegian specialities? What do you like and hate?

00:02:56.328 --> 00:03:00.111
There is sometime too many potatoes here. You get tired of them.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.762
But fish is good, like salmon. I like that.

00:03:06.178 --> 00:03:11.022
Burnost ? - Not my favourite.

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:13.829
It's OK with jam.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.364
How did you start with cross country ski ?

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:23.373
It was a coincidence: I went with my dad once when I was 12.

00:03:24.693 --> 00:03:32.368
The I like it very much. I was also then in some camps in the MÃ¼nstertal.

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.100
Earlier I did other sports.

00:03:36.145 --> 00:03:40.334
If you hadn't do skiing, what sport would it have been ?

00:03:40.482 --> 00:03:46.851
The question is if I would have been good at it, but probably football.

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:49.378
I played that a long time before changing to skiing.

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:57.638
I fill my luggage always with Swiss specialities. Do you do the same ?

00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:06.460
I stay here for longer time I take some stuff with.

00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:09.142
Norwegians take always the bread to Switzerland.

00:04:09.143 --> 00:04:14.154
That's strange, because it's not really good here.

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:20.130
Since your success, there is a little cross country boom in Switzerland.

00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:25.846
I agree. it's nice that people have more interest in cross country.

00:04:25.847 --> 00:04:32.609
It's a very healthy sport. It's in the spirit of time to move oneself more.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:41.244
At the Swiss championship two weeks ago there were certainly several thousand people watching.

00:04:41.526 --> 00:04:44.165
That's very positive for our sport.

00:04:45.176 --> 00:04:46.923
Thanks.

00:04:47.696 --> 00:04:51.297
That's for today. Good bye.
