What kind of band plays snappy music?

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.530
A rubber band! You guys loved my frozen snacks and
vegan ice cream videos so I thought it was

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.599
was about time we brought the two together

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.060
for some summer pops. Today I have three
recipes to share with and you can and of course

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.760
make them all in a normal

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.130
ice cream mold which I will link down
below but I'm also gonna show you three

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.340
different ways you can make these pops

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.099
mold free. Let's start with my strawberry
banana pops.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.149
This is one of my favorite recipes and it is so easy.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.149
In your blender add banana, vanilla

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.129
extract, stevia or sweetener of choice, and
a greek yogurt

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.260
or yogurt of choice. Blend it on up. Now
you're gonna wanna wash

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.780
out that blender because that is only
one of the beautiful layers of this popsicle.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.390
This time add in your strawberries and 
sweetener of choice

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.690
and if your strawberries are
really sweet you may not need any

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.469
sweetener at all.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.500
For these popsicles I am using a large
silicone ice cube mold which I got at TJ

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.940
Maxx for about three bucks.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.369
A regular ice cube mold will also work.
Start by filling

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.100
each mold about one-third full with your
strawberry mixture

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.340
and then add another layer of your
banana mixture and finish off with a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.340
final layer

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.750
your strawberry mixture once more. Cover
with plastic wrap

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.850
cut a little hole over each mold and
sticking your miniature popsicle stick.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.320
I got mine at the craft store. Since the
mixture is liquid that plastic wrap is

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.140
going to help keep those popsicle stick

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.180
in the mold. Transfer to the freezer
for a few hours

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.120
or overnight. You may need to use a knife
or an offset spatula to help wiggle these babes out

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.409
and running them under a little bit of
warm water will also help.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.650
But once you get them loosened

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.660
up they will slide right out. So preety

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.980
and so delicious. What did Mr. and
Mrs. Hamburger

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.660
name their daughter? Patty. Next up my very
vanilla popsicles.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.340
Start with a bowl of greek yogurt or
yogurt of your choice

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.000
and some vanilla extract and stevia or
sweetener of choice

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.160
keep in mind with all these recipes that
if you start with a sweetened yogurt

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.259
you may not need at any sweeter at all. I
just like to use greek for that added

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.270
protein.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.270
Add in some of that greek yogurt mixture
to your blender

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.400
along with some blueberries or
raspberries or your favorite berry of choice.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.550
Blend it on up. For these popsicles we're
going to use

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.090
mini loaf pans as our mold, a regular size
loaf pan will work

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.520
you want huge popsicles.  Line the loaf pans
with plastic wrap

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.050
and then fill each one about three
quarters of the way full with your blended

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.959
berry mixture.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.320
Then carefully at a layer of your remaning yogurt mixture

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.610
on top. Cover each pan tightly with
another sheet of plastic wrap.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.660
Use a knife to cut even slits for
popsicle sticks into the wrap. Insert your

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.600
many popsicle sticks

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.800
into each slit and transfer to the
freezer for a few hours

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.390
overnight. Once they're frozen, allow them to thaw for a few minutes before trying

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.590
to remove them from the pan.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.650
Run them under a little bit warm water and
then lift them out on the pan and remove

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.630
the plastic wrap.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.750
You'll probably wanna let them sit for
another 10 to 15 minutes at room

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.480
temperature

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.220
before your cut them with a serrated
knife. So Cute!

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.650
What can you steal without getting in
trouble?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.120
Second base. Do you get it? Like

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.440
when a base... In your blender add your coconut
milk.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.400
I like to use lighter coconut milk full fat is fine but it isn't necessary for

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.850
the creaminess of the popsicle

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.790
so I like to cut back on the fat by using the light. Add your freshly squeezed lime juice

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.220
I'm using regular limes but if you have key limes go ahead and use those.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.220
Lime zest, spinach for nutrition and color
because why not add veggies

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.239
to a dessert when you can? Vanilla, salt,

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.940
and stevia or sweetener of your choice.
Blend it on up.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.910
And if you are looking to make all of these
pops vegan you can use the coconut

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.150
milk and the other recipes I sheared
instead

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.360
of the yogurt. Righteous! Pour your mixture into little

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.130
3 ounce paper cups. Wrap the tops
in a little bit of foil,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.299
plastic wrap is a little bit harder to
work with with the paper cups.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.919
Make a small slit over the center of
the cup and stick in your mini popsicle sticks.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.780
Transfer to the freezer for a few
hours or overnight. I think that the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.570
paper cups are perfect for this recipe
particularly

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.440
because it does tend to separate if you use
a bigger mold. When you are ready to

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.440
eat them you first want to dip the cup

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.850
into a bit of warm water and I like to
rub my finger

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.380
over the cup to loosen it up a bit. Use
scissors to cut the cup

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.000
away from the popsicle and then just
lightly tear it off.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.990
If any of the paper sticks, just dip your
finger in a little bit warm water and

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.930
rub it right off.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.490
If you wanted to take these key lime pops
to the level up key lime pie

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.590
pops you could dip your popsicle back into
the warm water

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.690
and then roll it in some graham cracker crumbs.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.810
Keep in mind they will no longer be
vegan if you use regular graham crackers but

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.870
I have linked a vegan graham cracker
recipe in the description box below if

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.580
you're interested.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.660
Tell me which flavor and which mold are
you most excited to try.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.780
Comment below and give me a thumbs up if
you're stoked for these refreshing summer

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.800
popsicles.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.300
I will see you tomorrow for another
summer sips.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.490
Have a great day and remember it's

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.130
all a matter of Mind Over Munch.
