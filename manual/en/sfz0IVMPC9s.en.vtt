00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.270
Today I'm going to teach you how to make this
ugly origami heart. My name is Robert Segundo

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.459
and lets get started. So what we're going
to do is we're going to take our square piece

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.060
of paper that we have here, preferably red.
What we're going to do is we're going to fold

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:20.180
it in half like so. Then you're going to fold
it, I'm going to fold it like this, now you

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.810
don't want to do this because this would definitely
put all your creases off center and make it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.340
definitely bad, but I'm doing this to save
time. Because really what you want to do is

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.300
you want to take and you want to fold your
paper like this, open it up, fold it like

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.579
this, open it up, then take these corners
fold them in like so until you get your nice

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.520
pretty shape. And then once you have it like
this, what you're going to do is you're going

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:54.109
to take, and you're going to fold these triangles
in to your center line like so. Making sure

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:05.339
that your paper stays together. There you
go. Take this, fold this one over like so.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:14.990
Then open it up. The same thing with the other
side. Open it, fold it in like so. Take this

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.740
side and fold it in just like that. There
we go. Now what we're going to do is we're

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.950
going to open this up and we're going to take
these corners here and we're going to fold

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:34.310
them into that point there. Now that we've
done that we're going to open those back up

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.423
as well and you have this crease that you've
created right here. What you're going to do

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:48.530
is you're just going to take and fold those
under, just reverse fold like so, and do the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.969
same thing on the other side. Now take, and
pre crease that again so they fold a little

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:08.060
bit easier. There you go. Like so. Now what
we're going to do is we're going to take,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.890
we're basically going to take these ends and
we're going to fold them up this way along

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.750
that triangle piece and then kind of squish
them down to where they stand up like this

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:28.860
in 3-D mode. There we go. Then just take,
fold it down like so. What you're going to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.250
do is you're going to take and along this
crease line you have there, you're just going

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:41.460
to take it and reverse fold it in. Same thing
on the other side like so. You already have

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.780
the makings of your heart here and if you
want to you can take and you know kind of

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.090
fold the corners down and shape it up just
a little bit. You know make it a little bit

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.010
nicer. Then remember, take your time because
if you try to do this in under three minutes

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.540
this is what it's going to look like. My name
is Robert Segundo and have fun at doing your

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.930
origami heart.
