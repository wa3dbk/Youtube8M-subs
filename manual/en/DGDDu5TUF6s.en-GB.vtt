00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.990
10.
There's a species of bee that likes to drink

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.730
human tears as a protein source.
Sometimes the bees are so gentle that people

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.730
can't feel them attached to their eyelids.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.730
09.
Vultures urinate on their own legs in order

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.730
kill bacteria from carcasses. Turkey vultures
deter predators by throwing up horrible smelling

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.730
vomit.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.730
08.
Male ducks have long, spiraling penises that

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.730
explosively extend &amp; force females to mate.
Females have long, twisting vaginas to make

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.730
non-consensual sex difficult.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.730
07.
Sand tiger sharks eat their siblings while

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.730
still in the womb. The lone survivor then
eats the unfertilised eggs of the mother before

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.730
birth.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.730
06.
Up to 80% of koalas are infected with the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.730
STD chlamydia &amp; can pass it on to humans.
Although a rare occurrence, they can spread

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.730
the disease by urinating on you.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.730
05.
Male AdÃ©lie penguins have been observed mating

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:52.250
with injured females, chicks &amp; corpses. In
1910 a biologist found them so depraved that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.000
his findings were kept secret for 100 years.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.760
04.
Mountain goats can be aggressive &amp; have killed

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:19.049
people. They are also attracted to the salt
in human urine. National Park advice is to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.290
avoid peeing on trails to avoid attacks.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.130
03.
Sea otters have been documented mating with

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:45.320
&amp; drowning baby seals. They continue this
behaviour for up to a week after the seal

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.479
has been violently killed.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.680
02.
Two-toed sloths are attracted to human toilets

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:00.469
&amp; climb inside latrines. They've been recorded
eating poop, urine &amp; toilet paper - possibly

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.979
to get nutrients.

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.180
01.
Male dolphin gangs threaten &amp; intimidate single

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:36.710
females into mating. They also try to have
sex with humans, murder other animals for

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:52.380
fun &amp; kill their own young.
