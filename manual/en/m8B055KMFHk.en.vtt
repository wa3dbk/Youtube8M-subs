00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.920
Justin: All right, guys, it's that time of
year again.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.750
That's right, the biggest Mustang show in
the entire world is happening right now.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.150
AM2015 is upon us, guys.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.150
What's up?

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.560
I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.850
Comin' to you from Maple Grove Raceway, the
Seventh Annual American Muscle Mustang Show.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.760
It's our biggest and best one yet.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.990
Three thousand plus Mustangs, over 15,000
people with a portion of the proceeds benefiting

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.990
Make A Wish.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.510
Now guys, it's gonna be a great day out here.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.480
We've gonna be unveiling Jonathan's Make A
Wish Dream New Edge.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.500
Chip Foose is gonna be giving away the MMD
By Foose 2015 GT.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.190
Vaughn Gittin Jr. is here with his rig.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.530
Steve Saleen, the guest of honor, has brought
a few of his cars, and you know we're gonna

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.940
do it big for the events, right?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.040
We're gonna do the BAMA Dyno competition,
BBK revving competition, the Vogtland springs

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.289
exhibition races, and the Roush burnout contest,
and we even have a damn jet car this year.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.190
That's right, guys, we're doing it big as
always.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.510
Let's hit it.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.050
All right, guys, I'm here with Molly, from
Make A Wish.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.190
Molly, it's great to be out here at our show
this year, benefiting Make A Wish.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.390
Can you tell us in a nutshell what Make A
Wish is all about?

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.390
Molly: Absolutely.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.000
Make A Wish grants wishes to children with
life threatening medical conditions.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.860
Justin: Well, let's talk about a wish today,
a big wish that's being granted.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.860
Molly: Very big.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.860
Justin: For Jonathan.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.080
His Dream Mustang that we built for him.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.920
We also have some really, really neat raffles
going on today, including a trip to SEMA which

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.970
is a great show out in Las Vegas, ride-alongs
with Vaughn Gittin Jr. who is a madman.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.009
We have a supercharger system we're giving
away, which is pretty cool.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.750
Chip Foose is giving away a drawing of a Mustang
and some wheels, and last but not least you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.939
actually get to be in a video with me.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.520
Molly: That will be very helpful for us to
grant more wishes.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520
Justin: Absolutely.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.950
Steve Voudouris: When we first got a call
from Make-A-Wish and we learned that Jonathan's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.030
wish was to have us, American Muscle, overhaul
his car.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.009
We were honored.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.990
We were excited.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.960
Justin: Three, two, one.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.950
All right.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.930
Jonathan: Wow.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.920
Justin: Congratulations, buddy.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.920
Missin' one thing.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.770
These belong to you, sir.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.280
Did we nail your vision or what?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.540
Jonathan: By far.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.370
Thank you.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.629
Seriously, thank you.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:34.970
Dave: Eight hundred horsepower, street driven,
956 hp.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.080
Mustang Owner: This is a 352 cubic engine,
pro charged, pushrod motor.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.060
I think it should probably make somewhere
solidly in the 1100s.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.819
1,16 hp at the wheels.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.709
Justin: Guys, we're hanging out in Shelby's
booth here, of course.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.709
We're with Tim and Phil.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.709
You guys got a great story.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.200
Tim, tell us a little bit about your relationship
with Ford.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.370
Tim: I think it started back when my grandfather
started working for Ford.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.340
His sons, Phil and my dad, Lionel.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.739
They worked there their entire life.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.190
Unfortunately, my father passed away when
we were kids, but he still kept up that Ford

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.190
legend going, and that's what we're trying
to do here.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.190
Justin: So it's definitely a family affair.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.849
You made a nice sizeable donation today to
Make A Wish, and for that we're really honored

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:17.849
and we thank you guys.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.140
Tim: We did that in honor of my father.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.159
Brett: All right, folks.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.050
Welcome to the 2015 Roush burnout competition.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.090
It's about to go down.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:43.200
Justin: All right.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.909
So we're here with Mr. Steve Saleen.

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:52.909
How you doing, sir?

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:53.909
Steve: Hi, Justin.

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:54.909
Thank you for having us.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:55.909
Justin: Hey, it's our pleasure.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.440
Can we talk about the Black Label 302 here?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.659
Steve: I think it's the best that we've done
after 30+ years of doing it.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.739
We actually took three and a half to four
inches out of the car to give us a much better

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.860
aerodynamic package.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.770
On the back it has a full functional rear
diffuser and, of course, our trademark Saleen

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.770
Wing.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.760
Justin: Thanks for showing us your beautiful
creation.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:35.260
Brett: Ten cars for this BBK revving challenge.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.380
All right.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.710
Justin: Thanks for joining us for the Vogtland
Exhibition Races.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:59.790
Okay the EcoBoost, 2014 GT run, BAMA Terminator
with the GT500.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.070
Doug Hyman, come on down, brother.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.680
Doug: Last year my girlfriend and I did our
first show together.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.910
This year it might be a little more special.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.130
Will you marry me?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.139
Dave: Will you marry him?

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.750
Female: Yes.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.160
Doug: All right.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.380
Dave: He said yes.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.590
Give her a hug.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.009
Look at this.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.610
Holy cow!

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.630
5.69 at 280mph and change.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.280
Justin: Well, Chip, here we are day of-, I
mean, this is the moment, right?

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.150
This is the one we've been waiting for with
this car.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.150
How excited are you?

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.150
Chip: I'm very excited.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.720
What an amazing get-together of Mustangs here
at the show.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.070
Justin: We had a blast working with you, Chip.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.330
It really was fun creating a car.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.330
Chip: My pleasure.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.520
Justin: But now, it's time to give this thing
away.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.200
What do you say?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.935
Chip: Well, I already know this gentleman's
name, and it's Brad Brallier.

00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:03.000
Brad, here's the key.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Congratulations.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.009
Justin: Put your hands together, everybody.

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:10.729
Nice, dude.

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:18.460
How do you feel about taking home this machine?

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.870
Brad: A dream come true.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.870
Justin: Well, guys, that's it.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.440
AM2015 is in the books, massive success, 3000+
Mustangs, over 15,000 people and one lost

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.440
voice.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.479
It was an incredible time, as always.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.520
We had a great time unveiling Jonathan's Dream
New Edge Mustang, and on top of that we raised

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.550
$55,000 for Make A Wish.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.550
It was unbelievable.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.110
One of my favorite parts about today, though,
was giving back to the community.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.280
I mean, that's what this show is all about.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.490
It's American Muscle's way to thank you guys
for being such great fans of the brand.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.110
I don't know how we're gonna beat this.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.790
I know I say this every year, but I'm sure
we'll find a way next year.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.319
So in the meantime, thanks for hanging out
with us, AM2015 and for all things Mustang,

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.679
keep it right here at AmericanMuscle.com.
