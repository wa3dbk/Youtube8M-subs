Behind the scenes
Behind the updates

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:11.843
You want updates and you want them now, so in a change to this weeks behind the scenes, 

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:17.266
Paul M went to find out how the team decide what updates they'll be releasing throughout 2013. 

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:21.642
So Runescape is 12 years old, and keeping content that kind of appeals

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:25.720
and is tailored to such a wide variety of players is like, an unbelievably massive task. 

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.665
 So I guess my first question really is, how do you do it.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.824
Well it's not an easy job that's for sure. 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.930
What we tend to do is think about the next twelve months of content that we've got planned,

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:40.699
what we want to achieve within those twelve months, and also kind of have a broad idea of what we want to achieve within the next three years.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.484
When we're thinking about what sort of players we've got, 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.419
we try to make sure that the content we've planned over the next year is appropriate for all of those different groups. 

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:51.761
Some of the bugs that we've got, some of the problems that players have with content. 

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:55.529
We also need to think about all the different skills that we've got in the game, 

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:58.657
we need to think about which pieces of content we've updated recently,

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:04.457
what things we haven't one for a long time, but also areas of the game that have become a bit dated,

00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:08.570
we want to make sure that the game is constantly relevant to players,

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:13.466
so we need to always update, so there's really quite a lot of juggling acts that we're doing all the time. 

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.874
How do you choose what goes in and what stays out. 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.582
Every single project that the entire RuneScape development team is working on is put into a schedule,

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:24.934
right now I've got about six years worth of content in my mind,

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.520
we can't do it all at the same time, so it's about making sure what's right for the game and when. 

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:32.870
But how do you decide "right, okay, well this contents going to go in and this content isn't going to go in". 

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:38.801
A lot of the times its about availability, it's about working out how many hours we've got in every day,

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:44.842
how many hours each department has got to work on things, and then fitting everything together, almost like a jigsaw puzzle.

00:01:44.877 --> 00:01:49.953
Some quests can take up to a year to create, we've got other pieces of content that are very very short, 

00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:57.056
we've just recently done a rework to the demon slayer quest for example, which we should be seeing in the game within the next few months,

00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:01.601
and we restricted ourselves to only a week or two weeks of development. 

00:02:01.636 --> 00:02:08.393
The grandmaster quest that we've got coming up in the next few months has been about nine to twelve months development time.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:15.802
Even though I've been here almost ten years I'm still surprised by the amount of development time that it takes to do certain things. 

00:02:15.837 --> 00:02:21.289
It doesn't surprise me that the players underestimate the amount of work that it takes because I do it every single day. 

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:25.865
So would you say then that ten years ago making a quest was a much simpler process. 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.018
The content that we're producing now is so much more challenging to make just because we've got so many more things to think about. 

00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:38.410
For example the graphics, the quality of the graphics that we can produce now is just astronomically higher than it was before. 

00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:43.594
We have a lot more invest in things like 2D concept art so that we've got a team of concept artists

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.931
that will actually produce really cool images for the modelers and animators to work from.

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:53.986
Audio is a lot better now as well, the quality of the audio that we're producing, using full orchestras, 

00:02:54.021 --> 00:03:03.538
proper voice over's, actually thinking a lot more on how we want those characters to talk - it adds a lot more to development really. 

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:10.187
If we player wants this or wants that how do you decide what goes in, what doesn't go in, whether is a good idea, a bad idea - how does that work. 

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:13.667
It's quite often the case that the ideas that the players really want to see in the game, 

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:17.514
we also want to see in the game, because we're all players of RuneScape as well. 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.696
How long do you think it takes for a player idea to... 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:20.528
Oh and RuneFest as well...sorry. 

00:03:21.678 --> 00:03:23.153
Oh yea, RuneFest, we got loads of good ideas from RuneFest. 

00:03:23.277 --> 00:03:31.193
Yea, well the Runespan, the update last year, that was voted on by the players from RuneFest, and we're really looking forward to doing that again. 

00:03:31.228 --> 00:03:35.536
So, it wouldn't be behind the scenes and I wouldn't be doing my job properly if I didn't harass you a little bit 

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:40.880
and ask you for a bit of a of a heads up for future content. So, what have you got. 

00:03:40.915 --> 00:03:49.249
This is a bit of a cryptic clue, I guess, the gods will be hunting for the rarest butterfly. 

00:03:49.284 --> 00:03:51.369
That is very cryptic. 

00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:55.257
Also something cool - Death, one of the characters that we've got in the game,

00:03:55.292 --> 00:04:01.129
 he's always been a bit of a comedy character but he's actually going to be doing a bit of fighting this year. 

00:04:01.164 --> 00:04:03.149
Do you have any body set to voice Death? 

00:04:03.184 --> 00:04:06.099
No. Not yet. I'm not sure. 

00:04:06.134 --> 00:04:07.028
Are you taking auditions? 

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:14.092
Maybe we are, I'm not sure we're going to voice that quest to be honest with you, we'll see. 

00:04:14.127 --> 00:04:18.596
Okay well I don't want to be the one to stand in the way of progress so I should probably let you get off and crack on.

00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:21.716
Mister voice over guy can we hear about next week's BTS please! 

00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:30.427
But of course! Next week on behind the scenes we really will be looking into the coming desert achievement diary, promise!
