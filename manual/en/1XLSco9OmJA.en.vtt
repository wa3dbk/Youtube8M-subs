Welcome to nishamadhulika.com.

00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:13.788
Today we will prepare Namkeen Masala Sev which all of you will surely like as its tasty and easy to make.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.153
Ingredients required :

00:00:20.727 --> 00:00:22.417
Gramflour - 2 cups

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:26.657
Oil - 1/4 cup

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:30.591
Baking soda - less than 1/4 tsp

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.801
Ajjwain(carom seeds) - 1/4 tsp

00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:43.692
Grinded spices(masala) - 10-12 black pepper, 4-5 clove, 1 cinnamon stick an inch long

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.847
Salt - add to taste or 1/2 tsp

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:49.684
Oil - to fry sev

00:00:49.957 --> 00:01:05.858
To prepare Sev first we have to knead gramflour with baking soda,

00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:21.303
ajjwain(crush to enhance flavour), grinded spices, salt and mix.

00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:44.144
Add oil, then water to the mixture and knead well for a soft dough.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:55.434
The dough has to be softer than that required for chapati.

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:12.778
After preparing the dough leave it aside for 10 mins as the dough needs to ferment.

00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:20.248
Now the gramflour dough has fermented and is set to prepare Sev.

00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:28.319
A Sev making machine is required to prepare Sev which comes with

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:35.462
various shape cutters. We will use the one with holes in it.

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:08.097
Fix the shape cutter in the machine then open the container which is to be filled with the dough.

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:20.834
Apply some oil on your hands to avoid the dough from sticking to them.Now take some of the dough and roll it lengthwise.

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:31.292
Place it in the container and repeat till the container is filled.

00:03:49.305 --> 00:04:11.540
Close the lid of the container tightly and our machine is ready to use.

00:04:12.464 --> 00:04:20.454
Heat oil in pan, check if its heated by putting a small piece of the dough.

00:04:20.942 --> 00:04:24.593
If the oil is hot then piece will float else sink to the bottom.

00:04:38.213 --> 00:04:48.801
Place machine over pan and push the piston upwards, Sev oozes out of the container into hot oil.

00:04:51.966 --> 00:04:55.593
Pour as much desired Sev into pan and then remove machine.

00:05:02.025 --> 00:05:05.922
As the Sev comes on the surface of the oil we will upturn it.

00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:22.138
Lower flame to make Sev crispy.

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:37.122
Remove Sev from pan and place it on a strainer with a plate under it to hold excess oil.

00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:44.288
We do not have to fry Sev for a long time else it gets hard.

00:05:45.785 --> 00:06:33.958
Repeat the same process with the machine until all the dough in it is used then fill container again.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.490
Namkeen Masala Sev is now ready. This Namkeen Masala Sev was made using few spices.

00:07:15.514 --> 00:07:25.986
If you prefer more spicy Sev then you can add 1/4 powdered black pepper and red chilli powder(according to taste).

00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:57.797
Once Namkeen Masala Sev is prepared let it cool properly for 1-2 hrs then it can be stored in a container for 2-3 months.

00:07:58.474 --> 00:08:03.037
It can be eaten as a teatime snack or something to nibble with your morning tea.

00:08:03.273 --> 00:08:09.800
