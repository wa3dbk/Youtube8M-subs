Foooood!

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.640
You ever show up at a church potluck to discover that there really.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.700
isn't enough for your favorite dish to go around

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.500
I mean, how is that coveted zucchini
potato chip casserole gonna be

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.300
apportioned among all those attending the potluck.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.939
Coincidentally, that is similar to when
United Methodist must decide

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.260
what portion or apportionments

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.640
the local church should contribute to
the larger ministries

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.640
of the United Methodist Church.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.620
But, actually, one has absolutely nothing

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.600
to do with the other. I just really like
talking about food.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.879
And potlucks specifically, uh...

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.419
Now, as far as what local church apportionment mean to the United Methodist Church,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.600
well that is a much more important
question

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.300
and of course that is why we are talking
about apportionments

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.780
on this episode of Chuck Knows Church.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.240
[Cue intro music]

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.409
[awesome intro music right?]

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.600
The United Methodist Church

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.210
is unique as a connectional
denomination, meaning that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.900
all United Methodist Churches are
connected by general

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.230
regional and annual conferences that
share common laws and processes.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.430
Now, one way this connectional denomination is possible is through each churches

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.540
apportioned giving. Meaning each local church

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.780
contributes to the ministry's of the
United Methodist Church

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.830
as a whole. Apportionments or apportioned giving

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.970
is a term which describes how the money
each parishioner gives to their local church

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.700
is distributed throughout the United
Methodist Church which supports

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.210
ministry and mission locally and...

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.690
around the world. It is not the term used
to divide Mrs. Jordan's garlic glazed

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.180
potluck pork chops.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.370
That term is "get behind me. I was here first."

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.010
[giggles off camera]

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.290
In the days of John Wesley one penny collection supported the work of local Methodist societies

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.090
and the larger Methodist movement. Just
like the early members

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.500
today local church contributions helped
the United Methodist Church as a whole

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.830
make mission and ministry possible. Again,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.850
connectional church giving local
churches the opportunity to be involved

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.260
financially in the total mission the
United Methodist Church.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.320
To learn more you can ask your pastor tell
them Chuck sent you.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.730
Alright and I will apportion this

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.989
to the crew. You all will get one cracker
apiece

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.600
The ham is mine!
