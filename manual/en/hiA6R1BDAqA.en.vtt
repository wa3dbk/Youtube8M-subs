00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.260
Brothers and sisters, welcome back to Food
Busker.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.610
Today we are going to do lamb sliders.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.110
Roll montage.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.320
Right first thing we need to do is get the
rosemary chopped.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.910
So nicely dice all that up.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.210
Now we're making mini burgers so your prep
needs to be mini.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.030
You don't want big chunks of herbs or big
chunks of onion.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.740
So get your prep nice and tight.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.489
Right we need to get the pan on, but today
we're using a wood fired oven.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.789
So we want a little bit of oil in the pan
and then we're going to whack it in the oven

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.489
to bring it up to temperature.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.909
Okay now I'm going to leave that to bring
it up to temperature, if you're doing it at

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.379
home bring it to a medium heat until you think
it's ready.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.030
I'm so excited to be using this wood fired
oven my brothers and sisters.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.789
So that's nice and hot so I'm going to put
my red onion in, you want about five tablespoons.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.869
One teaspoons of ground cumin, one teaspoon
of ground coriander seeds and some fennel

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.159
seeds that are ground.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.729
And now I'm going to put the rosemary into
the pan and let's get that into the oven.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.729
Aaaaaah.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.759
So I'm just going to saute those off so they
become translucent, and the herbs and the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.829
spices start meeting each other and getting
to know each other.

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:32.799
Okay so we're just going to give that, move
it all around and that's going back in now

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.609
to cook a little bit more.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.630
These are done, come and have a sniffarooney.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.009
Look how beautiful that is.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.670
So let's get it into the bowl, you're smelling
all those spices right now.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.670
Beautiful.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.900
Okay, now let's get some other ingredients.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:04.350
now we want about two teaspoons of garlic
paste, a tablespoon of ketchup.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.060
And then we want 750 grams of lamb mince.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.600
Now let's incorporate those ingredients.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.660
Get your hands in there!

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.920
Right so just wash my hands, and then what
I am going to do is get some salt in there

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.040
to bring out the natural flavour of the lamb.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.970
Use some good salt and then let's just incorporate
that in.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.360
Okay so get a nice chunk of meat you want
about a size of a golf ball and then just

00:02:43.360 --> 00:03:00.010
roll it round and then just pat it down so
you've got flat sides.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.980
Okay I've washed my hands, now I'm going to
put these into the fridge for half an hour

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.739
to rest and settle.

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.040
Okay so they've rested in the fridge for half
an hour and they've retained there for beautifully.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.470
Now I've got my pan in and I've just going
to get a little bit of oil and I'm going to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.710
rub it on the top of the burgers.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.550
Now let's grab the pan.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.760
Burger.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.340
Now let's get these in the oven.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:41.549
Okay, now let's just flip these little guys
over.

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.810
These guys are ready, so let's just get them
out.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.819
I want them to rest for a couple of minutes.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.819
Just drop em down here.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:04:01.930
And now I'm going to quickly toast my buns.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.230
These guys are perfectly toasted, going down
on here.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.510
Burgers on, now for the garnish.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:30.520
Tomatoes on the top, red onion and then a
dollop of yogurt, feta, mint and finish off

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:39.890
with just a little bit of paprika.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.880
Look at those bad boys!

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.930
How gorgeous are they?!

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.890
Okay so I reckon they're Â£9.50 in a restaurant,
I'm going to take them to the street and see

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.140
what people think.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:10.260
Where the bloody hell am I?!

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.300
Oh, hi!

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.720
I'm the food busker and I cook on the streets
and I ask the people what they think of my

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.730
food and what they would pay for it.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.750
Jim?

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.000
Jim, from the Craft Beer Channel?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.860

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:51.700
These craft beer boys, they're weird!

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.120
Water!

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.550
Failed!

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:24.240
Mmm, these are delicious.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.440
But what would you have paid for them?!

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:42.470
