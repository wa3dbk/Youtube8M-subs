Hi I'm James Adams I'm here on behalf of expertvillage.com
and now I'm going to proceed to talk about

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:13.480
AGP video cards. AGP video cards are not volatile
but they are kind of older but, they are good

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.650
for games. Newer games require PCI express
but you could still get around with AGP video

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.039
card. Now this is a sound card but this is
a PCI sound card and this is a AGP video card.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.309
This is old. Notice the difference on the
sockets right here. The PCI has two like little

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.600
slits right there where the AGP only has one
but, they are the exact same length that is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.410
because when I explain before a PCI slot looks
exactly the same as a AGP slot except AGP

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.199
slot is brown and it always about a inch if
this is where the PCI slots are the AGP would

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:02.929
be about a inch behind to kind of differentiated.
AGP if you are thinking about a AGP video

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.640
card more then likely your need for video
editing or games. If you are thinking about

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.540
video editing its worth the money and maybe
don't pay more then a hundred bucks for a

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.770
AGP video card. You don't need more. If you
are a gamer and you have a AGP video card

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.560
and you want to play games its not really
worth spending $200 on a AGP video card you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.620
mightiest well save the money and a year from
now get yourself a brand new .... processor

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.570
and a good video card. AGP is still good but
its showing its age and from all the stuff

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.760
that I read about games performance and stuff
AGP wont be around for much longer. Actually

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.750
it is not in production anymore. So AGP to
upgrade you AGP video card there is more of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.880
a option of I got a 120 bucks I want to play
some games my video card right now is old

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.431
and I don't want to buy a new computer I need
something to get me through about a year a

00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:07.750
year in half maybe, maybe with real luck 2
years. So think about what you want to do

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.050
when you want to upgrade a AGP video cards.
It is a good old technology but it is showing

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.069
its age.
