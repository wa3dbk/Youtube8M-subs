00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.200
Today we’re going to talk about the hottest
trend in beauty and it’s called the inside

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.230
out approach. And the big buzz word is hyaluronic
acid. Maybe you’ve heard of the botox-alternative

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.520
injections? These contain hyaluronic acid
and that’s why they’re so good for the

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.980
skin because it helps plump the skin up. But
what if there were an alternative that you

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.579
could take, like a supplement or something
to boost your own hyaluronic acid levels?

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.560
There is, and it’s called Rejuva. And, to
give you an idea of how it works, we’re

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.080
going to look at these fruit examples. Now,
we’ve got some grapes here and they’re

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.520
nice and ripe and plump and full of water.
Now what happens when you dry out a grape?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.789
You get a raisin. It’s wrinkled and shriveled.
Sort of what happens to your skin as your

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.350
skin loses water. The same thing with these
plums. If you dry out a plum, you get a dried

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.050
plum or prune, and they’re wrinkled and
you know, there’s just no water. Tt’s

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.522
the same thing that happens with collagen
as we age. We’re going to walk through this

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:08.980
example today and when we come back tomorrow,
we’ll take a look at what we’ve got. I’m

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.770
going to put some oil in one and water in
the other. And we’ll come back tomorrow

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.590
and see exactly what I’m talking about.
Okay, we’re back again today. And, we put

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.230
olive oil in this one and we put water in
this one. As you can see, the one with the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.210
oil, didn’t plump up at all. And the one
with water, that’s a huge difference. That

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.070
shows you how powerful water is at plumping
tissue. But, we spend a fortune on oil, putting

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.530
topicals on and it’s not, that’s not where
you want to be.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.960
Rejuva is so great because it has the hyaluronic
acid in there and it’s nature’s moisturizer.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.600
It’s got 17 other key ingredients that are
fantastic for keeping your skin moist, keeping

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.250
it hydrated. Maybe you are tired of not being
able to get your makeup on because the texture

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.720
is so rough and you have to exfoliate every
time.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.000
This is something that will make such a difference.
And, it’s so easy to take. It’s a super-fine

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.640
powder in a capsule form and you start seeing
results very quickly. Just within a month.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.290
There’s actually been studies done that
show you get a sixty-fold increase in your

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.910
hyaluronic acid. And, it’s important to
get that to the tissues while they’re being

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.950
formed inside the body.
If you put oil on, after the fact, after the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.250
skin’s already made, you’re only getting
so far. But, if you can do something to those

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.060
tissues to improve their health and appearance
while they’re being formed inside the body,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.230
you’re going to be way ahead of the game
as far as being able to stay youthful and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.810
healthy-looking.
