00:00:02.493 --> 00:00:05.662
You and...
You and I, we're the same.

00:00:05.663 --> 00:00:08.199
How do you mean by that?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.036
Gotta be the best.
Oh, I see. Okay.

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:14.671
Be the best.
Yeah.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:31.289
Sometimes I see
flashes of light.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.560
You know, like, uh... Colors.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:42.300
I fall asleep and I dream.

00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.536
But there's a part of me
that's always awake.

00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:48.573
And I can see myself dreaming.

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:56.647
I'm just... I'm seeing things
differently, fish.

00:00:56.648 --> 00:00:59.550
That's good.
That's good.

00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.051
Fish...

00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:05.790
Why the hell do
they call you fish?

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:07.041
( &lt;i&gt;laughs&lt;/i&gt; )

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:11.345
Well, spurgeon,
sturgeon, fish.

00:01:11.346 --> 00:01:14.481
I mean, it took about
15 minutes of my first day

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:17.317
At the naval academy.
Yeah.

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:19.920
Your kids go there?

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.556
Yeah, they did.
They did.

00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:24.759
And they're good men,
both of them.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.795
I don't see as much of them as
I used to when mary was alive.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:31.565
You don't have to talk about it.
It's okay.

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.251
No, it's okay. It's okay.

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:36.253
You're a married man,
you know what it's like.

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:37.955
I mean, every marriage
has its good years

00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:39.890
And its bad years.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.110
We ended on a great year.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.063
Good.
