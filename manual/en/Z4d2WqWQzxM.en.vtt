On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Jim
Dufresne and I'm here to tell you about acoustic

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:18.410
guitar amplification. Okay, here's the acoustic
bass guitar. These are starting to become

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.920
more popular now and the prices have really
come down a lot on these. You'll notice first

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.600
of all that it has four strings because it's
a bass guitar and the body is a little bit

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.400
bigger. The bigger the body the more chance
of having a good bass and sound. Now, the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.950
old string basses had big bodies on them.
They had a nice big round bassy sound. The

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.510
Mexican Guitaron has a big body. I swear if
I ever got caught in a hurricane or a flood

00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:03.580
I'd want a Guitaron for a life reserve. Now
here's a bass guitar that has the Piezo Electric

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:12.420
System built in. See, I can tap on that and
you can hear it. I'm doing it. It has a preamp

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.110
just like the other guitars did. This one
has a the jack that comes out of the side

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:35.170
but a lot of them have them right here on
the bottom. So this one has a pretty nice

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:43.950
sound. Remember that our settings on the P.A.
system are flat. That means there's no changes

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.110
in the Graphic Equalizer. It's zeroed out
and the preamp tone controls are right at,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.210
they're right at zero. So we're not adding
any bass, or any treble or removing any treble.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.920
It's just the natural sound of the bass guitar.
It sounds, it sounds pretty good.
