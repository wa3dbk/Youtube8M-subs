00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.540
Hey, welcome to Ski Talk. I'm Rob from skis.com joined today by

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.620
Jeff, our Full Tilt rep. Jeff, thanks for being here.
Absolutely.
So, we're talking about the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.760
Full Tilt Drop Kick Boot. Really cool boot in the line. What can you tell me about it?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.840
Well, the Drop Kick is one of our freestyle boots.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.920
Designed for that park and pipe rider that wants

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.100
a nice flexible tongue. It's a 6 flex on it.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.240
The ribbing gives it a nice, progressive flex. Intuition Liner for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.320
warmth and comfort. Really perfect for that freestyle guy.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.370
And another great feature with all the Full Tilt boots, and this boot included, is the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.530
shell. Really unique design on the shell.
Yeah, this is also

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.630
one of our Full Tilt Original shells.  The FTO shell

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.720
which is very low to the ski and super lightweight which is, again,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.770
something that the freestyle guys like. Three-piece shell allows it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.210
easy to get and out of even when it's ice cold.
And a big thing with

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.260
all the Full Tilt boots and this boot especially, really

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.370
cool buckles and this has a different boot board in it.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.430
Correct. This has our active boot board and it's actually a rubber

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.610
boot board. Better dampening comfort when hitting

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.770
big hucks and things like that.
Awesome. And so, you know,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.880
going back to who is the Drop Kick for?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.950
Who's the guy?
i would say with the little sneaker graphic

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.030
to it, it's definitely more of a freestyle rider design

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.140
boot with the active boot board and the lightweight.
So, really, kind of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.230
more that park rider?
Right. Right.
Definitely. So,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.300
that's it. That's the Drop Kick. Jeff, thanks for joining us, again, I'm Rob from
