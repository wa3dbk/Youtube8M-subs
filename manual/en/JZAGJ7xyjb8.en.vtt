MALE SPEAKER: I think tonight,
we're all really happy about

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.865
Small Beginnings.

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:06.910
And this is the start
of a bigger bang.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.620
So please welcome The
Rolling Stones.

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:26.840
KEITH RICHARDS: It was
a mutual respect.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.250
I think I always felt
that about Toronto.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.910
It's been a favorite haunt to
rehearse in for some reason.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.290
A lot of it's to do
with logistics and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.280
money I've no doubt.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.170
You go to the Masonic Hall, you
knew where you were going,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.030
and you didn't have to
break in a new room.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.850
So it was an easy place
to rehearse in.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.850
And it's always been
a good town to us.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.170

got me out of jail.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.680
KEITH RICHARDS: I think
there's something

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.830
psychological maybe, in kicking
off before we actually

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.050
hit the big stage.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.155
And just get the feel of an
audience, really face to face,

00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:11.220
which is quite important.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100
Because once you get on the
big stage, you have to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.340
exaggerate and everything has
to be amplified more.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.110
The hard gigs are like the small
ones, where you've got

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.795
no props, no nothing.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:23.670
You just have to do what
you do face to face.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.620
I think it's a matter of
touching your roots and then

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.640
letting it fly from there.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.690
After all, it is a club band.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.030
I mean, in its embryonic
form that's what it is.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880
If we can pull it off
in a club baby we

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.469
can pull it off anywhere.

[MUSIC--THE ROLLING STONES]

KEITH RICHARDS: In a way you use
it to break in new songs.

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.460
And then throw a brand new song
at you now that you've

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.890
never heard in your life.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.720
Let's hope it goes down well.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.030
It's the band testing themselves
and saying, well,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.290
if we can play them an unknown
song, and yeah, it's rocking,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.470
then we're cool you know?

MICK JAGGER: I think that's the
first time we ever done

00:02:04.427 --> 00:02:05.472
that, is that right?

00:02:05.472 --> 00:02:07.100

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.690
KEITH RICHARDS: There is a
kind of feeling about set

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.260
lists that it finally
settles itself.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.920
And then you have room
to maneuver.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.170
You know, let's branch out a bit
and try some of the newer

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.810
stuff or something we
never done before.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.560
Do some cover versions.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.890

the band feeling comfortable

about itself.

KEITH RICHARDS: A lot depends
on if Mick wants to sing it.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.890
I mean, when it comes down
to it, the front man

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.020
has to be the one.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.500
If I throw an idea at him and he
says, no way am I going to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.490
do that, then no way we're
going to do it.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.880
When Mick's feeling adventurous,
it means he feels

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.910
confident in the band and
everything's set and ready to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.578
go which I certainly think
he was that night.

KEITH RICHARDS: If I look at the
set list that Mick's drawn

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:10.410
up, and the more adventures the
thing is, then I have more

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.710
confidence in him because
I know because

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:13.870
it's a two way street.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.270
In a way, I go, wow he
wants to try that,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.160

KEITH RICHARDS: Songs tend
to race when it's live.

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:37.800
There's that extra adrenaline
that you have to constantly

try and control it.

Because once Mick gets going,
and the whole thing is

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.570
rocking, it's easy to let
it carry you away.

best for the music.

and drums have to--

a band is for the drummer
