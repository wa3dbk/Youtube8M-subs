00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.280
Hello, I am Tess.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.370
Welcome back to the feed my friends series.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.930
In this episode, I am going to be showing
you how to make a delicious lamb steak with

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.719
chermoula.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:22.980
[music]
So to begin, I want to be chopping my garlic.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.630
I have a few cloves here.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.439
I am just going to bash them.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.190
Roughly peel them and I am just going to roughly
chop them on the diagonal.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.280
We want them in nice strips.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.280
Right.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.260
So I have got my pain heating here on a nice
high heat and I am just going to add some

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.860
olive oil straight into the pain.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.470
To that, I am going to throw in my garlic.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.751
Now I have some really nice spices here.

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:57.960
I have some smoked paprika, I have some coriander,
and I have some chili flakes.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.850
I am just going to pop these in and toast
them as well.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.989
So I am toasting my spices to release the
flavor.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.989
Right.

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:06.989
So that is ready.

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:07.989
You do not want to over toast the spices.

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:12.110
You will know when they are done and now I
am just going to add my red pepper straight

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.940
into the pan.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.700
So I am not trying to cook the red pepper.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.150
I just want to get all of the flavor.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.540
So I am just going to pop my red pepper straight
into this bowl.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.290
Put that to one side, and I have these two
lovely lamb steaks right here and I have about

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.180
half a teaspoon of smoked paprika and ground
coriander, which I am just going to add with

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.440
a little bit of olive oil.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.930
Now the reason that I am putting olive oil
onto them now, aside from helping me rub in

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.630
the nice spices, is because you do not want
to put oil straight onto a griddle pan.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.460
For the full list of ingredients and the method,
just check out the description box below.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.760
So my pan is really nice and hot and I am
ready to add my steaks.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.101
There we go, a nice sizzle.

00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:07.860
That is exactly what we want.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.710
So the steaks just need a couple of minutes
on each side.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.010
While they are doing their business, I am
going to get to work on the mint.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.959
The mint adds a really nice freshness to the
chermoula.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.629
Just roll up your halves into a nice little
ball.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.040
Then just take your knife and gently rock
it back and forth and get a nice finely chopped

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040
mint.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.859
Now that mint can just go straight into there.

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.440
Give that a little mix up.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.999
Now I am going to go back to my steaks.

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.499
They are ready to flip.

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:40.230
You want some nice grill marks on it.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.329
The hob that it is on right now is not actually
that hot, so I am going to move it across

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.549
to this one, which is hotter.

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.319
You want it on a really nice high heat.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.560
Give that a flip.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560
Right.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.849
So nice is a good time to taste.

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.219
Think about seasoning.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:05.599
Does it need a little bit of salt?

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.000
A little pepper.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.780
Definitely a little bit of olive oil.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.279
This is kind of a combination between an accompaniment,
kind of salad like fresh vegetable style thing

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.579
and also a relish as well.

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.840
Lovely.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.359
So coming back to the lamb steaks.

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:30.700
So I am just going to leave these on my board
to rest.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.849
So when you are looking for whether the meat
is cooked, it is a texture thing.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.739
So the harder the meat, the more well cooked
it is.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.840
So you are looking for a slightly spongy kind
of texture.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.120
You do not want it to be too hard.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.209
So then you have a nice pink piece of meat
basically.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.209
Now I am not going to waste the juice that
is in the bottom of the pan.

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.859
I am going to pour it straight into my chermoula.

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.799
Just give that a little mix.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.049
So we are pretty much ready to assemble.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.469
Basically what I have done is I have some
chickpeas here.

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:04.239
There are two chickpea tins, so that is about
800 grams of cooked chickpeas and I have added

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.319
some olive oil, probably about three tablespoons
and some water, salt, and pepper, and I have

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.659
mashed it into a kind of rustic chickpea mash
and this is just the most perfect accompaniment

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.659
for these lamb steaks.

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.989
It is just simple, it is easy, and it is really
cheap, too.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.659
So while that is heating through, I am just
going to slice my lamb steaks.

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.940
So you just want to cut them on the diagonal.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.170
As you can see, they are still nice and pink
inside.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.199
There we go.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.199
Beautiful.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.419
The same for this one.

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.560
There we go.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.560
Perfect.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.740
I have a big plate here, so I am going to
serve for two people.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.379
I am going to pop my chickpea mash into the
center.

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:50.580
I am going to spoon it a little bit flat and
I am just going to arrange the lamb steak

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:59.760
beautifully on top and then I am just going
to drizzle over on top with this as a chermoula

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760
relish.
