00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.950
Portland police found themselves in an unusual
predicament this weekend when they were dispatched

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.669
to apprehend a 22-pound Himalayan called Lux
— after it assaulted a baby and forced a

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.470
couple to retreat. Northwest Portland resident
Lee Palmer called police after the cat attacked

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.759
his 7-month-old child, scratching the baby's
forehead, late Sunday. He then kicked the

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:31.939
cat "in the rear" and the cat "went off over
the edge," he told the 911 dispatcher. "He's

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.260
trying to attack us. He's very, very, very,
very hostile."

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.270
The couple locked themselves, their baby and
their family dog in a bedroom while they waited

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.760
for police intervention, The Oregonian reported,
however, Palmer showed concern for the officers'

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.390
safety as well. "When I leave out the bedroom
to let the police in, I'm going to have to

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.450
fight this cat," he alerted the dispatcher.
"Tell them to be careful — the police."

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.870
"I will," the dispatcher said. "Do you think
the cat will try to attack the police?" Palmer's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.490
reply: "Yes." Meanwhile, the cat can be heard
howling in the background. "He's charging

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.320
us," Palmer told her. Police entered the apartment
armed with a dog snare. The cat dashed into

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.160
the kitchen, scaled the refrigerator and then,
using the snare, officers got the cat into

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.931
a pet carrier, The Oregonian reported. No
one, including the child, was injured. On

00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:37.170
a more serious note, the Mayo Clinic recently
reported that one in three patients who are

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.610
bitten on the hand by felines have had to
be hospitalized and two-thirds of those hospitalized

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.979
have needed surgery, a three-year study showed.
It's really all in the fangs. When cats bite,

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.430
they can inject bacteria into joints and tissue,
breeding infections. Researchers estimate

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.250
that about 400,000 bites and 66,000 emergency
room visits can be attributed to cat attacks

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.659
each year, according to data from the World
Health Organization.
