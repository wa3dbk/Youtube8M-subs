00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.040
So, what's the plan, Stefan?

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.190
What's the big move you're making?

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.500
I took Klaus' family to make him suffer.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.210
I'm not going to let him make him suffer more.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.110
So, then what are you going to do, huh?

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.470
Are you going to lock me in some cave and
keep me hostage?

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:32.669
Maybe I'll just turn you into a vampire.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.669
Stop the car, Stefan!

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:34.669
Stop the car, Stefan!

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:35.669
Stefan, how nice to hear your voice.

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:36.669
Tell your hybrids to get out of town, Klaus.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.809
Well, that's not going to happen until I get
my coffins back.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:39.809
Ok.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.440
Well, then I'm going to drive

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.611
your blood source off wickery bridge.

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:43.611
I don't believe you, Stefan.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.611
You won't kill her.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.611
No!

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:46.611
No!

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:47.611
No!

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.611
What are you doing?

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:49.611
What's going on?

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:56.890
I just fed her my blood.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.829
No more hybrids if she's a vampire.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.289
You won't do it.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.289
Really?

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.289
Try me because your coffins are next to go.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.289
Say good-bye to your family, Klaus.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.289
Stefan, slow down!

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:05.289
Stefan, slow down!

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.289
Fine.

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.289
I'll send them away.

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.289
You win.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:09.289
Stefan!

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.289
Stefan, stop!

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:23.680
Stop the car, Stefan!

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:34.330
Aah!

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:45.840
Get back in the car.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.160
Stay away from me!

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.070
Elena, get in the car.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.350
How could you?!

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.060
My parents died going over this bridge.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.740
I almost died.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.440
You knew that.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.840
You're the one who saved me.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.565
Look, he had to believe that I would do it,
all right?

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:03.650
Your fear sold it.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.450
Well, what if he hadn't?

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.450
He did.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.960
Well, what if he hadn't?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960
He did, Elena!

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960
He backed down!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960
He has a weakness!

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.290
If I know his weakness, I can destroy him!

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:25.489
After everything, that's what mattered, destroying
Klaus?

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.299
Destroying Klaus is all I have left.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.870
You had me!

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.610
I lost you the minute I left town with him.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.280
You just haven't let yourself admit that.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.730
Is that what you're doing?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.219
Trying to make me hate you?

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.930
I don't really care what you think about me
anymore, Elena.
