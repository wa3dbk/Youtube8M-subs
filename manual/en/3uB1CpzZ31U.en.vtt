Men's Trouser Pockets - The J Pocket or Western
Pockets - Overview of Pant Pocket Styles

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.630
Hi!

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.580
Today, we're going to be talking about the
J or the Western Pocket as it's sometimes

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.580
called.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.010

Style Q&amp;A.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.780
I'll link to it down below, but that's our
new Q&amp;A site, so I can better answer questions

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
because YouTube comments are broke, as I've
said in the past.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.080
This is the question that came in, "Antonio,
I've got a quick question I was hoping you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.490
could help me with.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.850
What do you think of dress pants with J pockets?

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.580
These are similar to the ordinary pockets
you would find on jeans, but on dress pants,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.370
in my case, charcoal grey trousers.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.120
FYI, I'm six foot, 150 lbs, so I wear slim
fitted clothing.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.700
The venue I thought this may work at is with
casual Fridays at the office then drinks afterwards.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.920
I'd probably wear them with a black dress
shirt, no tie, and dress shoes.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.009
I'm looking for this look to flare up the
ordinary.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.039
Let me know what you think.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.970
Best regards, Alex."

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.359
Well, Alex, it's a great question, something
you don't normally see on dress slacks, the

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:25.359
J pockets.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.619
So most of the time, you're going to see either
the straight or the slanted pocket.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.249
So if you're wearing dress slacks right now,
go ahead and take a look at them and you'll

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.750
find that some of them are straight up and
down and vertical.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.270
Other times, they've got a little bit of a
slant to it, so it makes it a little bit easier

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.310
for the hands to fit in there.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.330
The advantage of these pockets is they're
very easy to manufacture.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.119
They're just very simple to make in this industry's
standards and they work.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.249
I like the slanted one.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:02.499
The problem with the vertical pocket and why
I oftentimes avoid it with a lot of my clients

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:07.569
is if you like to wear your trousers a bit
close, a little bit closer there on the hips,

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.110
they can occasionally flare out if your trousers
are too tight.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.570
The vertical helps to offset that and that
vertical can range -- you can see it's slanted

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.880
over anywhere from just a few degrees to 20,
30, or 40 degrees.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.830
Now, once you start going horizontal on the
pocket, all of a sudden, we are talking about

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.580
the J or commonly referred to as the Western
Pocket, and we see this on jeans.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.170
Now, the reason this pocket is there is there
are a number of reasons, but most of all,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.000
because you can wear those trousers much closer
to the body and the pockets are not going

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to flare out.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.650
Sometimes we'll call them elephant ears and
you've seen it before.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.220
When somebody's wearing a pair of trousers
that's a little bit too tight and the pockets

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.690
are just pointing out, kind of like ears if
you look at the person from behind, so the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.030
J pocket eliminates that.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.200
In addition, the J pocket is I think a bit
more secure.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.661
So if you like to put money in your front
pockets or a change, the J pocket, if you

00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:15.870
ever get the inclination to jump up on a bar
and do a flip around or something like that,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.950
the J pocket does a good job of keeping everything
in your pockets secure versus the other pockets,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.550
you'll have things fall out occasionally,
so that's another advantage.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.600
Now, why wouldn't we do this all the time?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.070
Again, they're less common and they're a little
bit more expensive to manufacture.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.210
I think there's something in the manufacturing
process.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.000
Literally, they actually had to turn the machines
a different way and little things like that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.550
actually cost a bit of extra money, especially
when you're making thousands and thousands

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.690
of pairs.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.650
On custom clothing, I make this for my clients
all the times.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.680
If someone usually asks for it, I don't just
point them in that direction all the way because

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.040
it is also a bit more casual.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.930
Because it's associated with denim and with
jeans, it is more casual, but for this gentleman,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.890
tall, skinny, it's going to be a great look.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.680
In addition, he's not wearing it with a jacket.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.950
The point about it being casual is kind of
moot because if you think about it, the only

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.610
way someone's going to be able to see these
is if you are wearing the trousers without

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.610
a jacket.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.920
In that case, you're going for a casual look.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920
Hopefully this helps.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.270
I would recommend that you go ahead and try
this especially if he's having these trousers

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.310
professionally made.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.730
The only thing I would recommend is just you
want to make sure that you get a close fit.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.130
I think J pockets, if they're on trousers
that fit too loose, they start to sag a little

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.550
bit in the front, so you want to go again
for a closer fit.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.710
Also, no pleats with J pockets, so if you
start to introduce pleats, you cannot have

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.680
a J pocket and no cuff at the bottom.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680
Okay.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680
That's been it.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.420
I will see you guys in the comments.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.710
