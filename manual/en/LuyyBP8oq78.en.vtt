00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.810
The whole point of video games is to do things
you can't do in real life.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.509
To go on adventures, to save the princess,
to travel to these crazy fantasy worlds of

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.059
monsters and robots and...I guess zombies,
sometimes.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.690
But you know, games get so far from reality,
it's refreshing to play one that...appreciates

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.890
what's real, you know?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.360
No lasers, no aliens...just air.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.840
And water.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.060
And life...real life.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:01:03.530
Sometimes, nothing's more interesting than
reality.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.270
Of course, that's not to say Storm is a realistic
game.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.640
Conjuring the wind and creating a thunderstorm
doesn't really qualify.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.060
But it is based in reality.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.950
This is a simplification of the processes
we take for granted, the things we tend to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.950
ignore.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.270
We may not have dragons, but...the world is
a pretty cool place.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.799
A game like this reminds you of that, as well
as providing a relaxing contrast to what you

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:37.249
were probably playing before.

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.990
Storm is a puzzle game, based on physics...and
nature.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.100
Its levels are little more than rocks and
trees.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.259
Some grass, here and there.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.909
As well as a few patches of dirt.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.890
And it's basically a nature simulator.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.100
You have to get the seeds from full-grown
trees to those bare patches of Earth.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.119
Once the seeds are planted, on to the next
level.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.939
It's like Mother Earthbound.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.229
Obviously, the game centers on...moving the
seeds.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.689
You can't actually touch them, so...your only
option is to use the elements.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.010
Create a wind gust, cause a downpour, whatever
it takes to get the seed from tree to soil.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:29.810
It starts easy enough, but as the seasons
change...the Storm gets unexpectedly complex.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.810
So it works like this.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.270
You start with one seed-bearing tree and limited
elements.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.380
Generally, there's no way you're getting that
seed to the dirt without getting more elements,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.160
which are scattered around the stage.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.430
There are wind orbs, rain orbs, lightning
orbs...and you'll need all of them to move

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.430
the seeds.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.270
See, each element can essentially be powered
up.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.650
If you collect three rain orbs, for example,
you can summon rain three times in the same

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.270
spot...which can cause far more serious flooding.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.170
Two lighting bolts in succession can cause
rock to crumble...so the more orbs you have,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.510
the greater the nature you can unleash.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:19.360
I love almost everything about this game,
but specifically its tone.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.990
It's really just an aesthetic treat.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.130
It looks beautiful, the music is fantastic...there's
a sense of creation, you know?

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.810
A kind of prehistory.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.820
There's no animals, certainly no people...just
Earth, in all its stunning glory, sharing

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.900
the stage with life.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.770
And it makes for a beautiful puzzle game.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.080
Of course, like life itself, Storm is far
from perfect.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.890
Some of the puzzles get a little frustrating
when...they become less about strategy than

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.070
performance.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.760
So you might have the right idea, but you
still have to do it.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.890
Eventually, timing becomes almost as important
as puzzle solving.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.510
Hit the right jump, destroy the right obstacle,
Storm requires both planning and execution.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.580
And sometimes, that execution leaves just
a bit to be desired.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.760
Fortunately, that's more like the lone cloud,
in an otherwise sunny sky.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.770
Storm is an absolutely gorgeous game, as well
as a genuinely clever puzzler.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.320
And you know, as much as we look to fiction
to define our gaming experiences, there's

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.260
something so brilliant about—for once—just
looking outside.
