00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.010
Hi welcome back to Expert Village I'm Pete
Perata and today we are learning how to shuffle

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.690
cards. Now I just talk about in the last few
segments about the riffle shuffle we are going

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.830
to move on to a totally different shuffle.
The Hindu shuffle. Let's get into that the

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.480
Hindu shuffle is one of the easiest shuffle
to do while not a riffle shuffle the Hindu

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.411
shuffle can be done off of the table. In order
to do a Hindu shuffle grab the pack in the

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:37.449
following grip. I have my two middle fingers
on the outside lower portion of the outer

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:46.010
edge of the deck and my thumb along the inside.
My pinkie is free. Once I have the deck in

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.010
that position I could then take my left hand
and strip a packet off of the deck by lifting

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.100
up and pulling out. My thumb on my right hand
could also pull down the main stock of the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.550
deck to help it cut easier. So I reach over,
take the top portion with the left hand, lift

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.170
up with my thumb my left thumb as I pull down
with my right thumb. Split the pack off and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.830
carry it away. I then could leave/take that
portion and simply let it drop onto the remaining

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.200
cards in my left hand. If the cards start
getting a little squiggly on you, you could

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.500
always use a the pack on your right hand to
square them up so they are square. This allows

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:46.920
you to get a better cut and drop on the remaining
cards coming from the right hand. Once you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.690
could get down lifting packets off of the
deck and collecting them on your right hand

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.820
you could speed the deck up and this forms
more of a shuffle.
