00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.560
I'm Helen Bradley, welcome to this
video tutorial on painting with the art

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.509
history brush in Photoshop.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.709
Before you start painting in Photoshop I
suggest you open and crop your image and

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.829
then fix any problems with it.

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.169
I wanted to remove the no parking sign,
recolor the jacket thrown across the

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.439
horse's saddle

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.230
and also recolor the gentleman's shirt.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.340
The image too looked a little bit too
cold for me. It was shot in late

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.729
afternoon, and I wanted to give it an
afternoon warmer light.

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.649
So this is what the image now looks like.
It's fixed and it's ready to be turned

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.350
into a painting.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.550
Now because I've cropped this image I need
to save it, close it and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.890
reopen it before I can use the art
history brush.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.520
Now this is a critical step. The art
history brush will not work if you've

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.550
cropped an image and you haven't

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.360
closed it and reopened it, so it's really
important to save, close reopen your image

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.060
and then things are going to work just fine.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.200
Now to paint this image I need a couple of
copies of this fixed layer.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.010
So I'm just going to drag them onto the new icon
and then I'm going to rename them, the first

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.920
one under painting,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.740
and the second one the paint layer.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.770
As I'm not using the paint layer at this time, I'm
going to turn its visibility off,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.700
select the under painting layer and then
make sure that I have the art history

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.240
brush selected.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.260
It shares a palette position with the
history brush tool.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.020
Now I need to remove the contents of the
under painting layer. To do that I'm

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.050
going to press Ctrl or Command + A to
select the layer,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.090
Backspace or Delete to remove its
contents

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.430
and then Ctrl or Command + D to
deselect the selection.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.329
The Art History Brush won't work unless
you tell it where the source is going to be.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.619
And you're going to get the stop
symbol which is why I've let it happened because

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.329
it's invariably going to happen to you.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.930
When you see this symbol what you need to
do is to point the art history brush at

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.560
where the layer pixels were. Now the under
painting layer was the first duplicate layer

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.619
that that we created, so it's this one
here. If I click here I'll set the source

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.869
for the art history brush being this
duplicate layer. And I'm ready to go. I'll

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.399
just select a nice big brush. I'm not being
too fussy about my brushes right now,

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.599
but you will want to be a little fussier.
I'm using the square bracket key to

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.420
just enlarge the brush, and I'm just
painting in

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.200
the under painting layer.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.689
And all I'm concerned about here right
now is just getting coverage. It doesn't

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.299
matter what it looks like,

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.589
just coverage

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.529
is the important thing.

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.259
Having done the under painting I'm now
ready to do the same thing on the paint

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.810
layer.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.720
We'll select the paint layer,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.050
we'll enable its visibility so we can see
it, we're going to remove its contents

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.979
with Ctrl or Command + A to select the
layer contents,

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.379
Backspace or Delete to remove them

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.539
and then Ctrl or Command + D to
deselected the selection.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.399
We have the art history selected and
again, we're going to get this stop icon

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.580
unless we tell it where the source
data is.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.369
And this is in the second duplicate
layer,

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.369
so let's just click here.

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.539
I'm going to choose a much smaller brush this
time too. I'm going to choose a nice little

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.229
soft brush.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:19.100
And if it's not small enough, again I'm
going to use the square bracket keys

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.510
to make it smaller or larger as I
need to. And as you can see I'm just

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.690
shrinking the brush as I'm painting.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.969
And the smaller I make the brush

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.319
the more detail I'm getting in my
painting.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.119
And all I need to do is to just continue
to paint over the image.

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:38.579
And the more I paint

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.930
the more detail I'm going to see.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.029
Now this could be a process that might
take you half an hour or an hour on a

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:51.279
particular image. I'm trying to do it in
a very, very short period of time.

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.149
I'm just going to shrink my brush

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:57.349
right down nice and small so that we can
see a bit of detail coming through.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.849
You want to compromise with your brush
size between

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.079
the detail and the painterly effect. So
too small a brush will give you too

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.040
much detail so it's going to start
looking like a photograph again,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.009
too big a brush won't give you enough
detail.

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:16.159
And you can use multiple paint layers if
you want to, just make extra duplicate

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.560
layers.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.270
Do exactly the same as we did for
deleting the layer contents and then

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.540
setting the source for the art history
brush and then paint over that

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.509
layer.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.039
You might use different brushes on
different layers to get different amounts

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.080
of texture

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.080
in the important focal part of your image
and in the background areas.

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.889
But you can see with just a few minutes
of work what we've achieved is something

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.629
that looks a lot more painterly than a
photograph and we've done it using the

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:03.289
art history brush in Photoshop.

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.849
