00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
hello everybody

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.150
just a quick update on the solo

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.080
performance chip or in my case the fuel

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.040
economy chip i put on about 50 miles so

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570
far i am noticing an increase in pickup

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.150
power and torque especially when towing

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.210
a trailer has I still haven't put on

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.449
enough miles yet completely you know

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.789
reset the ec and I reset the ECU but for

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.210
the easier to completely get adjusted or

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.969
however that works with these things one

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.520
thing I am noticing though is if you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.590
remember one of my last videos i told

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.469
you i haven't been below point four

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.289
gallons per hour at idle a couple years

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.750
now especially since my truck is age too

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.280
getting the crap beaten out of it

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.960
royally as you can see right now i'm at

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.690
point three nine gallons per hour 2.4

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.230
the other day I was advertised a point

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.960
for three 2.45 somewhere between their

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.920
truck still running nice and smooth

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.810
idling right word family dies very happy

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.689
so far just with my and I know it's just

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.630
a little drop in the bucket but does add

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.210
up especially during the winter it once

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.560
we come to the wintertime when I wear

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.180
leave the truck idles i'm loading up and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.150
unloading so that we keep the cabinets

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.390
and warm in here so that's it for this

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.369
one not like i said about being roughly

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.799
50 miles so far we doing a service

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.900
called probably tomorrow night I'll take

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.659
me another 60 60 or 70 miles round trip

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.939
that should push me over the line for

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.840
the ECU and once i get on that freeway

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.530
off actually see what kind of mileage

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.960
