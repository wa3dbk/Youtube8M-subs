00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Is J Park a free soul?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Completely! He can be listed in Korea's top 10 free soul singer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000
He is somewhat very mannered and unexpectedly very polite.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
He doesn't do make ups.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I think I am free soul compared to ordinary Korean celebrities.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Do you know Loco?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Did you drink? Really? Have fun!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you know Loco? You don't know? All right.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Wow he is Loco who is number one on the music chart!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hook the phone! He is Loco!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Do you want Loco's autograph?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Wow he is Loco!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Crazy guy.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Dorks!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I just acted that way for our '4 Gaji Show' and also to publicize Loco.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Do you act the same when there is no camera?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It depends on my condition. I behave like that often.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Even today on my way to studio while I was driving in the back street when people notice me and yells 'It's J Park! He is so cute!' I reply them back 'Do you want to be my girl friend?'

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Or when they say 'Isn't he J Park?' I say 'No I am G-Dragon'

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I am me. It's very hard to pretend not being me. I feel very awkward and uncomfortable. So I always behave naturally. I am not good at reading other people's faces and wearing fake smiles. Also I hate doing those behaviors.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We have only one life but if I can't show the real part of my self during the time I am working as celebrity I must feel very constrained. I don't want to live like that so I try to behave normally.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.000
When we gather up to film SNL episode, that is Jaebeom's spot.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
When we are waiting to film our episode he always lies down on that floor over there. He looks like a neighborhood boy.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
There are many chairs left but he sits on the floor.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000
When I am in the toilet doing my things sometimes people ask me to take a picture of me. I feel very uncomfortable.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I do the things I must do. But with a very bad look.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I look upset. Like this, 'Let's take photos.'
0:04:41.000,1193:02:47.295
What do you do when you encounter things that you don't want to do?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I wish he knows how to make fake expressions. There are so many people who think bad of him because he is too frank.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Since he does not know how to make fake faces, I think he must have hard times when he first came to Korea. Koreans are used to keep up appearances.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Free soul is viewed as a person with a rude foreign mind in Korea.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But once you get close to him, you know his real personality and change the misconception you had toward him.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Isn't this too strong tasting foods?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
What is strong tasting food?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Eating too salty. Putting too much ketchup, mustard,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Me?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Yes!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
No~

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Who is Ptree?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
My dog.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Can he appear in the program?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
He died this morning.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Really? Don't lie to me.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I am serious.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I went to the hospital with my dog yesterday but he died this morning.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You think I am joking?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Yes. You talk as if nothing happened.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Don't you think my eyes are a bit swollen with tear?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Oh that's why he had swollen eyes. I didn't know that and teased him that you have swollen face.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I thought so too.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I feel sorry that I teased him.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I didn't know until he told me a while ago.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I just thought that he didn't have enough sleep so he had a swollen face. I feel so sorry.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I am sorry.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.000
P-tree was my family. I raised him since I was in high school. It has been 11 years already.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Even Ptree's daddy dog and grandpa dog are alive. I never thought P-tree would die first. It was hard for me to accept his death for few days. So I try not to think of him and focused more on making songs.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Whenever I returned home P-tree would greet me. But now there was no one waiting for me when I go home.
