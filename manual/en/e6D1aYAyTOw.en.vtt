Hi, the next step we are going to be doing
is the application of the artificial tip.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.051
Items that we are going to be needing, well
most of you would have a real finger but I

00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:19.500
have a artificial finger today for demonstration
only. We are going to need a file, I have

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.510
a artificial tip, got resin, and I have my
extender for my resin. Getting started, what

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.220
you are going to do you are going to take
your finger, my artificial finger and what

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.820
you want to do anytime you are filing on the
natural nail. The natural nail is your real

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.540
nail you want to take the end of your file,
you want to buff it really gently just go

00:00:48.540 --> 00:01:01.040
over top of that nail. You just want to ruff
it up a little bit so that the resin would

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:10.210
adhere to the nail when you apply the tip.
If you can see that. Oaky, we roughed up the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:19.440
natural nail okay what we are going to do
is I'm going to take the resin and apply the

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:29.070
extender at the end, I'm going to take the
tip and whenever you are holding the resin

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.840
you want to make sure you hold it straight
across and you can kind of see it go down

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:44.050
inside. You just want to get a little dot,
you see that little dot right there. You want

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.770
to take that and apply it right inside of
the wall of that tip and just kind of spread

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:59.070
it around just like that. Okay and when you
raise this up you want to make sure you squeeze

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.260
that so you can get any air out of your resin
cause if not it would explode and come back

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:14.770
up. I'm going to take this and with a rocking
motion you want to apply that tip directly

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:27.650
onto the natural nail going to side to side
just like that. You want to hold it for just

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:40.030
for a few seconds to make sure that it adheres
before you let go of it and that is the step

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.380
to how to apply the artificial tip.
