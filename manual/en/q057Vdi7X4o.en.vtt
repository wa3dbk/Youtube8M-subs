00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.470
Today I’m going to show you how to cut back
the paper backing. As you can see with a side

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.790
view of the sheet rock, you have to take off
this layer of backing on both the placement

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.090
piece that you’re going to inset in the
wall and what exists on the wall itself. &lt;P&gt;

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.280
And what you want to do is go back, probably,
about an inch and a half on each side of the

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:42.770
hole. Just with a box cutter, make a few cuts.
You’ll be able to tell when you cut through

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.499
the paper. And you just get a putty knife,
insert it between the sheet rock and the paper,

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:57.300
and it should just peel right off, just like
that. And make sure that you get at least

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:15.650
half of the paper off.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:33.880
And it doesn’t have to be square, because
you’re going to tape a float over it. &lt;P&gt;

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:51.200
And once you get all done, make sure you get
all the little loose ends off. And you’ve

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.030
got to do the same thing on the little patch
part that you’ve already measured and cut

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.060
that will inset just like that. Actually,
on this one, you’re not going to have it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.439
because it’s going to inset some to where
there’s a lip. But you should do the same

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.689
on the inside piece, too.
