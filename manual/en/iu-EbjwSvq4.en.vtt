00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.320
Ahh... You've found yourself a hunter...

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:23.180
Hello, good hunter. I am a doll, here in this dream to look after you. Honorable hunter, pursue the echoes of blood, and I will channel them into your strength.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:32.220
You will hunt beasts... and I will be here for you, to embolden your sickly spirit.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:42.610
Very well... Let the echoes become your strenght. Let me stand close. Now, shut your eyes...

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.670
Farewell, good hunter. May you find your worth
in the waking world.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.670
Welcome home, good hunter. What is it you
desire?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:05.980
Did you speak with Gehrman? He was a hunter long, long ago, but now serves only to advise them.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:17.980
He is obscure, unseen in the dreaming world. Still, he stays here, in this dream... ... such is his purpose...

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:36.920
Ahh, the little ones, inhabitants of the dream... They find hunters like yourself, worship ,and serve them. Speak words, they do not, but still, aren't they sweet?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:49.960
Over time, countless hunters have visited 
this dream. The graves here stand in their memory. It all seems so long ago now...

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:05.360
Hunters have told me about the church. About the gods, and their love. But... do the gods love their creations? I am a doll, created by you humans.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:16.000
Would you ever think to love me? Of course... I do love you. Isn't that how you've made me?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.060
Good hunter... Your presence somehow soothes... I sense the ancient echoes, they course your veins...

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:09.900
Ah! Ahh... Welcome home, good hunter. I must have drifted off... What is it you desire?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:26.480
What... what is this? I-I can't remember, not a thing, only... I feel... A yearning... Something I've never felt before...

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:37.680
What's happening to me? Ahh... Tell me hunter, could this be joy? Ahh...

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:53.080
Good hunter, you have come... Dawn will soon break... This night, and this dream, wil lend. Gehrman awaits you, at the foot of the great tree.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.940
Gehrman awaits you, at the foot of the great tree. Go on, good hunter...

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:08.840
Farewell, good hunter. May you find your worth in the waking world.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.000
And so, the hunt begins again...

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.700
Are you cold? Heh heh... Oh, good hunter...

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:34.640
O Flora, of the moon, of the dream. O little
ones, O fleeting will of the ancients...

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:46.040
Let the hunter be safe, let him find comfort.
Let the hunter be safe, let her find comfort.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.280
And let this dream, his captor... foretell
a pleasant awakening...

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.800
And let this dream, her captor... foretell a pleasant awakening...
[...be, one day, a fond, distant memory...]
