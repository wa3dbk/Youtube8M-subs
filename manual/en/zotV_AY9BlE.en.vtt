Hey everyone, I'm Chef Jason Hill and right now I have my pellet grill fired up and I'm going to do my smoked bacon wrapped chicken hot wings on there. So let me show you how I do this.  

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:27.520
Ok I've got six wings here. You can definitely do more if you've got a whole bunch of people coming over and I like to dust them a little with Bad Byron's Butt Rub. It's pretty expensive so if you don't have it, you don't want to spend the money, I have a clone recipe on my website.  

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.680
And this stuff is pretty strong, so I don't put a whole bunch of this on each one. Just a little bit.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.620
And give it a little turn. Flip them over and get the other side.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.100
This is really a good seasoning though. It's one of my favorites.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.260
Use it on anything from chicken, pork, beef. I use it a lot when I'm doing my smoking.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.740
All right. So now we're going to wrap the chicken wings with bacon.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:08.016
And I like to not let the bacon overpower the chicken, so I don't do a whole slice. Just a half.

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:09.722
Turn your wing.

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:11.322
Wrap that bacon around that wing.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.540
Uh oh. It came unwrapped! That OK. We can save it!

00:01:17.098 --> 00:01:18.098
There we go!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.240
All right, my pellet grill's been preheating, so before I continue, I'm going to top off my pellet box.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.280
I set this at 200 F right now because I have time to let these smoke for about 2-3 hours.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.960
If you don't have a smoker or pellet grill, you can do these in the oven on low, and they'll come out good. But not quite as good as they will on the smoker.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.980
I just set them directly on the grill. I find that on my Green Mountain Pellet Grill, the right side tends to be a little bit hotter.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.600
So I'm going to get these bigger guys on this end.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.740
Put this little one over here.

00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:05.814
Just try to get them to cook evenly.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.740
OK. 200 degrees. Close the lid, and we'll come back and check them in a couple hours.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.700
Nice, slow smoked cooking!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.360
All right, no endorsements here, but for this recipe, I've tried some other sauces and I really prefer the Tabasco Buffalo for the hot wing sauce.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.420
And we're going to be pulling those wings off in about 20 minutes, so let's get our sauce made.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.080
First I'm going to turn my burner to a medium low because I don't want this butter to burn. We just want it to melt down.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.140
And I'm doing 1/3 cup.

00:02:44.524 --> 00:02:46.764
And we'll just start whisking around and get it melted.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:03:01.400
All right. Our butter is completely melted. Now we're going to pour in 1/2 cup of the hot sauce and just whisk that together really well.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.320
Turn it on low and just let that simmer a little bit. And that's it. That's basically it, guys!

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.060
That's our hot wing sauce for our smoked bacon wrapped chicken wings.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.820
All right everybody. They are ready.

00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:21.457
Come check these out!

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:31.700
They are done! Perfectly smoked bacon wrapped wings! Now they're ready for the bath in the sauce!

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.620
All right. Let's grab the sauce.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.560
You can do them one at a time or all at once.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.420
I like to let these soak in here for a good 5-10 minutes before removing them to eat.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.100
Just let em sit in there.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960
Coat well.

00:03:57.454 --> 00:04:02.714
If you make these, you are going to be very popular with your friends and family.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.760
Ok, now it's time for our favorite part. Let's eat!

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.920
They're definitely worth the wait. They've been on that smoker for a couple hours.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:12.814
Here we go!

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.280
Are you kidding me?

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.380
Mmmm. Delicious!

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.400
Like I said earlier, if you don't have a smoker, you can do this in your oven. You're not going to have that same element of flavor, but

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.960
it will be close enough and I think you'll be glad you tried these! Thanks for Tubing in!

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.140
Mmmmm!
