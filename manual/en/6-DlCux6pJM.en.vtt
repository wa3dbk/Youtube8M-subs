00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.936
The President: On behalf of
Michelle and myself,

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.472
welcome to the White House.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:12.746
This city, this house, has
welcomed foreign envoys

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:16.049
and leaders for more
than two centuries.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.352
But never before have
we hosted a dinner

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:24.190
at the White House like this,
with so many Presidents,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.859
so many Prime
Ministers all at once.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.062
(applause)

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.967
So we are grateful for
all the leaders who

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.468
are in attendance.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.604
We are grateful to the spouses.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.541
I think the men will agree
that the women outshine

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:46.379
us tonight in the beautiful
colors of Africa.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.816
Tonight we are making
history, and it's an honor

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.618
to have all of you here.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:55.255
And I stand before you as the
President of the United States

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.824
and a proud American.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:02.195
I also stand before you as
the son of a man from Africa.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:09.035
(applause)

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.071
The blood of Africa
runs through our family.

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.341
And so for us, the bonds
between our countries,

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.544
our continents, are
deeply personal.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.580
We're grateful for
the ties of family.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.385
Of all the incredible moments
of our trips to Africa,

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.488
one of the most memorable was
being able to bring Michelle,

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:35.195
and later our little girls, to
my father's hometown in Kenya,

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.164
where we were embraced
by so many relatives.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:43.803
We've walked the steps
of a painful past --

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:49.075
in Ghana, at Cape Coast
Castle; in Senegal,

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:52.645
at GorÃ©e Island -- standing
with our daughters

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.915
in those doors of no return
through which so many

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:59.486
Africans passed in chains.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:03.656
We'll never forget bringing our
daughters to Robben Island,

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:08.695
to the cell from which Madiba
showed the unconquerable

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:12.832
strength and dignity
of an African heart.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:18.071
We've been inspired by
Africans -- ordinary Africans

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.007
doing extraordinary things.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:26.613
Farmers boosting their yields,
health workers saving lives from

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:31.384
HIV/AIDS, advocates standing
up for justice and the rule

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:35.321
of law, courageous women
asserting their rights,

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:41.060
entrepreneurs creating jobs,
African peacekeepers risking

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.062
their lives to
save the innocent.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:48.701
And both of us stand in
awe of the extraordinary

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:52.338
young Africans that we've
met, not only across Africa,

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:56.109
but most recently here in
Washington just last week when

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.679
we hosted our Mandela
Washington Fellows from

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.814
many of your countries.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:05.818
And those young people show
the world that Africa has

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.222
the talent and the drive
to forge a new future.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.693
These are the tides of history,
and the ties of family,

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:17.630
that bring us
together this week.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.035
These are the citizens who look
to us to build a future worthy

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:26.472
of their dreams -- especially
those who dream of giving

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.909
their children a future
without war or injustice,

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.247
without poverty or disease.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:36.249
They are in our prayers tonight.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:41.087
And also with us are the words
of a song -- "New Africa" --

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.356
that have inspired so many
across the continent,

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:48.995
and that Michelle and I first
heard last year in Senegal:

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:53.566
Come together, New
Africa work together

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.970
Keep on working, for Africa.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.577
And so I propose a toast to
the New Africa -- the Africa

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.981
that is rising and so full
of promise -- and to our

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:13.052
shared task to keep on working
for the peace and prosperity

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:17.657
and justice that all our
people seek and that all our

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:20.493
people so richly deserve.

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:22.095
Cheers.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.365
Enjoy your dinner, everybody.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.399
(applause)
