00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.290
bayad animal control officer shot a
litter of kittens kittens infront of

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.720
screaming kids

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.549
is this the type of thing animal control
officers should be doing

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.399
if you do you think is this is what they
should be done about i mean if if

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.700
there's like a rabid animals in front of
kids that are going crazy

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.240
beyond the reality of this is uh... i
think all so to resell landon who is the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.950
ohio and pc executive director told the
sun news that

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.670
a homeowner called for help called the
police for help because of this uh...

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.529
litter of kittens that showed out

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.879
infront of some children right and the
kittens were clearly dated no was going

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.340
on they say hey what let's call animal
control makes perfect sense

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.150
so but this is all according to the ohio
s pc executive director

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.050
the officers showed up and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.360
who could beat bill person who called
assumed that the officer would be like

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.180
trapping the kittens in taking them to a
shelter and if they need to be humanely

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.820
euthanize because they're not adopted

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.190
it would be done in a proper way it's
not just going to be a good you-know-who

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.510
a firing squad essentially

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.949
instead the officers accused of going to
be struck

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.660
getting a gun which the homeowner
assumed was just a tranquilizer gun

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.210
and walking to the back of the house and
just starting to shoot and kill

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.080
eight and week-old kitten

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.870
kids were up stairs in the window they
start screaming and crying because

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.790
they're looking down at what the police
officer is doing

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.650
and uh... did that that's that's what
happened now the police department is

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.959
not denying it they're saying that is
what happened

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.189
and this was the proper thing northridge
bill police department chief mike

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.130
freeman

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.720
put out a statement defending the police
officer a officer accord t

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.500
who the ohio as pc eight has demanded be
fired and charged with animal abuse and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.659
the statement from the police is they
catch for located within a wood pile and

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.740
euthanized the cats were removed from
the wood pile and taken from the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.360
residence he said that according to
actions were appropriate

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.090
and that no disciplinary measures for
the incident are going to be imposed

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.310
he did nothing wrong

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.110
he shot kittens with a gun rather than
taking them to a shelter and he did

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.850
nothing wrong with you know it right in
front of him and he did it right in

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.300
front of children shot kittens in front
of children and that sounds like he

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.969
didn't even give anyone any warning that
he def

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.510
monies firearm offer it there

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.989
i mean the the kittens really didn't do
anything anything wrong right anyone

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.580
violent cats they didn't have to be born

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.600
they were carrying skittles they didn't
have a least he they weren't wearing

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.240
hoodies certainly nothing that would
warrant just being shot i mean i don't

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.779
even like capt

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.399
and i would be horrified

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.779
i mean i can only assume that this is a
person who

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:37.560
gets off

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.149
on killing

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.469
animals there are people like that and
if you are one of those people

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.379
by this is a job that you would try to
get

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.769
if the average

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.299
individual shot ten kittens in their
backyard wouldn't he be facing a number

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.699
of mtv of animal cruelty charges unless
you could really say hey listen these

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:59.529
kittens were all suffering they were all
about to die because a piano fell on

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.809
them uh... there and he would be illegal
it would be a legal but yet the cop did

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.979
nothing wrong something about the
stories thinks that i have there is no

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.819
