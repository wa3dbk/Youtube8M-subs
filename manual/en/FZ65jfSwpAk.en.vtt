00:00:00.815 --> 00:00:04.087
l worried about you last night.
You shouldn't have run off that way.

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:07.391
Well, l--
l suddenly felt such a fool.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:09.692
l wanted to drive you home.
Are you all right?

00:00:09.757 --> 00:00:13.064
Oh, yes. Yes, l'm fine.
No aftereffects.

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:16.902
But as l remember now,
the water was cold, wasn't it?

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:20.505
- It sure was.
- What a terrible thing for me to do.

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:22.739
You were so kind.

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:27.080
lt's a, a formal thank-you note
and a great big apology.

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:30.282
- Well, you've nothing to apologize for.
- Yes, l do.

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:33.118
The whole thing must have been
so embarrassing for you.

00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:35.754
Not at all.
l enjoyed--

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.957
Talking to you.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.027
Well, l enioyed
talking to you.

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:48.366
Well, l'll get my mail.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.104
Would you like to have
a cup of coffee?

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:54.607
No. No, thank you.

00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:00.281
Oh, l couldn't mail it. l didn't know
your address, but l had a landmark.

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:03.250
l remembered Coit Tower.
It led me straight to you.

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:05.785
That's the first time
l've been grateful for Coit Tower.

00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:13.293
- l hope we will too.
- What?

00:01:13.358 --> 00:01:16.364
- Meet again sometime.
- We have.

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:21.635
Good-bye.

00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:37.985
Where are you going?

00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:40.422
Oh, l don't know.

00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:42.490
- Shopping?
- No.

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:45.360
Well, anywhere in particular?

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.696
No. l iust thought
that l'd wander.

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.766
Oh. That's what
l was going to do.

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:53.870
Oh, yes, that's right.
l forgot.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:56.539
lt's your occupation, isn't it?

00:01:56.603 --> 00:01:59.209
Well, don't you think
it's kind of a waste for the two of us--

00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:01.310
- To wander separately?
- Uh-huh.

00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:03.646
Ah, but only one is a wanderer.

00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:05.982
Two together are always
going somewhere.

00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:09.219
No, l don't think
that's necessarily true.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:13.358
- You left your door open.
- Be right back.
