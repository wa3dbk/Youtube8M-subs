&gt;&gt; Hilah: Hey dudes!

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.749
I am Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I am
going to show you how to make homemade corn

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:04.749
tortillas.

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:05.749
I have gotten a lot of request for these.

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.630
I showed y’all how to make wheat flour tortillas
a while back whenever we released the breakfast

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.980
taco book, and while corn tortillas are not
really traditional on Austin breakfast tacos,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.510
sometimes you will see them, especially who
are gluten intolerant, and if you’ve never

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.260
had a homemade corn tortilla, you are seriously
in for a treat.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.260
There are so much better.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.920
They are infinitely better than anything that
you can buy at a store, and they are super-easy.

[Homemade Corn Tortilla Recipe]

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:37.290
&gt;&gt; Hilah: You only need three ingredients
for these, one of these might be kind of hard

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.880
to find wherever you live, but saltwater and
then the masa flour, masa harina, this made

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.850
by soaking dried corn in a solution of lime
water, and that’s not, I don’t mean the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.850
fruit.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.239
It’s calcium hydroxide which is a really
strong alkalizing agent, and it sloughs off

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.510
the outer hull of the corn, and then that
interior, meaty part is ground up to make

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.341
the masa dough, and sometimes you can find
that already made, sort of like a big, you

00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:08.930
know, probably like a two pound bag of sort
of a play dough looking substance.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.380
When that is dried and then sort of like repulverized,
then you end up with this, so it’s basically

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.070
a flour that’s already been cooked if that
makes sense.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.780
It’s been cooked by the lime.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.290
That’s what we’re going to use today.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.260
If you can find the already prepared masa
dough, you can use that.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.290
I have got a about a cup here.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.300
This is just some salt.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.830
I like to weigh masa because it can absorb
water from the humidity in the air and stuff,

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.330
and that will affect how much water you need
to add, so for about four ounces of masa which

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.070
is 28 times 4 grams which is 112, I don’t
know, we’re probably going to probably use

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.090
about 2/3 of a cup of warm water, and this
is just warm to the touch, but I like to start

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.299
out with just a little bit at first, maybe
half a cup and start mixing it up, and you’ll

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.680
get the hang of this.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.630
You’ll start to just sort of know, it’s
like pie crust where you just have to do it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.470
a few times, and then you’ll know what the
right consistency is, but it’s really easy

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.470
to work with.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.000
Corn is naturally gluten-free, so this is
a great thing for people that have gluten

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.150
sensitivities.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.300
If you actually had full-on celiacs or something,
you’d probably want to get some kind of

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.690
like special, approved masa that hasn’t
ever touched anything that has ever touched

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.140
wheat, but for regular gluten sensitivity
I think this is probably fine.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.450
So then just kind of get your hands in there
so you can start to feel how it’s coming

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.670
together, and what we’re looking for is
something that obviously holds together into

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.370
a ball, but isn't sticky.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.629
If it starts, if it sticks when you start
to press it out, that means it’s a little

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.849
bit too wet ,and if it sticks to your hands
a lot, it’s a little bit too wet.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.959
I think I might have overdone my water, so
I am going to add a little bit more, but the

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.210
great thing is because there’s no gluten
in this, you don’t have to worry about overworking

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.349
it like you do with the pie crust.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.099
It’s never going to get tough, so you can
just play with it all day long.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.430
Just play with yourself and your masa dough
all day.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.440
Okay.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.800
See it holds together, but it’s not sticking
to my hands.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.900
A lot of traditional Mexican cooks will actually
pat them out by hand, but that takes probably

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.709
a good decade of practice, and I am not that
old, just kidding I totally am, but I have

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.400
a tortilla press and I am going to use that.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.850
Okay, so this is a metal tortilla press.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.489
This is actually a pretty bad designed one
because it doesn't open all the way, and then

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.129
it can very easily fall shut and slam your
finger which has happened to me only once

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.540
I am happy to say, but it hurt like the dickens.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.849
So, you can use this.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.780
You can use one that’s made out of wood,
whatever you can find, and I am going to line

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.989
it with some Saran Wrap, like so, can you
see that?

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.590
And then you just want to pinch off balls
of dough about the size of a golf ball which

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.321
will give you a four to five inch sized tortilla
which is kind of small.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.520
It’s definitely smaller than the ones that
you get in the store, but it’s a good size

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.080
for little tacos and stuff it’s fine.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.160
So put your little ball down there, and close
that, and this where your little power lever.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.489
It’s a very simple machine, and just squish
it.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.810
you can make them as thick or thin as you
want, but this seems good to me, and see if

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.759
it had stuck to the plastic, I would just
pull it off and put it back in here and add

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.909
a little bit more of the dry masa, but it
didn't stick, so that means we’re looking

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:34.879
good, and I’ve got my hot skillet over here,
and I am just going to throw it right in the

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:39.849
center, no oil, no grease, nothing like that,
and just let it cook for, I don't know a minute

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.909
or so, and then we’ll flip it and let it
cook another 30 seconds.

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:50.280
If you don’t have a press, you can totally
do it without one, and without using your

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.610
pans manually because gross right!

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.059
I hate doing stuff with my hands.

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:01.360
We just still want to use the plastic, make
your little ball.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.770
Fold it over like so, and then get a pot.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.369
I know you got one of these.

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:16.169
Just sort of mash it out evenly, ahh, here
we go.

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.370
It’s kind of a baby one.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.509
This one will be for banjo.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.610
All right, turning back over here.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.490
Pay attention, so it’s starting to bubble
up a little bit, and the edges start to like

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.740
curl up, and these are traditionally done
on more like a griddle, like a comal flat

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.720
thing, but I don’t actually have one of
those, so I use a cast-iron skillet, but I

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.105
use that for everything, so I guess that’s
not really very special.

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:41.909
All right, see this one is starting to puff
up a little bit?

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.229
It’s totally okay.

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.629
It’s a little inflato, that’s all right,
and then I’ve got my little tortilla warmer

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:54.919
here which you can buy these, or if you want
to just wrap them up in a clean tea towel,

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.580
that’s totally fine too.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.050
Keep them wrapped up in there, and once you
have, you know, your 12 tortillas, or your

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.029
8 tortillas made or whatever, then you can
wrap that whole deal in foil and put it in

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:10.830
the oven at like 150, 200 Fahrenheit, and
just they’ll stay warm, and fresh, and delicious

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.419
in there for quite a while.

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.909
There we go.

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:16.909
Okay!

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:17.909
Tortillas are done.

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.830
I forgot to mention that you should still
wrap them in a cloth just to absorb any condensation

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.080
and keep them from getting soggy, but anyway,
I will just show you how awesome and tender

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.539
and pliable these are compared to something
you might buy at the store, so I am like stretching

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:32.539
it.

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.550
It’s like an elastic, rubber band almost
here.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.881
So of course you can make a taco, or you could
spread it with butter and sprinkle it with

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:42.699
some salt, or you could just put a little
bit of hot sauce on it like I am about to

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.869
do, and enjoy the wonderful, natural corny
flavor.

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:50.189
Mmmmm hmmm.

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.360
It’s a great snack!

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.430
It’s like you’re chewing something because
it’s actually like real foot.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.740
All right, well thank you for watching.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.009
If you have any questions about the recipe,
or any comments about how I screwed it all

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:06.110
up, and I should just stick to being a white
person, please leave them below and I will

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.969
respond as cheerfully as possible.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.509
Thanks again, and have a wonderful week.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:09.830
Bye bye!
