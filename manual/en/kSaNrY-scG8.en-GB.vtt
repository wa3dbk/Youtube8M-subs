00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.780
Not long after this Hanuman Arjuna encounter...

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.180
It is now the turn of Bheemasena,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.460
Who enters the same forest...

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.740
where Hanuman is engrossed in Rama Jabam.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.580
He is in search of celestial flowers sought by Dhraupati.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.420
Hey oldie...

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.460
Remove your nasty extension out of my path.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.400
Hey creature, are you deaf?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.220
Remove your god damn thing from my path.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.320
I have work to do.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.320
Welcome, Vaayuputra!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.680
You are my dear younger brother.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.700
It is time to play with you Bheemo.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.380
If you do not mind, kindly cross my tail and pursue your path.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.240
Dear oldie...

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.420
What do you think of your extension, the ocean...

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.780
for me to jump over like my brother Hanuman?

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.940
Not bad!

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.000
My cute big fellow!

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.240
You remember me.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.360
Don't worry...

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.760
This will make you remember me forever.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.600
Ha... Ha...

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.280
Pardon me... I am too old to move.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.120
Kindly help yourself by shifting my tail from your path

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.740
and please set back after you cross it.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.720
You should have said this long back.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.340
What a waste of time talking to you?

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.440
Saying thus, Bheema bends down and fits his Index finger under the tail,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.780
and tries to swirl it aside.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060
But he get hurt in the bargain.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.220
Cursing himself, he put his right hand to lift the tail.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.860
Mmm... Uhhhh... Uhh... Uhh...

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.720
Uhh... Ah...

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.240
The tail does not move.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.600
Huh... Huh...

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.200
Hmm...Mmm... Mmm...

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.100
He is now force to fit both his hands under the tail.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.440
Put whole his breath and strength to lift but all went vain.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.960
Ahh... Ah...

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.020
At last he is able to lift just a few feet

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.600
But the tail slips out of his hands and falls over his legs.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.600
Ahh...

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.980
Mmm... Hhmm... Hhmm...

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.060
My fellow Vaayuputra!

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.640
This is how your dear elder brother cross the sea.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.940
Do you understand?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.620
My revered Elder...

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.560
What a fool I am for not recognising that Chiranjeevi Hanuman

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.780
But it is indeed a great day in my life...

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.460
to witness your inimitable Vishwaroopa.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.040
Pardon me for my foul maltreatings.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.000
Nobody takes a kid's words seriously.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.420
But always loves to play with them.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.780
That is what I did it with my dear Bheema paiyya...

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.980
So great of you! Bless me brother!

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.340
I am blessed to be omnipotent and omnipresent by my Lord Rama.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.040
True to his words, I permeate strength and success to all noble endeavours in this universe.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.400
Be true to yourself and to your conscience.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.080
You will receive Rama's Blessings.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.560
Sri Rama Jayam!
