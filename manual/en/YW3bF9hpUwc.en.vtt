00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.210
This video will show you what to do if your printer does not pick up or feed paper from

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.690
the input tray or an “out of paper” message displays on your printer when you do have

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.230
paper loaded into the printer. Sometimes, the problem can be fixed just by

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:26.730
doing a printer reset. Without turning the product off, remove the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.520
power cord from the back of the printer. Wait 30 seconds.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.230
Plug the power cord back into the printer. If the printer does not turn on automatically,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.230
press the power button to turn on the printer. Try printing a self-test page.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.140
On the printer control panel, press the Setup button.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.440
Scroll to Print Report and press the OK button. Then scroll to Self-Test Report and then press

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.359
the OK button. If the test page prints successfully, You

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.270
do not need to continue troubleshooting. If the test page does not print, continue on

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:22.790
to the next step. Lift the output tray on the front of the printer.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.030
Remove any wrinkled or damaged paper from the stack.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.560
Make sure that there are at least 10 sheets of plain white paper but no more than 25 sheets

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.159
of paper in the paper in the stack. The printer may hold more sheets of paper, but this number

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.420
of pages is best for testing. Make sure all the paper is the same size and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.810
type; then tap it on a flat surface to get the edges perfectly aligned.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:02:01.840
Finally, load the paper and adjust the guides so they're snug against the stack.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.340
Try to printing a self-test page again. On the printer control panel, press the Setup

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.599
button. Scroll to Print Report and press the OK button.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.260
Then scroll to Self-Test Report and press the OK button.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.989
If the test page prints successfully, you do not need to continue troubleshooting. If

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.440
the test page does not print, continue on to the next step.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.349
Next, we'll make sure the paper settings in the print driver match the settings for

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.980
at least one of your paper trays. On your computer,

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.260
• Open a document in the program you're printing from.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:50.650
• Click File. • Click Print.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:00.290
• Click Properties. When the Properties dialog box opens,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.930
• Click the Features tab. • Find the “Paper type” drop-down menu

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.700
and choose the appropriate paper type. • Find the “Size” drop-down menu and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:26.840
choose the appropriate paper size. •

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.819
Click OK. Click OK again to print the document.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.879
Printer rollers get dirty from paper dust, ink, and oil from your fingers. In this step,

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.319
we'll clean the rollers. Before you begin, gather the following cleaning

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.560
materials: • Clean, lint-free cloth

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.239
• Clean cotton swabs • Clean water to dampen the cloth. Distilled

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.700
or bottled is preferable but not required. Do not use alcohol or other chemical cleaners.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.379
Remove the printer's rear access door or the duplexer.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.610
Clean the rollers visible in the printer with a clean, lint-free cloth lightly moistened

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.610
with water. The cloth should be damp, but not soaking wet. Use your finger to turn the

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.680
rollers toward the printer. Make sure you remove any buildup or debris from the entire

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.710
surface of the roller. Clean the rollers with a moistened cotton swab, removing any buildup

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.550
or debris. These rollers are difficult to reach, but they are the most important to

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.020
clean. If these rollers inside the printer are not cleaned, this problem will continue

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.690
because THESE are the rollers that feed the paper into the printer.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.710
While the rear door or duplexer is off, check the rollers. Note if any rollers are missing,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.620
don't roll freely, and are springy when you push on them. These conditions could prevent

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.180
rollers from feeding properly, and mean that the rear door or duplexer needs to be replaced.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.710
If you're using a duplexer, also clean the inside rollers.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.120
Open the back panel of the duplexer. Clean the rollers inside with a clean, lint-free

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.240
cloth lightly moistened with water. The cloth should be damp, but not soaking wet. Make

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.020
sure you rotate the rollers as you clean them to remove any buildup or debris from the entire

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.770
surface of the roller.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.919
Replace the printer's rear access door or the duplexer.

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:48.289
Plug the power cord back in. Turn the printer on.

00:05:48.289 --> 00:06:01.539
Load paper into the input tray.

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:08.180
Try printing a self-test page. On the printer control panel, press the Setup

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.430
button. Scroll to Print Report and press the OK button.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.090
Then scroll to Self-Test Report and then press the OK button.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.819
If the test page prints successfully, you do not need to continue troubleshooting. If

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:28.130
the test page does not print, continue on to the next step.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.240
If you've tried everything described in this video and you still have a problem, your

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.350
printer likely needs some type of service. Contact HP to find out what the support options

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.319
are for your printer. Your options for service may vary depending on how long you've owned

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.490
the printer and what country you live in.
