00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:20.286
I think most people have no idea what it 
 is when they first look at it.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:24.631
It looks like it could have fallen from the sky.

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:27.569
We are trying to create something that is unexpected.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:32.614
Powerful, and mysterious.

00:00:32.614 --> 00:00:35.943
It is this living alien object.

00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:39.426
There is something inside of it.

00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:43.798
It wants to get out.

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:57.301
There was a point in time where consumer electronics were a physical thing.

00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:03.807
A transistor radio, or a cassette player, or a 
 Walkman, or a stereo, or a television.

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:08.932
And then the software element of it became 
 very important in terms of the experience.

00:01:08.932 --> 00:01:15.628
And now I think we are entering this era where consumer 
 electronics is the hardware and the software and the cloud.

00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:21.566
Q is a small Android powered computer and 
 it connects to your phone or tablet

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:25.229
but also all of the media that you have stored in the cloud

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.958
and the fact that it was going to be in 
 your home meant that it needed to be

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:35.280
not only functional but also beautiful.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:49.270
Google products are used by millions and millions of people 
 every day on the web and mobile side.

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:55.520
How that translates into physical products, it raises a lot of interesting opportunities.

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:57.950
In the past products were basically machines.

00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:02.060
You would go up to the machine, you would 
 dial the knobs, you would read the display.

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:06.180
This is how you get the software from the device to your phone.

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:09.320
Now that you are controlling it from a mobile device

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:13.900
we can take away a lot of those elements to make things simpler.

00:02:13.898 --> 00:02:17.260
People's stereo systems, they were very much revered

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:20.500
but when you went around to people's houses you would never touch them

00:02:20.502 --> 00:02:25.300
The idea here is that people can be inquisitive, play 
 with it, but also start using it interactively.

00:02:25.304 --> 00:02:31.340
I get a kick out of just that it is a sphere.

00:02:31.343 --> 00:02:36.630
It is just as simple as that.

00:02:36.627 --> 00:02:42.430
When I think about the ways that I enjoyed music 
 when I was younger it was very social interaction.

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:50.080
And so with Q we are really hoping to create 
 a renaissance around those kinds of social experiences.

00:02:50.078 --> 00:02:54.360
Where you are enjoying something together instead of just enjoying them by yourself.

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:59.110
'Have you heard this one? This is from their live gig in North Carolina.'

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.250
It is a little bit like a jukebox in that way 
 that you can all be at the same party

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.470
and all be sending music to the same device.

00:03:05.473 --> 00:03:11.140
Everyone who has an Android phone and who has Google Play 
 is able to play the DJ at the party.

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:14.540
It is the sort of thing where you think, why can't everything do this?

00:03:14.543 --> 00:03:18.800
Isn't this the right way that music should be?

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.250
It is a super exciting time to rethink how 
 everyday products will work and function around you.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:42.220
To be able to store all of your media in the 
 cloud and access it everywhere is a new frontier.

00:03:47.302 --> 00:03:52.760
This really is a third wave of consumer electronics 
 and it is all about the cloud.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:04:02.880
Nexus Q is just the beginning.
