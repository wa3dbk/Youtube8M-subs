Hi! my name is Bobby McGee from Bobby
McGee Endurance Sports

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.559
and bobbymcgee.com

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.759
What I'm gonna talk about in this
segment

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.739
is how to stretch your quads, alright?

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.580
Now lying on the ground stretching your quads is very very effective

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.830
but it is not improving your ability to
stay in posture when you run and be

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.189
balanced, and also hold your pelvis in
alignment.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.529
Now stretching the quads is kind of
complicated because the knee

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.300
is an unstable place and it can flex and extend
and the hip cannot only move forward

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.530
move forward and backwards, but it can
move inwards and  outwards, up and down

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.430
as well.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.609
So you have to do quite a lot of work to
actively

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.469
release the... the quad muscle in
the quad muscle that we're basically

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.330
focusing on again is rectus femoris.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.710
Now in the beginning when you do this
exercise you can use some support

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.730
but ideally just to improve your proper reception in the opposite

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.489
ankle

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.829
and also improve your balance, your
dynamic balance while you're running

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.270
you want to get to a point where you
stretching your quads without using a

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.189
support. So what we're gonna do here, alright?

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.150
Is you firstly put your shoe, and your
hand your running shoe and your hand

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.410
but notice I'm not holding onto my
ankle

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.810
and I'm also not holding onto my toe,
my hand is right on the top of the tie

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.020
of my shoe

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.290
so that my ankle flexibility is not part
of the exercise.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.229
Alright?  The next thing that I'm going to be
doing

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.899
is making sure that I'm in a nice
straight line it's very easy to push those

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.160
shoulders back

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.020
tilt the pelvis forward, and arch the lower
back, that's taking pressure off

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.729
the quad

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.689
and counterproductive in terms of what
we're trying to do, alright? So the first

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.010
thing we do, is we lower that chest

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.569
The second thing that we gonna do

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.740
is gonna make sure that these thighs are
parallel. And then from the front section

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.999
notice if i'm doing this badly i'm
pushing this hip out to the side

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.760
I really wanna pick that hip up

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.000
so that my pelvis is parallel from the
front, that's what I want to be doing

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.720
that parallel position

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.729
Alright? So Im nice and done in the front,

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.790
my hip is tucked on this... on this left
side, my thighs are parallel,alright?

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.930
Now...

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.710
I do the million dollar move, alright?

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.630
Ahm...which is to pinch my glute, but
before that, what I actually wanna

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.070
do

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.959
is just push by foot slightly into my
hand, pull my knees slightly forward

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.290
in this way. So I'm loading up that hip
and then the million dollar  move. I'd

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.390
pinch my glute as hard as I can which is
this but muscle here, pinch it as hard as I

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.140
possibly can, keep my head up

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.569
keep my body down, and now draw the leg back

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.430
over 7 count period

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.699
and then slowly lower that down again

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.799
and draw it back again.

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.579
Alright? and just hold it briefly and come
back down again.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.079
And that's the most effective way to
stretch this upper quad muscle

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.469
that is so essential in running.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.169
So keep those quads loose, because if the quads are tight

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.999
that' ll pull the front of the pelvis down and put 
the hamstrings on pressure,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.140
you really want those quads nice and
loose

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.080
so that the pelvis can remain neutral

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.279
and the pressure can come up the hamstrings.

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:53.779
Good luck at this, speak to you next time.
