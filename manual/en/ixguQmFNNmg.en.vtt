00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.440
Joel Scruggs, Public Affairs Specialist, Bonneville
Power Administration (off camera): Water is

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.299
a precious commodity in the Columbia Basin.
More than 100 years ago, irrigation transformed

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.070
this dry region into prosperous farmland and
so access to water has been the foremost priority

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.880
for decades, often at the expense of habitat.
But in recent years the focus has shifted.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.579
Today, water users, agencies, conservation
districts, and landowners are working together

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.059
to make the most of this resource through
conservation and restoration efforts that

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.010
benefit both fish and farmer.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:50.829
Jay Marcotte, Fish and Wildlife Project Manager,
Bonneville Power Administration: All these

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.589
little tributaries extend up into the mountains
and provide 20, 30, 40 miles of virtually

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:04.180
pristine habitat. This is where the fish end
up going to spawn, but on some of these creeks

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.220
you might have five, six, seven, eight, in
succession, little diversions that were put

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.020
in there to irrigate small parcels of land
for agricultural production. So we need to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.790
make it so that fish can get past these passage
barriers.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.750
Michael Garello, Fisheries Engineer, HDR:
So this is the Keach-Jensen diversion structure

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.610
on Manastash Creek. After this project is
complete, the roughened channel/fish passage

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.780
structure that we provided will allow fish
to migrate successfully up stream and down

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.150
stream unimpeded. The structure is a combined
fish passage, fish screening facility and

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.320
diverts which distributes water to various
agricultural practices down stream.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.040
The fish passage structure incorporates a
series of nine rock weirs that are integrated

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.501
into the stream bed. The diversion structure
itself has an inlet; water goes through the

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:05.340
inlet in the trash rack, sweeps across the
screens. Water that’s diverted goes through

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.240
the screens. The remaining water goes through
the fish bypass. The fish bypass transports

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.909
debris, juvenile fish that are in the area
and water from the diversion structure back

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:24.000
downstream to the creek. And then the screen
will inhibit fish from being able to swim

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.640
down the diversions.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.819
The previous diversion incorporated a large
concrete sill. Downstream of that sill there

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.220
was a lot of scour and erosion and it created
a vertical jump barrier and fish weren’t

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.090
able to get up stream and down stream. So
this will keep fish in the stream and allow

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.510
them to pass freely up and down stream as
needed.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.050
Anna Lael, District Manager, Kittitas County
Conservation District: These are big steps.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.920
The screening and passage are big steps. Whatever
fish can make it up here need to be protected

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.900
from ending up in the irrigation systems and
that’s what these facilities do.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.870
Joel Scruggs (off camera): The Keach-Jensen
diversion will be ready for the next irrigation

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.220
season in the spring. Following construction,
the focus shifts to water-saving improvements

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.080
and in-stream flows. Then the project moves
down stream to take out a two more barriers

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.100
on Manastash Creek.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.140
Michael Garello: We’ve got a lot more to
go, but these are great projects and it’s

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.860
been a collaborative effort among water users,
state and federal agencies, local special

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.330
districts, the landowners — everybody’s
really pinched in.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.670
Jay Marcotte: And we’re doing the work in
ways that allow the agricultural programs

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.910
to stay whole, but also allow the fish and
wildlife resources to benefit.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.220
Joel Scruggs (off camera): Projects like these
ensure that folks get the water they need

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.240
and fish have access to historic spawning
areas.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:46.970
Michael Garello: We’re going to be able
to provide various species of salmon, steelhead

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.599
access to habitat that they haven’t had
access to for probably anywhere from 80 to

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:28.250
100 years. It’s possible that we might see
fish migrating up here within our lifetime.
