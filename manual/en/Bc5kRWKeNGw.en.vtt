00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.420
At the end of every day of fishing it comes
time to clean up, and that's how your next

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.850
day of fishing
is going to start so if you have ever wondered

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.110
why do I go to get my rods out and everything
is in a pile

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.140
when I get to the lake and I'm mad.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.510
Because like most of you I didn't take enough
time to put them back in the rod box

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.510
correctly.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.100
So one of the things that has helped me over
the years are rods gloves, what are these?

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.090
These are actually sleeves
for your rods.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.130
You simply slide it on the rod this is even
made from Micro Guide and I start placing

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.130
them in my box.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.830
I don't even use a rod organizer, but with
these rod gloves the whole deal is you can

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.250
just keep stacking them in.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.282
I put the lure down on the reel, don't place
it up on your eye somewhere because that's

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.790
going to cause nightmares.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.140
O.J Simpson lawyer can't get this out.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.080
Don't put it up there you want it down here
where you can work with it.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.050
Slide the rod gloves on and they come everything
from spinning reels to bait casters 7'6 we

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.210
have them all different lengths and some
you can even get the line size stamped on

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.210
the glove itself.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.640
Of course me I had my little logo put there
because I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.689
try to be a little something something you
know.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.990
But it works for me, it short cuts me headaches,
and when it's less headache

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.649
for me in a day of fishing I'm all about it.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.070
So try it next time you go out and pick yourself
up some rod

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.070
gloves.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.079
Wrap your rods up, place your baits down on
your reel, stack them in there I'm probably

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.869
25 deep and tomorrow
morning when I get ready to fish they will

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.259
come right back out.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:59.179
That's worth it all right there.
