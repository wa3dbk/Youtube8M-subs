00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.790
Alright, now I'm going to give you the Southern
Gothic. And, again, forgive me but what I

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.749
have to show you is a very generic Southern
Gothic. This is the back cover of the Visconti

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:20.770
Hours Manuscript. An exceedingly lavish manuscript.
And, if you can see up very, very carefully,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:28.020
what you're going to notice is, in these Gothic
forms, there are some slightly more rounded

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.089
shapes than in the form that I just showed
you. These are versals. There's a lot of gold

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:40.780
in this manuscript. This is a D. See that
rounded D? That uncial D? Okay, let me show

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.649
you what these letters look like. Not that
much different, but, yeah, there are character

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.440
changes and you want to be aware of these
and you want to be consistent. Very important

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:07.540
to be consistent. So, rounded, softened here,
still Gothic. (Demo) A little bit of a softer

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:18.560
thing here, little bit more rounded here.
Little softer turn, here, a little bit more

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:58.109
rounded. Softer. (Demo) You can do this if
you want. There's certainly a lot of different

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:05.600
ways to do the F. The G is, you can, it's
just like the A all the way up until, all

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:29.310
the way up until here. This is rounded. H.
Rounded. Uncial influence. Alright, and I'm

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.739
just going to go to the I. It's just a little
bit of a softer feel. And, of course.
