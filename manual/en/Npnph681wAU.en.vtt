Hi, I'm Jay from Real Street Performance. Today, we're going to talk about the adjustable cam sprocket and what it means to you.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.749
Now the adjustable cam sprocket is a tool that is often

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.740
inexpensive and accessible for most of the engines that we sell parts for.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.559
It's something that I recommend based off of the fact that it gives you the opportunity to optimize your cam timing.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.070
As you mill the block or the head or you're swapping one block onto another head and vice versa,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.610
you'll often change cam timing because you're changing deck height in the timing belt's relation. This isn't to be mistaken for

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.399
degreeing your camshafts. That's a whole other subject.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.920
Something that we're going to touch on. Although,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.330
it's very lengthy and because we try to do this in a short period of time, it's not for today.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.639
Basically when the valve timing happens, changes how the engine makes power.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.460
Generally if you retard the timing,

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.559
you will increase top-end power. And if you advance the cam timing, you will

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.429
increase low-speed power at the sacrifice of top-end power. Now there is no free lunch. You will give up one or the other.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.509
This is one of the downfalls of having a fixed cam timing engine. So when you go to the dyno,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.660
I recommend that you work in two degree increments. So you would

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.409
advance or retard each camshaft independently

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560
or together. And work your way through

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.120
what the engine likes and how it changes the power band of the engine.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.809
We're going to post a quick little cheat sheet there on the screen so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.440
you can look through what some of the effects are of moving the cam around.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.990
You're going to want to be mindful that as you move the camshaft depending on the size of the camshaft,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.559
you may come off the heel of the cam. The area of the cam lobe that is not lifting the rocker open

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.640
or valve tap it open. And if that's the case, you're going to want to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.249
check the valve lash throughout the process because if you were dealing with a large camshaft that has a lot of overlaps,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.190
as you move the cam lobe around physically with the cam sprocket, you can alter the valve lash.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.249
So it's good to check the valve lash throughout the process.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920
Not a very difficult procedure.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.700
Just bring a note pad. Take some notes.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.609
Try to do two runs at a time That way you know that your informations repeatable. If you have a bunch of cool down time

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.919
between the runs, it's going to skew your data. Again, not very difficult. Most of you guys already have adjustable camps sprockets.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.220
It's a good way to optimize your program. If you have any more questions,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.790
give me a shout or tune in next week for our new tech tip.
