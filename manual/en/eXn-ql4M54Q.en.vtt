00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
There is a famous Italian model named Claudia Romani. She was born in 1982.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.080
She's the same age as Guillaume.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.780
She loves soccer so she became a soccer referee.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.440
Soccer?!/ Really? Wow~

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
I'll show you.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.780
That's not soccer!

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400
There can't be a match.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.980
While running...

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.840
When you get a yellow card, you say. "Yes!" and run like this.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.320
When you get a red card, won't you sing?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.780
In 2012, by a famous American music magazine, she was chosen as the best bikini model.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.880
A few years ago in Denmark, she was chosen to have the best legs.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.180
Soccer players were interviwed and they said, "We're looking foward to it."

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.040
"This referee can make a mistake. It doesn't matter."

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.720
Is this a marketing for modeling or did she really want to became a referee?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.260
There were people who said that this was marketing. She started living in the US a few years ago, in Miami.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.060
She's promoting in US so how will she do her job in Italy...

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.960
It's 100% marketing/ It's not like she can go back and forth between countries on Sunday

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.080
Going back and forth to referee?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.780
This is 100% marketing.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.500
What if she likes Abnormal Summit so much that she becomes a producer for JTBC

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800
She'll be sitting there instead os our current producer

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.440
I am going to be on this show forever (if that happens)

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.220
You're not thinking that right now?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.520
I do! Of couse I do!~

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
Until when will you do Abnormal Summit?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.100
As long as I do it.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.700
You're not saying that you'll do it forever

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.340
Yes.../ We will call you this week

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.460
