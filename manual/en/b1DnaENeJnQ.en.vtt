00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.430
What's better than three of the Infidels by
Benchmade

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.690
Not a whole lot
Let's look at the new Mini-Infidel

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.119
It's small, compact, easy to carry in the
pocket

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:26.119
Regular Infidel has a clip and it is easy to carry
but it's quite a bit larger in your pocket

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:35.479
Here's one thing where they made the Infidel
shine, that my friends is just stupendous

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.260
Mini-Infidel opening it is a snap, smaller
blade, easier to handle, lighter weight

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.260
See the difference between the two, regular
Infidel is quite a bit larger

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.990
For those of you who might like the black
blades, we have this model for you right here

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.390
I carry a Benchmade almost daily, this is
the model I carry, you can see it has lots

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.140
of wear
The issue with this knife is when you pull

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.039
it out of your pocket, it's usually in this
position

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.780
I after to turn the knife in my hand and then
find this button to deploy it

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.530
And I have to make sure there is nothing in
front of the blade, it takes a little bit

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.179
of time
Let's switch to the mini-infidel

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.399
As I pull it out of my pocket, my thumb is
already positioned, they have grooves built

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:39.399
in here, so as you pull it out the thumb stays
put and all you have to do is push it forward

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.710
The blade deploys
If you look at the size difference between

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.710
the mini and the knife I carry, almost exactly
the same size, maybe a little bit thicker

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:02.959
but not by much and a shade heavier
That's it, the long short of it, the new mini-infidel

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.460
