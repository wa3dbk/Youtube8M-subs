00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.009
We're going to go ahead and swaddle baby with
his arms out of the blanket because we want

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.500
to help him. As babies start to grow and develop,
they need that freedom of movement. Swaddling

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.870
can restrict some of their motor development,
if they're swaddled to late in life. So, even

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.470
if, at an early age, if you find that they're
trying to loosen their swaddle and get their

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.180
arms free, try swaddling them with their arms
free to begin with. And that can be one arm

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.230
or both. So, we're going to go ahead and swaddle
baby with arms out. And we'll lay this blanket

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.480
out here, this specially designed swaddling
blanket. There's a little pocket here. We're

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.830
going to go ahead and fold that pocket back
so when we bring baby down to the floor to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:47.690
the blanket, we're laying baby right here,
so his underarms are at the edge of the top

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.579
of our blanket, and his arms can be free to
move once we start to wrap the blanket around.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.190
So, taking his legs, go ahead and help to
guide them into the little pocket, pulling

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.229
the pocket up, right there, making sure that
the top of our blanket, again, right underneath

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.610
the arms. And we're going to go ahead and
take the blanket, folding around this side

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.570
first, helping to lift him a little bit if
you need to so that you can scoot that blanket

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.950
right underneath and behind him. You'll notice
here on this side that there's soft Velcro,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.710
and that's because, on this side, as we start
to wrap it around, there are two flaps with

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.229
hard Velcro that need to be attached to keep
a nice, secure, snug swaddle. So, go ahead

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.310
and wrap around this side, making sure you
give it a little bit of a tug. You want this

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.770
to be nice and secure, if you are swaddling.
Lift him up, if need be, and tuck one flap

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.660
back and stick it in, and the other flap back
and just stick that on. And lift baby up,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.580
and have a look. Making sure, check your swaddle.
Make sure it's nice and snug. You don't want

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.810
it loose. It needs to be nice and snug. And
check the baby, if you're swaddling with their

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.860
arms out, does have freedom of movement. Are
his arms free? Can he move? Can he touch things?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.079
Is he able to explore and learn? Make sure
that your swaddle allows him to do that. As

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.569
babies do grow, they need to have the freedom
of exploration and learning through touch

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.260
and movement.
