Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.320
Today we are gonna be making something that
I got so many requests for!

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.849
We’re gonna be making Spongebob Squarepants!
I love lemon bars, and so I wanted to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.919
do this cartoon series for you. So, we are
gonna be making Spongebob Lemon Bars!

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.630
Let’s get started!

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.539
There’s a lot of ingredients because we
are making these from scratch, so I’m

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.539
just going to explain as we go. The first
thing you’re gonna do is take a big

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:44.539
mixing bowl, and you’re gonna add 2 sh-ticks
of unsalted butter, which is, 1 cup.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.980
And you want to make sure it is room temperature,
these are a little bit soft.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.899
Then you’re gonna mix it up, there we go,
that’s what it should look like.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.280
Kinda fluffy, that’s what we want!

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.109
Then you’re gonna take 1/2 a cup of sugar,
just regular white sugar, and slowly

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.690
add it to the butter. Just put a little bit
in, mix it up, and you’re just gonna

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.410
keep doing this until you’re out of sugar.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.940
Once your butter and sugar is all mixed together
we’re gonna add some salt, just

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.340
1/2 a teaspoon.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.260
Merp!

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.690
And, now we’re gonna slowly add in 2 cups
of regular white flour.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.410
Just really slow, sprinkle a little, and then
mix together.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.530
If you put it all in at once you’re gonna
get a big pffft! Dust Cloud, so just slowly

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.810
add the flour. Once you’ve mixed all that
together, it looks like dough, and that’s

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.980
exactly what we want, this is going to be
our lemon bar crust which we will bake first.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.450
So what you’re gonna do is grease your pan,
this is a 9x13 inch pan, just a glass pan.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.190
I’m just taking a little bit of baking spray,
you can also use butter, whatever

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.180
you want. Now what I’m gonna do is just
pour in the dough, sprinkle it in,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.820
and pack it down flat.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.800
Who, lives in a pineapple under the sea? Sponge-Bob-Square-Pants!

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.880
Once you got your dough all ready, we’re
just gonna put this in the oven for 20

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.659
minutes at 350. And while that’s baking,
we are gonna make our lemon mixture!

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.239
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum! My favorite! I love lemons!

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.680
The first thing you’re gonna do is take
4 fresh lemons and you’re just gonna take

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.150
1 of them, and you’re gonna zest the entire
thing into this bowl.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.859
So this is a lemon zester, and make sure not
to get your fingers, I am guilty,

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.700
I have done this before, and just go like
this.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.200
Here you go, this is what it looks like, we
have 1 lemon zested, now we are

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.799
going to make some lemon juice.

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.269
We are going to need 2/3 cup of lemon juice,
it depends on what size your lemon is, but

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.090
for me this was 3-1/2 fresh lemons. So how
to do this, you’re gonna take your

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.620
lemon, and a big cutting knife, and cut it
in half.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.780
Be careful!

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.999
And then I got this little manual juicer,
there are electric ones, but I like

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.510
this one because it’s really easy to use,
and it gives me a little bit of a workout!

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.909
So I can eat more lemon bars!

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.200
Just put it on the top, squish it around like
that and the juice will go to the bottom.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.569
Herro!

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.879
2/3 cup of lemon juice! Freshly squeezed!

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.749
Now that we’ve got our lemons prepared you’re
going to take 1 big mixing bowl,

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:26.739
and a whisk, and this is really easy. And
you’re just going to take 1 cup of

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:35.199
regular sugar, pour it in. 1/2 a cup of flour,
pour it in, and then I like to

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.089
whisk these together before I add my other
ingredients.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.860
Now we’re gonna add 4 regular eggs, the
yolk helps to give it that yellow color,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.900
to look like real lemon bar.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.360
Mix these in!

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.780
Now we’re gonna add our lemon zest, and
2/3 cup of fresh lemon juice.

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.019
Easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy!

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.169
And then just mix it all together until everything
is even.

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:08.649
And… There we have it! Our lemon mixture
is all done look at that, it smells so good!

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.359
And, it was perfect timing, our crust just
finished from the oven. And that is what

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.030
you want it to look like, a little bit of golden-brown,
along the sides.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.700
Oh, so good! Alright, now you’re just gonna
let it cool for about 10 minutes before

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.740
you pour in your mixture, and you’re just
gonna pour it all on the top.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.500
Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop!

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.280
Now we are gonna bake 1 more time, throw this
in the oven again for 20 minutes,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.610
again on 350.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.340
Once your lemon bar is done baking, you’re
gonna let it sit on the drying rack

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.710
and cool and then put it in the fridge
for 3 hours to chill.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.080
Or you can leave it overnight, whatever you’d
like!

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.330
So, here we are, our lemon bar is nice and
cold, I took it out of the fridge.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.500
And, we’re just gonna cut little squares,
and then I’m gonna use a flipper and

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.220
put ‘em over here to decorate!

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.220
Once you got all your lemon squares cut out,
it’s time to decorate!

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.860
I’ve cut them, these ones are medium sized
and the these ones are smaller, you can

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.550
make them any size you’d like. Look at the
top of these though, this is just perfect

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.850
for Spongebob! Because the top of lemon bars
are a little bit spongy looking, it’s just perfect!

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:23.140
To decorate, we’re just gonna be using different
cookie frostings, we have black,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.660
pink, this is a cookie icing, blue and white,
to make Spongebob’s face.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.920
And the reason this tastes so good is because
the lemon bars are very tart, very lemony,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.300
and so you want to put a little bit of sugar,
something sweet on top to compliment it.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.830
A lot of people, just if you’re making a
regular plain lemon bar, would just

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.370
sprinkle a little bit of powdered sugar on
top. But we’re gonna be putting a little

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.030
bit of sugar icing.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.860
Also, I’ve got some scraps from the edges
when we were cutting out the lemon bars,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.280
hold onto these because we’re gonna decorate
with these later.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.370
I’ll show you, hold onto them.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.380
First thing we’re gonna do to decorate,
we’re gonna do spongebob’s eyes, so get

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.310
your white cookie icing, and just draw 2 eyeballs.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.620
Now we’re gonna take our blue cookie icing,
and make the little blue part of his eyes.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.030
Now you’re gonna take pink icing to make
his cheeks.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.550
Just do little circles right next to the eyeballs.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.580
Now you’re gonna take your black icing and we’re gonna make his eyelashes

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.500
and smiley face. remember he has 3 eyelashes for
each eyeball.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.390
Now that we’ve got all the little smiles
on, we’re gonna make his 2 front teeth with

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.710
the white frosting again.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.020
Last but not least, we have 1 last thing to
do decorate, what you’re gonna do is take

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.200
your scraps that we set aside, and what I
did is I scooped off the top, this lemon

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.610
mixture right here, and I put it into one
of these little baggies, and I just put

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.740
a numer 2 tip on it, and we’re gonna use
this to make Spongebob’s nose!

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.020
Ta-da!

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.200
Here are Spongebob Lemon Bars! They are so
good! And I’m so happy that I finally

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.680
got to do something Spongebob! I love cartoons,
I watch a lot of cartoons, and

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.310
Spongebob is one of my favorites, so I got
pretty excited.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.890
And the fresh lemons taste so good! I
would really suggest this recipe with the

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.330
fresh lemon juice, it’s the best!
