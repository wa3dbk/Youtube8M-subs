00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.760
Hi everyone.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.020
Welcome to the first week
in our series of classes.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.470
In this tutorial, we're
going to take a look

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.860
at how you can use a flatbed
scanner, believe it or not,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.100
to create some very fine images
of three dimensional objects,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.110
like microfluidic devices,
Petri dishes, and other sorts

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.370
of material you're creating
or working with in the lab.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.260
Now you might be
wondering why we're

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.300
starting this course with
a tool that you probably

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.140
wouldn't think of
for creating really

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.690
fine images of your work.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.460
Well, we want you to experience
the fun part of creating images

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.880
at first, and
frankly, we wanted you

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.769
to start off with some easy
stuff-- well, relatively easy--

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.170
and not having to worry too much
about technical issues, which

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.660
believe me, will come later.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.680
That's a promise.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.310
This course is
meant to encourage

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.700
you to capture your material
in a number of ways.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.110
And probably most important,
to learn to see in the process.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.310
So you're seeing, and
will continue to see,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.810
all sorts of images that I
made on the flatbed scanner

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.790
with different approaches.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.410
I'll go into detail for a few of
them in all of these tutorials

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.080
and we'll call
them case studies.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.890
You'll see things
that will surprise you

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.430
and you'll discover
new perspectives, that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.500
is new points of
view, which might lead

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.720
to new thinking about your work.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.860
Try out your ideas
about imaging.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.180
It won't take long.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.720
That's the nice part
about the flatbed scanner.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.290
Some of your ideas will
work, and some won't.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.140
Believe me, a lot of them won't,
from my personal experience.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.340
And emphasizing what I said
in the general overview,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.020
most of this is
about experimenting,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.180
or in a way playing.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.140
The process, I hope, will
become an active discovery,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.850
as it did for me when
I made these images.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.350
You should think of this
process in a similar way

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.370
as you do with your
own investigations.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.860
So using the scanner can, if you
choose, come close to imaging

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.500
with a microscope, if
you make sure you capture

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.060
your image at a high
enough resolution.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.720
You can start zooming in to
your image on your screen

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.400
and see things that you
could not see with your eyes.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.460
And I'll show you that
a little more later on.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.240
One thing-- I wanted to let
you know that I digitally

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.140
cleaned some of these images
so that your eye wouldn't

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.180
be distracted with
dust particles.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.840
That's important
for you to know.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.010
And something else--
keep in mind you'll

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.390
see a separate interactive
gallery of these images.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.590
We call it the visual
index, with the names

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.960
of the researchers
and other information

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.470
about what you're seeing.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.260
It's important to know who
is responsible for creating

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.590
these pretty amazing
and useful devices,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.950
and who's doing this
fascinating research.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.390
The decision of whether to use
a flatbed scanner is yours.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.620
First think of the size of
your device or material.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.220
I'd say a safe bet is, if
you're planning to see details

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.750
from a few millimeters
up to a few centimeters.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.540
But as you'll see
in a few moments,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.890
you'll be able to capture detail
in the 30 to 50 micron range.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.930
What you'll see and
show in your image

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.320
will depend on how you set
the resolution in the scanner

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.280
setting.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.270
For the time being, just think
about it this way-- the higher

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.280
your DPI setting, that is dots
per inch, the more information

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.290
you're sending to the sensor.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.270
The more information
you're sending,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.670
the more detail you'll
be seeing and capturing.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.300
You'll find all about this
in our How to Do it tutorial.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.170
Take a look at that after you've
completed this week's tutorial.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.810
You'll see how changing the DPI
settings, as we are seeing here

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.610
in these three images, will have
a direct effect on capturing

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.110
details.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.170
Why use it instead of a camera?

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.050
Well first of all,
you can very quickly

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.440
make some very fine
images without going

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.050
to more complicated
setup with your camera,

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.920
as you'll see later
in the next few weeks.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.110
You can show evidence
that you've made something

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.660
or that you're
observing something.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.750
You might want to show
a part of something

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.710
larger, a small
structure for example.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.790
You'll be able to share
some observations quickly

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.430
with your colleagues.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.350
You can consider
it as a draft image

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.880
that you will eventually use
in a figure for a submission.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.130
Perhaps you can even use the
image as a patent submission.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.580
That's something to think about.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.840
The wonderful surprise
here is that you

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.590
can put a three-dimensional
object on the scanner

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.530
and create images that suggest
their three-dimensionality.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.790
Yes, you will lose
depth of field,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.470
which we'll discuss in the
next tutorial about cameras

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.350
and lenses.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.550
But still, eventually
you'll create sometimes

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.160
a knock-your-socks-off image.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.660
Hopefully you're interested
in that sort of thing.
