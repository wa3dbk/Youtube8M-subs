Hi my name is Carey Kepler I'm a functional
training coach I also work with triathletes

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.480
today I'm going to give triathletes triathlon
goals for the intermediate to the beginner

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.270
triatlete. And if you would like more information
you can go to my website at www.boundless-energy.com.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.750
What I want to talk about is the freestyle
stroke it's also known and called the crawl

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.500
it's the most sufficient stroke that your
going to be able to use, so you want to be

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.030
familiar and be able to use that stroke if
not throughout the entire swim portion of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.949
the race, then at least the majority of it.
I know first timers sometimes get nervous

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.269
in there and you want to breast stroke or
back stroke. But the freestyle stroke is the

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.389
most sufficient so when your doing a freestyle
you want to make sure about there about 5

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:56.910
mechanical moves that you want to be familiar
with. The arm positioning you want to be familiar

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.920
with the way of the arm is place into the
water you want to catch the water so your

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.450
going to place the hand into the water, and
your going to pull through and keep a high

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.190
elbow. Number 2 you want to make sure that
you have a kick and a strong kick and it's

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.549
going to be a flutter kick so your not going
to bend at the knee your going to actually

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.710
move through the water with your hips. And
number 3 you want to be familiar with your

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.470
breathing technique some people breath unilaterally
which is one side every other stroke. The

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.299
most efficient breathing technique is the
bilateral breathing technique that you'll

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.390
swim and breathe every 3rd stroke so you'll
actually be breathing down both sides. The

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.030
benefits of that is the more fluid body movement
so your going to be more slippery in the water

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.579
so your going to be more efficient and also
when your in triathlon there's so many people

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.780
around you there are waves water can come
into the mouth and if your capable of breathing

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.100
from side to side your able to avoid and miss
some of that water which can really you know

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.370
clog you up. So you want to try to learn to
bilateral breath. And 5th you want to make

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:15.710
sure that your are body positioned in the
water that you are most slippery. Being slippery

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.500
in the water means that you literally are
going to turn from side to side, so that your

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.100
body movement rotates completely from almost
shoulder to shoulder when your in the pool

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.580
you want to work on that. Shoulder roll and
hip roll and so if you exaggerate that in

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.690
the pool when you actually swimming in a race
your going to be the most slippery and the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.540
most fluid in the water, so you want to be
more fish like.
