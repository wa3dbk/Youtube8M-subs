Hey guys, welcome to this episode of TechByte.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.650
Today we are going to look at the Apple iPad
Smart Case.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.080
This is basically a smart cover with a back.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.500
For my smart cover demo click the annotation
in the top left corner or if you’re watching

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.760
on a mobile device find the link in the description.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.760
This case isn’t connected by magnets but
by putting half the iPad in and then pressing

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.500
the two other corners into place.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.750
This case works with the iPad 2 and The New
iPad but as it has to fit the new iPad which

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.670
is slightly thicker, there is a bit of extra
room when this case is used with an iPad 2.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.379
This case is made out of polyurethane and
at the time of recording there are not any

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.620
leather versions.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.699
The material on the inside of this case is
soft microfiber so that your device doesn’t

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.910
get scratched.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.920
There are perforations for the speaker, which
impressively doesn’t drown any of the sound

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.680
out, cut-outs for the 30 pin dock connector,
camera, microphone, headphone jack and mute

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.009
or rotation lock switch.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.600
The cut-outs for the headphone jack and mute
or rotation lock switch aren’t placed that

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.990
well as it is hard to flick the switch and
the headphone cut-out is very small.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:40.080
A feature I like is the raised profile buttons
which sit over the top of the iPad’s buttons.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.299
The smart cover works just as a normal smart
cover.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:53.200
It wakes and sleeps the iPad, closes magnetically
and works in the two stand modes: the typing

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:11.540
stand, which is very useful and works fine,
and the movie stand which is quite wobbly

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.989
and if you tap the iPad too much then it could
fall over.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.630
Another feature in the original Smart Cover
is the screen cleaning function but as this

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.340
case has a raised lay-on-table design, the
microfiber doesn’t touch the iPad’s display.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.730
The case feels like it has too much room,
like it was made for a bigger iPad as you

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.290
can squish the case and if you turn the case
the iPad moves around in the case.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.099
Many people have complained about the ease
of opening the cover but that hasn’t really

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.020
been an issue with me.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.280
The sides of the case are quite sharp and
uncomfortable to hold and when you take the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.770
iPad out of the case and hold it; it feels
so much nicer to hold in the hand.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.629
Just to point out; if you would like to return
your smart case with engraving you won’t

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.730
be able to as it has been already personalised.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.180
The iPad smart case gets three bytes.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.750
Overall the case is quite good.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.670
If Apple made it so that the iPad fit in it
tighter then it would be a great case but

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.250
at the minute it’s just an okay case.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.090
I’ll have one more iPad video coming on
Tuesday and then that will be the end of the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.519
series but I’ll keep doing the ‘What’s
On My iPad Series’.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:46.489
Thanks for watching this video guys, I’ll
see you in the next one.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.819
Bye!
