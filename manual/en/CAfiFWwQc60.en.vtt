00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Financial literacy. 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:10.880
The financial system is composed of a group of institutions whose aim is to channel savings in order to satisfy demand for credit.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.880
In other words, its job is to act as an intermediary between those who have excess funds and those who need them.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.920
A sound financial system is fundamental for the economic stability of countries.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.200
But what determines the soundness of the financial system?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.000
The proper operation of its markets, the robustness of its institutions and, in particular, the fact that all the agents are well informed.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.920
Knowing, understanding and making mature judgments
on financial products 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.520
is good for people and crucial
for the development of a more sustainable system.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.920
Today, there is a very complex range of products on offer: 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.000
you can choose between insurance, reverse mortgages, hedge funds,
forward contracts, commodities, call options, 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840
over-the-counter products, swaps, basket options...

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.280
It has become extremely difficult to understand the financial markets.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.200
This is why it is so important for people
to be well trained in these subjects.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.680
Of course, they have to understand the opportunities offered
by the different transactions, but also their risks.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.440
That's the only way they can make good decisions
and become consistent savers or responsible debtors.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.280
In 2005, the OECD approved a resolution recommending member
countries to promote financial education among its citizens.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.360
Financial education should be a continuous,
long-term process that covers the different stages in life.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.280
Obviously, people's needs vary according to their age and situation. 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.680
Older people prepare for their retirement
and manage their pension plans;

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.120
adults buy cars or homes,
or apply for loans for holidays;

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.560
young people receive their first paychecks, rent a flat,
and prepare for an independent life;

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.120
while minors try to get the most out
of their monthly pocket money. 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.360
For all of them, financial literacy is fundamental,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.440
and thatå“€ why in BBVA it is one of our priority
and differentiating commitments. 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.000
BBVA's Global Financial Literacy Plan
operates in two main areas.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.280
First, through the program Adelante con tu futuro
(Forward with your future),

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.040
the plan aims to assist the processes of banking penetration
in developing regions, particularly in Latin America.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.280
Educating in financial questions
is an essential step in banking penetration

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.680
and it is the only way possible for consolidating
sustainable development in these countries. 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.320
The Plan also aims to contribute towards boosting education in values associated with the use of money among the young;

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.120
in this area, students of 6 to 14 throughout Spain are learning
concepts such as saving, effort, responsibility and solidarity at school. 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.920
This is our program Valores de Futuro (Future values). 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.360
In all, throughout 2009, more than 100,000 people in Mexico
and 320,000 children in Spain benefited.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.280
A trained, thoughtful and critical group of citizens
will be in a better position

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.480
to relate to the financial system, and will make us better,
not only ourselves, but all the actors operating in the system. 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.080
That is why we believe that investment in education means
a commitment to the health of the financial system as a whole.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.120
If it is important for people, it is important for BBVA.
