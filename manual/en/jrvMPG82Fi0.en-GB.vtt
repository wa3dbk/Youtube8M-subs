Hi everyone, welcome to this episode of Chic!
Today I want to show you a springtime make

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.149
up look that I`ve created with the new products
from the Dr.Hauschka LE Chorus. I`ve started

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:35.610
with a nice pink blush and now I`m going to
apply some concealer to small blemishes. Create

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:52.260
a healthy glow by adding some highlighter
to the top your cheekbones and cupids bow.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.650
Next we move on to the eyes! For this look
I`m using an eyeshadow duo from Dr.Hauschka.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.850
Apply the light shadow from the palette over
the inner half of your eyelid. Apply with

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.009
a damp brush the darker colour to the outer
corner of your eyelid. This will amp up the

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:34.409
pigmentation of 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:54.840
the eyeshadow. Use an eye pencil to accentuate
your lash line. For mascara, I`m using the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.450
Dr.Hauschka Volume Mascara, which I`m really
loving, because it has a nice thickening and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:39.560
lengthening effect. The mascara isn`t waterproof
though. Finally apply a lipstick to your lips.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.920
Apply gloss to the center of your lips to
make them look fuller. And this is the final

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.599
look. I hope you enjoyed the video and don`t
forget to subscribe and give this video a

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:02.720
thumbs up.
