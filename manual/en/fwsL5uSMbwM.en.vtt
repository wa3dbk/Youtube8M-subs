00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.439
What should have been a magnificent age, a
Sun Age, is now bloodied by their return.

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.439
While some see the Dragons as a glorious sign,
others see them as an omen of evil. Nevertheless,

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:21.749
their mere presence marks this age with violence
and upheaval. A period of death and rebirth.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.070
No one knows what exactly is to come, but
every age has its wars, its tragedies, and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.070
its victories. This will be no different.
Welcome...to the Dragon Age.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.829
This is Thedas. A land continuously ripped
apart by the races and religions that have

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.820
permeated throughout its history. At its beginning,
its enlightened citizens were deeply rooted

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.820
in magic. The ancient kingdom of the immortal
Elves, Elvhenan, ran across the mass of Thedas,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.590
practicing arts and holding knowledge that
modern-day scholars could barely fathom possible.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.590
But as the humans pushed from the north and
moved into the continent, so came the Quickening:

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.320
an event that removed the Elves' immortality.
And as war and tyranny imposed upon the rule

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.189
of the Elves, culture and knowledge was lost...
In the modern age, their people are scattered

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.689
and left dissolute. The Dalish elves roam
the lands, grasping at what little knowledge

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.689
was left from the old empire. The truly lost,
forced to live in alienages, the slums of

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.990
cities. Or worse- as slaves. Thedosians treat
the Elves as second-class citizens; the once

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.460
immortal beings, a proud people, are now subject
to the whims of Humans, who have spread dominance

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.569
in both culture and numbers.
Humans and Elves are not the only performers

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.569
on the stage of Thedas. To outsiders, this
fanatical race is nothing but monstrous warmongers.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.620
To those within their lands? One word: order.
These people are called Qunari. The great

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.319
horned civilization that lives in Par Vollen.
After numerous bloody encounters, Thedosians

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.040
are only intimately familiar with the Qunari
as a military body. The common image of the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.040
Qunari borders on zealotry. They seek to make
life's purpose through order. That purpose

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:58.120
is reason enough for the Qunari to campaign
against the races that already call Thedas

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.950
their home.
As Humans conquered the surface world, and

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.860
the Qunari bloodied them in turn; a race of
artisans, builders, and merchants toiled underground

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.230
within the Deep Roads, shaping stone and steel
into works of architecture. The Dwarves stretched

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.900
their home far and wide, adhering to a strict
four-tiered hierarchy that pontificated life

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.349
in the name of honor or coin. These nobles,
warriors, smiths, and outcasts built a culture

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:32.720
so fascinatingly self-sufficient, one cannot
help but be fascinated by them. The Dwarves

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.390
are crafty in their resilience and influence,
but many of their proud cities in the Deep

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.049
Roads have fallen to matters dark; for deeper
underground, darkness stirs. An enemy to all

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:51.049
things living- regardless of race or origin.
That enemy, the aberrations of flesh, are

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.090
called Darkspawn. And with the Darkspawn comes
the Blight.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.620
The Chantry teaches us that the first Blight
was caused by man, by mages who dared enter

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.579
the Golden City, the house of the one god
called the Maker. In their greed, the magisters

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:20.579
tried to capture the Golden City, but instead
were cast out...changed and corrupted. Carrying

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.350
the taint, a festering sickness of the blood
that manipulates the body to decay, they became

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.320
the first Darkspawn.
Twisted deformities mindlessly focused on

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.139
reproducing their numbers, the Darkspawn taint
the ground beneath their feet, turning the

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.139
lush surface world to dust. By call of the
Archdemon, they inflict an unfathomable amount

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.530
of destruction, and death.
Take heart though, because like any story

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.780
worth telling, evil has those who would oppose
it.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.690
There exists self-sacrificing heroes who endeavor
to stop the Darkspawn from infecting others.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.490
You see, if not for the Grey Wardens, the
flame of life would have been extinguished

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.490
on Thedas long ago.
To stay alive in this world, the sword and

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.500
bow are close companions. Battle is a way
of life; masters of it hold the most power.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.750
Even the tongue and quill are weapons. But
magic? Not every nation shares the same view

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.479
on the practice of the arcane arts. Some celebrate
magic and hold it as the defining factor of

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.550
those in power and politics. Other nations
believe that magic must serve man, and suppress

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.550
magic for the safety and security of non-magical
users. And in extreme cases, societies bind

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.630
and chain magic only for use as weapons of
war.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.789
For many, magic is taboo. It draws those who
use it closer to the Fade, the metaphysical

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:20.509
realm where spirits and demons dwell. Wars
have been won and lost over its use, and the

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:26.460
more Thedas is pulled into chaos, the closer
the Fade gets to being pulled into reality.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.009
These tears in the veil? Well, they are a
story for another day.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:37.699
For now. Know this…
The land lies rich in stories and history.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:44.699
As Thedas has persevered ages through constant
strife, its tales have also persevered.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.819
Join us as we travel the land and visit its
inhabitants, nations, religions, and cultures.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:58.380
See the wondrous land of Thedas through its
people’s eyes and discover for yourself

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.380
...the Dragon Age
