00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.010
Hi. Welcome to another filmmaking tutorial.
My name is Tom Antos.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.469
And today I’m going to talk about umbrella lights 
and their use in fashion, glamor photography and music videos.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.599
Here’s an example that 
we’re going to be working on.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.210
This is the original scene. 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.010
And we’re going to turn this

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.400
into this shot.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.320
This example uses only three lights.
As in most of my tutorials, I try to stick to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.310
as few lights as possible.
And also to lights that are available to

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.710
most people out there, so you can try this on your
production at home, but still be able to get

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.140
professional results.
So, the first thing I’ll start off is explaining

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.390
what are umbrella lights.
Umbrella lights are basically, as you see

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.290
in this example... an umbrella with a silver
lining inside it, which allows you 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.329
to bounce light off it.
It is very similar to any kind of a reflector.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.329
It’s used in photography or film or video productions.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.290
The difference is the shape of it. 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.290
Because of its curved shape, it bounces light 
within the umbrella... internally a lot more, 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.600
creating a very even, soft kind of a look.
Umbrella lights are sort of like soft boxes,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.610
but they are a little bit less directional
and the shadows, I would say, are even softer.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.960
Here is the light that I’m going to use
in this example.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.950
It mounts on a standard light stand.
You can buy this mount that holds 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.979
the light bulbs and umbrella together on eBay or in
any kind of a photography store. 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.979
Just look out there.
This one that I got cost me $80, I believe,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.810
altogether.
Basically, what it does, it mounts on a standard light stand

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.530
and then it will allow you attach an umbrella.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.130
The umbrella that I’m using in this example
is fairly large. It’s around 45 or 50 inches,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.200
I believe.
Which is probably as big an umbrella as you

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.989
will ever want. It will allow you to light
a pretty big area.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.090
Let’s say you’re lighting a model. You’ll
can light them from head to toe.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.090
You can see me up here mounting the umbrella
into this light stand...

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.060
And then up here, I’m going to put in two
light bulbs. These are fluorescent light bulbs.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.860
They are about a 100W each.
The reason why I’m using fluorescent 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.530
as opposed to tungsten lights is because this
umbrella that I have cannot handle 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.340
very high temperatures.
And since fluorescent lights produce 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.140
very little heat, they work perfectly.
If I were to put, let’s say, a 1000W tungsten light,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.700
it would probably melt the umbrella,
or set the whole thing on fire, 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.890
which is not the safest way to work.
Whereas these two fluorescent light bulbs

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.450
together they draw around 200W, yet the amount
of light they output is comparable to, probably,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.819
around a 600W tungsten light.
So, they’re pretty nice and strong.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.420
And basically what you do is point these light bulbs
straight at the umbrella, not at your subject.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.129
So that you’re not lighting the subject 
directly with the light bulbs.

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.620
Instead, what you’re doing is allowing the
light to bounce all over the umbrella and

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.230
then shine back onto your subject...
creating a big light source.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.810
Then, the second kind of a light that I’m
going to be using in this example is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.310
a 1000W tungsten.
These are actually Red Heads.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.659
You see me mounting them up here.
And here in the back I adjust them to “Spot”

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:57.659
so that they limit the amount of spill.
This way, they create this very concentrated

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.150
light source.
Here is a little diagram of how 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.159
the whole set-up looks.
We start with the camera... pointing it

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.340
at our foreground subject
and in the corner on the left side, 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.459
we’ll see our background subject leaning against
the post.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.459
Again, this whole set-up is located at the
back of this little restaurant / lounge, 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.240
that had a lot of very nice practical lights...
on the walls, the chandeliers that you see

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.629
there in the corner,
which add a lot to the overall look of this shot.

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.199
Once again, this is something that I talk
about in Tutorial 1 and then later on, 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:43.270
in Tutorial, I believe, 3. 
Production value, location, scouting, all those kind of things, 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.270
they all add up to the overall look of your shot.
So, it’s something to pay attention to.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:55.229
Then here I add the 200W umbrella, which is
just off to the left side of the camera

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.169
and around six feet away from the subject.
And then I just put two of the 1000W lights. 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.759
One aiming straight at the subject in the background
and just illuminating her.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.529
And then another one to the right side, slightly
behind our foreground subject... 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:18.719
creating  this rim light from the side. 
It adds a more dramatic touch to the shot.

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:23.860
And here is the final shot.
What it still is missing is a little bit of

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.479
color correction, 
which we’ll do at the end.

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.990
I want to show you a few more examples of
what you can do with umbrella lights.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.990
Here are a few photographs that I took a few
years back of this model.

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:45.360
In here, as you can see, what allowed me to
create this very even, soft kind of a light

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.139
 - no harsh shadows, as you can see; the skin
also looks very, very smooth and silky.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.189
That’s kind of what big umbrella lights
are good for, because they add 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:02.129
this very even and very soft reflection on the skin... 
or any metal object.

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.289
You can see up here when you look at the bracelet
she’s wearing.

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.330
Or also in the eyes of the subject or any
kind of shiny surfaces.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.960
It just adds this nice sparkle, this glamor
look to your shot.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:25.479
Now, we’re going to go back to our example.
Here is with the color correction 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:31.699
our final, final shot.
I’m intercutting it here with 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.069
a wider version of that shot.
All I simply did was I changed out the lens.

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:41.800
I started out on a 50mm lens 
and then I switched to a 24mm lens.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.100
And I didn’t have to readjust the lights.
This way I got two different kinds of shots

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.409
that I can intercut together.
And here is the final thing.

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:10.759
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial. If
you have any more suggestions, comments, 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:14.349
please leave them below and also,
if you create any videos yourself 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.890
using some  of these techniques 
that I explained up here, 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:23.990
feel free to respond to this video 
and I’m going to add it so others can see.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.990
And also, if you have any questions or comments,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.810

Thanks. Bye.
