00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.900
Essential oils are both exciting and promising

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.140
when it comes to taking care of your own

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.280
and your family's health.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.773
Whether you're applying essential oils topically,

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:23.755
enjoying the aromatic benefits through diffusion,

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:27.003
or taking essential oils internally,

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.789
the positive healthful effects of essential oils are boundless.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.272
That's why you'll want to ensure that the essential oils you are using are capable

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.726
of delivering on their promise.

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:42.100
You'll want to make sure that you are choosing essential oils for their potency and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.239
their purity.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.780
A lot goes into making sure that essential oils are both potent and pure.

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:54.268
Potency starts with the plant itself.

00:00:54.268 --> 00:00:55.610
The same species of plant

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.510
can be grown in different environments

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.440
will vary in composition.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.640
When plants are grown in optimal soil, temperature, and climate,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.220
they produce a higher quality essential oil just as nature intended.

00:01:07.528 --> 00:01:10.008
But that's only half of the equation.

00:01:10.427 --> 00:01:12.747
Purity places a major role as well.

00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:18.908
Many essential oils available for purchase are not certified pure.

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:22.288
Often, they contain synthetic fillers or other elements.

00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:23.488
that dilute and alter the purity.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.520
This diminishes the healthful qualities of the oil.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.940
doTERRA is committed to providing the purest,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.940
most potent essential oils possible.

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:38.456
We employ a global network of farmers who know

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:40.710
intimately the process of growing plants

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:42.136
for essential oils.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.400
They ensure the plant is taken care of properly

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.860
and harvest it at the proper stage.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.700
doTERRA has also perfectly melded modern advances and testing procedures

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.180
to ensure the purity and efficacy

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.260
of each essential oil.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.920
Every doTERRA essential oil

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.700
is put through the highest standard of rigorous and thorough testing.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.640
This testing protocol, CPTG,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.820
Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.080
sets the bar for quality, purity, efficacy, and consistency.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.060
When an essential oil is deemed worthy to be sold as a doTERRA essential oil,

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:28.924
you'll know that it has the highest quantity of

00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:34.100
active, beneficial constituents and that it is free of contaminants, and adulterations.

00:02:38.487 --> 00:02:42.167
Because at doTERRA, we know the same care and attention

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.940
as well as the same commitment to only provide the very best

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.260
is not unique to us.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.200
They're the same qualities you employ when taking care those you love the most.
