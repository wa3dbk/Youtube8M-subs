Howdy folks it is Barry here and it is time
to reply to some of the comments you left

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.860
on my last episode right Mum? Yeah I am good
hi! People love my mum. Did they? Yeah they

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.990
have been leaving loads of nice comments down
below and I have a few of them here including

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.199
a few random ones but just to clear my vocal
chords I have some sifu remember those things,

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.500
yeah I quite like them now although I was
told the f was pronounced as an s too so it

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.170
is like sisu. Loads of you have said about
my wedding, billions of questions about the

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.270
wedding lots saying what was the wedding like
I have not had the official photos back yet

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.750
but Mum you were there Mum had to be there
unfortunately you cannot pick family it was

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.430

mum got a little bit drunk of wine and bellini

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.890

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:08.310

My Mum is taking a sifu to enhance the vocal

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.299
chords so obviously you know what we are building
up to in a minute, haha no! Lucy says I am

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.799
loving the guests on the taste segments your
mum is hilarious can you give her a high five

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:27.799
from me there you go a high five to my Mum
there you go Lucy � that one is for you

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.020
Lucy.
Lyn says are you sure that is your mum she

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.899
looks so young? Now I can confirm this is
my mum I can confirm I have picture evidence

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.030
if you want to see it historically of the
growth and development of my mother she does

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.450
not always look like this, earlier she had
like an afro �hello mummy� open the door

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.130
and out she pops this is my mums house by
the way this is my mums house right I had

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.369
a really late night. I had a really late night,
yep she was up until 8pm no no no listen I

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.000
am talking to Lyn a moment Lyn C maybe or
L thankyou I can confirm that is my son and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.390
thankyou for what you said, you know what
it is like us women we try and make the most

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.010
of what we have got sometimes it works and
sometimes it does not. Yeah, make up does

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.480
wonders you have a wig I could try it on I
will look just like my mum I will go get it.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.280
So just to prove it I know I look like Garth
from Waynes World but we look quite alike

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.310
now Mum right apart from the lippy, a woman
has got to have her lippy no I have not got

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.970
to put my lippy on thank you very much that
is fine. Thinking about it the other day my

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.150
step Dad tony who is behind the camera did
actually send me a picture of my mum with

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.810
this wig on right and it made me think that
she had dyed her hair, here is a picture of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.360
the hair but it is kind of like a two tone
skunk or racoon thing going on right now with

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.510
my mum, I am ok I can live without it. Ok
what have you done to the dog? That is our

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:10.260
poor Yorkshire terrier emmie right there,
oh it is keeping her warm.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.440
Snazzynotes says do you have a caf� in west
London I swear I have seen you before that

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.210
is to me ok someone thinks they have seen
me in a caf� in London I do not have a caf�

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.040
in West London, in East London I do not have
a caf� at all, but if I was to have a caf�

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.430
somewhere, where should I have it? What do
you think? Well what do you guys think? Yeah

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.010
let us know down below and if there was a
virgin kitchen caf� what would it serve

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.790
what would you think would there be R Kelly
playing bump n grind on repeat all the time,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.800
the most amazing caf� the world has ever
seen. You could have giant and mini food,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.811
yes you would.
Yazan aladassi says that is a cool name isn�t

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:57.020
it Yazan oh my god where are you from Yazan
I cannot tell you that but I could stalk them

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.940
I guess he says is myharto your sis? Now myharto
do you know who she is she is an American

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.441
who does something called my drunk kitchen
which is a lot like my virgin kitchen and

00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.000
it is just a coincidence that we are called
those names we both started our channels a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.319
very similar time and she just gets drunk
and stuff and people have said recently that

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.620
I look a lot like her oooh I must check that
out but I think my mum is hiding something,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.850
we could be separated at birth something to
confess? I have nothing to confess ok but

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.700
maybe I could do a collaboration with her
one day you never know, I would quite like

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.760
to do that get drunk together and do jagerbombs
and stuff could do a jagerbomb with you! I

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.770
have never had a jagerbomb that was the plan
at the wedding but we did not get to that

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.710
there you go.
Alex Carroll says the swingers, we have to

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.840
hear it. So obviously if you have not seen
this video already my Mum confessed to me

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.630
that she used to sing and that was the first
time I knew this she used to be in a four

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.630
piece group called the swingers and I still
cannot get over and you said there was a CD

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.490
right no a record we did not have CD in those
days so not even a cassette a proper record

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.400
no it was an LP and it was a very, very long
time ago and I could not even tell you what

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:15.430
I sang and believe me *barry tries to sing
the song* no swingers was the name of the

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.790
group. Well what was the song called? I cannot
even remember it *Barry tries to sing another

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.520
made up song* and believe me you would not
want to hear me sing. This requires a lot

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.710
more digging and I will report back very soon
with a proper link to this song and even try

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.130
and put it on a separate youtube video and
maybe do a music video, get my mum to do a

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.080
separate music video on her own as all 4 of
them, imagine that.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:50.830
Reneesaysmeow says, meow? Yeah like a cat
you cannot say that why can you not say meow?

00:05:50.830 --> 00:06:05.419
Because meow is another name for stuff it
is! Meow meow is the name for stuff it is,

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.350
alright mum.
It�s wicked if you go into a studio or something

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.042
people could send fan art to jazz up a wall
that is something I mentioned right at the

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:16.580
last end of the episode was that I am potentially
moving out of my kitchen because there are

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.240
lots of reasons for it really it is more efficient
but if I move out of my kitchen I could make

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.720
videos 24 / 7 and go into some comedy and
gaming which I am keen to do too and also

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.130
you could drop in with biscuits and cake and
smiles like that idea? Yeah I like the idea

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.510
I think it would be good, I think we should
all maybe drop in one day? Yeah well people

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:43.169
can drop in as and when people just like reneesaysmeow
meow has said is that people can send in fan

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.890
art for the back of the wall and I can make
it look homely it would be a new virgin kitchen

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.401
and could look really cool my virgin kitchen
2 yeah and I could do my virgin gaming in

00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:56.460
there too a lot of love for a gaming channel
so I may do that on the side.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.630
So the next episode coming up I am doing a
knickerbocker glory recipe loads of people

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.570
have voted for that it is coming up and also
a day where I am doing lots of negative calorie

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:09.139
foods where you eat strawberries and celery
where you eat them and the calories are negative

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.590
so I am going to do a whole day of that to
see what it is like. Obviously there is sugar

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.270
in it and stuff like that so here is a list
on the screen right now of things let me know

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.320
down below what sort of stuff you would make
and what you want me to make and try to get

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.190
me through that day and we will see how it
goes but if you have any suggestions what

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.710
you want to see on the next episode let me
know down below, give my mum some love if

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.581
you want or some hate if you want, if you
have some weird stuff to send in for my mum

00:07:32.581 --> 00:07:36.440
to taste or other friends to taste, let me
know too, thanks for the love, see you next

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.660
time.
