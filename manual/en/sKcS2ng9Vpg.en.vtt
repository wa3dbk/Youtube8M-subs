00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.000
Stewed goose legs with apples and calvados

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.800
Now itâ€™s time for stewed goose legs with apples and calvados.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.500
Here are the ingredients:

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.100
2 goose legs,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.500
1 kg russet apples,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900
50 ml calvados,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
0.5l goose broth,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.000
salt,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.900
black pepper,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.700
2 tbsp sugar,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.000
2 tbsp butter,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.200
a few cloves,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.300
bay leaf,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400
whole black peppercorns.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.000
First I season the legs with salt and pepper
and let them rest for an hour.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.500
In the meantime,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I peel the apples, remove the seeds,
and dice them.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.400
Next I lightly brown the legs in a frying pan

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.200
and add most of the apples

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.600
along with a bit of sugar, 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100
cloves,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.100
bay leaf

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
and whole peppercorns.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.100
I pour in the broth

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
and calvados

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.100
and stew everything until the meat is tender. 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.400
Meanwhile, I heat 2 tablespoons of sugar in a frying pan

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600
and stir it until caramelised,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.700
then I add butter, 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.000
the remaining apples and I fry everything.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.400
The goose legs are best when served with fried apples
and baked potatoes.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.200
Enjoy goose on St Martin's Day.
