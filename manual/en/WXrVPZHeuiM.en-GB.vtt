00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.040
So we keep hearing about North Korea's weapons
capabilities but we thought it was a bit unclear

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.850
just what kind of missiles North Korea has
so we interviewed David Wright from the Union

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.039
of Concerned Scientists to find out just what
exactly North Korea could hit. Here's our

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.369
guide to North Korea's missiles.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.980
"North Korea have built a version of the old
Soviet scud missile and modified them to get

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.400
a somewhat longer range. It's thought to have
a range of something like 300, 500, maybe

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.760
600 kilometres which would allow them to reach
most of South Korea."

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.650
"Now the no-dong missiles are thought to have
a range of something like 1,000 maybe 1,300

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.480
kms with the same sort of payload up to about
a tonne. Really the concern with that missile

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.870
being tested is that Japan is within range.
Accuracy is not very good."

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.660
North Korea also have their original Taepo-dong-1
missile which technically could hit Tokyo,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.689
Shanghai, and Taiwan but the question is why?

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.759
The one that's been drawing alot of attention
recently has been called the Roosevelt in

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.149
the West. It's been seen in military parades
that North Korea has done and from that people

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.609
sort of speculated what it's capability would
be. Depending on what you think the technology

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.420
that missile uses, it could probably get up
to a range of about 3,000 km that gets it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.719
close to Guam but doesn't look like it would
actually be able to hit Guam.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.749
The other one is what's called the Taepo-dong-2
which is a ballistic missile which is thought

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.229
to be based on the North Korean space launch
vehicle they launched satellite with in December.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.610
We have not seen tests of that missile as
a ballistic missile. It seems to me they're

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.149
very likely to try and put one of the nuclear
weapons on top of it and I just don't think

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.420
based on the technology that it's able to
get more than 7500 to 8000 kilometres.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.340
Check out the time that the Harlem Globetrotters
went to North Korea and if you're interested

warfare is the future of conflict. But most
