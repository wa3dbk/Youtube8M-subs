(Female narrator):
See the view from Brisbane’s tallest building or get a bird’s eye view of Suncorp Stadium.

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:21.332
Welcome to Virtual Brisbane, Brisbane City Council’s computer-generated 3D model of the city.

00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:28.554
Keep watching to see how this innovative technology is helping us plan for our growing city.

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:37.055
Virtual Brisbane is a spatially accurate and interactive 3D model of the city’s CBD and inner 5 kilometres.

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:44.143
It allows planners to analyse proposed developments in greater detail than ever before.

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:50.692
By animating the proposed development in Virtual Brisbane, planners can view it from an unlimited range of aspects, 

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:55.189
including ground level, mid height and bird’s eye views.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:01:04.384
They can vary the time of day, weather conditions and assess the impacts of heights, orientation and design.

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:11.897
They can also consider other scenarios like adding extra parks and trees to support new development.

00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:14.578
Virtual Brisbane will also make it easier for residents

00:01:14.578 --> 00:01:19.864
to understand the future of their neighbourhood and city, and have their say.

00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:23.697
By incorporating Virtual Brisbane into the neighbourhood planning process,

00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:29.318
council planners will be able to show residents the impacts of changes in a 3D environment

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:33.578
much better than sketches or artist impressions.

00:01:33.578 --> 00:01:38.618
But the potential for Virtual Brisbane is far greater than just development assessment. 

00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:44.258
It has potential uses outside of Council for industry, government and education.

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:48.498
