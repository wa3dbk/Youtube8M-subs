00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.930
Hi.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.070
It is Binky and Scrumble, my little puppy,
from Made in Chelsea.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.330
Welcome back to my series at Binky's Beauty,
on Videojug, where I show you all my top beauty

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.180
tips and makeup looks each week.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.210
In this week's episode, I am going to show
you all a really cool, navy, smoky eye, which

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.110
is very on trend this season.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.820
First up, I am going to use the Bare Minerals
Eye Primer.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.250
It is a really creamy, lovely base for your
eyelid.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.150
Try it with your finger.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.580
This adds a really lovely shimmer to your
eye.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.230
But, also, it makes sure your eyeshadow does
not crease.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.910
Next up, I am going to use the Clarins Eyeshadow
Kits.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.940
This is called the Iris Blossom.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.460
I am going to use this dark shadow.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.190
Wash that across the eye in sweeping motions.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.670
Next up, I am going to be using the same darker
color, just a smaller brush, and put it across

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.440
my lower lash line.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.660

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.410
Now, I am using the Bare Minerals, and it
is called Wild Thing, Eyeshadow Palette.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.471
I am going to use this really cool blue.

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:07.580
And, I am just going to really pack it on.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.830
Brush along the eye line and then gradiate
up into the eye socket, not going up above

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.830
the brow line.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.490
Almost dab it on, so you get a really nice,
thick color.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.921
Now, I am just going to take a fluffy brush
and blend out these edges so it does not come

00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:27.730
across so harsh.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.710
Now, I am going to use the Guerlain Liquid
Eyeliner, but in blue.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.671
And again, as you might have seen from my
other video, I'm going to do little brush

00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.830
strokes across the top of the eye line.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.340
[Music]

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.350
Now, I am going to use Dior Show Blackout
Mascara.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.350
Great brush at the end.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.350
It applies really well.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.350
Nice and thick.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.350
And my bottom lashes.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.060
And then, I am going to use the Clarins blue
eyeliner pencil.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.640
I am going to put it in the water line of
my eye.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.939
And this comes out really well.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.000
There you have it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.770
I hope everyone liked this makeup look.

hannel.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.709
All of the products I have used you can get

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.849
Tune in next Friday, when I will be showing
you how to do a dramatic sixties eye.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.849
See you then.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:25.849
Bye.
