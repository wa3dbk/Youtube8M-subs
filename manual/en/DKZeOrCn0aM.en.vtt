00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.529
Welcome to this week’s Movie Math, where
the Melissa McCarthy’s express hit a serious

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.009
speed-bump.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.500
Yes it would seem that despite incredibly
strong buzz and reviews for Spy, audiences

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.680
simply couldn’t get over the bad taste left
in their mouths from her previous films - especially

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.000
Tammy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.250
Now obviously McCarthy and Feig hoped Spy
would be a palate cleanser, but apparently

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.650
no such luck as the comedy seriously underperformed
at the box office.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.760
Expected to come in at around forty million,
it barely managed to get thirty - which has

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.489
got to shake many suits in Tinseltown to the
core who’ve already invested in McCarthy’s

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.489
supposed star-power.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.570
Who’s Sony gonna call?

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.570
Bill Murray!

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.539
To BEG him to reconsider returning to Ghostbusters
once more!

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.210
I mean, while many of us felt a lot better
about Ghostbusters creatively after having

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.710
seen Spy - written and directed by Paul Feig
who will do the same for the Ghostbusters

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.570
reboot, with McCarthy once again starring
- these box office numbers are awfully sobering

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.890
from a business perspective.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.900
And if Jason Statham was stalling his Daredevil
deal in the hopes of getting a bigger payday

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.880
post Spy’s debut, it looks like now he’ll
have to take whatever Marvel and Netflix are

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.880
offering.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.520
In fact, don’t be surprised if the Bullseye
signing is announced any day now as Statham

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.460
and his team will be scrambling to secure
his future - which once again seems questionable.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.870
And while sure, Spy was yet another R rated
film in a year that’s been flush with them,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.560
McCarthy’s Identity Thief and The Heat were
also rated R and had much better box office

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.030
debuts.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.270
And while Spy could also gain a following
in the ancillary market further down the line

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.700
ala Austin Powers - a film which initially
bombed - McCarthy is SUPPOSED to be much farther

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.830
along in her career than Mike Myers was at
the time.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.300
And McCarthy’s wasn’t the only Hollywood
star to plummet back down to Earth.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.380
It was a tough weekend all around, as Insidious
Chapter 3 opened with roughly half of Chapter

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.400
2’s debut haul, while Entourage also underperformed
despite opening mid-week in a gambit to get

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.430
ahead of the competition.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.789
And while surely nobody expected Vincent Chase
to open as big as Carrie Bradshaw, it does

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.620
appear that the Entourage fantasy of movie-stardom
will remain just that - a fantasy.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.799
Nevertheless, Warner Bros is still gung ho
on HBO’s big-screen prospects, especially

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.689
with fan-phenom Game of Thrones waiting in
the wings.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.749
President of Domestic Distribution, Dan Fellman,
even name-checked the show while discussing

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.900
Entourage’s numbers with the industry trades.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.659
Sure he was referencing the recent IMAX release
of the final two episodes of Season 4, but

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.319
obviously Warner Bros is angling for a Game
of Thrones movie just as everyone on the show

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.629
is angling for the iron throne...

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.120
As for the rest of the box office, San Andreas
had a respectable drop in its second weekend

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.439
- dropping just one spot despite the onslaught
of new releases.

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.180
Pitch Perfect 2, Tomorrowland and Avengers
Age of Ultron also all dropped about fifty

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.569
percent, while Aloha nearly dropped out of
the top ten in only its second weekend.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.069
But all eyes are on Mad Max Fury Road, as
fans hope to see its box office numbers climb

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.090
high enough for a sequel.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.969
Industry insiders are equally curious, and
the Hollywood trades took note when the ambitious

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:23.680
- and expensive - actioner passed the three
hundred million mark worldwide over the weekend.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.489
Now as I’ve said before, Mad Max Fury Road
needs to top four hundred million for sequel

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.060
consideration, as that’s the point when
it will at least break even for Warner Bros.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.329
I know that the budget has been listed as
one hundred and fifty million, but that doesn’t

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.219
include advertising for the film - and it’s
important to realize that the entire movie

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.919
industry is pegging Mad Max’s TOTAL price
tag as at LEAST two hundred million.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.939
So it would seem that once again it’s up
to China to save another Hollywood blockbuster,

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.709
yet there are some rumors that it won’t
be released there - which would be a serious

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.169
financial blow for the film.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.239
Just a refresher, China only accepts a limited
number of foreign releases each year, and

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.329
they favor foreign films which have Chinese
participation.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.380
That’s why an increasing number of Hollywood
films not only have scenes set in China, but

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.650
also have Chinese co-financing.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.250
It’s also important to note that even when
a Hollywood film is released in China, the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.370
studio only gets about twenty to thirty percent
of the film’s local box office with the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.900
rest going to the Chinese government.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.789
So if by some miracle we do get another Mad
Max movie, perhaps it would be wise for him

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.360
to check out post-apocalyptic China...?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.860
Finally, it’s worth noting that specialty
release Love And Mercy almost cracked the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.900
top ten, as did Bollywood film Dil Dhadakne
Do.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.900
Neither had particularly strong per theater
averages though, illustrating just how dire

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.060
things are in the bottom half of the top ten.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.840
As for this coming weekend, Jurassic World
is looking to be the third film of the year

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.840
to open north of the century mark - not bad
considering it’s only June, and last year

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.700
just two films were able to boast such an
accomplishment.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.750
And that’s the weekend box office, breaking
down tinseltown!

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.900
I’m Grace Randolph and we just did some
Movie Math - as always, thanks for watching,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:25.280
and I hope you’ll go Beyond The Trailer
for these other top movies...
