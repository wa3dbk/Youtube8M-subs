00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:01.835
- [Voiceover] What I want to in this video

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:05.202
is get some practice figuring
out patterns and numbers.

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:07.524
In particular, patterns that take us from

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:10.903
one number to a next number in a sequence.

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:13.596
So over here, in this magenta color,

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:18.263
I go from 4 to 25 to 46 to 67.

00:00:18.263 --> 00:00:20.393
So what's the pattern here?

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:22.831
How did I get from 4 to 25

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:25.502
and can I get the same way from 25 to 46

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:30.308
and 46 to 67, and I could just
keep going on and on and on?

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:31.887
Well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:33.986
When I see 4 and 25, let's see,

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:38.026
25 isn't an obvious multiple of 4.

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:43.026
Another way to go from
4 to 25, I could add 21.

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:48.041
Let's see, if I add 21, 4 plus 21 is 25.

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:51.052
If I were to go from 25 to 46,

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:53.025
well I could just add 21 again.

00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:55.835
It looks like to go from
one number to the next

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:57.483
I'm just adding.

00:00:57.483 --> 00:00:59.573
I wrote 12 by accident, 21.

00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:02.684
I'm just adding 21 over and over again.

00:01:02.684 --> 00:01:07.166
That's going to be 46 plus 21 is 67.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.159
And if I were to keep going, if I add 21

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.110
I'm going to get to 89.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.110
If I add 21 to that I'm going to get 110,

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.955
and I could keep going
and going and going.

00:01:22.955 --> 00:01:27.157
I could just keep adding
21 over and over again.

00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:31.522
The pattern here is I'm adding 21.

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:34.471
Now what about over here, in green?

00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.607
When I look at it at first,
it's tempting to say,

00:01:36.607 --> 00:01:40.276
3 plus 3 is 6.

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:43.480
But then I'm not adding 3 anymore to get

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.290
from 6 to 12, I'm adding 6.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.147
And then to get from 12 to 24,

00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:51.096
I'm not adding 6 anymore, I added 12.

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:54.463
So every time I'm adding twice as much.

00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:58.389
But maybe an easier pattern might be,

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:59.884
another way to go from 3 to 6,

00:01:59.884 --> 00:02:03.738
isn't to add 3, but to multiply it by 2.

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:06.501
So I multiply by 2 to go from 3 to 6,

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.030
and if I multiply by 2
again, I go from 6 to 12.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.818
6 times 2 is 12.

00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:14.929
If I multiply by 2 again, I'll go to 24.

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:19.457
2 times 12 is 24 and I could
keep going on and on and on.

00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:23.520
2 times 24 is 48, 96, I
could go on and on and on.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.353
The pattern here, it's
not adding a fixed amount,

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:30.927
it's multiplying each
number by a certain amount,

00:02:30.927 --> 00:02:33.760
by 2 in this case, to get the next number.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.102
So 3 times 2 is 6, 6 times
2 is 12, 12 times 2 is 24.

00:02:38.102 --> 00:02:40.076
Alright, now let's look at this last one.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.908
The first two terms here
are the same, 3 and 6.

00:02:42.908 --> 00:02:46.117
The first two numbers here.

00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:47.833
I could say, maybe this is times 2,

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:51.223
but then to go from 6 to 9,
I'm not multiplying by 2.

00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:53.429
But maybe I am just adding 3 here.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.937
So 3 to 6, I just added 3.

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:59.327
Then 6 to 9, I add 3 again,

00:02:59.327 --> 00:03:02.276
and then 9 to 12, I add 3 again.

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:03.506
So this one actually does look like

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:06.432
I'm just adding 3 every time.

00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:09.633
The whole point here is to see,
is there something I can do,

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:12.142
can I do the same something
over and over again

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:13.814
to get from one number to

00:03:13.814 --> 00:03:16.786
the next number in a sequence like this?

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:18.637
What you want to make sure
is even if you think you know

00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:20.480
how to go from the first
number to the second number,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.175
you've got to make sure
that that same way works

00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:24.961
to go from the second
number to the third number,

00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:27.074
and the third number to the fourth number.

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.258
But here we figured it out.

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:31.323
In this first set of numbers,
we just add 21 every time.

00:03:31.323 --> 00:03:33.274
This one we multiply by 2 every time.

00:03:33.274 --> 00:03:37.083
This one we add 3 every time.
