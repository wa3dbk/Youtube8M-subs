00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.980
So what I've just demonstrated was just a
tune I just made up that is really the essence

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.070
of it is I'm trying to achieve a classic amp
sound.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.090
Like you might get in the '60's; if I was
back to Stax recording's, the Motown recordings,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.270
Steve Cropper, the Funk Brothers, really anybody
from that era that was just playing early

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.219
R&amp;amp;B; what you might find is an amp that's
a little harried, because its cranked and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.329
a tremolo, on board tremolo, setting within
the amp.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.940
People played; they weren't really pedals;
they plug right in to the amp and dialed everything

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.940
up.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.769
And this was similar to the sound the might
have gotten.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.539
I have an amp that was nowhere near what they
had back then.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.120
It's a two-channel Rivera amp, a great amp.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.629
I'm just going clean, and what I've done is
I've taken the tremolo that I believe sounds

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.440
closest to what an on board amp tremolo would
sound like, this Supa Trem by Fulltone.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.299
It's a very warm, analog sounding tremolo.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.140
And then my favorite pedal the Fulltone first
generation OCD Pedal, again drive all the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.190
way down.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.100
I'm basically using it as to emulate a cranked
amp, as a transparent sounding overdrive.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.110
So what I'm getting is a very musical representation
through pedals and through different settings

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.840
of what it would sound like if I was just
plugging my Telecaster into just an old, vintage

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.240
tweet amp.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.780
What I've done as far as the settings, very
simple, you drive all the way down on the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.170
overdrive pedal.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.200
Volume to match the clean, it'd be a little
bit of a boost.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.880
And then as far as the tremolo, I have it
about 12 o'clock.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.420
Mix and rate on like a medium to slow, slow
to medium speed on the tremolo.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420
It's not a hard tremolo.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.450
It's a soft tremolo.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.060
It's almost barely noticeable and that's what
gives you that very warm, rounded effect that

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.379
I think is really just pretty.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:18.190
I think that a lot of just slow R&amp;amp;B, ballads
work great with this.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.069
You really pop out of the mix.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.680
And I find that if you're backing up a singer
or if you're playing where you really have

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.139
texture; you're not really playing down beats.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.450
You're not really-- you're rolling the rhythm
section is really to add color and fill up

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.069
space with texture.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:49.140
I think this is a great effect to use for
that and it's a very natural sounding one,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:03:01.669
too.
