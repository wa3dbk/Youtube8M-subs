Hey, guys! Welcome back
to Fit Foods with me, Rob Riches.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.100
On today's show, I'll be addressing
a recent question that I read,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.900
which is, if I work out early in the morning,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.960
and I have to get up and eat breakfast,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.980
often when I get carbohydrates
or other starchy carbohydrate foods,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.980
I feel starchy during my workout.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.800
Great question, and at times
that I normally work out in the morning,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.520
I found the simplest way to get around this

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.220
is to just have protein,
high-quality protein, and healthy fats.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.920
Some might call it Paleo,
I just call it good healthy nutrition.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.080
Let's have a look at the ingredients

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.900
and whip up a recipe on today's episode.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.240
What we have here are simple ingredients,
but all high-quality,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.820
very nutrient-dense.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.900
We will start with 5 eggs

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.400
and include one yolk and all of the egg whites.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.000
A very fast highly-absorbable protein.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Really good in the morning.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.960
It gets into our body,
gets broken down, metabolized,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.580
and absorbed quicker.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.800
It's one of the fastest, most absorbing proteins.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.980
That's a great protein for the morning.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.980
To that we will add some chicken.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.200
We have about 4 ounces of cooked chicken.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.320
This is cooked from the night before.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600
So, it will be easy to chop up,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.840
throw into this egg scramble
that we're going to make

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.740
and just add a little bit more fats
and some flavour.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.500
I have about a 1/5 of avocado,
some healthy fats,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.780
a great smooth creamy texture.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.320
We also have some sliced grilled red peppers.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.140
I precooked these at the same time as the chicken.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
They are great to keep in a container

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
and get a handful
when you want them to make a salad

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.340
or, for instance, our eggs scrambled.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.660
Here I have goat cheese mixed with chopped chives.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.480
I always keep
a couple of table spoons of this in the fridge.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.920
Great to scoop out,
mix into a salad, add to some other dishes.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.460
It's going to work great onto our egg omelette.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.100
To finish off, just add a handful of spinach leaves, 
fresh baby spinach leaves.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.740
I'm going to tear these off, 
as the eggs are cooking,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.860
whip up everything together

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.320
and in about 5 minutes
all of this will be on the plate,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600
in a ready-to-eat,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.900
high-protein, nutrient-dense egg omelette.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.140
Let's get started!

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.820
Here we have it. The finished product.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.040
Our egg scramble with one yolk,
and the rest are egg whites.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.360
We also have the chicken in there.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.440
Altogether, this brings in,
at least, 45g of protein,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.580
fats, probably just nudging over 10g,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.220
and carbohydrates, 
really just thanks to that fiber

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.660
from the spinach 
and a little bit from that pepper.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.120
Quick to make and quick to eat. 
Highly absorbable.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.540
This you can whip up and make in 5 or 10 minutes.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.180
Eat it and be off to the gym in about 30 minutes.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.200
