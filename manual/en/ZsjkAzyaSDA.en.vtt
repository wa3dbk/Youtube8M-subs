00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.980
Hey everybody, 
welcome back to computertv.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.650
I'm Sam, 
and today I'm gonna talk about

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.250
the Nikon COOL PIX S230 
Digital Camera.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.920
Now take a look at this thing.
OK.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.990
It's really sleek looking, 
and this plum color is really nice.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.430
And this is a 
Premium Digital Camera.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.500
OK. It's a Nikon.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.990
So, 
Professionals use this stuff.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.930
And, I'm telling you guys, 
this is, you know,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.260
State Of The Art 
Digital Camera here.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.560
First of all, it's 10 Megapixels. 
That's humongous. OK.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.010
Has a 3x Optical Zoom,
and a 3" LCD Touch Screen. OK.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.880
Look at this.  Very large, 
and it's Touch Screen.  So that's cool.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.380
You know, not many of my friends have 
Touch Screen Cameras.  Very cool.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.950
Now, it has 17 Scene Modes, 
4 Movie Modes,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.260
Voice Recording, 
Rechargeable Battery,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.000
Also, 
SD and SDHC Compatible,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.470
OK, so that means you can get those 
extra large, you know, Memory Cards,

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.430
stick it in here, you know, 
you could have 8 GB of storage on here,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.940
that's gonna hold all your Pictures, 
plus some, alright.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.010
And it also has 
44 MB of Internal Memory.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.220
So, you know, 
it's got a little bit of storage built in.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.750
Alright, 
so let's get right to it.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.780
Right here, 
you see the Lens.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.820
And up top, 
you got the Flash right there,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.650
and when you turn it over 
you have your ON and OFF.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.190
And this is your 
Wide and Tight right here.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.560
So we're gonna turn it ON.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.690
This, again, 
is your 3" LCD Screen.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.100
OK, 
I'm gonna take a picture of myself.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.640
Alright, 
pretty nice looking, if you ask me.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.950
OK, now to see the picture 
that I just took,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.950
you just push this button, 
right here.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.950
This is your 
Playback Button.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.980
OK, 
and you can see it.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.860
And if you're wondering why my smile 
looks so nice, I'm gonna tell you,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.950
in just a minute.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.190
Alright, so lets go back.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.420
Now, you have a couple different options
from here.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.700
When I click this button 
right here,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.600
This is your 
Scene Selection/Mode Button,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.060
you click it here.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.730
Now we were in 
Smile Mode,  OK,

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.700
and Smile Detection 
focuses on the person's smile,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.740
and really makes it 
stand out of the image.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.150
So, it's a cool, you know, technology that
not a lot of Cameras, you know,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.680
had back in the day, but now, most Digital 
Cameras come with it, and its really cool.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.930
Now, this is a Touch Screen LCD, 
so we'll go up here,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.520
and you'll see, 
this you can choose from 17 Scene Selections.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.270
So let's say you're on a snow trip, 
you're on a, you know, surfing trip,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.730
it has a, you know, Scene Selection 
for that.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.440
What about Portraits? 
What about Fireworks, even?!

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.140
OK, you can't go wrong 
with this, I'm telling you.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.610
And be creative.  
Don't just stay in AUTO Mode.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.050
You need to explore your Digital Camera 
and all the different features that it has.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.750
Now, up top, you'll see right here, 
this is AUTO Mode,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.110
which we are in now.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.220
Now, to really make some adjustments 
and go to your Settings,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.230
down here, you see this button 
on your LCD Screen, called Menu

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.060
You just touch it, and right here, 
you get to ISO Sensitivity.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.940
Now, you guys know what that is, 
OK, that has to do with the light.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.930
And you wanna make sure that your pictures
don't come out too grainy in low light.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.910
So, this has a range of
80 - 2000.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.410
Alright, that is a killer range, 
I'm telling you guys.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.280
It is top of the line.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.950
Alright, so you go scroll down here 
with your arrows,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.290
and you'll see you can White Balance, 
you can set your Exposure,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.490
you can do a lot of things in here 
to make sure that your image comes out

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.260
just how you want it to.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.810
Alright, so, we're gonna get out of here, 
and we are gonna go back into Movie Mode.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.940
Now, like I said, 
you have 4 Movie Mode Settings.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.400
So you click right here onto Menu, 
and you go into Movie Options,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.430
and here you see you can 
make a Movie that has a 640 Resolution,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.110
or has a 320 Resolution.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.290
Now, this is perfect if 
you're loading you're Movies onto, you know,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.020
your Facebook Page, 
or onto YouTube.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.030
You don't want too big of a Movie, 
because then, it will take forever to load.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.600
I'm telling you guys, 
this is a really great feature.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.530
Alright, 
so we're gonna get out of here,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.230
and we're gonna go back 
into Play Mode.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.740
Now the cool thing about this Camera 
is that it's Touch Screen,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.440
and kind of like the iPhone,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.150
you just swipe along, 
and you can see all you images.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.220
That's pretty nifty.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.650
You don't see that a lot on
Digital Cameras.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.320
Alright, 
we're all done here.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.660
Now, when you are ready 
to hook your Camera up to your Computer,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.900
or your TV, 
you do that with this Port right here.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.640
This is your AV/USB Port.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.810
So you can watch all your Pictures 
on your Big Screen,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.710
upload them fast, you know, 
put 'em on Flickr, whatever you wanna do.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.150
And this has a 
Rechargeable Battery,

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.020
it's right here, 
in this slot right here.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520
And this is also where your 
SD Card goes.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.660
Rechargeable Battery 
is fantastic.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.830
Let me just tell you, 
you will really be happy

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.860
when you are out, on the go, 
and you don't have to stop, you know,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.270
at a grocery store, 
and get some extra batteries.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.640
OK, rechargeable, 
as long as you have your charger, you're set.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.110
Alright, 
so once again,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.810
this is the 
Nikon COOL PIX S230

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.010
It's a 
Premium Digital Camera.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.850
If you have to buy a gift,
Graduation's coming up,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.180
what about Mother's Day, 
Father's Day?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.520
Come on, 
look at this Plum color.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.460
I think your Mom 
might like this.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.020
It's a nice Camera.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.420
So,
we'll see you next time.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.530
I'm Sam, 
and have a great day!
