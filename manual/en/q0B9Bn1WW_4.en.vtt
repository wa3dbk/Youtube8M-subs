00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.280
Cloning 101

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.669
The ability to create a clone used to be science fiction.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:17.039
Dr. Ian Wilmut's group changed that in
1997 with the creation of Dolly the sheep.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.819
Since then the debate on applying the technique
to clone human beings has been ongoing.

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:29.019
Based on all the discussion, it may sound like
cloning, human or otherwise, is an easy process.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.960
Find out what is actually involved in the
cloning process by viewing our short animation.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.930
What are clones?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.930
Simply put, clones are organisms that have identical genetic material.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.810
In other words, the sequence of bases in their DNA is exactly the same.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.600
Long before the birth of Dolly the sheep, clones had
been observed in both nature and in the laboratory.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.010
When a couple has identical twins (or identical triplets, etc.),
the children are clones of one another.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.460
A plant cutting can also be used to generate a clone.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.690
Prior to 1996, it was thought that cloning an entire
animal could only be done with embryonic cells; 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.070
cells present in the early stages of an organism's development.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.190
In the 1950's, scientists generated entire frogs from embryonic frog cells.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.439
After a small number of cell divisions, embryonic cells start to
change into the different types of cells that an organism needs, 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.100
including cells that form muscle, blood, liver, etc.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.990
This process is called differentiation.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:50.829
Although each of these cells has the same genetic material, each cell
can only access the genes needed for its particular function.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.549
Before the experiment at the Roslin Institute,

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.320
it was thought that once cells differentiated,
they could not be used to generate an entire organism.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.289
For instance, in a sheep, udder cells could generate
other udder cells, but not an entire sheep.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.859
The scientists at the Roslin Institute solved this problem
by growing sheep udder cells under starvation conditions. 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.749
This put the cells in a state similar to embryonic cells.

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.759
This is called the G0 state.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.369
An egg cell was taken from another sheep.

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:37.569
The nucleus, which contains the genetic material,
was removed from the egg cell using a very fine needle.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.199
They then used electric shock to fuse one starved
udder cell with one nucleus-free egg cell.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:51.199
They made 277 of these fused cells.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.680
Although the egg cell came from a black-faced sheep,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.619
notice that the nucleus with the genetic
material came from the white-faced sheep.

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:05.329
These fused egg cells were then inserted into several different sheep.

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.549
These surrogate mothers were also black-faced.

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.459
Of the 277 fused cells, only one progressed to form a developed lamb.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.579
Dolly was born on July 5, 1996.

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.739
Scientists found that Dolly had the same
DNA as the udder cells she came from.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.559
She is a clone of these udder cells.

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:35.739
Dolly has given birth to a lamb named Bonnie, produced the natural way.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:44.859
Other lambs have been born at the Roslin Institute through their
cloning process; some carry genes that will produced usable human drugs.

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:53.769
A laboratory in Hawaii run by Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi was the
second group to successfully clone an animal from an adult cell.

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.099
They cloned mice using cumulus cells, a cell type found in the ovaries.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:07.859
The cloning method used by the lab in Hawaii was different
in two ways from the method used to clone Dolly.

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:15.699
First, the cells used to clone the mice were not
grown in culture, but instead were used immediately.

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:22.079
Second the nucleus was removed from the cumulus cell
and then directly injected into the egg cell.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:29.079
This egg cell's nucleus had already been removed.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.860
The Yanagimachi lab used coat color to track genetic heritage.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.789
The cumulus cell comes from an agouti (brown) mouse,
and the egg cell comes from a black mouse.

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.770
The egg cell now had the same genetic
information as the nucleus donor mouse.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.119
The egg cell was then activated and
implanted into a white host mother.

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:08.840
On October 3, 1997, the host mouse gave birth to Cumulina,
named after the cumulus cells she was cloned from.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.870
Cumulina is the same color as the mouse that donated the nucleus.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.729
DNA fingerprinting confirmed that Cumulina
had the same DNA as the nucleus donor.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.149
The scientists have taken cells from Cumulina to make more clones.

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:32.190
They have successfully made several generations
of clones and all mice seem normal.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.110
Dolly the sheep died at the age of six.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.840
Since the world said hello to Dolly,
several other animals have also been cloned. 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.709
Both Dolly and Cumulina were cloned from 
cells in the female reproductive system;

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:54.879
cows have also been cloned using ovary and cumulus
cells with the same method that was used to clone Dolly.

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.979
Pigs have been added to the cloned animal menagerie.

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.120
Scientists hope to use cloned pigs to grow
organs that can be transplanted into humans.
