00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.389
Everyone likes to think that they are not
affected by advertisements, but unless you

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.289
never seen a single advertisement in your
life, your choices are influenced and affected

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.619
by all the advertisements you’ve ever seen.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.820
Every advertisement changes our opinion on
the brand or product.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.570
You may see some advertisements where you
think “why would anyone decide to buy this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.000
product after seeing this”, but the purpose
of advertisements is no longer to have the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.710
consumer immediately pick up the phone and
buy the product.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.300
The purpose of these advertisements is not
to inform the consumer about the product and

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.510
it’s features.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.530
The reason companies like McDonalds, who have
almost universal recognition, still advertise

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.740
is because they are trying to build an opinion
and corresponding “brand image” in their

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.429
consumers minds.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.100
There are two main psychological methods that
marketers use nowadays for their advertisements.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.610
The first method is called the “mere exposure”
method.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.830
These are those minimalist, bare bones advertisements
that make you scratch your head and wonder

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.750
why the company would spend thousands of dollars
on them.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.130
It’s because everybody is more comfortable
in groups.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.700
If one line at the bank is considerably longer
than the other, people will almost always

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.909
go in the longer line, because they think
there must be a reason that people choose

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.280
one line over the other.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.590
They think that one line is better than the
other, or one line is more correct than the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.590
other.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.320
It’s just an easier and more comfortable
decision.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.229
It’s the same kind of idea in consumer psychology.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.969
By exposing the consumer to the brand, the
consumer starts to feel like they know it.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.820
Because of this, when the consumer goes to
the store to buy detergent, they can reach

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.780
for Tide and be comfortable in this decision.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.049
The Tide detergent might be a couple dollars
more than the store brand detergent, but they

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.310
know that this brand detergent will work well.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.340
It wouldn’t be such a huge brand if it didn’t
work well.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.820
A greater example example of this phenomenon
is painkillers and other over the counter

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.950
drugs at the pharmacy.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.410
The generic brand drugs are the exact same
product as the name brand, with the exact

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.420
same composition of ingredients.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.360
If they had a different composition of ingredients,
they would not be allowed to be called the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.020
same drug.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.190
Advil and generic ibuprofen are the exact
same product, with the exact same composition,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.859
but still people will buy Advil despite it’s
steeper price.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.940
It’s just easier to choose what everybody
else chooses.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.190
The consumer tends to be anxious to buy the
cheaper, generic brand drug.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.190
Does this mean that you should always buy
the generic brand drugs?

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.989
Well not necessarily.

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.560
In a study by the University of Cincinnati,
Parkinson's disease patients were given two

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.620
drugs, one of which they were told was a more
expensive, name brand drug, the other being

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.579
a less expensive, off brand drug.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.740
After taking the supposedly more expensive
drug, the patients had a 28% greater increase

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.290
in motor skills than after having taking the
supposedly cheaper drug, while in reality

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.550
both the injections were just saline solution.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.459
The expectations were higher for name brand
drug, therefore the patients felt better because

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.709
of a placebo effect.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.620
So sometimes spending more will make you feel
better.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.550
The other common psychological method used
in marketing is the “classic conditioning”

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.550
method.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.620
The idea behind this technique came from a
study done by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.400
in the 1890s.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.280
Pavlov noticed that his dogs would start to
salivate whenever he would enter the room

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.430
even if he didn’t have food.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.090
This was because the dogs had an expectation
that they would receive food when Pavlov came

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.590
into the room because every time he did have
food he would walk into the room,.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.641
Pavlov decided to start ringing a bell whenever
he gave food to his dogs, and after a while

00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:16.900
the dogs would, whenever they heard the sound
of a bell, start salivating.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.019
This is because the dogs were trained to associate
the sound of the bell with food coming.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.040
They were trained to have the expectation
of food.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.770
The same psychological principle works with
humans.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.080
Brands will try to have certain feelings,
reactions, or images associated with their

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.340
product.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.840
If in their advertisements they show certain
images in conjunction with their product,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.790
the consumer will subconsciously relate the
images to the product.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.039
The best part of this technique is that it
always works.

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.520
No matter how much you try to block out the
advertisements, as long as you see them, you

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.500
will start to subconsciously relate the two
images.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.050
Car brands are the biggest culprit of using
this sneaky technique.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.620
Their advertisements rarely have anything
to do with the actual car, but rather about

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.750
someone driving the car.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.819
Luxury car brands will show people in black
tie pulling up to a red carpet event, while

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:18.050
suv advertisements will show some adventurous
looking couple with kayaks and bikes in tow

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.620
driving on some dirt road.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.639
At this point you’re barely buying a car,
but rather a lifestyle.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.469
You’re buying into the image of being someone
that goes to black tie events, or spends their

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.570
weekends being adventurous.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:39.020
The car barely matters at that point, it’s
the image that you’re buying.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.680
Perhaps the greatest advertising success in
recent memory is the beats headphones brand.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.990
Beats controls 27% of the $1.8 billion headphone
market, despite making, what are generally

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.349
agreed upon to be mediocre sounding headphones.

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.159
The New York Times reported that the actual
manufacturing cost of Beats headphones, which

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:06.090
sell for upwards of 250 dollars, is about
14 dollars.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.379
The reason Beats are considered such a premium
product is because of their marketing and

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.099
brand image.

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.360
From the beginning, Beats spent a huge amount
of money to pay for celebrity sponsorships.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.970
All the most famous athletes were wearing
Beats in their interviews, so the consumer

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.409
started to get the idea that these are these
were fashionable, high priced headphones.

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:33.039
The high price; solid, heavy materials; sturdy
packaging; and celebrity endorsements all

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.400
raised people’s expectations, and likely
psychologically made the headphones sound

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:52.220
better, just like with the name brand medicines.
