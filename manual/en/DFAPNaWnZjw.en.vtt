00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.180
Hey, what’s going on guys?

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.930
Troy here with MuscleTactics.com and I got
three awesome supersets that will get you

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.210
guys those ripped six-pack abs, so let me
dive right into the first superset here.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:22.170
First one, I have this little ball here with
the handles.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.090
You can use the regular medicine ball as well.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.050
What we’re going to do is we’re going
to, I believe these are called Cocoons.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.430
We’re going to get a nice stretch.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.250
We’re going to lengthen our entire body.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.570
Then we’re going to crunch in.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.680
So, we’re going to do that for 15 reps.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.340
And then we’re going to dive right into
Weighted Russian Twist, so let me demonstrate.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:01:11.120
And you want to go nice and slow and controlled,
especially on the way back, it’s lengthening.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:24.390
And 15, we’re not going to rest, so we’re
going to swing, swing right into Weighted

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.590
Russian Twist.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:54.870
And if you guys want to make this more challenging,
you can actually do what they call a kick

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.750
and twist, where you rotate.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.410
And that’s a good one for you guys who are
advanced.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.579
In the second superset we’re going to do
Abdominal V-Ups.

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.579
So you’re going to just kind of rock back
and forth on your butt.

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.849
And you’re going to go straight up and then
you’re going to really crunch and contract

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:16.930
your abs on the way in.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.810
Then we’re going to go straight into Straight
Leg Oblique Crunch, which I’ll demonstrate

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.810
on through.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.129
So here we go.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.569
So it’s very important to completely flex
those legs straight, crunch in.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.480
You shouldn’t be off balance.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:47.769
Nice and centered.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.230
Now straight into Oblique Crunches here, so
you’re going to rest on one side.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.739
Keep your body in a straight line.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.049
You feel it right here.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:09.159
Switch sides.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:36.680
And it’s really going to target the entire
side of your obliques.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:49.390
All right, third abdominal superset.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.489
We’ve got a killer oblique one.

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.189
We’re going to go Weighted Side Bends right
into Dumbbell Wizards.

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.310
So this is going to really target right and
left side of our obliques.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.019
Let me dive right into it.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.519
So it’s easy if you just grab a weight plate
here or you could do a weighted dumbbell.

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.579
You’re going to bend to one side.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.329
Get a nice stretch right here on the way back.

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.720
It’s going across your body.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.060
Keep it slow and controlled.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.400
Rock from one side to the other.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.840
Switch sides.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:39.680
And you get a nice pinch here on your lower
obliques.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.530
It’s going to really target right where
I’m pointing.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:57.819
And now we’re going to 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.740
transition this right into Abdominal Wizards.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.569
So you’re going to start on one side of
your body.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.650
You’re going to swing the weight across.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.139
Think about using, think about me swinging
the weight across using your obliques to power

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.139
through that movement.

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.800
You want to keep your abs under tension the
entire time.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:28.550
So get a good rotation.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:58.699
That was a tough, those are three really tough
supersets.

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.669
Super important when you’re working your
abdominals, you want to put overloaded weight

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:02.669
on your abs.

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.530
Your abs are a muscle just like any other
muscle that you’re going to work.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.099
So if you guys want to sculpt those really
ripped, aesthetically-pleasing six-pack abs,

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.669
make sure you throw some overload on them.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:49.419
Try these three supersets.
