00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:08.760
(upbeat music)

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:13.807
Hi, there.

00:00:13.807 --> 00:00:16.518
Today I'm going to show
you a simple salad.

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:19.512
In fact, it's called Simple Persian Salad.

00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:22.440
Now Persia is the former
name for country Iran.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.484
And in Iran and throughout
the Middle East,

00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:27.271
ingredients like cucumbers, onions, herbs,

00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.949
citrus fruit, and vegetable
oils are all food staples,

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.326
and I'm using all those
heart healthy ingredients

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:34.620
in our salad today.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.331
So, let's get started.

00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.498
So first, I have two
peeled, seeded, and chopped

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:42.455
cucumbers here that I
just chopped into small

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:43.653
fourth inch cubes.

00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:46.522
That goes into my bowl here.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:49.017
(spoon scraping against bowl)

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.472
Next, these are four medium tomatoes

00:00:52.472 --> 00:00:54.972
that I've already diced into small cubes.

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:57.391
In they go.

00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:01.437
And one diced, medium red onion.

00:01:01.437 --> 00:01:03.315
I like to use red onions for this salad

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:05.149
for the color and the strong flavor,

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.819
but you can use any type
of onion with this salad.

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:16.494
Next, two tablespoons of
fat-free feta cheese crumbles,

00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:20.908
and now a bit of mint.

00:01:20.908 --> 00:01:23.168
This is one tablespoon of dried mint,

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:26.214
or you could use one-fourth
cup of chopped fresh mint.

00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:28.590
This is another staple in Persian cooking.

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:33.720
If you don't have mint, you
could use parsley instead,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.972
another popular Middle Eastern herb.

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:38.516
Okay, so I'm going to mix all this up,

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:42.228
(spoon scraping against bowl)

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.613
and then put it in the
refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:53.823
That will put a nice
chill on the vegetables.

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:03.533
Now, while that sits in the fridge,

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:05.210
I'll make our salad dressing.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.962
This is a super simple salad dressing,

00:02:07.962 --> 00:02:11.091
only three ingredients,
but it is still very tasty.

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:14.177
So in this small bowl,
I'm going to add the juice

00:02:14.177 --> 00:02:15.302
of two limes.

00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:28.941
And now to this lime juice,
I'll add in one tablespoon

00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:30.862
of extra virgin olive oil,

00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:38.369
and lastly a half teaspoon black pepper.

00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:43.099
Now, I'll give that a good whisk

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.044
(whisk tapping against bowl)

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:48.244
and that should do it.

00:02:48.244 --> 00:02:49.291
Easy, right?

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.757
Okay, so now my vegetables
have had time to chill

00:02:52.757 --> 00:02:55.424
and we are going to put this all together.

00:02:55.424 --> 00:02:57.178
I'm just going to pour
the dressing over the

00:02:57.178 --> 00:02:58.681
chilled veggies,

00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:03.684
and then toss well.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:12.444
And there you have it,

00:03:12.444 --> 00:03:14.361
simple Persian salad.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.656
This is a terrific salad
to go with chicken,

00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:19.284
fish, or pasta, really
just about any main dish

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:20.411
that you are serving.

00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.578
And you can make it a main meal salad

00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:24.455
by adding some healthy protein to it

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:27.334
like grilled chicken breast
or beans, like chickpeas.

00:03:27.334 --> 00:03:30.420
And this is a recipe that the
kids can help you make too.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.421
So, until next time, enjoy.
