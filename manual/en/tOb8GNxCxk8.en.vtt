00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:06.351
I’m at the very start of this series, it’s a very stimulating process, 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.920
very new, where the work starts to dictate its own rhythm, 

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:13.000
starts to dialogue with a different intensity 

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:15.000
and suggesting different paths all the time.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:19.975
 With each new piece, it seems that they already start to procreate,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.310
 developing into new works and indicating these paths. 

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:31.494
And here we can see these pieces first hand. 

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:39.206
And I introduced the motion after a meeting with a group from Rio called Intrépida Trupe, 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.910
last year, they invited me to participate in a show, 

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.621
and during the rehearsals, while making the choreography, 

00:00:48.251 --> 00:01:00.251
a piece from the “Grades” series was balanced on another piece, causing a movement that was incorporated into the show. 

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:10.002
I was at the rehearsal, I saw how this moment arose and that it where the motion came from. 

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:16.449
And immediately I thought that could be a new path for the work. 

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:24.346
So I started to do various experiments and what we can see here is the result of those experiments. 

00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:30.303
the fuse was already there, and that was the spark to start the series. 

00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:37.687
Since then there have been several developments, and I changed the material, 

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:41.522
now I'm working with 1 inch solid steel rod, 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:52.009
and these works ask the public to participate, 

00:01:52.942 --> 00:01:57.942
in fact, it’s the spectator who activates the work and makes it work. 

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:07.575
And the pieces come to life. 

00:02:13.603 --> 00:02:16.603
... as if the spectator were turning the piece on, 

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:19.614
starting it up.
