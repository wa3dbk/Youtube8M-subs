00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.880
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.690
 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.460
At the end of my middle school, I received a scholarship  in Singapore 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.720
on a Highschool International Baccalaureate Program, IB

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.120
 I could choose 6 subjects to study so I thought,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.620
it would be best if I could study something 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.540
that would help later with my career in college.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.640
We Vietnamese students tend to choose science, math, or economics subjects 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.000
because most of us were seem to be really good at those.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.100
Unfortunately not everyone fits into that group.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.920
I’ve always loved arts 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.980
so I wanted to apply to art and architecture colleges in America.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.740
I know decisions like this come with a lot of difficulties, 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.400
especially for us Vietnamese girls due to the cultural prejudice,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.820
pressure from family and friends and mostly our lack of guidance and confidence. 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.880
Everyone tells you to study for fame and money, 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.120
not for happiness and passion. 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.820
Practicality as they say. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.460
So if you want to follow your passion, 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.340
you have to be confident, and persistent.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.500
Did I have any difficulty applying to US college? 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.120
Plentiful indeed. 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.700
At that time I didn’t know where to look for advice

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.300
 since my Singaporean counsellors didn’t know much about art schools. 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.640
None of my friends know how to make a portfolio. 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.300
Back in the day, I had to physically 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.060
mail my portfolio through the post office. 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.860
This means the prints had to be really well made, 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.080
the paper material had to be carefully chosen. 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.081
Now you can submit online portfolio. 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.160
With Issuu, Wix, and Tumblr, things are much easier.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.120
There are many online tools like them to assist your work

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.380
You can look up coongcu.com to learn how to use those tools

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.820
This website has very well made tutorials that 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.449
Vietnamese can learn from other young people around the world.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.719
This stems from a six months long project, that

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.059
 I and other three passionate Vietnamese students have been working on. 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.100
I hope you will make use of it.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.411
Thoughts about Ivy schools like Harvard, Yale, Columbia, 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.900
top 100, or top 50 and so on

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.810
Well, I think it’s a great if you get accepted, 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.870
but if you don’t, it still doesn't matter.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.820
It's you who make the name of where you go to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.960
Your college’s reputation doesn't define who you are

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.660
After I made the decision to study Architecture, 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.140
i have had opportunities to intern 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.320
in 4 American cities: Cincinnati, Hawaii, Chicago &amp; Boston

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.120
I'm currently exchanging one semester in Paris, France

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.900
Honestly I didn't really expect that 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.700
I would be given this much opportunities

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.800
That’s why it’s you who can direct your own life 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.520
regardless which college you go to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.200
when you choose America your destination

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.980
 If you have any passion, you should definitely give it a try 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.050
because you can study different majors within one school, 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.660
be it business, fine arts or biology. 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640
You don’t have to declare your major 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.320
until your sophomore year so try it. 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.880
Even if you fail, do it again. 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.990
My life motto is ...

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.730
 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.269
 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.949
Goodluck!
