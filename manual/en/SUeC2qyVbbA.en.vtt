00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.620
What do you know about Trane vs Rheem air
conditioning?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.719
Trane is far better on quality than Rheem.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.549
Rheem is not a generic brand.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.870
In fact, their generic brand is Ruud.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.140
Ruud is properly named, given how often you’ll
want to curse at the manufacturer, installers

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.930
and repair people.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.320
I was asking about Rheem and Trane.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.360
Rheem’s quality is almost as bad as Ruud’s,
and they are both far less reliable than Trane.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.280
How would you rate Rheem’s warranty?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.490
Assuming they answer the phone and you do
not get a rip-off installer or repair person?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.760
Mediocre.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.920
I need specifics.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.350
Their part warranty is very limited, with
the limited warranty lasting up to ten years

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.210
on some components and twelve months on others.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.470
And the warranty is void if the unit is not
registered within two months of installation.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.670
Then I’d have a reason to blame the installer
for the problem.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.850
It gets worse.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.470
The home builder or prior owner might not
have filed the warranty, and so you do not

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.760
know it does not have a warranty until you
contact the company.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.490
They keep talking about their extended warranties.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.310
Of course they do.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.840
It is a profit center, and that warranty still
has all kinds of limits and exclusions.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.310
What do you think of Trane’s warranty?

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.170
Trane has a ten year warranty on almost all
the parts in the AC.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.580
The compressor, I think, is actually warrantied
for twelve years.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.729
I thought that was the most likely part to
break.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.299
It is certainly the part that matters to you
most – if it breaks, the unit dies.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.619
What type of reviews does Trane get?

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.290
Depending where you get your information,
it ranges from one to one, to two to one,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.290
negative.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.150
In contrast, brands like Goodman have three
or more bad reviews to every five star review.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.420
It could be worse, like an American Standard.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.490
American Standard is made by Trane.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.759
Well, I guess I’m OK as long as I don’t
make anything made by Rheem.
