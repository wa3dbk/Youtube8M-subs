Hi i'm Ryan from Dream Engine and today
I'm going to share some tips on how to

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:14.040
interview someone on video. Interviewing
someone on camera can be tricky if you

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.910
don't ask the right questions in the
right way an interview can quickly

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.640
become stale boring or inauthentic, so
I've compiled a few tips for you so you

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.779
can make sure that the interview you're
filming is as engaging and professional

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.140
as possible. Open versus closed questions
when interviewing someone getting the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.149
best answer is obviously a top priority
and while asking the right question is

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.700
crucial how you ask the question is just
as important so asking open-ended

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.059
questions is the best way to get the
response you're looking for

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.250
for instance asking do you enjoy your
work is going to elicit a simple yes or

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.239
no answer but if you ask what are you
working on at the moment

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.890
this is an open-ended question and it'll
give you a far better response because

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.820
it allows your interviewee to open up
and it'll give you much better content

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.100
for your video ask them to repeat the
question when answering the question

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.350
have your subject include the question
in their answer if you ask what is the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.979
best part of your job
the answer will then start with the best

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.869
part of my job is etc this simple
technique will help you to remove the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.759
questions from your video in the editing
and it'll give their answer context so

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.520
the audience knows exactly what they're
talking about prepare your questions

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.329
have your questions prepared before the
interview this might seem obvious but

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.970
it's a common mistake for interviewers
to maybe be overconfident or lazy before

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.020
the interview and just try to wing it so
think about what information you need

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.130
from your subject and what type of
questions will get the response you want

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.780
there's also room to improvise of course
so if your subject starts to talk about

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.310
something interesting go with it and ask
the appropriate natural questions

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.770
because if you stick too rigidly to your
prepared questions the conversation and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.750
rapport with the interviewer you can
suffer don't give out your questions to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.790
get the best
most natural answers possible. It's

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.750
usually best not to give you questions
out before the interview you can give a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.670
general idea on what kind of questions
you'll ask but if the subject tries to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.470
prepare their answers you run the risk
of the interview becoming robotic and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.950
stale. Stop talking. Keep your questions
short and to the point if you ask a

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.270
long-winded question the subject may
forget the point of the question or not

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.470
understand exactly what you're asking
once you've finished asking the question

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.510
stop talking unless you're going to
appear in the video don't make any

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.570
noises such as yeah or okay or hmm you
can nod in gesture but keep it quiet

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.620
this will make sure your voice isn't
picked up in the audio and will reduce

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.620
the editing time give them the final
word at the end of the interview ask if

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.250
you've missed anything or if there's a
topic that your interviewee wants to

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.350
talk about as prepared as you might be
sometimes the best information will be

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.850
something you hadn't even thought of to
ask so following these simple tips will

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.230
help you to get some great content from
your interviewees I'm Ryan spanger and

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.030
this is another web video marketing
