00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.860
Although technically the third outing for
Cut the Rope on the App Store, Experiments

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.090
is the first solo release for ZeptoLab giving
it a very similar parallel to the release

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.060
of Angry Birds Seasons by Rovio last year.
However, instead of simply adding a thematic

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.970
spin on things, Experiments adds to the world
by not only introducing players to a new character

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.590
(The Professor), but also by switching up
the puzzles with timing-based challenges to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.390
test your skills with new and old contraptions.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.520
As before your goal is to get the piece of
candy to Om Nom, hopefully collecting up to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.910
three stars in the process. The candy is subject
to the basic effects of gravity, amongst other

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.390
physics-based restriction, which is where
the use of ropes comes in, allowing you to

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.940
swing and adjust the path of the sweetie as
it arcs through the air or floats away in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.079
a bubble. Everything is handled by simple
tap and swipe controls, intuitively popping

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.760
bubbles, activating whoopee-cushions and slicing
rope as required, giving you ample opportunity

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.360
to concentrate on the puzzle at hand instead
of obscure gestures.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.710
Experiments cuts to the chase straight away
by packing in a hefty amount of tools from

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.219
the original game within the first 25 levels.
New-comers may feel a bit overwhelmed, but

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.890
if you've spent any time with the original
you'll blast through without much challenge.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.860
Where the game really starts to take off is
in the introduction of two new tools, the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.080
rope gun and suction-cups. Both fit in well
with the new overall theme of Cut the Rope's

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.110
puzzles as they require careful timing to
use effectively, making them all the more

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.270
important to master when faced with moving
stars that are about to disappear from the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.270
level.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.530
That isn't to say the whole game has shifted
towards this break-neck-paced style of trying

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.250
to solve a puzzle in seconds - plenty of thought-provoking
brain ticklers are included to test your problem

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.170
solving skills. And who wouldn't want to wait
around? The series' signature super-cute graphical

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.100
style is in full swing with Om Nom reacting
to the candy flying around the stage with

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.020
a host of adorable animations. Should you
fail a round you'll also be encouraged by

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.710
The Professor to continue on, making it hard
to get upset when you're trying to perfect

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.310
a complicated maneuver.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.670
Considering the sizable amount of content
in the original game, it's easy to consider

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.360
Experiments to be more of a paid-for expansions
rather than a true sequel, but for those itching

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.390
for more content (which is likely to be anyone
who owns the original) it's a small price

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.960
to pay to experience some new puzzling challenges.
It will be interesting to see where ZeptoLab

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.590
ends up taking Cut the Rope, especially with
this release adding more story-based depth

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.599
to the world, but until then it's a great
way to kill an hour or so after conquering

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.379
the original game.
