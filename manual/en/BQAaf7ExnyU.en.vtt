00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.800
Everything ends

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.500
Even the brigthest bonfire will fade to embers

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.380
We've all seen that before

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.840
Embers holding on to a fragile flame

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.140
You had a life before this

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.420
There was a woman, a home, a child...

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.960
A curse

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.180
Your woman, your home, your child, right?

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900
What happened to them?

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.740
You don't remember

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.240
What you do remember is the curse

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.660
You struggle against it but it consumes you

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.260
And you experience death

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.960
And in death you dream

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.520
You dream of a lost kingdom

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.460
A murky forgotten land

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.660
A place where souls may mend your ailing mind

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880
Then you live once again

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.660
Who were you before you died?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.560
When did you get to this forest?

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.280
Dosent matter. Push on

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.480
But you are tired. So tired

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.160
Now all you remember is that your memory is fading

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.020
But wasnt there something else?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.700
There were important memories, they were everything to you

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.660
Now they've melted away

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.580
And you are agonized by their loss

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.500
You're aggrieved by this curse

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.720
And so you trow away everything you used to be

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.620
And gain a new purpose

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.040
Discover the origins of the curse

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.500
And use the legendary souls of Drangleic to maintain your sanity

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.600
But soon you realise

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.660
You are not the only one who journeyed to Drangleic   with this goal

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.740
Drangleic...

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.500
Once Drangleic was a mighty kingdom

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.280
Led by a wise king and a mighty queen

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.820
But giants from a far off land waged war with the kingdom

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.360
To reclaim something that was stolen from them

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.140
The giants were repelled

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.200
But the weakend kingdom soon fell victim to the curse of the undead

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.580
Hollowed soldiers overcame the lands

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.680
And the king who once had the strength to lead his people

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.140
Also found the strength to fight them

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.180
But something went wrong

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.380
The king has locked himself away

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.440
And no one has seen the queen

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.560
The kingdom of Drangleic is in decay

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.280
Everything will crumble and waste away so that something new may be born

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.500
Drangleic

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.420
It bears resemblance to a place we once knew

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.280
A world with struggle between light and dark

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.380
A kingdom with a sinner, a king, a doomed betrayer and a mass of the dead

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.300
A land where the curse of men reflects the curse of the world

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.980
Every flame turnes to ashes

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.720
Kingdoms rise and fall

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.360
Some light, some dark

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.660
All struggling for new beginnings with a fragil flame trying to survive among the embers

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.700
But perhaps struggling is the fires ordinary state

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.260
The curse of life is the curse of want

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.180
And so your peer into the fog

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.260
In hope of answers...

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.180
