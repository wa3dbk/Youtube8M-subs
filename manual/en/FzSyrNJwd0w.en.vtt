00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Those look like bass to me how they're real
close to the bottom and kind of lined up along

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.289
the bottom. They're right on the edge of where
it came out of that creek channel and got up on that hard spot.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:35.560
I just missed one. On that one cast I've had
three strikes already. That's one thing I

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.560
like about a spoon. When you've got them grouped
up in an area the deal is you're trying to

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.980
get the fish to be really competitive with
each other. So you've got to get one fish

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.980
to get amped up to chase the spoon and bite
it. That will get the rest of them started

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.489
in their own little feeding frenzy. That is
when you can really get in there and jack

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.460
on them. But with a spoon what is nice about
it is that it's a big profile bait. If you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.560
lay this spoon down next to a crankbait, a
swimbait, a worm, or a jig. It's a lot bigger

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.870
than those other baits. I just missed another
one right there. The nice thing about a spoon

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.720
is with a lot of other baits you set
the hook and miss the fish you just have to

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.970
wind up and go again. But with a spoon you
just let it go right back to the bottom. Sometimes

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.530
it won't even make it back to the bottom once
you get the school activated. It's just you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.650
got one excited, he drew the attention of
another and he'll come over and hit it, then

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.750
that one will miss it, and you'll swing and
miss him. Let it go back to the bottom and

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.570
another one saw that, so he'll come over and
try to hit it, and then all of sudden the school

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.570
is competitive. That's when it really starts
to have two people because you want to keep

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.770
a bait in the water constantly.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.140
Obviously a spoon imitates a large baitfish
down there that looks injured trying to get

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.360
away. Maybe a fish came and busted up a shad
and now he is wounded and he's trying to get

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.360
out of there and the other fish see it as
a easy meal. Any lake that has big forage

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.670
such as gizzard shad, threadfin shad, and
large baitfish this can be a really good option.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.520
The bait is heavy. The spoon I'm throwing
is actually a little bit larger that what

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.280
most people will throw just because we have
really big gizzards on the Tennessee River.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.270
So that's the nice thing about a spoon because
not only can you get a school fired up and

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.730
activated, but you can actually catch the
biggest fish out of that school on a spoon.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.730
Some of the keys with it I mean it is heavy
but it doesn't throw like a rock because it's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.760
got a cup in it and it catches the wind and
it will get a little squirrelly on you. It

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.040
will slice like a golf ball, and it will lay
up and just stop in the wind and will cause

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.040
a backlash if you're not careful. I fish it
on 20-pound fluorocarbon line. I've got it

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:18.140
on a medium-heavy rod, which happens to be
an Abu Garcia Villain Rod.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.140
I want top snatch it up off the bottom but
the key to the bait is not what it does going

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.030
up, but what it does coming back down. I want
to feed it slack and kind of watch my line.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.280
I've got a bow in my line and what I'm watching
for and I'll feel it in this rod if you've

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.220
got a good sensitive rod you'll feel it even
with the slack in your line. You'll feel something

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.970
and it will be a short jerk. Or you'll see
you line with that bow in it and all of a

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.370
sudden it will just lay limp. One has got
it when it did that. So I'm going to watch

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.340
my slack all the way to the bottom, and once
it gets to the bottom I'm going to reel up

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.220
and snap on it again.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.220
You get one to hit it, you get him hooked,
and I've kind of gone both ways on how to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.930
land a fish on a spoon. If they're hooked
just in the front of the mouth and they've

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.060
got an ounce of spoon hanging out here they're
notorious about shaking their head and they'll

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.289
bang that spoon on the side of their head
and get themselves free. So when I've had

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.210
some bigs one on I've found it's better to
do like what those big swimbait guys do on

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.340
west. They've got a heavy rod, heavy line,
a reel with their drag basically winched down,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.559
and they just go into just winding those things
as hard as the can. What you're doing is trying

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:43.270
to take control of the fish. Don't give him
a chance to get out there with free line and

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.139
jump and throw that spoon around. He comes
up to the surface you just kind of reel through

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.860
it so you're just kind of dragging him along
the surface so he can't get any leverage to

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.219
be able to shake his head. The other part
of that is once you get him close to the boat

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.930
like that they're going to jump here if you
take that pressure off. So you either need

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.659
to go ahead and come the rest of the way with
him and swing him into the boat, or you need

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.430
someone there to help you net it and land
it real quick. Because nine times out of ten

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.960
if he's a big one and jumps with that big
spoon on the side of his head he's going to

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.180
knock himself free.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.180
So you just want to make a long cast. Then
when it hits out there I'll try to let out

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.129
a bunch of line and then I'm going to watch
and I want the bait to fall almost vertical

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:36.240
where it landed out there. So if it takes
up all make slack I'll open up my reel and

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.680
let it take the rest of the slack until I
know it's on the bottom. Essentially the way

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.569
you know it is on the bottom is your line
will just lay limp on the water.

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:55.569
I find these places where these fish get grouped
up with my Structure Scan. I'm looking for

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.400
either a higher spot that has a hard clean
bottom that has been cleaned off, or I'm looking

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.279
at where a creek channel comes in and 
touches a point or a hump. Just some place

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:17.279
that a school of bass can relate to and feed
on baitfish. That's what I'm looking for.

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:27.969
Like I said earlier these fish can be just
sitting out here grouped up not really feeding

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:35.330
and the spoon gets them actively feeding.
You get one excited and chasing it a little

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.490
bit, then another one saw it so you've got
two chasing it, and before you know it you've

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.930
got the whole school going.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:51.930
Got Him! I can't tell but he's acting like
a big one. Yeah he's a big one!

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:36.649
All right, that's what I'm talking about right
there.

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:41.520
I was going to try and lip that fish but what
i talked about earlier is you get them up here

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.979
around the boat jumping and throwing the spoon.
See how big this thing is? I mean he slams

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:50.429
this thing against his head and banging it
against his head until this hook pops loose.

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:57.429
That's a beautiful fish. Nice healthy belly
already. Already back out here chomping on

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:08.199
shad again. That spoon is a great shad imitator.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:15.199
Thank you old girl. See Ya!
