00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.049
so as you guys notice the housing market
has been doing pretty well recently home

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.580
prices have increased significantly
meaning that current homeowners

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.000
are doing better I mean if you owed more
on a home that was worth less

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.570
that was a bit of an issue you upside
down on at home but now prices have been

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.800
increasing steadily and as a result

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.260
I'll a current homeowners are really
really happy about it and it's

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.910
makes it seem as if our economy is doing
better in everyone's doing better

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.890
but the reality is they're all these
little companies popping up now

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.870
that are buying many many foreclosed
homes at once one of those groups

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.989
is led by Stephen Schwartz man and it's
the Blackstone Group

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.110
they've come up with a company known as
invitation homes and recently they've

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.629
bought

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.950
32,000 homes to the tuna 5.5

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.610
billion dollars and what they do is they
buy these foreclosed homes

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.480
they renovate them if they need to be
renovated and then instead of selling

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.530
them decide if

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.780
flipping them what they do is they rent
them out so it seems reasonable

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.299
especially considering the fact that
it's really difficult for people to

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.770
get mortgages this day in age it's
really difficult for them to get

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.080
approved for the loan

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.710
I'm so there is more of a market for
ranchers

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.400
so it seems like a really reasonable
thing except they're buying these homes

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.229
in areas

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.390
including Phoenix Las Vegas in Orlando

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.240
and they're kinda buying them in these
fringe suburban neighborhoods that are

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.759
truly that desirable

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.890
so there's a huge chance that they're
creating this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.770
or they're not creating it
single-handedly of course there are many

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.040
factors that come into place

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.189
but they're contributing to the next
housing bubble

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.890
because people are unlikely to rent in
these areas they're more likely to rent

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.740
in areas that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.630
are up urban that are you know bigger
cities where

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.180
you have access to you know certain
things like bars restaurants work

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.960
here so another housing bubble what a
chance 90

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.110
so what we're gonna talk about our own
personal like E

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.740
interactions with the housing market and
in our future everything I wanna get to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.219
that but

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.200
in terms of this like when you read the
details of what they're doing in

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.800
in gobbling up this this this this
housing and the need to build like we're

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.230
not building a house is too long term
keep up with the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.920
population growth the US it all seems
reasonable but as

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.629
an American who has lived in the past
few years in this country I don't trust

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.730
anything that they're doing I either
think that one they're gonna purposely

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.330
screw me

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.560
or two they're going to be crippling
competent and they are gonna cause

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.629
another housing bubble it seems like at
this point

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.819
we're just hopefully you buy it at the
right time I guess under the right

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.269
agreement to bill the weather the net
inevitable collapse in the future I

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:35.910
don't know if that's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.989
unrealistic or from being conspiratorial
but that's just the experience

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.860
I have looking towards the future I
think it's a common fear among people

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.019
that are looking to buy

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.700
and it is really difficult to buy
something confidently especially in

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.810
today's market especially when you see
all these reports indicating the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.900
market's doing better

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.430
yeah if you were lucky enough to buy the
bottom with the market great

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.720
the price in prices increased you know
upwards of 20 percent in the last year

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.060
so it's really really difficult for a
lot of people to buy homes at this point

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.640
and you

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.970
it seems like what they're doing is
great because if there is a market for

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.099
ranchers well they're buying these homes
they're renovating them

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.640
and what they want to do is they
actually want to provide better customer

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.030
service for people that are their
tenants

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.870
so one thing that they keep mentioning
is how you know it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.610
traditional ranchers sometimes have to
deal with absentee landlords that might

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.110
not come and fix something when they
need help immediately

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.220
but they want to create this sort of let
hotline

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.090
where you call and say hey I I have
issues with my plumbing come fix it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.430
and you're supposed to have speedy a
fish into service but who knows if

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.599
that's really gonna happen

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.709
the part about this that really troubles
me is first of all there are

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.739
members in the middle class they do want
to buy homes and they do qualify for

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.409
these homes

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.560
but then you have cash buyers where you
have

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.790
huge companies that you don't have the
resources to just buy

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.310
gobble up a budget homes Iran's and then
these middle-class families can't find a

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.640
single family home

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.599
so I have a problem with that but the
part is that really makes me worry is

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.379
if they're buying a bunch of homes in
areas that are desirable

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.840
and let's say they've taken out credit
in order to

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.489
by all these homes at once what's gonna
happen if they can't find renters

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.359
bill notify that now deal that's gonna
be an issue yet know it might my main

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.389
concern is the same as we articulated
the idea that they could be squeezing

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.460
out the regular everyday families that
want to buy a house in this area because

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.419
if they don't have

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.050
like if if they can be outbid by a
little bit goes beyond their budget but

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.970
as a big business who is looking to for
our midterm serve investment over the

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.139
next 5-10 years something like that

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.380
than that sucks in and I know from my
own personal experience not even looking

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.610
for houses in LA it's horrible to be in
that

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.080
situation where you you have no options
outside of moving possibly tens of miles

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.580
outside the city centre now

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.990
looks we love these houses are in less
desirable areas it seems like there

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.040
might be more latitude for people to
negotiate

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.020
but I'm incredibly worried and I this
might not be great example love how

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.720
paranoid I am about the future of
American housing but

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.930
it doesn't look good it doesn't look
good and just put everything in

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.550
perspective guys they definitely don't
want a fear monger anything like that

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.660
this particular company only represents
one

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.820
three hundredth love a one-percent

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.110
on the housing market so it's not like
this company can single-handedly

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.070
destroyed the housing market

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.020
but this is just one factor and just
this is just one company

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.630
in a wide variety of issues within the
housing market right now

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.880
so it's just something to take into
consideration to any if the incentives

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.430
for this company or to do that you can
expect that

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.570
probably other companies going to follow
suit exactly maybe it's only one three

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.800
hundredth right now but

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.789
ten years from now to three hundredth
