[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.800
This was a unique opportunity.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.970
I actually grew up in Orange
and I walked by this very house

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.660
everyday during my
junior high years,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.930
going to where the
law school is now.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.720
So it was very
meaningful when we

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.880
had the opportunity to invest in
this beautiful, beautiful home.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.070
We're leaving a legacy
for future students

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.460
to look inside
themselves and to give.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.630
That's what our only hope is
of establishing this Elliott

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.530
Alumni House.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.700
This is an historic house.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.890
Been here for a long, long time.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.420
And Chapman itself,
as an institution,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.730
is an older institution.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.390
The fact of the
matter is, the reason

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.300
that I decided I wanted to
sponsor the veranda here

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900
is it goes back to
memory-- it goes back

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.800
to the way I met my wife.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.060
We met in what was the
entryway into the main campus

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.400
building on the old
campus in Los Angeles.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.440
We fund the restoration
of the gardens.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.000
That's what people see
when they first walk in.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.780
And, besides, so many of us
in Town &amp; Gown are gardeners.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.280
And this appealed to us.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.800
And the campus came to
us with the suggestion

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.090
that we join with
the alumni group

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.700
to do this restoration project.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.640
We felt very honored.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.620
The Alumni House is
an additional element

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.320
of the cementing of the
relationship between Chapman

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.330
and the community.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.930
They have done a marvelous job
in remodeling and refurbishing

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.510
it-- used a lot of
the original wood.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.920
They bought beautiful
antique furniture.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.350
And it's very warm and
a friendly environment.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.750
And it's been decorated
just beautifully.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.360
People, I think, will feel
good here, once they come in.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.280
This is going to blossom.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.470
And we know it's
going to be used

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.140
for functions all of the time.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.830
The involvement of alumni
really helps a school,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.100
because they can bring
so many experiences back

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.700
to the campus, and mentor
other students, as well,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.210
keep in touch with
the professors,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.310
letting them know
what is happening out

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.920
in the working world.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.040
And I think it's a
wonderful connection.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.220
The Alumni House, as a
facility, helps to focus.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.230
When something is
of value to you,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.080
you find a way to give back
to an institution, to a place,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.510
to a group that has helped form
the life that you have lived.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.080
Giving back has been a
legacy in our family.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.870
And I always promised that
when I got out of school,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.060
I was going to give
back, because somebody

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.980
helped me get through.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.190
We're only renting our
space on this planet.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.530
And let's remember
that there are going

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.220
to be others coming after us.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.730
And we should be thinking about
giving for future generations.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.760
I will do everything that I
can to encourage my family,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.690
and to encourage
others that I know,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.610
to give their support
to this institution,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.790
because I believe that it's
one of the finest of its kind

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.630
anywhere, anywhere.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.680
