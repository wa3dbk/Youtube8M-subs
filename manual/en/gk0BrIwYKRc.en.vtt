00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Oh my gosh I'm so excited!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Iâ€™m ridiculous amounts of-

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.560
look how big this box is!

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.420
It's like, bigger than me.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.680
Oh my gosh, I'm excited.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.000
It's not as heavy as everyone says it is, everyone's like oh my gosh the box is so heavy but...

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.840
I don't know, maybe because it's partial silicone I don't know. And I can't get it open...

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.900
So much tape!

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.320
You have no idea how hard it was not to speed. I was like 'I will not speed'

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520
But I sped through the work zone though

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.780
I was like 'no, work zone'

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.360
I'm shaking, I'm that excited!

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.420
So excited!

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.520
Oh my gosh!

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.980
It's huge!

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.760
And look at all that bubble wrap

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.160
And I got a box! I don't know what's in the box but there's another box!

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.680
Oh my gosh!

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.380
And there's more bubble wrap and oh my gosh this thing is huge!

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.960
Oh my gosh!

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.320
Brother: How big's the box, ay? That's what I said.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.980
Oh my gosh and the tail's stuck and I can't get it- look at this thing!

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.260
Oh my gosh!

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.960
Mother: Nobody help her, let her struggle on her own!

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.180
Oh my gosh! Get out of the box!

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.920
*loud popping noise*

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.700
Whoops

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280
Mother: I hope that was bubble wrap *laughing*

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.460
That was bubble wrap. I swear to god I hope that was bubble wrap too.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.060
Oh my gosh it's huge!

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.380
Oh my gosh!

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.040
It's amazing.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.700
And I'm excited and look at that!

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.480
Look how pretty that is.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.220
Mum: zooming in

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.760
And now it's got dog hair on it from the floor.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.680
Brother: What's in that?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.880
There's uhhh-

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.300
Mum: Just for context, lay next to that, Renee

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.500
And for everyone watching I'm 156cm or 5'1.4"

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.480
So this thing is...

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.800
Bigger than I am!
Almost.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.040
It's like, the exact same size.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.460
So there's a care sheet and a warranty and-
Oh my gosh! Look at it!

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.140
And now it's covered in dog hair.
Brother: It's f***ing huge

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.660
And she gave me something for free

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.260
I haven't found my scale heart yet, which is kind of concerning but that's okay.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.240
It'll be around somewhere hopefully.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.840
Whoops.
That's a... belt? I got a belt.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.560
Hi puppy

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.060
No, get away. 
No. No standing on the tail.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.940
Mum: Belt, oh look.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.240
What do we do with the box?

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.780
Mum: Can I stop now?
Yes

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.720
Mum: How?
