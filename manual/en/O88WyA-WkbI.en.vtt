00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.980
Hello, everybody!

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.009
Where are we, Frankiki?

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.280
We are in, we are near

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.419
Frankiki: the Square Enix shop.
Ali-Kitty: Very very near! It's right-
Frankiki: Ah, Square Enix cafe.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:14.449
Cafe, cafe!

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.189
Though, I think they have a shop in there.

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.369
So, it just opened last month, and so we're going to have some Final Fantasy themed..

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.369
cuisine..

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.590
So we got here to the Square Enix cafe ARTNIA, and this is the menu... there are various Final Fantasy themed things. Potion, high potion, Shiva, Ifrit, Elixir, Blue Materia, Red Materia.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.329
But of course the best part is these desserts, including the Aeris dessert, which I'm gonna get. And Cloud's Buster Sword... 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:25.329
Frankiki: It's Seventh Heaven! See?
Ali-Kitty: Chocobo Cappuccino! 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.890
Ali-Kitty: Look at this!
Frankiki: It's Cloud's Buster Sword parfait. Looks delicious!
Ali-Kitty: Looks delicious! おいしそう、ね！おいしそう！

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.840
This is gonna sound dirty, but I can't wait to have a bit of Cloud's Buster Sword...

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.549
*laughs* Damn, that sword girl! All right!

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.820
So, I've got my Aeris Parfait. And I don't know why, but it's smaller than the Cloud Parfait.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.790
Let's just compare the two...

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.790
Ali-Kitty: Not very fair!
Frankiki: Mine's a LOT bigger than Ali's!
Ali-Kitty: That's okay. Of course you know it's Aeris because

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.960
it's slightly pinkish, and you can see there's a 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.960
pink bow, and I'm not sure what that's made out of, I'm a little nervous!

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.559
Franki dropped her spoon. Hahaha.

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:17.760
I'm really full!

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.969
But a true Aeris fan

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.009
would finish this.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.010
Cloud's parfait has raisins in it.
Raisins?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.889
I am finished! おいしかった！ It was very good. But very.. big.

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:36.889
Like, the top part of Cloud.. *laughs* was delicious, but his bottom part wasn't very good.

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.099
Ali-Kitty: I can't put that in that's dirty!

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:49.099
Everything I say sounds really sexual!

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:51.819
I want Aeris. 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.819
But I don't wanna buy them all until I get Aeris. What do I do...

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.969
So, we're in this museum type room.

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.699
But we're not quite sure if it's the same exact stuff 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.529
that's in the Square Enix shop

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:08.849
which is on the other side of

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.849
Shinjuku station. But we will find out!

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.919
Okay, so what did we think of the Square Enix cafe?

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.319
Highly pricedl

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.879
Highly priced? How much were our parfaits?

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.749
Like, 1,000 yen?

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:40.679
Frankiki: About ten dollars.
Ali-Kitty: Plus the cappuccino, jeez!

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.409
But it's very cute

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.139
Very cute.

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.099
There's lots of merchandise, and there's a nice display area, museum-type area.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.540
So, it's recommended?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.849
Yeah, it's good.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:53.909
Recommended! If you have money. Yay! Byebye!
