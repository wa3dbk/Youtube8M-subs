00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.420
Reduce the signs of aging by following these tips from dermatologists:

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.710
Wear sunscreen every day since the sun’s rays 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.820
can accelerate signs of aging. 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.820
Use a sunscreen or facial moisturizer that offers broad-spectrum 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.120
protection and has an SPF of at least 30. 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.200
Be sure to apply sunscreen to all skin that is 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.020
not covered by clothing. 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.320
Do not tan. Getting a tan from the sun 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.720
or a tanning bed exposes you to harmful UV rays that 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.800
can accelerate aging, causing wrinkles, age spots, 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.900
a blotchy complexion and even skin cancer.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.110
Moisturize. Moisturizing traps water in the skin,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.710
which can help reduce the appearance of some fine lines

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.500
and make your complexion look brighter and younger.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.800
Test products, even those labeled “hypoallergenic.” 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.100
To test, dab a small amount of the product on your 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.090
inner forearm twice a day for 4 to 5 days. 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.690
If you do not have a reaction, it is likely safe 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.790
for you to apply to your face.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.280
Also use the product as directed. 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.190
Active ingredients can do more harm than good when too much is used. 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.090
Applying more than directed can cause clogged pores, 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.770
a blotchy complexion, or other unwanted effects.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.870
Do not use products that sting or burn. 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.070
Irritating the skin makes signs of aging more noticeable. 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.970
Some products prescribed by a dermatologist may cause stinging or burning. 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.650
When under a dermatologist’s care, this can be safe and effective.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950
Limit the number of products. 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.860
Using too many products on your skin, 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.970
especially more than one anti-aging product, tends to irritate the skin. 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.570
This often makes signs of aging more noticeable.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.060
Shop smart. People often think that the more expensive 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.770
a product is, the more effective it will be.  

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.660
This is not always the case. 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.870
There are some very effective, affordable products 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.770
in the skin care aisles of your local stores. 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.550
Give the product time to work. 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.670
While a moisturizer can immediately plump up fine lines, 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.270
most products take at least 6 weeks to work. 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.440
Sometimes it can take 3 months.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.740
If after following these tips, you still do not 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.140
see the results you expected, 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.930
you may want to consult a dermatologist. 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.530
