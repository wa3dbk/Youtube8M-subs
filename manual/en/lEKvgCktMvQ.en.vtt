00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.180
Hi.  This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.
I'm going to show you how to create

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.450
overlapping, vertical photo strips from a single photo

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.640
and then colorize and effect each strip individually

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.880
creating a fun, interesting look. 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.960
Open a photo you'd like to use. I downloaded this portrait from
Shutterstock dot com.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970
 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.340
Make a copy of your photo by pressing Ctrl + J on WIndows

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.540
or Cmd + J on a Mac. Click the Adjustment Layer icon

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.640
and choose "Solid Color".

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.800
Pick white and click OK.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.080
We want to bring the "Color Fill" adjustment layer below Layer 1

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.000
There are two ways of doing this. One way
is to drag it to the line between Layer 1

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.980
and the background and then release. 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.440
I'll press Ctrl or Cmd + Z

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.820
to undo the last step.  

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.160
The second way to place the Color Fill below Layer 1 is to use the shortcut

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.420
Ctrl or Cmd + [

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.340
Click the thumbnail of Layer 1 to make it active

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.500
and open your Rectangle Tool.  Choose

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.899
"Shape".  If you're working on a version earlier than CS6,

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.369
the Shape icon is here.  The Fill color is
irrelevant, since we're ultimately going

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.240
to fill the shape with the photo.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.840
Make sure the Stroke is empty.   Its symbol

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.420
is the red, diagonal line.  Drag a vertical,
rectangular shape across your image.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.939
Position the rectangle below Layer 1

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940
To move or rotate it, 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.170
open your Transform Tool by pressing Ctrl or Cmd + T.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.719
When you see a curved, double-arrow,

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.560
rotate it to an angle you like.  You can always change it later.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.320
I'll drag the shape over the left side
of the portrait.  Drag any middle point

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.280
on the edges to extend

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
or shorten the shape.  To accept the Transform,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.490
Press Enter or Return.  Make the top layer

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.830
active.  Make it into a clipping mask by pressing

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.850
Ctrl + Alt + G on Windows or Cmd + Option + G on a Mac.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.260
This clips the photo to the shape directly below it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.780
hiding everything on a photo except for the area inside the shape.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.440
Make the Rectangle layer active and click

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.550
the "fx" icon.  Choose

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.190
"Drop Shadow".  The blend mode is Multiply

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.940
and the Opacity is 20%.  Uncheck Global Light

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.160
and make the Angle: 132 degrees.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.960
For this photo, I'll make the Distance: 20 pixels

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.860
and the Size: 5 pixels, however, keep in mind,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.030
you may want to use different amounts for the Distance and Size

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.080
depending on the size and resolution of your photo.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.800
Click Stroke.  Click to color box,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.200
pick white and click OK.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.940
Make the Position: Inside,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.560
click "Color Overlay" and change the blend mode

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.960
to "Hue".  Click the color box

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.340
and pick a color you like to colorize your photo.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.330
You can always change it later.  Click off the eyeball

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.340
next to Color Overlay temporarily hide the effect.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.700
Next, we'll group the clipped photo and the shape into a folder.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.630
To do this, Shift-click on the photo to highlight it and then,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.390
press Ctrl or Cmd + G.  Make a copy of the folder

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.820
and position the copy under the original.  Open the folder copy

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.910
and click the rectangle thumbnail to make the shape

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.070
active.  Open the "Path Selection Tool"

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.260
and drag the copy to the right.  Open your
Transform Tool to angle and position it.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.130
to your liking.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.640
Then, press Enter or Return.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.840
Remember, you can always go back and change it later.

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.030
Close the folder, make a copy

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.350
and position "copy 2" below "copy 1".

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.540
Open the folder of "copy 2" and as before,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.150
make the rectangle shape active.  Open your Transform Tool

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.030
to reposition and angle it.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.800
Continue the same steps to create the rest of the vertical panels.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.230
Now that we have our finished vertical, strip portrait,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.510
let's change the hues of each individual panel.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.460
Open the top folder and click next to "Color Overlay"

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.760
to make it visible.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.860
Close the folder and open the folder directly below it.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.710
Make its Color Overlay visible and
double-click on the words, "Color Overlay"

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.830
to see it in the Layer Style window.  Click on the color box

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.290
and pick another color and click OK

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.160
on both Windows.  Continue these steps for the rest of the panels.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.770
If you have CS6 or later, I'll show you
how you can use the "Color Lookup" filters

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.470
to give each panel its own unique look.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.330
First, make sure the Color Overlay effect is hidden

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.670
on all of your panels.  Make the clipped photo

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.530
active and click the Adjustment Layer icon.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.650
Choose Color Lookup and click the

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.940
clip-to-layer icon.  This will restrict the
effect to the individual panel below in

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.050
the Layers panel.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.500
Open "Load 3D LUT".

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.240
Each of these effects were historically used by the film industry

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.370
to apply specific looks to film scenes.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.570
Go through each one to determine which
one you like for your individual panels.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.490
Once you've chosen the one you want,
click on it to apply the effect.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.780
Close the folder and open the one above it.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.360
As before, make the clipped photo active,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.400
click the adjustment layer and choose Color Lookup.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.070
Clip it and pick another effect.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.170
Continue adding different effects to
each panel until you're happy with the result.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.230
This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.
Thanks for watching!
