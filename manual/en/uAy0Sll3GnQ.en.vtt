00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.960
There's no population without copulation
Genetics is not interested in nations

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.679
Genetics isn't interested in nations.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.799
Genetics is interested in population.
Let me explain that:

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.159
population includes me and you.
Right now, in this building,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.919
population includes all the people 
who are right here, right now. Why?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.679
They're in the same place
at the same time, and they all have the opportunity

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.999
to exchange some form of genetic material
between each other.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.880
A nation can't do that.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.479
Looking for 
the oldest population in a region

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.759
is something that's possible,
but looking for the oldest nation

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.999
in a region is something banal.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.239
Let's take the Balkans 
and Bosnia and Herzegovina as an example:

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.999
the existing myth refers to
the genetic markers that are some

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.759
15.000-20.000 years old
and 7.000 or 8.000 years old.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.319
Back then, 
Homo Sapiens had more pressing problems,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.079
like what to eat 
or how to avoid getting eaten,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.600
than to sit in front of the fire
and think about which nation they belong to.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.279
The genetic pool is basically 
all the wealth that one population has.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.879
In practice, in Bosnia and Herzegovina
it represents the diversity of genes

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.759
or genetic markers, depending on
what you're researching,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.000
which you can see 
in the population in BiH.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.479
Thousand-year long processes
have resulted in the fact that

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.399
the BiH population today
is extremely diverse.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.039
We call that "genetic diversity"
and we can say that

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.439
it's unexpectedly high
for a population

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.920
and a geographical area
that's this small.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.959
When you compare it to
the neighboring populations

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.359
of Croatia, Serbia and
other neighboring countries,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.280
we can say that it doesn't 
significantly differ in terms of statistics.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.799
Your appearance, the way you are,
and my appearance, the way I am,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.919
isn't based on genes alone.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.959
It's also based on the conditions
under which you grew up.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.799
No one can guarantee that you
with your genome given by your predecesors -

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.959
mainly your mom and dad -
that you'd look exactly the same

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.000
if you lived in Australia,
in Northern Canada, et cetera.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.079
Our environment, the Balkan
environment,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.639
or South Europe, 
whatever you'd like to call it,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.319
did affect us.
Typical Dalmatians, or typical

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.999
residents of the Balkans,
can be easily recognized

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.159
then by our long arms 
and long legs, if nothing else.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.600
I wouldn't call it a Balkan phenotype,
but let's say that it's quite specific to this area.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.639
Genetics doesn't deny 
the concept of nation,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.519
but genetics 
can't determine the nation either.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520
The nation is determined by other things.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.400
Genetics is exclusively 
interested in population.
