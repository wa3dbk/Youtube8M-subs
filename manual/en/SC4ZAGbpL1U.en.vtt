00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We are now having the last panel 
discussion of our seminar.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And subject is: Disposal of 
nuclear waste in Finland.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Keynote speaker is professor 
Matti Saarnisto, welcome.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Honored chairman, 
dear listeners.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.000
This seminar has strong 
pro nuclear power consensus.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.500
It feels to me almost 
like a religious act.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.500
Security risks in all phases of 
nuclear power production

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.000
are swept away.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.500
General director Laaksonen's comments however
balanced discussion a little.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.500
I still wish problems 
are not forgotten.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Finland is very different from most
nuclear power countries in Europe

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.000
in all phases of nuclear power
production.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Starting with the search of uranium ore,
to building of new nuclear power plants

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.500
and ending with the disposal of
nuclear waste.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We are planning to open new
uranium mine, while all other mines

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.500
are closed in western Europe.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.500
Reason for this isn't the exhaustion
of uranium ore on the european mines,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.500
but the long-term and uncontrolled
influences on the environment.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.500
Finland is also planning to put
highly radioactive waste in bedrock.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
Oor plan is based on method developed
in Sweden 30 years ago.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
we have not invented
a better way.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Finland is planning disposal of 
nuclear waste first

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.000
in the world, even Sweden is
behind.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.000
Other countries are on early stages
of planning disposal.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.000
Also traditionally strong nuclear countries;
Great Britain, France and Canada.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.800
Some countries do not have a plan
how to treat nuclear waste at all.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
One example is Russia.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.000
There is no internationally accepted 
solution how to treat nuclear waste.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
USA have invested 10 billion dollars
to geological studies of planned

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.000
Yucca-mountain nuclear waste repository site.
However further financing is cancelled

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.000
for the reason that safe disposal have
not been possible to confirm.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.000
In Finland has to be cautious about 
nuclear waste disposal..

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.000
since there's reason to believe that 
Finland may become "solution" for..

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.000
other European countries looking
for placement of nuclear waste.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.500
Although our law do not allow it today.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.500
Germans have open discussion of 
sending nuclear waste to Finland.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.700
A canadian study (feb 2010)
predicts that nuclear waste will be

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
gathered to a few places 
around the world.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Problem is solved in a nice way
for Germany, while electricity and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
nuclear waste is generated in Finland  
and waste also stays here.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It reminds me of geography book 
from 1920's, describing Finland:

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.000
"Far border-guard of Europe,
frost-bitten, but developing Finland."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
[sarcastic] Nuclear waste repository is
terrific achievement of high-tech..

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
country; we use foreign technology to
generate radio-active nuclear problem.. 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.000
for amusement of many future sivilizations.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:47.400
Proper working of new Olkiluoto waste
repository is only speculation in long run.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.000
And it has no scientific facts behind.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.000
Strong earthquakes generated by 
ice age loading..

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.000
..and deep frosting of bedrock 
are serious long term threats..

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.500
which put Posiva's waste plans
under a question.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.500
Also bedrock at Olkiluoto
site is not as strong as told..

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
..by finnish nuclear industry.
