Hi! I’m Jim McKelvey with Third Degree Glass
Factory in St. Louis. You can check us out

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:12.070
on the web at www.stlglass.com. Today, we’re
going to learn about glassblowing for expertvillage.com.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.609
Fern flashes the piece, then she’s going
to bring it back to me. When she brings it

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.310
back to me, I’ve got a couple of seconds,
if I want to, to adjust the piece to see if

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.640
it’s high. It’s a little bit high right
there, and now it looks pretty even. You’ll

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.350
notice that we’ve already shaped the bottom
half of the cylinder. Actually, we’ve shaped

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.750
the bottom 3 quarters of the cylinder. So
all I really need to do to complete the cylinder

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.250
shape is to heat up the top. Now, if the piece
wasn’t made out of glass it would be real

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.199
easy: I’d just heat up the top. But since
glass tends to crack if it gets too cold,

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.530
I’m going to have to remember to flash that
punty occasionally to keep some heat down

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.329
there as well. If the glass gets too cold
it will crack, and we don’t want it to crack

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.960
until the last moment when we’re ready to
remove that punty. So, to heat a piece like

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.619
this, I’m going to stay right in the front
of the glory hole, concentrating on the heat

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.430
on the tip of the piece. Occasionally, I take
a flash, which means go all the way in for

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.730
a couple of seconds and then come out. You
don’t want that punty hot and moving around,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.939
but you don’t want it so cold that is seizes
up and is prone to cracking. So, what I do

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:33.329
is I stay here right until I see the tip of
that piece start to round out and want to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:43.390
become nice and soft. You’ll also notice
that as with the other times, I turn as slowly

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.570
as I can, but still fast enough to keep the
piece from falling off center. Okay, so the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.979
piece is looking pretty soft up there so I’m
going to come back to the bench and finish

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.520
this cylinder. Here we go. When you’re working
on the punty, you don’t want to bounce the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.090
piece. You don’t want to knock it against
anything. So, I’m going to start by lifting

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:19.750
it with the jacks and slowly opening the tip.
I open the jacks as the piece is opening and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:29.120
I’m almost there. One more reheat should
do it. Now, when you reheat a piece of glass

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.909
that’s on the punty, it’s generally a
good idea to flash the punty as the first

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.800
move. So, I go all the way in and make sure
that punty get a little bit of heat. Then

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.661
I can back out and concentrate that heat just
where I want it. This one of the things that’s

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:48.150
really nice about making cylinders, is because
you’ve made most of the shape on the blowpipe.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.849
You can keep that back part out of the fire
and keep it nice and cold so it retains it’s

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:02.270
shape. What I’m going to do here is concentrate
that heat, again, right at the tip. When I

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:11.280
see that tip start moving, then I’m going
to come out. One more flash here. I see the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.780
tip is moving nicely, so I’m going to come
out and we’re going to finish this. Fern’s

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.750
going to help be by paddling the lip, just
a little bit, with a paddle. I’m going to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.180
ride on the sides. Okay, that’s good, and
there’s our cylinder.
