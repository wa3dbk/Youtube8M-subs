Steam introduces Family Sharing, a video of
the xbox one dashboard leaks, former devs

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.920
from relic, Bioware, and Riot team up to announce
The Long Dark, and more!

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.100
Hey guys, Jess here, and this is the Curse
Weekly Roundup!

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.180
First up - Valve has announced Steam Family
Sharing - this long-awaited and often-rumored

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.320
feature lets friends and family members borrow
each others' games - basically your friend

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.630
can authorize your computer to play his game.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.170
Then you get to earn your own Steam achievements
and save your own progress to the Steam cloud.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.860
So then theoretically if you borrow a friend's
game and later decide to buy it yourself,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.089
you should be able to pick back up on your
progress.

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.210
The feature will go into beta sometime this
month - to sign up, join the Family Sharing

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.610
Group on the steam community, and Valve will
choose an initial pool of 1000 Steam accounts

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.440
from this group to try it out.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.000
FINALLY, one of the biggest advantages console
gaming had over Steam, but Valve's catching

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
up now!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What do you guys think?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.049
Are you gonna use the Steam Family Sharing
feature?

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.280
Leave me a comment and let me know!

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.110
And you can check the full announcement on
the Steam Store page if you want to read more

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.960
about how Family Sharing will work.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.870
Next, a video of the xbox one's dashboard
leaked onto the internet earlier this week

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.650
- and was almost immediately removed, but
not before thousands of people were able to

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.650
view it.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.010
The video features a boy appearing to be in
his mid to late teens, showing off what the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.240
dashboard looks like.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.140
THe general consensus is that he was likely
the son of a Microsoft employee who took home

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.890
a beta unit to test - unfortunately, posting
this video was a HUGE breach of Microsoft's

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.240
NDA and this kid very likely cost his mom
or dad their job as a result.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.091
But, if you want to see this video for yourself,
someone was able to snatch it and upload it

00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:42.320
to liveleak before it was removed from YouTube,
so we'll drop a link to that in the video

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.320
description.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.870
Moving on, apparently it's been the week of
leaks, because Batman: Arkham Origins faced

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.470
a leak as well, albeit a much less controversial
one.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.380
Images of the alternate character skins have
surfaced - although this leak is very possibly

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.409
simply a PR stunt to try and generate buzz
rather than a full-on leak.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.340
Regardless, check out the image and leave
me a comment below letting me know what you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.320
think of the alternate skins.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.900
Next up, a new PlayStation Vita has been announced.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.530
The new model is thinner and has 1 gig of
built-in memory.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.600
But to balance THAT out, the new 64-gig memory
stick is goign to cost about a hundred bucks,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600
wow.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.740
This new model looks pretty cool - but it's
been met with mixed reviews so far; complaints

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.920
about lack of games and high price for the
memory sticks have been the two that stand

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.060
out so far, but what do you guys think?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.840
Has the new model convinced you or is Nintendo
still winning the handheld war?

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.170
Finally, former devs from Relic, BIoware,
Riot, and Volition have teamed up to form

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.220
Hinterland Studio, an independent game studio
in Vancouver, Canada.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.380
THey've just announced their first title,
THe Long Dark.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.030
It's an episodic, post-disaster survival simulation
game set in North America after a geomagnetci

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.319
storm has crumbled the country's technology
infrastructure - sounds pretty awesome if

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.380
you ask me.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.140
Hinterland will be launching a kickstarter
for hte Long Dark on September 16th to raise

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.760
initial funding for the game, and you can

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.069

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.000
