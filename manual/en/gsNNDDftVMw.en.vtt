00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.629
Perennials are a low maintenance choice for
beds and borders.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.109
You plant them once and they come back year after year.
Hi, I'm William Moss and

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.530
I'm here to tell you about six easy steps
for growing a great perennial garden.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.710
The first step is to choose a nice open
location

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.880
like this bed. There are perennials that can go in full sun and those that can take

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.910
full shade.
The second step

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.840
is to actually sketch out a plan.  You
just want a plan so that you kind of have a

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.039
guideline to follow,

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.840
whether you're planting up by the curb
or you're planting over by the front door.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.140
Step three is you want to choose your plants. You
want  to pick some that have

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.100
varying heights to them. That gives more excitement .to your garden

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.700
You need some taller plants. Taller plants give
you a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.900
vertical element and add drama to the garden. So you're looking at things like Joe Pye

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.550
Weed, perennial sunflowers,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.739
and also the rugosa roses and other
types roses.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.500
Then you have that medium-tier level, where your talking
about things like cone flowers, ornamental

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.610
grasses,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.890
and this coreopsis. It really fills in and gives you a nice space.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.000
Finally, you have the smaller plants.
Those are the ones for the front and also

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.300
for use as edging. Combining those three
heights gives your garden a lot of interest.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.740
Step four is to dig the soil and amend it.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.900
We've already turned it over using a
garden fork, you turn the soil just to

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.140
make sure that it's easy to plant in, and
we amend it with a rich compost.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.100
The compost not only improves
drainage and texture, it also feeds the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.650
soil.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.200
So having done that, now we're just
gonna rake it out smooth

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.369
around this irrigation system.
Step five is to place the plants

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.280
and begin to plant them. Now you don't
want to crowd the plants. You've got to be sure

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.670
to give them plenty of space.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.549
Remember that perennials are going to get
larger every year.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.750
So you want to put them down and give them
enough space so that in two to three

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.700
years

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.369
they've still got plenty of room. So you put
your tall plant in first, the rose.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.149
And now I'm putting all of my medium-size plants in .
around that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.189
And finally you put in the smaller plants.
Now we're ready to plant.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.360
We're going to start with the coreopsis here.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.479
Now to take these plants out, all you do

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.599
is first you have to press the sides of the
pot, then turn it upside down.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.090
So now that I've got it out, you see
some of these roots are a little tangled.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.300
We're going to break them up just a bit because we want them to grow out.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.230
and through the soil. Then come over to
my hole,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.040
my space right here where I had it. When you're planting you wanna dig down

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.019
and plant as deep as it was when it
was in the pot.

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.940
Not deeper, not shallower, the same
height.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.420
One's done! 
Step six is to mulch your perennials.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.110
The mulch does a lot of things. It's
going to help conserve the moisture.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.379
It's also going to suppress weeds, and design-wise,

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.230
it brings a unifying look to the whole
garden. Spread it out

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.660
be sure not to cover up the crown of the
plant, just

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.120
the areas around it. It's as easy as that!

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.330
You plant a perennial garden one afternoon and you'll enjoy it for many years to come.
