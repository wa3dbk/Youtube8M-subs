00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.540
Hello everyone

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.460
Today's introduction is

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.360
a condiment

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.240
It sounds like a sauce

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.020
In fact it can replace

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.760
Salt used seasonings

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.700
It can be pickled vegetables

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.760
Make bread

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.200
Marinated meat

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.720
It is rich in enzymes

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.760
About 100 kinds of enzymes

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.840
It has quite a lot of probiotics

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.000
It is very good for the body

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
very healthy

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.620
This is in Japan

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.240
In fact, there was a long time ago

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.580
That is it in recent years

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.800
Pretty red in Japan

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.040
Also come to Taiwan

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.120
Currently available at this

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.800
Some in Japan

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.660
Japanese department store supermarket

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.740
Can be bought

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.800
About 300 grams or so

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.320
It takes about 100 Taiwan dollars

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.220
But I discovered later

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.960
Some recipes

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.200
Teach us how

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.280
Made at home

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160
Discovering is very simple

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.920
And can save more than half of the money

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.640
So I think it's very cost-effective

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.920
So I recommend it to everyone

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.320
How to make homemade salt sauce

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.740
Making salt pan

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.640
First of all

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.320
To prepare a first

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.680
Disinfected

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.840
Large glass jar

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.120
I suggest glass jar

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.700
Some people say that the use of sealed boxes

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520
Some people say that plastic cans

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.620
Can be

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.840
But I still recommend

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.120
May be more stable

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.720
Material or glass jar

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.920
A little safe

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.840
Afraid of releasing some substances

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.400
Still plastic

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.520
a little worried

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.000
In addition, I bought on the Internet

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.480
This is called Mi Fu.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.400
Or you can talk to some rice shops

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.480
Ask about

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.060
Naomi is a fermented rice

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.760
Michelin I was bought in an open-air auction

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.480
Very convenient

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.700
After I made an order

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.800
Received the next day

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.040
This is dry today

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.240
Some people sell it wet

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.540
It is a piece of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.160
It must be broken

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.480
This is dry

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.640
So relative

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.900
Part of water

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.280
Will increase more

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.500
Salt production

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.920
It's like using three things

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.020
One is rice bran

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.900
One is water

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.680
One is salt

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.740
It's that simple

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.040
But the proportion of these three things

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.740
If you are wet

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.120
Or frozen rice bran

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.540
That ratio is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.480
1:3:4

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.060
It is a salt

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.940
look

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.500
Salt pot

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.080
I remember it like this

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.600
That is, salt is first

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.060
Salt is 1

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.420
The trick is 3

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.320
Water is 4

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.680
But because I'm dry

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.720
I become 1:3:6

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.400
So today I am 100 grams of salt

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.440
Salt section

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.480
I suggest you

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.480
Just like cooking salt

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.040
Then you can use sea salt

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.440
But don't use a salt

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.320
Rock salt

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.840
Because of the minerals inside the rock salt

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.000
Will affect the brewing of rice bran

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.520
The hot water has just been put in

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.480
That way to make it dissolve

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.060
Put rice bran

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.920
Place in a sterilized jar

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.040
Pour it in

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.711
Remember that the jar is sterilized by any method

00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.440
Can be

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.520
The remaining cold water

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.320
Put these first

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.480
You can pour it in

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.720
Not related

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.680
There is some salt inside

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.840
Still not completely dissolved

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.166
Not related

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:15.020
Just pour in

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.480
Then mix it evenly

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.320
After stirring

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.640
In fact, this sauce

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.598
Completed

00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:22.000
But because of this sauce

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.240
Need to place 7 to 14 days

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.920
It is the temperature in autumn

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.240
I think it can be completed in 7 days

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.280
But we each day

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.460
It must be like this

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.080
Come in and stir it once

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.260
Until we found rice grains

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.120
When it has become porridge-like

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.520
This salt sauce

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.680
Completed

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.300
That's it now

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.400
I'll just sit still

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.640
Under the room temperature

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.380
Lightly cover

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.100
Slightly covered

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.300
But don't tighten it

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.040
Tightly

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040
It has no way to breathe

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.120
Rice bran is an active thing

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.380
I just said it's enzymes

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.760
Up to 100+ kinds

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.960
This probiotic

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.720
Also quite a lot

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.920
It is alive

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.520
So we remember to give it

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.480
A little air like this

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.140
We are in normal

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.700
A cool corner

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.400
You can

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.440
Then I'll come back tomorrow

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.840
How does it become

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.680
The second day of homemade salt cake

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.640
Then we act like

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.200
Is to open it

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200
You can see salt sauce

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.240
It looks like there is a little foam

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.160
Not related

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.120
Let's get it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.600
It's like this

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.560
Let it stir

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.100
That can also be seen

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.720
None of them are like porridge

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.880
Not yet matured

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.360
Then let's look at it tomorrow

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.440
This is the third day of salt panning

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.440
You have to take the lid.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.400
You just do one thing

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.920
Then help it stir

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.920
Help it ferment

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.520
It's still not like a thin rice

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.420
So also put

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.560
Because it is the third day today

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.200
Gently cover

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.080
Let it continue to ferment

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.520
Well, we have this salt sauce.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.080
Has been made

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.160
Today is the tenth day

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.600
It has been so stirring every day

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.240
That everyone can clearly see

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.680
Today's 10th day

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.800
Our confusion

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.240
It is already obvious

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.300
Present this image

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.400
like porridge

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.700
Current salt sauce

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.040
It has already been completed

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.360
Complete the salt sauce that has been made

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.760
We will cover it tightly

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.240
After tightly

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.380
Put salt sauce

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.200
Put it in the fridge

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.140
Can probably use

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.920
Three months to six months

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.340
Very simple

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.280
Home-made salt sauce

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.120
Completed

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.800
Everyone is free to try

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.600
Extremely fun

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.480
Salted sauce like experiment
