JOE WILES: In this segment, we're going to
continue "Can't Stop" by the Red Hot Chili

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:17.359
Peppers. Let's take a look. Now we've just
gone through the intro, which is.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.249
And the bit that comes after that part is
a little bit tricky. But once you get the

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.949
fingering down, it's worth learning. We're
going to start with our index finger on the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.449
7th fret of the A string. Our middle finger
is going to be on the 7th fret of the G string,

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.860
and we're going to want to bring our pinkie
up to the 9th fret of that G string as well

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.710
in just a moment. We're going to hit that
three--we're going to hit twice, then hit

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.120
the G string twice--once rather, hit the G
string once, and then once again, then back

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.579
here two or three times. One-two-three. We
answer each high end with three of the bass

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.990
note, okay? So it's like this. One-two-three,
One-two-three, okay? And then we're going

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.759
to bring that finger down to the 5th fret
and answer the same way. Okay? Oh, we have

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.130
to switch up our fingers so that they could
stretch out. Index finger slides down to the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.280
5th fret of the A string, ring finger under
the 7th fret of the G string, which has the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.520
difference right there, and then our pinkie
is going to be on the 9th fret, still. So

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:32.850
those two riffs put together sound like this.
And then we're going to go down to the 7th

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.799
fret of the low E string. We're gonna--then
we're going to come down to the 7th fret of

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.609
the low E string, middle finger on the 7th
fret of the G string and then the pinkie on

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:51.990
the 9th fret of the same string to answer.
Okay? Then we're going to switch it all up.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.359
We're going to switch these two fingers. This
middle finger is going to go to the 8th fret

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.619
of the low E string, and the index finger
is going to come back to where that one was,

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:07.990
which was on the 7th fret of the G string.
So basically, we're changing bass notes from

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.070
the 7th fret of the A string down to the 5th
fret to the 7th fret of the E string up to

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.280
the 8th fret, and we're answering it the same
way. But because of the position of the bass

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.390
notes, we have to move our hand around in
different formations. Slowly, this riff sounds

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:53.790
like this.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.820
In our next segment, we're going to talk about
"Anthem Part Two" by Blink 182, an artist

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.780
that's made this list quite a bit. I'll see
you there.
