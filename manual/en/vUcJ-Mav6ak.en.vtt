00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.580
Fish is a fun hobby and today we're going
to talk about how to maintain your fresh water

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.080
aquarium. My name is Michael and we're going
to talk about that. First off what we're going

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.930
to do is on a daily basis you're going to
look at your fish. You're going to inspect

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.000
them. Make sure that they're swimming o.k.
and that they're not having any problems.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.630
We're going to look at them and make sure
that they don't have any spots all over them.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.150
If they have little tiny white spots on them
that's Ick and we're going to need to address

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:34.239
that, and take care of it. I have here a,
it's called a Magnafloat and it's actually

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.750
for cleaning algae off of the tank. I personally
like using this because during, during the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.230
month if I do develop a little bit of algae
I can come and I just clean it off. And a

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.220
lot of times I'll take this and I'll just
park it off to the side, and if it comes undone

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.112
it easily floats up to the top and you can
connect it again. Fish, we're going to feed

00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:58.079
our fish everyday. And you, you can feed them
a couple times a day as long as you make sure

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.340
you're not over feeding them. And when we
do feed them we're going to give them a little

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.510
bit of flake food or pelleted whichever's
required for that particular fish. And we're

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.670
going to watch them. We want to see how food
they're going to eat in a, in a 3 minute period.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.040
If I have a lot of food that's going to go
down to the bottom, I need to keep an eye

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.740
on that. Because too much food down on the
bottom can jeopardize the water quality. Another

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.680
thing we need to do with our tank is we need
to do monthly maintenance on this tank. And

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.960
we want to take out 25% of the water and you're
going to do that with a gravel siphon so we

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.479
can pull all the debris out of the bottom.
And we will then take treat our water and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.270
put it back in the tank. The filter itself
needs to be cleaned. The cartridge that's

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.030
in the back, this needs to be replaced monthly.
The carbon in it is really only good for about

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.979
30 days. We're talking today about how to
maintain your fresh water aquarium. My, my

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.430
name is Michael and we learned how to do that.
