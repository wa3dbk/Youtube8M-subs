00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
The net's always a lot lighter and a lot easier
to pull in when you've got a fish. It's very

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.760
very hard and heavy when there's nothing.
It's not really hard but sometimes it's..

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.809
depends on the size of the tide. When the
sun's shining things always seem a lot nicer.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.230
Yes, we've been salmon fishing together y'know
32 or 3 years and she still pulls the net

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:30.170
in now like she did when she was only 60.
You must be joking. It's a 2 mile walk, a

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.790
mile out roughly and a mile back. Don't forget
we're old, old age pensioners. What better

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.820
type changing room could have than this. I
can get the old bird dressed here. This is

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.539
why it's a family job pulling her trousers
up. I'm 77 and everybody says why we're so

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:58.670
fit we eat so much fish. I'm 84 nearly now,
and a lot of people 84 thinking about not

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:08.340
pulling nets and rowing boats. We've got Conacre,
Pill's Mouth, Deadman. The salmon will be

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.450
holding in the deep water. You know maybe
another week or two. So I'm hoping now for

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.030
the fish to just go in through, find they
can't get out and they'll come back down through

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.710
on this draft so that's why I choose this
today I may be unlucky I may have done better

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.579
up there. The net is secured on the beach
with a crew member, which in my case is Sheila.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.180
"OK doll, pull un in." Which if she's doing
her job properly "Right, steady dear not too

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.869
quick." Which she does most of the time. I
was fishing Conacre many years ago and the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.710
wind was blowing me towards the rocks, I was
stuck fast and the minute you're stuck fast

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.360
the bottom of the boat goes down and the water
comes over and sinks you you see. I never

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.420
had a knife to cut the net adrift so all I
had to do was just get an armful of net and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.930
throw it all out in a great heap and make
a bolt to the shore as fast as I could and

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.570
leave it there til the tide come in. The funny
thing about it people would have said "Cor,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.629
Steve Taylor, got drowned shooting Conacre
when he's done it a million times what ever

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.170
was he thinking about." but it was so
simple. Just a split second and the wind...

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.860
gone. The net itself is a seine net. The idea
is to form a circle on the shore and come

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.510
back into the same shore again and we both
walk into the centre and you start pulling

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.310
in on the footrope until it gradually gets
smaller and smaller and smaller until if there's

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:43.150
anything in the net it's there. What you think
then Taylor? Rubbish. Ho ho ho thanks. Looks

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.629
like a lovely mullet. No it's a flatfish.
Ah it's a flatfish. Back for another day.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:55.150
Got to pull all this back in again now. They
can never understand in the village of Braunton

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.450
why a farmer never makes any money and the
salmon fishermen never catch any salmon. Years

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:11.409
ago I caught 300. But that's many many tides
ago that was. And in those days my uncle and

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.379
I fished in a boat he never had enough money
to buy a pair of chest waders so he always

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.040
fished in his mother's skirt. He wore his
skirt and bare feet when it was frosty. Cos

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.269
fishing used to start the first of April then,
April then you see. Only eight weeks now.

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.489
Or just June and July. They have taken away
the best months from us you see. There were

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.959
36 netsmen catching salmon on this river but
now there's only three licences left and we're

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.540
the last three remaining. That's myself, and
my son and the other one was a Mr Cox from

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.690
Appledore. If all three of us went on a bus
trip and we were killed there'd be no more

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.680
netting in the Taw and Torridge ever again.
But last year they made an amendment that

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.090
meant there will always be one net on this
river when we all die. I'd refuse the money

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.750
just to have this way of life. See the mullet
everywhere. I know. Just imagine that was

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.330
fish. We won't be having salmon for supper
tonight. There's something here. Here's a

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.479
salmon. Keep him coming. Here he is. Aw, lovely
salmon. There's a lovely salmon look at that.

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:35.050
Hold on to him dear. Or he be gone. Ah, you
got a smile out of me. Nice heavy fish. When

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.960
I leave this world I'm gonna be placed to
rest at Heanton church right in the sun with

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.410
a good view of the estuary. Well then I can
watch who's catching the fish. I can talk

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.160
to the salmon and tell them to go round the
net if it's opposition. Come on Stephen. Alright

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.440
dear, I'm coming. We didn't know he was there
til we got in, you were asleep. Far too good

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.630
for the working class. He he he he.
