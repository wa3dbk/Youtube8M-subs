00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.210
Installing artificial grass

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.760
the first step in installing
artificial grass is sub-base preparation

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.899
a good sub base is the foundation for a
lasting beautiful install. Excavation. A

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.070
good rule of thumb is to excavate to
three inches below finished grade

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.360
this will vary based on the particular
application and the type of native soil.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.880
Soils that are sandy, silty or contain a
lot of clay will require additional

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.080
excavation

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.310
perhaps four to six inches below
finished grade. When you have soils that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.690
tend to be very firm rocky or similar in
composition to decomposed granite

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.710
you may be able to get by with a little
less, perhaps two inches.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.690
Purchase Green recommends a minimum of three inches to ensure a solid sub base

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.280
foundation. Purchase Green also
recommends the use of geotextile fabric

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.509
between your native soil and your sub
base to prevent base contamination

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.729
If you have soils with lots of clay.
Subgrade bend-a-board.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.140
The bend-a-board we're referring to is
distinct from a landscaping bend-a-board

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.850
or Wonder Edge product. Landscaping bend-a-board and wonder edge products are used

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.790
for aesthetic purposes to provide a
clean edge.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.890
Often times there are no natural
restraints, such as adjacent planters. A

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.319
subgrade bend-a-board in artificial grass
serves as a structural purpose. It serves

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.680
as a nail board along the entire
perimeter of your project.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.670
The use of a subgrade composite bend-a-board enables you to secure the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.819
artificial grass using a pneumatic
staple gun

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.360
rather than simply putting nails through
the artificial turf into your sub base.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.870
It is a more robust installation
although, because of cost considerations,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.549
it is only used by one out of five
installers. It usually adds about thirty

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.709
cents per square foot to the total job
cost. Purchase Green recommends its use

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.600
on high traffic areas, pet areas and for
any customer that simply wants the best

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.940
possible installation and are willing to
absorb the added cost. The bend-a-board

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.450
is a composite 2-inch by 2-inch product
and comes in 12 foot length. It is

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.040
secured in place with 12-inch composite
redwood stakes approximately every

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.329
three feet.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.450
The composite stakes are screwed into
the bend-a-board.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.870
This holds the bend-a-board in place and
at the proper elevation.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.870
The top of your bend-a-board should be
even with the top of your sub base. When

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.530
installing the bend-a-board, leave a
half-inch gap between the bend-a-board

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.780
and any constructed restraints such as
sidewalks, patios or walkways. We'll

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.260
explain later why you're doing this but
suffice to say it leads to creating a

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.390
beautiful looking natural edge.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.129
We recommend that the top of your bend-a-board and the top of your sub base

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.480
should be about a half inch below any
adjacent side walks, patios or walkways.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.250
You want to maximize the amount of pile
height that is above adjacent flat work

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.440
for the most realistic appearance. Spread
and compact base. Base selection.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.930
Your base is usually a class II road
base, a crushed miscellaneous base, a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.849
cement treated base or a decomposed
granite. Road base, as opposed to

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.190
decomposed granite is less expensive and
compacts better. Its disadvantage is that

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.030
it's harder to obtain a really smooth
surface and it doesn't drain as well.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.430
Decomposed granite drains better and
provides for a very smooth surface but

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.979
is more expensive and doesn't compact as
well. As a general rule road base is used

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.090
on landscaping applications and
decomposed granite on putting greens.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.289
Oftentimes on putting greens an
installer will opt to do the bottom

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.580
two inches in road base and the top one
inch in decomposed granite for cost

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.419
considerations. Base compaction.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.180
This is a critical step in the
installation process. The primary reason

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.410
you removed three inches of native soil
and replaced it with a base material is

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.030
that you wanted to replace an expansive
sub base with one that is not going to

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.580
expand. If you install artificial grass
over an expansive soil over the course

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.930
of a year or so as you pass through
rainy seasons and dry seasons the soil

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.840
will expand and contract. As it expands
it will pull or push on the artificial

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.690
grass. When the soil contracts

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.350
you will be left with bubbles and your
artificial grass will look like carpet

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.120
that needs to be stretched. So be sure to
get a good compaction on your sub base.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.700
This is typically done with a vibratory
plate compactor, roller and or hand

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.730
tamper to get those hard-to-reach areas
and tight corners.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.740
Be sure to wet down your base as you are
compacting it to help remove any voids

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.200
or air spaces. Purchase Green recommends
that you incorporate minor grade changes

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.570
to provide the most realistic look.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.660
Crowning the middle is always an
excellent option.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.930
Also be sure that you are accounting for
water runoff.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.760
Like most flatwork installations you
want a one to two percent fall and give

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.510
consideration to where and when drain
lines are necessary or appropriate.

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.969
Installation of a commercial grade weed
barrier.

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:07.939
It is unlikely that you will get weeds
through your artificial grass but that

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.229
doesn't mean it never occurs. If you
didn't do enough excavation or your sub

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.819
base is contaminated

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.789
you may get weeds that grow through
drainage holes that are in most

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.019
artificial grasses. The weed barrier is
just an added layer of protection.

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:26.119
This concludes our segment on sub base
preparation.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:32.029
Here's a summary: The first step in sub
base preparation is excavation. A minimum

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:38.119
of three inches is required to ensure a
solid sub base foundation. For the best

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:41.269
possible install consider a subgrade
bend-a-board.

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:45.019
It helps secure the perimeter of the
artificial grass and provides for a

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:47.899
beautiful, clean and natural-looking edge.

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:51.679
Be sure to choose the correct base for
your application.

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:55.729
A crushed road base is generally good
for landscape applications while

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:01.969
decomposed granite is better suited for
putting greens. Base compaction not only

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:06.229
improves the look of your artificial
grass once installed but also protects

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:11.959
against expansion and contraction in the
base, which can lead to buckling. Remember

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:15.589
to grade during base compaction to
ensure proper water runoff.

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:21.050
Finally the last step before installing
your artificial graphs is applying a

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:27.110
commercial grade weed barrier. This thin
geotextile fabric protects against weeds

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.729
or other growth that may result from
base contamination or otherwise make its

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:34.519
way through the drainage holes in the
artificial grass.
