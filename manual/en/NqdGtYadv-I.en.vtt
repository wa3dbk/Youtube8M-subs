00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:04.237 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.638 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; "DO YOU CELEBRATE KWANZA AT
YOUR SCHOOL," ONE OFFICER

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.874 align:start position:0% line:85%
TEXTED.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:10.576 line:91%
REPLY, "YEAH, WE BURN THE CROSS
ON THE FIELD, THEN WE CELEBRATE

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:15.581 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHITEMAS."

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.083 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IN ANOTHER TEXT, THE N WORD
IS USED TO DESCRIBE BLACK WOMEN.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.084 size:75% position:38% line:85%
"THEY SHOULD BE SPAYED."

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:24.891 align:start position:0% line:91%
RESPONSE, "I SAW ONE AN HOUR AGO
WITH FOUR KIDS."

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.859 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I'D LIKE TO FORMALLY
APOLOGIZE TO THE PRINCIPAL WHO

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:34.133 line:91%
OBSERVED THAT BLACK PEOPLE WERE
LEAVING AND I IMPLIED THAT HER

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.836 align:start position:0% line:85%
COMMENTS WERE RACIST.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:43.042 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THESE (BLEEP)S ARE RACIST.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.076 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.982 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.250 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND BY THE WAY, FOUR IS NOT THAT
MANY KIDS!

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:52.718 line:91%
YOU'RE MAD ABOUT A BLACK WOMAN
WITH FOUR CHILDREN, AND YOU HAVE

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.220 line:91%
NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT A WHITE
FAMILY ON TV THAT'S TRYING TO

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:59.659 align:start position:0% line:91%
BREAK THE VAGINAL CANAL WORLD
SPEED RECORD.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.693 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOTHIN'!

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.229 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LOOK, LET'S PLAY TWO RACIST

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:04.130 align:start position:0% line:85%
TEXTS AND A LIE.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.364 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU THREE
RACIST TEXTS.

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:06.098 line:85%
TWO ARE REAL, AND ONE IS A LIE.

00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:08.701 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH IS
WHICH.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.369 line:91%
OKAY, WE'VE GOT CROSS BURNING
LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE -- THAT'S

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:13.706 align:start position:0% line:85%
A WEIRD ONE.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.309 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEN ALL N-WORD'S MUST
(BLEEP)-ING HANG.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:20.513 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEN (BLEEP)ING N WORD.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.582 align:start position:0% line:85%
ANY GUESSES?

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:23.282 align:start position:0% line:85%
HA, JUST KIDDING!

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:23.883 align:start position:0% line:85%
THOSE ARE ALL REAL.

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.152 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT A FUN GAME!

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:31.657 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH --

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:44.237 align:start position:0% line:91%
HEY, IF YOU'RE TIRED OF
GAMES LISTEN TO.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.371 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:46.839 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS
INVESTIGATING THREE THOUSAND

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:50.443 align:start position:0% line:91%
CASES IN WHICH THE OFFICERS WERE
INVOLVED, CASES THAT COULD BE

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:56.516 align:start position:0% line:91%
TAINTED BY PERCEIVED RACIAL
BIAS.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.817 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: PERCEIVED RACIAL
BIAS?

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.920 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
SPAYING BLACK WOMEN, YOU'RE PAST

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
PERCEIVED. EVEN THE FERGUSON
COPS ARE, LIKE, "WHOA!"

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.193 line:85%
"THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE RACIST."

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:11.631 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT ONE OF THE COPS CAME FORWARD
AND MOUTH-TEXTED AN APOLOGY.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:15.935 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF I OFFENDED ANYBODY, I'M
SORRY.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:16.669 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M TRULY, TRULY SORRY.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.638 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOWEVER --
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO HOWEVER!

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:24.544 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO HOWEVER!

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:29.649 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HOWEVER, IT'S BANTER AMONGST
FRIENDS.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:33.019 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BANTER AMONGST
FRIENDS?

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.821 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE YOU GUYS WATCHING THE NEWS
AT ALL?

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.191 size:88% position:44% line:85%
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YEAR IT IS?

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:42.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
I SUSPECT YOU DO BECAUSE YOU'RE
TEXTING.

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:48.034 line:91%
I MEAN, IF YOU WERE SENDING
TELEGRAMS ABOUT THIS, MAY I'D

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.003 align:start position:0% line:85%
GIVE YOU A PASS.

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:52.071 align:start position:0% line:91%
"HOW ABOUT THEM (BLEEP)-ING
APES?

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:53.172 align:start position:0% line:85%
STOP."

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:53.940 line:85%
"I THINK WE SHOULD BURN A CROSS.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.141 align:start position:0% line:85%
STOP."

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.275 line:91%
IT WOULD BE WRONG, BUT YOU'RE
OBVIOUSLY STUCK IN A DIFFERENT

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:57.343 align:start position:0% line:85%
TIME.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.245 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WHAT MAKES IT MORE
TROUBLING -- THIS HAPPENED IN

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:01.414 align:start position:0% line:91%
SAN FRANCISCO, HOME OF
RICE-A-RONI  AND OTHER TOLERANT

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:02.647 align:start position:0% line:85%
PROGRESSIVE STUFF.
