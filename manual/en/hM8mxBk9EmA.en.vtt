00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
Reverend Kevin O'Brien:
The Vice President has asked
that we bless this occasion

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.066
with prayer.

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.200
And so let us pray.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:14.433
The Prophet Micah proclaims,
you have been told, oh,

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:19.867
mortal what is good and what
the Lord requires of you,

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:24.400
only to do justice and to love
goodness and to walk humbly

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.400
with your God.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:29.934
Gracious God, at this
moment in our history,

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:33.133
we ask your blessing on
your servant, Joseph,

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.633
as he renews his sacred
pledge to his country.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.900
And that all the
complexities of our world,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.767
a world so beautiful
but also broken,

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:47.233
give him a share of your wisdom
so that he can know what is good

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:51.800
and give him the courage to
always do what is right.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.233
Walk close by him so that he
can do justice and to labor

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:59.467
tirelessly for a more
just and gentle world.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:02.667
Empower him to be a voice
for those without a voice,

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:06.200
for those on the margins,
those so easily overlooked,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.467
for you will judge us all by how
we care for the least among us.

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.667
Continue to give him the
humility to always call upon you

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.000
in times of need and with the
gift of faith given to him by

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.600
his church and his family,
help him to always know of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
your presence.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.934
Lord, protect our President and
our Vice President and their

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:32.166
families in their
service to us all.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.567
Finally, we thank you for
the blessings of peace and

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.100
of liberty.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.266
We honor the sacrifices of
so many in our military,

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.066
in our foreign service,
in civil service,

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:47.667
who safeguard these blessings
daily and we renew our pledge as

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:52.300
citizens to join them in that
noble labor to always work for

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.734
the common good.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:58.133
And so, help us to set aside
self- interest and to meet one

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:03.166
another on the common
ground to which you call us.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.900
You, generous God, have given
us so much and we humbly offer

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.233
these gifts for the good
of others and for your

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:10.600
greater glory.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.633
Amen.
