00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.860
You're having a movie marathon.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.960
Each movie lasts
about 1 and 3/4 hours.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.420
If you want to watch
3 movies, how long

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.660
will your movie marathon last?

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.490
You can use the
number line below

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.970
to help you find your answer.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.020
So each movie lasts
1 and 3/4 hours long.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.330
So let's say the
first movie happens

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.710
to be Star Wars,
which I probably

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.250
would include in
any movie marathon.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.480
So it's going to be
1 and 3/4 hours long.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.388
So this is 1,.

00:00:32.388 --> 00:00:35.150
1, and then we're
going to have 3/4 more.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.940
So each of these are
a fourth because we

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.770
have 4 sections between
1 and 2-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.070
So we're going to watch 3/4.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.340
1, 2, 3.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.960
So that's how long
my first movie is.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.920
And then, my second movie is
going to be another 1 and 3/4.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.150
So 1 is 4/4.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.842
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:57.550
And then we're going
to have another 3/4.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.940
1, 2, 3.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.370
And just as the way I said
that, 4/4 and 3/4 is 7/4.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.606
So 1 and 3/4, that's
the same thing as 7/4.

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:07.730
And you see that over here.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.450
When I did the 1
and 3/4 in blue,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.580
I actually marked off 7/4.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.300
Same thing here,
here in magenta.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.700
And now, let's do it in green.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.770
So Gandhi is actually a good
bit longer than 1 and 3/4,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.660
but it's a good movie,
so I put it here

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.570
just because it's
one of my favorites.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.320
And so let's do another
1 and 3/4 hours.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.180
Or we could do that as 4/4
plus 3/4 hours, or 7/4.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.390
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.610
So that gets us to 5.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.650
So this point right over
here is 5 and 1/4 hours.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.870
Now, let's see if we
get that same result

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.200
when we do it mathematically.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.270
I guess this is
mathematical as well.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.240
But every movie lasts
1 and 3/4 hours.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.700
We already said
that 1 and 3/4 is

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.810
the same thing as 1 plus 3/4.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.010
1 is the same thing as 4/4.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.870
So it's 4/4 plus 3/4, which
is the same thing as 7/4.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.810
And another way to
convert this mixed number

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.000
into an improper fraction,
you say, hey, look.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.140
4 times 1 is 4--
and that's really

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.120
where you're getting the
4/4 from-- plus 3 is 7.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.330
7/4.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.600
Now, we're going to do 7/4
of an hour three times.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.000
So we're going to
multiply 7/4 times 3.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.610
Now, there are several ways
that you could think about this.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.410
You could literally view
this as having three 7/4

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.170
and adding them together.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.180
So 7/4 plus 7/4 plus 7/4,
which would be equal to 21/4.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.430
And if you wanted to convert
this into a mixed number,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.620
21/4 is the same thing as--
well, 4 goes into 20 evenly.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.240
So you could call
this 20/4 plus 1/4.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.030
And 20/4 is the same thing as 5.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.220
So it's 5 and 1/4, which is
exactly what we saw here.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.090
Another way of thinking
about it, you could say 7/4.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.192
And then we can multiply
it by 3/1, times 3/1,

00:03:18.192 --> 00:03:20.650
just to make it clear that
we're multiplying the numerators

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.820
and multiplying
the denominators.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.230
So in the numerator, I'm
to have 7 plus 7 plus 7.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.205
That's 7 times 3.

00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.580
And in the
denominator, I'm going

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.900
to have 4 times 1,
which is just 4.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.560
Well, this is just
7 times 3 over 4,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.808
or 21/4, which we've
already seen is 5 and 1/4.
