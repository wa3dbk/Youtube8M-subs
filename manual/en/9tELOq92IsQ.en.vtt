Hi Everyone, today's video is brought to you by Ben and Jerry's. They are Supporting Marriage Equality in Australia

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:13.987

00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:19.186
To show my support, I am rocking these bold and beautiful marriage equality nails

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:23.888
You know what they say, if you love it, you should be able to put a ring on it

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:27.776
As always, start with base coat to protect your nails

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:36.235
For the Thumb, Middle and Pinky Finger, apply a coat of white nail polish

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:54.062
Then apply a mid toned blue color to the index and ring finger to create an alternating matching set of nails

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:02.662
Of course you can use any colors you like to recreate this look

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:08.883
let that completely dry before moving on

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:18.425
Next we're going to use the help of some magic tape to divide the nails into 4 sections

00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:28.153
So take a section of tape from the dispenser and cut that piece in half

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.149
Place the straight edge onto the top right and bottom left corner of the nail

00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:50.600
make sure the edges are suck down properly so the nail polish wont slip through

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.580
Have both the mid toned blue and dark blue bottle open, and fill in one of the exposed sections with each color

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:25.540
Then peel off the sticky tapes before the nail polish dries

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:31.360
If you wait too long to peel, It might take off the polish from the areas you want to stay put

00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:35.160
Then do the same for the remaining nails

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:42.080
You can alternate the position of the tapes so that you can switch up the position of the colors for each nail

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:50.940
Try to get the dark blue to each corner of the nail since it's the only color that doesn't take up 2 sections

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.490
if the sticky tape is too sticky, you can peel it off the back of your hand a few times to reduce the stickiness

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:15.940
Once you've peeled the tape off all the nails, you should end up with a checked pattern like this

00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:24.770
Next grab a silver striper brush and apply a thin line across the intersections to clean up the lines a little bit

00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:33.800
Another way to achieve this 4 sectioned check design with a boarder, is using a striping tape

00:03:34.225 --> 00:03:38.890
you can see how that's done in my 5 ways to create puzzle nails video

00:03:38.894 --> 00:03:44.830
Apply clear coat as adhesive to the middle of the nail and place the heart decal on top

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.900
For the Pinky finger, a decal this big can stick out on the sides and make it easier to come off

00:03:53.896 --> 00:04:00.390
So grab a pen or pencil and press the decal onto it to create a curvature like this

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:07.300
Then place it onto the nail and it will stay put for longer

00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:14.490
For the other fingers, apply 2 rectangle studs to create the equality sign

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.190
leave a comment below and let me know what your thoughts are on marriage equality

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:35.950
When you're done, apply top coat to seal in the decals

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:40.730
