00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
DVD presentation live
15th of December 2013
Abaton cinema - Hamburg, Germany

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I really like it

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
As a classical musician, teacher, professor,
Iâ€™am always a little bit sceptical

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But no! This is fun
and it is never boring

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
always intelligently played
precisely played

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and always present!
Not a moment imprecise

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.000
I heard before, what we will do in the concert

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but I never expected it to become so great

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And then there were the new challenges,
a lot of movement and the special look

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
welcome with us on stage, the JGOH juniors team!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
