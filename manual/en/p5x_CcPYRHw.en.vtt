Hi this is CJ South representing expertvillage.com.
In this clip I'm going to show you the capture

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.390
clip feature in final cut pro. Okay, time
to go over my personal favorite way to capture:

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.960
the capture clip method. Like I said before,
I like more control over my clips, and this

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.859
is control right here. You can basically set
a specific portion that you'll want to capture,

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.090
and you can set it and leave it and go. We
capture, now you have to be there so you can

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.780
hit escape to make it stop but, with capture
clip it will automatically start where you

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.600
want it to start and stop where you want it
to stop. So its very powerful, especially

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.269
when you have all the things to do, which
I do all the time and I'm sure you do as well.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.960
So now to make capture clip work you have
to set a in and a out point on your footage.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.140
I briefly showed that earlier, so I will show
you again. Just go ahead and click the play

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.960
button to play your footage. Then you can
hit this button to the left here called mark

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.110
in. you can hit that to make a in point or
you can hit 'I' on your keyboard to make an

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.290
in point, and then come to the right here
and click the mark out button, or just click

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.770
'O' on your keyboard. Go ahead and stop that.
Now as you can see my in point was set at

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.310
whatever the footage was when it was running;
as soon I found that spot I hit the 'I' key,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:49.380
and whatever the time code was in that moment
is now frozen at my in mark. Same with the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.500
out. Out is now frozen at whatever I hit the
'O' key at or I clicked the button there.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:07.110
So now you have this space, this area in between
these two time codes that you want to capture.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.500
If you look in the upper left corner, you
can see where this is the duration is. So

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:21.000
my clip is going to be 8.15 seconds: 8 seconds
and 15 frames. So now to capture that footage,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.522
I just go ahead and I'll click the clip button
and the log clip comes up. Now it is going

00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:33.420
to ask you what is the name, and a default
to the name that you have put over in the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.370
description. So you can rename it here if
you want, but I recommend leaving it at whatever

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.430
the description was when you named it. You
can put a note too but don't worry about it,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.319
just go ahead and click okay. Now what it
does is now it cues your tape back to that

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.550
first time code that you set your in point,
and it will play and capture through the out

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.580
point that you set. So when it is all said
and done, all you will get is that portion

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.880
that you wanted and it will throw it into
your bin, your browser window, as it is doing

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:22.360
right nowâ€”it is capturing that section.
Then it hit a time code break; that happens.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.180
My skills as a cameraman sometimes suck. So
we'll capture and put into your browser and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.490
that is all there is to it. And you can continue
to do that, to capture a specific section

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.520
that you want in your footage.
