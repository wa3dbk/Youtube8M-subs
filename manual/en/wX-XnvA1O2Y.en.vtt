Hey everyone this is Lisa and I'll show how
to make this soft, chewy delicious cookie.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:13.780
For this recipe, you'll need 1 cup of unsweetened
coconut, an egg, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.180
an apple or a pear.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.570
I actually used a pear for this tutorial.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.109
1 square of dark chocolate and a toothpick.

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.119
Here, the (shredded) coconut are really thick,
so I placed them in a food processor to make

00:00:32.119 --> 00:01:39.220
them more finer.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:02:07.880
To create the cute bear faces, don't forget
to melt the dark chocolate and draw the faces

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.810
like so.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330
