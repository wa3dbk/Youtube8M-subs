00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.630
My name is Dan Spevack. I am the director
of the Montefiore Echo lab and I am highly

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.470
involved in the Montefiore/Einstein Cardiology
Fellowship Program.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.381
The fellows all rotate a substantial amount
of time through noninvasive imaging, and we

00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:29.419
do a lot of echocardiography, transesophageal
echocardiography, and stress testing, and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:39.810
fellows learn a lot about cardiac hemodynamics
while they’re in our lab and this is mainly

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.890
what we do.
Early on in the fellowship the focus of the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.810
fellows’ training is on how to obtain good
echo images, how to become a good stenographer,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.820
because it’s important to start from there
and they should know how to obtain images

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.920
themselves. As the fellowship goes on we concentrate
more on interpretation of the images, and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.990
the more senior fellows get heavily involved
in more advanced techniques, transesophageal

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:20.270
echo and stress echo interpretation. Those
who are really interested in echo learn more

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.740
about advanced techniques such as 3D echo,
strain rate imaging, speckle tracking, and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.390
things like that.
Like all cardiology fellowships at major academic

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:43.069
medical centers, we have all the pieces to
make a solid foundation. We have a strong

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:50.159
division of Cardiology but it’s also important
to have a strong overall medical center. You

00:01:50.159 --> 00:02:00.179
can pick any major organ system and Montefiore
does transplants in those areas. We have a

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:09.580
really well developed basic science laboratory
at the medical school. There are lots of opportunities

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.890
for collaborations between departments, between
the basic science and clinical medicine, and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.360
I think the foundation is very strong. Probably
you will find some similar setups at the top-tier

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.080
programs around the country, but what sets
us apart is that our collaborative efforts

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.890
are very easy. There’s a nice collaboration
between a lot of the departments, without

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.860
the turf battles that you hear about at other
centers. There’s a culture at Montefiore

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.320
of collaboration and cooperation, and to me
that’s made working here very pleasant and

00:02:51.320 --> 00:03:00.010
it certainly trickles down to the fellow level.
Within cardiology one of the things that has

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:10.010
made us famous here is our Arrhythmia department—the
first pacemaker was put in at Montefiore.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.800
Our Arrhythmia group is a world-renowned group.
The head of that department, John Fisher,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:25.470
is chair of the major arrhythmia organization,
the Heart Rhythm Society,and he’s editor

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.681
in chief of Pace, a premier journal on arrhythmia.
That’s sort of what Montefiore cardiology

00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:39.410
is most famous for. The cath lab is very strong
and the noninvasive imaging has always been

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.710
very strong and now with our new chief of
Cardiology, Dr. Garcia, noninvasive imaging

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.255
has become a major focus in our division and
I think we’ll continue to grow.

00:03:51.255 --> 00:03:55.720
I went to New York University for my fellowship
experience, and I thought it was wonderful

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.620
there. I certainly felt that I got the tools
I needed to succeed and I was able to come

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.770
out and get a job working here, working with
Cardiology fellows and publishing research

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.900
and working with cardiology patients. I feel
like I came from a background and a good program

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:25.910
that put me in a position to do what I wanted
to do, I see our fellows graduating and I

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.950
think that we also provide a lot of that,
that the vast majority our fellows when they

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.380
graduate
are extremely pleased with where they ended

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.690
up. The fact that we’re able to provide
our fellows with the experience to do what

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:53.710
they want to do when they graduate is fantastic.
NYU, for being a great program, did miss certain

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:03.190
things. When I came here I had to virtually
train myself in heart failure, transplant,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.790
and left ventricular assist devices because
that was something not done at NYU at the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.290
time when I was there. The diversity of experience
that we have here may be a little greater

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.000
because of programs like that. I think that’s
also one of our strengths.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.670
I think that we try to keep avery warm, sort
of safe environment for our fellows. We try

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.790
to make it so that this is the time in your
training when you really get to work one on

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.890
one with an attending, much more than you
have in the past, and you can feel verycomfortable

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.750
with your basics of knowledge because you
asked all of the questions you had floating

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.450
around that you were afraid to get out earlier
in your training. We work hard in all of our

00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:01.660
departments here to create this environment
of learning and collaboration and I think

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.830
that’s one of the things that makes this
a fun place to work.
