I'm Karina Fraley for Expert Village and today
I'm showing you how to make gift wrapping

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.540
using recycled items from around the house.
So I'm going to use this white ribbon and

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.070
I have just enough that says happy holidays
and I'm gonna use that and I actually want

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:23.570
to get a clean happy holidays around the front.
So I'm gonna start the edge of the seam with

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.779
the rest of it and actually you can take your
lid off at this point and go all the way to

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:43.890
the top with it. Put it there. And do your
dots around pull it nice and tight so it doesn't

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.620
slide on you cause otherwise it might slide
down. And than just go all the way around

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:03.260
the line at the end there. Pull it nice and
tight and go ahead and cut it. And than I'm

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:16.170
gonna fold it under actually I need to cut
this one a little more. I'm gonna fold it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:28.170
under. And one more dab of glue, hold it down
and there you go a very cute little can you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.130
can put anything in here. You can put in candy
or some fresh baked goods if you want, jewelry,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.819
little socks anything. Anything that fits
in here can go in there and its a very lovely

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:48.310
gift. You put the lid on and there is a very
cute little container that you can reuse.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.780
Not only have you reuse the coffee can but
once the gift is removed whoever the gift

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.930
receiver is can now use this as a pen case
throughout the holidays, or can put out some

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.709
candy canes whatever use they want to make
of it. Its a really nice little packaging.
