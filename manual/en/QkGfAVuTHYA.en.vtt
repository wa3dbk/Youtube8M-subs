00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.809
Hi, Welcome to Rhodes Video Recipe Box! Today I am going to show you a Spider Web Pepperoni 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.270
Pizza and what you'll need is 9 Rhodes Dinner Rolls and you want them thawed to room

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.619
temperature. You will combine them and roll it out into this 12 inch pizza

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.029
crust.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.390
And then what you are going to do, is take your pizza pan.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.689
Spray it with some non-stick cooking spray,

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.550
and then just put your crust

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.310
on your pan 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.080
just press the edges up against

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.190
pizza pan.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.390
Then you are going to take a fork and poke with a fork several times

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.800
and this will prevent it from bubbling

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.120
While you baking it, and this crust needs to pre bake, so we are going to stick it in the oven 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.800
at 350 for about ten minutes.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.300
Ok, next what you want to do, after your crust is pre baked and cooled just 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.160
a little

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.160
you just going to put your toppings on. So 
you are going to start with your marinara sauce.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.270
I just like to use the back of a spoon to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.300
spread this on.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.890
Ok, next you are just going to put your toppings on and I am using Pepperonis.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.890
now you could use um... italian
sausage you could use ham, whatever your family likes to eat.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.640
Ok, next what you want to do, is put your cheese on

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.630
and this is kind of the fun and tricky part. You are going to put your cheese on like a 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.950
spider web. so, it's really easy you are just
going to take these long slices of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.400
mozzarella

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.280
We are just going to go down this pizza

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.600
straight line

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.600
and then across the pizza, and then a diagonal  

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.750
and then a diagonal on the other direction.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.950
And then we are going to do three circles

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.730
We are going to doa big one on the outside.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.659
This will make our web.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.079
Then, little bit smaller circle

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.189
inside.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.779
And then one at the very middle

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:25.019
Now, this needs to go back into the oven, just until the cheese melts slightly. 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.419
Ok, so my pizza is out of the oven and before I serve it, this is my favorite

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.739
part about this recipe you are going to make the little black widow spider so you are going to

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.919
take an olive and just want to cut a little sliver off of one edge and that will be body.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.579
So i am going to put my body down.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.349
Then you are going to take another olive and you don't want to use the side that has the big hole.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.099
Use this other end

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.669
and cut off a piece for the head. Put the head down.

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.589
And then the legs, so you are going to take an olive, i am going to use this bigger one

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.679
and cut it in half

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:04.129
and then you just want to get four legs out of each half.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:11.129
So just slice four little legs off. Put those on

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.439
And won't you be the coolest mom for dinner!

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:25.439
