00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
I don't know if you noticed but on Snapchat every time that...

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.360
Oh this? Yeah! Yeah I moved!

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.100
That's not true.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.120
It's actually just decoration. There's nothing around.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.670
Lights don't even work... Ok this one does work.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.160
For the adults that are watching this video: Snapchat, what is it?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.120
It's an application that allows you to send messages, pictures and videos that last for a few seconds.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.040
Even if you are old you can download it. You just gotta type "Snapchat"

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.760
"F-A-C-E-B-O-O-K" and then you're good!

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.080
The anti-elder technique.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.940
Snapchat is kinda surprising when you start using it. I mean... Why send a picture  that's gonna be deleted right after you saw it?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Photography is an art! It's the 8th art. It tells a story.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.960
It's noble!

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.320
And there!

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.200
I'm proud to show you my masterpiece.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.800
Did you like it ?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.440
Do you want to talk about it?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.493
What's funny about Snapchat is that

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:48.320
there is often a difference between the snaps you send to someone of the same sex, your bro for example,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.400
and the snaps you send to someone of the opposite sex.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.640
Like a girl you wanna date.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.360
It's awkward this behavior on snapchat

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.600
We don't behave this way in the real life...

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.680
We all love to receive a cute snapchat,  or even one that's a little bit naughty.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.300
Even just naughty that's enough.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.040
When one of your friends next to you gets one, you want to see it!

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.870
Wow she is so hot!

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.440
Oh, too late. Sorry.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.760
Alright bye!

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.860
Oh! That girl!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.320
I'm gonna do like a "5 tweets to avoid on Twitter"

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.520
I'm gonna present to you the 5 things I hate to see on Snapchat:

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.270
5. The Artist/Painter's Snap

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.150
I sometimes receive snapchats with some crazy drawings!

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.560
The dude spent hours drawing it and when I compare it to mine, I feel totally lame.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.600
Like if it was normal the guy has more talent with his finger than you with all the paper on the planet.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.080
So when I receive this... I don't answer.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.400
So the guy just get like crazy like:

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.590
"I SPENT 3 HOURS DRAWING THIS SNAPCHAT COULD YOU JUST ANSWER!"

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.870
Yes, I'm a jerk.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.200
4. You can choose how many seconds your snap will last.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.790
I don't understand why some people just put the maximum length of time for a boring Snapchat.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.040
WHY?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.060
Why does your cat deserve 10 seconds. A lot of thing may happen in 10 seconds!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.240
You're under arrest.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.880
You're mistaken!

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.120
I just saved your life.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.670
Thank you so much!

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.630
Look !

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.670
Meanwhile...

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.060
There's too many! We're gonna die! Hello mom?

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.380
Hello

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.800
What?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.740
I'm your mother. I had a sex change.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.760
Dad?! I mean, mom?!

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.660
3. You can know who has taken a screenshot of your snap.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.350
This is a super interesting feature... and there are people who take screenshots of every snap you send them.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.160
Why would you do that?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.820
I'm making a collection of pictures of people and I print them and put them in my mouth - like this!

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.440
(I only see this explanation)

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.280
2. There are people who make useless ten-second snaps.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.700
And the reverse, there are those that make one-second snap.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.880
How much, exactly, can you see in a second?

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.030
You think you're playing a memory game, is that it?

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.920
Luckily, the snaps that last a second are usually...dick pics.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.460
That's why I take screenshots..!

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.820
1. Maybe the most annoying thing about Snapchat

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:19.400
is when I receive a short video... but it's entirely silent.

00:03:19.401 --> 00:03:22.500
(inaudible snap video)

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.720
I hope that that wasn't interesting.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720
I'm criticizing Snapchat a lot, but it's still amazing.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.950
Sometimes, I receive memorable snaps of my friends. We laugh a lot at them.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.800
Also, you can add me on Snapchat. It's CyprienVideo

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.760
Simple as that.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.640
On the other hand, how can we talk about Snapchat

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.380
without mentioning the biggest fear of the app's users.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.860
We all fear that one day...

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.840
Yea, in fact, since the start, we've kept all the photos.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.460
And, starting now, they're all available on the internet.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.320
Ok, bye!

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.430
Subscribe!

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.340
Well, only if you want to...do as you wish. That's just how it is.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.340
I want to say just a little thing concerning the video I made before this

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.600
I was very insensitive when I said that Romans were thieves

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.600
I regret having said that.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.600
That was very stupid on my part.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.840
I never wanted to stir up hate. You can even say that it's exactly the opposite.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.760
I don't want to stigmatize a certain group of people.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.120
I just want everyone to laugh normally.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.340
I made a mistake.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.340
And I hope that you don't do it.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.340
I'm counting on you!
