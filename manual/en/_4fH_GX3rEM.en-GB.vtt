00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.420
There can be no doubt whatsoever; the one
thing Malaysia is famous for, beyond its breathtaking

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.719
rainforests, is its tasty food!

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.280
One of the simplest, but most delectable of all Malaysian staples is the humble roti canai

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.200
- a moist, flaky, yummy flatbread that
has developed over generations amongst Malaysia's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.640
South Indian community.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.859
A breakfast staple, food stalls and cafÃ©s
across Malaysia's cities and villages are

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.610
crowded with people making, selling and eating roti canai.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.300
Roti canai is made from a wheat dough, prepared
and spread with ghee, and then eaten with

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.300
various spicy, savoury sauces, most usually
dhal, but also mutton, fish or veggie curries.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:01:04.500
Saya makan murtabak daging kambing dan kari - sedap!
[I'm eating lamb murtabak (stuffed roti) and curry - tasty!]

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.430
True enough: Food is one of the most popular
subjects among Malaysians both at home and abroad.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.790
This single mindedness about eating is imprinted

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.720
upon the minds of locals, as well as expats
- like me - who've lived there for any amount

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.200
of time.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.460
There are lots of roti variations, named according
to their extra ingredients or styles of cooking,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.200
and they all look similar to roti canai, but
there is one type that definitely stands out.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.200
It's the sweetest and tallest of all rotis
- and it's called roti tisu.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.159
Roti tisu preparation involves:
- stretching the dough

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.549
- placing it on a sizzling hotplate
- adding extra ghee and sugar for that yum factor

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.950
And then rolling it into a cone, once the pastry

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.950
is cooked to a beautiful, golden brown.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.900
Makanan ini roti tisu, tradisional, manis; Malaysia - sedapnya!
[This dish is roti tissue, traditional, sweet; Malaysia - it's tasty!]
