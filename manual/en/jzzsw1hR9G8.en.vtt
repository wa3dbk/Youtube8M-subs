00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.297
One of the major themes in photography

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:12.000
is this desire to have a more permanent image.

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:13.891
You have the woodburytype.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.000
You have the platinum print.

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.066
Very stable, very long lasting processes.

00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:22.066
Then you also have the pigment family of
processes.

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:25.825
The gum bichromate process and the carbon print
process.

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:52.231
The gum print is based on the light sensitivity of
chromium.

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:56.297
Mungo Ponton is the first person to really do
experiments

00:00:56.363 --> 00:00:58.693
with the light sensitivity of this compound.

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:02.297
Talbot himself experiments with chromium salts.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.759
He discovers that if you mix them with colloids

00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:10.330
gelatin or gum they harden when they are
exposed to sunlight.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.198
Based on the work of Talbot it doesn’t take too much time

00:01:13.264 --> 00:01:16.396
for people to figure out that if we take a colloid

00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:24.264
like gum arabic, and we put pigment into those, 
and then sensitize those with chromium salts

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.726
we now have a medium that can brushed onto
paper

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.330
expose it to light under a negative

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.396
and when we put this paper in warm water areas
that 

00:01:37.462 --> 00:01:41.066
are struck by light will harden, and that’s where 
the dark pigment will be.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:46.792
Areas that are not struck by light will dissolve
away, leaving the white of the paper. 

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:51.462
So now we have a brand new printing process,
 based on chromium.

00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:58.198
If you look at a gum print, the darker the picture, 
the thicker the deposit of gum. 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.396
The whiter the picture, the more you are getting
towards the actual paper. 

00:02:02.858 --> 00:02:06.264
So the image itself will have slight relief. 

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:12.924
One of the names associated with gum printing
and carbon printing is Alphonse Poitevin.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.396
He is a Frenchman who perfects certain elements
of chromium printing.  

00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:21.363
While it is still imperfect, it is the seed

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:25.000
to an improvement that is later done by Joseph Swan  

00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:29.000
that results in the process we now call carbon 
printing. 

00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:37.198
It is essentially a piece of paper that is coated
with gelatin that is bearing pigment. 

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:43.198
This thing is called the “tissue” but it is not tissue 
like at all, it’s like a piece of plastic. 

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:48.297
The tissue is sensitized with chromium.

00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:50.957
It is then contacted printed with a negative. 

00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:56.627
The light striking the gelatin
hardens it selectively.

00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:03.363
The tissue is then put into cold water, and a 
second piece of paper bearing clear gelatin

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.462
on the surface is put into contact with the tissue.

00:03:07.594 --> 00:03:10.924
They are slid into a tray with hot water.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:15.924
The unhardened gelatin with pigment oozes out
the edges.

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:18.792
It is softening because of the hot water.

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:26.165
You peal off the original tissue, and by washing it
in hot water

00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:32.693
you take away all the black you don’t need
in order to get a continuous tone photograph. 

00:03:33.891 --> 00:03:36.528
The image you get is very very permanent. 

00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:40.231
It is still being done today, there are
still people making carbon prints today.

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:47.231
Pictorialists really established photography as a 
fine art form.

00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:53.660
They used things like the gum bichromate 
process or platinum prints that involved a lot 

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:56.858
of hand work and craftmanship.

00:03:56.924 --> 00:03:59.957
You really had a sense of the photographic object

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:02.099
as something that was made by somebody.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.891
Alfred Stieglitz is the person most associated with

00:04:06.957 --> 00:04:09.759
what was called the photo-secession.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.594
He and Edward Steichen co-founded the 
movement.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.297
They promoted this idea through a publication 
called Camera Work.

00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:25.396
Stieglitz had a gallery called 291 in New York that
showed 

00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:27.891
photography as an artform.

00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:33.165
This was a camera that was used by Alfred 
Stieglitz.

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:36.330
It was given to the museum by Georgia O’Keeffe
in the 1950’s.

00:04:36.594 --> 00:04:40.462
The opening of that lens determines the 
sharpness of the picture. 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.660
If you open it up quite a ways, you get an image 
that is soft around the edges.

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:50.396
He was interested in pictorialist photography,
and this was the lens designed to do that.

00:04:50.462 --> 00:04:54.264
Stieglitz, Steichen, and Kasebier wanted 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.858
people to take photography seriously as a fine 
art form. 

00:04:58.462 --> 00:05:05.099
Not just an automatic activity that produced 
images without anybody’s intervention. 

00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:08.330
I think what the argument was really about was

00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:13.495
where is the creative input of the artist in 
photography.

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:18.066
That is a theme that goes back to the invention of
the medium.
