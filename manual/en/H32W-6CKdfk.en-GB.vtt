00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.400
Every three months
The season makes a change

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.500
And as the time goes by
We also change

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.320
our clothes and our habits
we gotta re-arrange

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.920
Every three months
The season makes a change

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.760
Yes every three months
The season makes a change

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.950
Oh in the winter
It’s really kind of cold

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.640
The days are short
And rain turns to snow

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
We gotta bundle up
And wear warm clothes

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.500

Now in the spring
The flowers start to grow

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.459
It really rains a lot
And gone is the snow

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:19.359
Don’t forget an umbrella
And rubber boots when you go

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.779
Out in the spring
When the flowers start to grow

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.340
Yes in the spring the flowers start to grow

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.679
Oh in the summer
It’s quite hot you know

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.459
The days are long and sunny
To the shade we go!

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.319
We wear our bathing suits
Don’t need socks for your toes

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.739
Oh in the summer
It’s quite hot you know

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.640

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.749
Now in the autumn
The leaves start to blow

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.320
You’ll need a big rake
And it starts to get cold

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.909
So on Halloween
Don’t forget warmer clothes

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.629
Oh in the autumn
The leaves start to blow

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.080

And as the time goes by
We also change

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.850
our clothes and our habits
we gotta re-arrange

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.260
