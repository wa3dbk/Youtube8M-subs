00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:20.789
We

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.820
won't have flying cars until we have ground-based
cars that drive themselves.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.519
Any particular innovation must achieve all
the required Outcomes to satisfy the overall

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.850
desire. One of the essential outcomes of transportation
is arriving safely. Making a small mistake

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.010
while flying is a lot more dangerous than
when driving. Over 37,000 fatal vehicle accidents

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.260
happen in the USA every year. Almost all of
those car accidents are the result of some

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
kind of human error. Until you can prevent
the human errors in ground-based cars you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.480
can't do it in air cars.
Innovation follows predictable paths. Trying

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.929
to jump ahead increases the cost and difficulty
by an order of magnitude. In other words,

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:10.409
you must walk before you run. Its not entirely
true that you can't skip ahead, but it usually

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.869
is technologically expensive and the market
just isn't ready.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.460
In "Is Automotive Industry Dead or Just Stuck"
my associate, Len Kaplan, explains how improving

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.079
safety will lead to the next generation more
efficient, more affordable, and more desirable

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.420
cars. Len lays out each step for all the technological
improvements to arrive at the next paradigm

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.209
of cars.
A flying car must be lightweight. Except for

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.490
using extremely expensive exotic materials
you can't make a flying car light and strong

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.450
enough to survive a crash. The best way to
avoid damage is to avoid crashing.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.939
Car companies with a lot of push from government
have been focusing on fuel efficiency. Consumers

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.659
have consistently chosen vehicles they perceived
to be safe over fuel-efficient vehicles. The

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.039
boom of SUV sales was heavily motivated by
safety concerns. So consumers are saying safety

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.799
is the under served desire. If you look at
accident statistics for the past 14 years,

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.220
you see safety has not improved.
Government has been pushing car manufacturers

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.000
to produce alternative energy cars. But serious
technology problems stand in the way of making

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.870
alternative energy cars viable. There is a
technology gap and a consumer demand gap.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.879
Alternative energy is a future step but it's
not the next step. The next step in cars is

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.860
crash avoidance.
Cars today are safer in a crash than ever

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.959
before.
But annual deaths from car accidents in the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.640
USA have remained over 37,000 for the past
14 years. Why are cars getting safer in a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.540
crash but deaths remain the same? In 2007,
2.5 million people were injured in vehicle

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.739
accidents. There is only so much you can do
to make a car crash safe. As long as the number

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.620
of car crashes remains high deaths and injuries
will remain high.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.700
Prevent the crash, prevent injuries and save
lives. Conveniently, the things that prevent

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.430
crashes also increase fuel efficiency. Plus,
the natural progression of crash avoidance

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.379
also leads to electric cars.
So that leads us back to flying cars. Until

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.659
the technology is developed to prevent accidents
on the ground, flying cars will remain too

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.810
expensive and too dangerous for average drivers.
When will we have flying cars? We will have

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.819
flying cars when we have cars that drive themselves.
