00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.939
Joe: Start working on our template.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:08.939
What shots are going to look like.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:14.840
That's the thing we're missing at this stage,
so we're going to have to get it out very

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.840
quickly.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.620
Layla: KickTV has a very strong presence as
a football, soccer authority on YouTube.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.270
And when Adidas, who are the major world cup
sponsors, decided that they wanted to make

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.930
something on YouTube, it was a perfect partnership.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.070
Rob: The starting point for any relationship
like this needs to be a true marriage in terms

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.329
of it needs to be right for your brand, and
they need to resonate with your target audience.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.429
Gareth: The way I see KickTV working and the
way they produce working is completely different

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.449
to the way Adidas football has previously
delivered content.

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.710
Jimmy: Collaboration: If YouTube is anything
it's, "I like what that guy is doing.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.710
It's really cool.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.930
Is there something we can do to work together
to help promote both brands?"

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.999
Joe: They've built an audience which goes
back to their channel and views things at

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.140
certain times and expects to see things at
certain times.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.789
It's something that we've been looking to
do for awhile that has proved to be quite

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.649
difficult with some of the campaigns that
we have.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.130
Those guys have got that nailed, and they're
actually showing us ways that we can possibly

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.729
easily do that as well.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.000
Male Voice: Like that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Yeah.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.830
Rob: You learn KickTV is a perfect harmony
in the sense that they are football, they

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.220
know football inside out.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.280
They're youth-oriented, which appeals to our
audience behind the scenes as well.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.500
Their insight into how a show works, how you
can craft the segments for an audience for

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.980
YouTube has been invaluable.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.420
Jimmy: We've worked really hard to build up
a certain voice to this channel.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.810
For big brands like Adidas to come to us and
say, "Hey, we love what you're doing.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.880
Let's work together."

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.250
I think it will come across as genuine.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.480
We want to work with Adidas, you want to work
with us?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.360
Let's have some fun.
