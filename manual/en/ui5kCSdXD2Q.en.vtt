00:00:01.279 --> 00:00:03.160
You ever hear of Lent?

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.340
no not lint, Lent.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.920
lint you find in

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.919
belly button, what we don't say belly button? Sorry. Never mind.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.119
We are talking about Lent

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.220
Not lint on this episode, not 'ipisode' of Chuck Knows Church [fun intro music]

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
Lent is observed in the liturgical year
for approximately six weeks.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.990
Considered a time of preparation leading
up to Easter. Is this awkward for anyone

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.470
else?

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.870
I think we can.. think we're good. Thank you.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.890
huh [regroup pause]

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.650
In most...

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.150
In most western protestant churches Sundays
are not counted as part of Lent so the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.310
time for Ash Wednesday until Easter is
40 days when Sundays are excluded. This is

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.880
to recognize the 40 days that Jesus
spent fasting in the desert where he

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.490
endured temptations before beginning his
public ministry.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.610
Now, as we said

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.020
Lent is a time to prepare for Easter.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.760
In fact, the church focuses on increasing
spiritual disciplines such as prayer &amp;

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.800
repentance or self-denial like giving
up sweets or fatty foods

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.040
or the mispronunciation of words like Lent.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.960
all this provides an example to those
preparing to live out the covenant of

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.440
baptism.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.530
now that's why Lent can also be a time
to take on something

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.740
a chance to improve yourself uh... grow spiritually

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.420
work on relational or bodily fitness

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.119
learn to juggle

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.119
whatever it is you choose to do or not do
it's about enhancing the discipline of

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.460
the whole body for a conversion from sin &amp; death

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.730
to love and life in Jesus Christ.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.159
Now, my favorite part is right before Lent
on Shrove Tuesday

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.360
a.k.a.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.360
Fat Tuesday the day before Ash Wednesday
and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.900
and right after

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.130
no interesting nickname Monday.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.540
Fat Tuesday is when we eat up all the
good food in the house to prepare for

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.859
the fasting season of the 40 days of Lent.

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:20.409
Which always translates to a pancake breakfast at our church.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.760
Can I get a fork?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.829
[off camera] "We already did the Shrove Tuesday episode"
[Chuck] Give it.. Did you ever hear of seconds?
[behind the scenes giggles]
