00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.677
Christine Cuddie: So today we had our capstone presentation 

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:17.140
it is a project that we have been working on for three months

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.468
and it is basically a collective presentation of everything we have learned

00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:23.384
in the past four years between business and fashion. 

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:25.453
Alyssa Marshall: We had to come up with our own business idea

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:32.061
and everything from marketing, to financials, to what the actual business would be

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:35.240
A lot of our program has really prepared us for this final project.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.918
Heather Johnson: We also had some industry panel people come in to

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:40.171
judge our product and they really really enjoyed it. 

00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:44.147
(They) thought it could be like a viable business 
 and we are really excited about it. 

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:46.806
Norma Ouellette: The first two years of the 
 program are focused in what we 

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:51.051
call the common platform and it covers all of the basic business skills. 

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.503
And then in years three and four we specialize 
 in fashion where we focus on 

00:00:55.503 --> 00:00:59.641
fashion management. So we focus on issues like international trade, 

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:06.366
export management, store management, retail, textiles, colour theory, so it is a 

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.890
very comprehensive course. 

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:11.472
Christine Cuddie: All of our professors have worked 
 in the industry or currently work 

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:15.931
in the industry and they have connections with 
 The Bay, Home Depot, Wal-Mart.  

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:20.372
The Internship that I did was at a smaller 
 retail company and they kind of  

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:25.008
taught me everything that I needed to know to 
 go into a career after school. 

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.303
Norma Ouellet: Where the degree really starts to play-in is about three to 

00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:32.196
four years into your career when the first management position comes open.

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.868
Or they are looking for someone to become a district supervisor. 

00:01:36.237 --> 00:01:38.470
Heather Johnson: It is something that is not offered anywhere 
 else,  like you could not go 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.980
to a university and get a degree but what is 
 special about Humber it that is is practical. 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.780
Alyssa Marshall: Humber has been able to give me 
 a good thorough knowledge of business 

00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:53.020
along with the fashion related courses. I feel 
 as though I can basically go out

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:59.370
and find any job. I feel like I am prepared for 
 a wide variety of options to go for.
