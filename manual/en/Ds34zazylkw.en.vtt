00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.669
Are you excited for Monster Hunter 4? Boy
howdy, I am! Clamber all over environments

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.559
and monsters like you’re the Prince of Persia
in Shadow of the Colossus? Yes siree Robert,

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.640
I’m squeeing like nobody’s business over
this sequel.  Please bring it to the Wii U, Capcom!

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.740
Thanks.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.820
After dumping a few hundred hours into Tri
and 3 Ultimate, I’ve amassed a sizable wishlist

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.160
of things I’d like to see in a Monster
Hunter sequel. Here are five of the more unique

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.060
items on my list.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.500
Two words: trophy room.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.980
I am a badass hunter of badass monsters. As
such, I have the ever-so-manly desire to mount

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.300
the heads of my kills on my wall. Of course,
my hunter’s digs only has space for a Great

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.359
Jaggi head and one or two other smaller monsters
so some of my resources and materials are

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.939
going to have to go towards expanding and
reinforcing my home.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.449
Goodness! Is that an elder dragon head mounted
on your wall?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.040
Why yes. Yes it is.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.500
All hunters worth their sodium chloride know
that they're going to have to consult outside

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.930
sources such as forums and wikis to learn
the most effective means to tackle the various

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.690
overgrown critters that stomp around the world
of Monster Hunter.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.680
Poppycock, I say! You should be able to learn
everything you need to know in-game. Otherwise,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.570
you may end up wasting your time slaughtering
dozens of Great Jaggi’s in free hunt mode

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.500
because you didn’t know that the Great Frill
is only obtained as a quest reward.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.970
Yeah, still kinda sore about that one.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.970
How about this: every monster you capture,
rather than kill, is donated to science. The

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.670
more you send in, the more you learn about
them. It could start with basic ecology

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.870
stuff: how it lives, what it eats, where it
sleeps, things like that. But keep sending in viable specimens.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.229
and you will learn the really important
stuff like elemental weaknesses, status tolerances,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.569
damage zones and to how best to go about getting
that rare drop.  A higher drop percentage when

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.989
carve the tail, you say?

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.219
Now where would you go to learn about this
stuff? I suppose it could be published to

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.059
your Monster Hunter Handbook but that’s
no fun. How about a Monster Museum?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.379
Of course, a museum is rather dull without
displays and exhibits. That’s why it’s

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:43.479
up to you to provide them. Oh, and the curator
will only accept monsters if they're in pristine condition.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.280
Rathalos looks kind of silly with broken horns
and a missing tail so if you want to make

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.159
a donation, you’ll have to kill the monster
in question without damaging it.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.839
Seriously, try felling Agnoktor or Lagiucrus
without breaking any of their bits.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.000
That's going to be one hell of a challenge.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.420
After spending the better part of 70 hours
going after the last item I needed to make a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.829
particular weapon, I came to the
conclusion that some of the drop percentages

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.950
are a bit on the absurdly low side. The probability
of obtaining some rare drops is as

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.230
low as 1% which means you’re going to spend
a lot of time going after some of these materials...

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.460
and you usually need more than one!

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.620
Now, the grind is part of the fun and why finally
obtaining this stuff is so fulfilling but

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.620
what if you could go after a monster and target
a specific reward? You’ve already captured enough

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.819
of them to know how to get it so if you specify at the start of a quest that you’re going

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.879
after this specific thing, you could increase
the likelihood of obtaining it as a carve

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:56.819
or quest reward by completing the hunt under certain conditions like: no poison, no bombs, and don’t damage

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.819
the head. Abide by these and the drop percentage increases from 1% to 10%.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.770
Yeah, just 10%

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.740
This is Monster Hunter, bucko. It ain’t
gonna just hand it to you.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.709
Swords, hammers, projectile weapons, even
a bug on a stick. Yes, the Monster Hunter

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.100
series hosts a huge assortment of weapons
but you know what I really want to kill giant

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.690
monsters with?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.820
My fists.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.860
Aside from a very weak kick and the Shadowbox gesture, your hunter has no attack power

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.590
without a weapon. But what if the individual
armor pieces had an attack rating exclusive

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.780
to fisticuffs? Suit up in your favorite armor
set without a weapon and you can get up close

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.800
and personal with your quarry to punch, kick,
and head butt it to death.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.259
No blocking and very limited range in exchange
for high mobility, no sharpening, sheathing, or reloading,

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.619
and a wildly different style of play.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.220
Alright, show of hands. Who’s excited to literally
butt heads with the Barroth?
