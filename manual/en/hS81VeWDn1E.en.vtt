00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.010
Now look at this. We just talked about the
rocking feet and the purpose of rocking your

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.559
body back and forth is, you need to use this
exercise to find your centered body weight

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:22.190
in order to throw kicks or punch. But now,
let us work on the hands. We are working on

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.470
the subject of high low. Now what does that
mean, "high lo"? Now imagine that we are putting

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:44.500
our hands way up high, now exhale. Again.
Inhale...exhale. Inhale....exhale. A lot of

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.339
people think that this has nothing to do with
self defense. Well you can agree with that,

00:00:52.339 --> 00:01:00.780
but take a look at what I am going to show
you. If I drop my elbows this way. Good, now,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:10.570
assistant please come over, Louise. Now if
try to grab him, because he is bigger; therefore

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.040
he just uses forearms. Again look at this,
here he is using forearms. Now, take a look.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.960
With this size how am I going to make him
bent, if I use my forearm it is not going

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.260
to be lethal enough. It is going to forbid.
But if I use my elbow. In this position I

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.480
have to make sure that he is on the ground.
Because once his knees are on the ground he

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.920
is completely useless. Your hand is so close
to the cheek, you have got the hand snatched.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.409
He won't be able to kick you, I do not think
he can wrestle you. And take a look; if I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.710
drag him backwards, his knee is going to get
busted from the cement. So tell me, Tai Chi

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.380
is just an exercise or is it both an exercise
and self defense technique in one. Think about

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.500
high and low. And the next one, we are going
to move on to a different subject, or the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.040
opposite subject of low and high. And you
will see the difference.
