00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.809
For twenty-five years, leading
universities, schools and institutions

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:09.030
have trusted the SecurTech Spot Anchor
system to protect their computers and electronic equipment.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.849
Computer theft is primarily a crime of
opportunity.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.649
A thief has two main goals. He wants to get out 
quick

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.669
and he wants to sell it quick.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.660
The Spot Anchor system provides two primary
types of deterrence to help prevent this.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.020
Physical deterrence makes it difficult
for the thief to get away quickly

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.889
if he gets away at all.

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:32.190
The second level is just as important and that's visual deterrence.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.700
A Spot Anchor permanently attached says
to the thief

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.570
"I'm difficult to take

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.930
and you'll get a lot less money from me
if you do".

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.530
The heart of the system is the patented
Spot Anchor.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.210
They come in a wide variety cable lengths and two different body styles to match most any type

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.640
of equipment.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.220
The narrow body anchor is perfect for
e-readers or items with smaller case sizes,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.400
like the overhead camera on this school
projector cart.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.920
Every anchor comes with close bond adhesive.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.600
Solid brass pin tumble padlocks are available in standard key, keyed-alike and master

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.260
keyed versions.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
Coated steel cables can be used to
connect different system components on a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.550
single lock.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.479
The system is very easy to configure and
install.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.630
Let's look at a basic system for a
desktop computer.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.850
The end of a double looped cable is
secured to a stationary anchor point

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.090
such as a desk or a table frame.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.710
This one was secured through a cable hole in a workstation.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.200
If you don't have a location to loop a
cable on your workstation you can use a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.020
SecurTech screw-and-glue desktop anchor
point.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.840
Then loop the cable through each of the
component anchors.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.790
A narrow body anchor is used on this monitor.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.790
When you reach the last component
secure it with a brass padlock.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.500
The Spot Anchor is just one of many solutions
that you can use to protect your electronics and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.600
equipment in any environment.
