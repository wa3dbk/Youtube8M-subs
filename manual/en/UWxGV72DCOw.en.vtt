00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.930
Kelly Sukhani says have you ever watched
sister wives

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.680

poly

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.109

wives.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.840
I am personally a fan of monogamy

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.729
um but as long as the children are
taking care of

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.830
and everybody's truly happy I guess

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.530
you whatever you wanna do see angelic
Edwards as what do they were friends who

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.540
just make out

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.150
example sex friends usually called
Prince benefits would

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.530
it still be friends with benefits I
can't speak for everyone else

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.700
but if you're making out with me that's
a benefit so we

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.530
friends with benefits harmony more alice
is would you rather have no one show up

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.130
at your wedding

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.729
or a funeral my funeral I don't get I'm
dead

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.030
you put me in a confetti sprayer and put
me in the ocean or something like that I

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.619
don't care but my wedding

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.759
I'm more so for the person and I'm
marrying because

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.390
I'm sure probably really upset if no one
comes can't have my boo being upset

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.909
Asma who here we ask which marsupial

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.369
do you prefer wombat or planypus PUPPY

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.860
yellow sure Robbie says I really like
one girl

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.570
but I'm not sure if she likes me too
I've never tried to make the first move

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.140
what should I do

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.729
try and how is the person supposed to know?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.080
okay and the question that I got asked

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.130
so much over the last 24 hours

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.610
where the hell did these freaking thing
come from

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.050
babs asks me is it white gold or blue

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.280
and black and for those of you who have
lived under our

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.700
internet rock over the last at least
12

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.760
hours there is this dress and the
internet was set ablaze

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.130
our dream on whether is whiten goal

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.500
or black and blue some pictures it looks

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.320
black and blue some pictures it looks
blue and gold some pictures looks

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.370
white gold alright guys so I have the
answer

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.540
it's very scientific

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.510
who cares who cares about that ugly

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.040
ass dress why are we talking about this
dress I would

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.220
never wear maybe if it had vertical
stripes

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.010
fine but it's got horizontal and I've
been eaten lately so it makes my hips

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.550
the kinda fat and I don't like it in the
end

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.739
the most ridiculous thing about this
dress is that we're talking about it

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.750
all to the extent that we are

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.130
things look different colors in
different light

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.320
do an experiment look at the wall

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.170
this wall is white
turn the lights off

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.250
what does it look like all well

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.410
that wall is black no way it's just different
light so unless I can find like an

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.239
original

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.880
I keep I'm sorry I'm part the problem
now

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.750
I'm going to shut up now anyway tell me in the
comments down below

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.500

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.720
blue or and black is it white and gold

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.710

nobody should care about the first place

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.060
