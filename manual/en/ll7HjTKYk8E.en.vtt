00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.979
How to Build a Snow Fort.

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:07.169
You're outside.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:09.000
You're getting pummeled with snowballs.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.740
Time to build a snow fort.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.460
You will need Winter clothes Ample snow Imagination
Water A barrier (optional) Plastic food containers

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.359
(optional) and a shovel (optional).

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.550
Step 1.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.259
Get fully dressed in your winter attire, including
durable waterproof gloves.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.289
Avoid jeans.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.869
They'll get water-logged and cold.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.869
Step 2.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.180
Head outside and scope out a strategic area
for your fort.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.650
Natural barriers – like fences or walls
– are good places to set up your fort.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.210
Determine where the front of the fort will
be.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.469
If you're using a fence or wall, let it serve
as your back wall, and build the fort in front

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.469
of it.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.540
Step 3.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.300
Mark out the area of the fort by drawing a
line in the snow with your foot or with a

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.699
plastic food container or shovel.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:55.760
Step 4.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.460
Clear the snow off the floor of your snow
fort, and collect it to one side.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.159
Pack snow on top of the line you drew to establish
the foundation of your fort's walls.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.460
Step 5.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.800
Begin by building the front wall of the fort.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.050
Use the plastic food containers to shape bricks
of snow.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.480
Step 6.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.260
Build brick by brick, or pack by pack, until
the front wall is tall enough that you can

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.140
hide successfully behind it.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.980
Use the same technique to build the side walls.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.480
Depending on your angle, you may not need
to add significant length or height to the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.480
side walls.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.430
Remember, you'll need all the snow you can
collect for snowballs.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.160
If you've built near a wall or fence, be sure
to leave an opening between the barrier and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.310
the side wall so you can easily enter and
exit the fort.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.360
Step 7.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.020
When you're happy with your structure, scoop
out gunner's turrets into the front wall so

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.490
you can keep your opponent in sight.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.570
Step 8.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.560
If it's below freezing outside, sprinkle the
walls with water, which will help to freeze

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.740
the fort, making it impervious to oncoming
snowball attacks.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.220
Now, duck behind it, start making snowballs,
and prepare for battle!

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.380
Did you know Fort Sumter, in Charleston, South
Carolina, was the site of the first battle

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.200
of the Civil War in April 1861.
