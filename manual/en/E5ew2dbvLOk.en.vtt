00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.880
 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.049
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.380
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.070
Hi, this is Melissa with waterionizerexpert.com

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.140
here to introduce to you the brand new
2014

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.590
life ionizer next-generation

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.750
M11C C as in counter top model

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.760
this is a 11 plate

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.779
system with titanium

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.879
platinum coated plates and produces up
to 800 watts of power

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.170
with 11 plate and 800 watts of power
that can give you a really broad

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.410
pH range and great negative ORP

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.469
it has a lifetime unconditional warranty

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.219
parts and labor and we get a little bit a
research that's a very comprehensive

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.500
warranty

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.079
so it's pretty much worry free ownership
the filtration on that system

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.860
comes with dual internal filter those
even take care

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.990
chlorine chlorine residual gas and
sediment that's present in the water

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.210
and also comes with a customized
pre-filter

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.380
that's based upon your local water
quality report

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.860
that will remove heavy metals contaminants
VOCs

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.520
arsenic fluoride things like that so this
system comes with several

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.820
option the plates on this have the option

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.729
a either flat or the upgrade the mesh

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.880
plates MESH is going to increase the performance
of the pH as well as that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.409
ORP the UV light is

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.670
added inside for people who are in high
chloroform levels

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.920
well water or just want added protection
and then you also have the options of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.770
the energy frequency technology as well
as the laser technology

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.649
so this system has four different
alkaline

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.680
three levels acidic and one purify
clean water mode you've got all your

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.170
buttons that appear on the front

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.420
very easy to read LED panel and this system comes in two different colors

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.989
pH testing with the system

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.019
so, because of the 11 plates on this

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.270
and up to 800 watts of power we actually

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.420
should be getting 11 to 12 pH

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.480
depending upon your source water let's
what this

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.680
outputs on the level 4 pH

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.270
so it's starting off around 11.1

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.330
11.2  and still climbing

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.410
and again like I said that's because these
large

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.560
11 plates and all the watts of power
are going into this system

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.739
that were really able to get a high pH
range on it

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.760
so as you see it's climbing up 11.3

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.239
close to 11.4 pH the life ionizers next generation

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.489
M11 is the first residential 11
plate system on the market

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.129
life ionizers continues to you put out
some

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.200
best product out there and it's no
wonder that their

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.970
top-selling highest-rated brand this
system has a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.640
high flow rate hi output and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.510
high levels up anti-oxidant potential I
would suggest this system for

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.510
people who are looking for optimal
unit that best
