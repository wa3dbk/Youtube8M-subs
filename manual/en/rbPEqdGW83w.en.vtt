Hi. Welcome to Bobby and Yuri's Round the World Channel.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.399
The two of us will be traveling to many countries   

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:09.636
to bring you information about those countries' points of interest

00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:13.964
beautiful locations, and delicious cuisine.

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:16.861
But.... we're still kind of saving money for that.

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:19.880
so today, we're gonna pretend we went to a foreign country

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:22.782
and introduce Karatsu City in Saga Prefecture!

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:24.661
Hope you enjoy watching it!

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.249
The first place we headed is famous in Karatsu: 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.310
Mount Kagami! It's over 280 meters high!

00:00:35.343 --> 00:00:36.343
That was a tiring climb!

00:00:36.747 --> 00:00:40.247
But it was totally worth it! Check out this view!

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:41.872
--You can't see anything!

00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:44.423
Nah, that over there looks like...  Rainbow Pine Forest.

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:48.476
And beyond that, the sparkling ocean!

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:50.878
--There's nothing sparkling...

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.118
Well, at least let's go check out the ocean.

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:55.602
Hello.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.739
--?????????????????

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:02.722
--???????????????????

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.060
It's rough when you don't speak the language!

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:11.563
But, using gestures, we were somehow able to understand the way to the ocean!

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.695
Thank you!

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:18.406
Before you get to the ocean, you pass through here!

00:01:20.248 --> 00:01:22.448
So this is the Rainbow Pine Forest!

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:26.802
According to local Karatsu folk, this spot is known for the appearance of GHOSTS!

00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:32.925
 the main staple of the local diet can be found! 

00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:36.212
I wonder if we can find it!

00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:38.908
Is it somewhere around here?

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:41.880
There! There it is!

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:46.040
This is the famous product of this forest! The Karatsu Burger!

00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:48.460
--Not funny...

00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:49.800
Yeah... sorry about that. 

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:54.640
 is sold at a stand here in the forest.

00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:56.760
It looks really really good but...

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.100
--People who mock the Karatsu Burger, don't get to eat the Karatsu Burger.

00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:02.760
Balls. 

00:02:03.298 --> 00:02:07.700
But, we've come this far. We've gotta make it to the ocean!

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:10.840
Pass through the pine forest and...

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:13.950
I can see the beach!

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:19.330
It doesn't get any better than the beach!

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.610
It would be awesome to just stay here! Camp out and barbecue!

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:25.850
--There's something wrong with your head, huh?

00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:27.960
I'll be waiting in the car.

00:02:32.743 --> 00:02:33.740
Otsukare-sama desu!

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:37.710
Seriously, in the near future, we're gonna go on a world trip.

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.530
and in this same kind of fashion, come rain, come wind

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.400
we'll be bringing you tons of interesting travel videos!

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.920
Please come back to check the channel again, and give us your support!

00:02:51.774 --> 00:02:55.270
I promise, it's not ALWAYS silly stuff like this :)
