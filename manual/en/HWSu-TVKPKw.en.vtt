00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.100
i just picked up a new job

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.100
But I'm hoping it ain't hard

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.100
after all it's a night shift

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.100
I'll be workin' the graveyard

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.100
urban legends aside,i think i'll be fine, there's no way these things are alive

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400
It's just a robot with nothing inside,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.000
Right? not like i'm fighting to survive

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.200
what was that noise? Bonnie is gone

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.200
honestly my skin is starting to crawl

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
something is coming, they're walking the halls

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.400
and now that my power is starting to fall

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.400
i'm sick of seeing all these sinister faces

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.400
why am i working for minimum wage?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.400
if i could be killed they should give me a raise why did they hire me this is insane!

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.726
enjoy your five long nights

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.360
kick back and grab a slice

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.560
if you get hurt on the job

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.280
we cannot cover your loss

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.280
make it to 6 and you'll be fine

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.840
what's with all of these accidents happening and we're still in business that is baffling

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.800
all these cameras had better be accurate

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800
i can't imagine if they get their hands on me!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800
got a long past full of tragedy what was the Bite of '87 actually?! 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800
why does it seem every damn event at freddy's

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.400
is no less than a massive catastrophe 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.000
you don't need to reiterate the gravity of making sure i don't run out of batteries 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or they might reconfigure my anatomy adding me to their mechanical familiy!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
enjoy your five long nigths

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
kick back and grab a slice

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
if you get hurt on the job

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we cannot cover your loss

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
make it to 6 and you'll be fine

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.200
"ok 6 a.m"

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
"dont wanna fool around any second now"

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200
"come on let's do this"

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
"come on baby i'm ready for this let's go 6 a.m"

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:49.200
" don't got all night tick-tock-tick-tock ,buddy just uh..stay in your desinated places  no need to go to the back office"

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.900
i smell a foul odor

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.900
i think it's getting closer

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.320
i'm having hallucinations

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.240
how much longer till the night is over

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.940
maybe the place is haunted

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.500
and all they want is closure

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.300
but i really don't give a damn

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.460
i wanna clock out and knock back a cold one

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.300
chica's tweaking out

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.020

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.360
Freddy is creeping around

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.920

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.500
