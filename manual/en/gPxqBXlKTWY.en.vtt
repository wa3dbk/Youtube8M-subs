00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.120
What is anemia? Anemia is a condition in which
your blood does not carry enough oxygen to

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.830
the rest of your body because of a shortage
of healthy red blood cells. This is most commonly

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.460
caused by a shortage of iron in the body,
which is needed to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.410
is the iron containing protein that gives
blood the its red color, and it is the actual

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.410
component of the blood cells which carries
the oxygen.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.360
What are some of the causes of Anemia? Anemia
causes can be broadly separated into iron

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.410
deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiency anemia
and anemia of chronic disease.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.410
Common causes of low iron are heavy periods
in females, pregnancy, ulcers, colon polyps,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.940
colon cancer, and of course, not getting enough
iron in your diet. Inadequate folic acid or

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.979
vitamin B12 can also cause anemia. Inherited
blood blood disorders that can cause anemia

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.990
include sickle cell anemia and thalassemia.
Other conditions which can result in anemia

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.990
are diabetes, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease,
kidney disease, heart disease, hepatitis C,

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:29.039
HIV/AIDS, and rheumatoid arthritis.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.659
What are the common anemia symptoms?

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.369
Anemia can make you feel weak, cold, dizzy
and irritable. It can cause shortness of breath,

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.409
and you may feel out of breath just from performing
routine activities. Exercise can be very difficult

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.030
to tolerate. Other symptoms are pale skin,
chest pain, cold hands and feet, irregular

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.350
heartbeat, and brittle nails. Although many
think it is a myth, a desire to eat ice may

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.340
also be a sign of anemia, along with the desire
to eat many other odd items such as paper

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.340
or clay. It is unknown exactly why these unusual
cravings occur. Ice is, however, the most

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.689
common craving.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:23.629
How is anemia diagnosed? Having many of the
symptoms that are associated with anemia is

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.459
not proof that you are anemic. Many of these
symptoms are general in nature and could be

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.239
associated with many other disorders. Mild
anemia, such as caused by low iron or vitamins,

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.909
is easily treated, but other types may be
long-lasting, severe, or even life-threatening

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.879
if not diagnosed and properly treated.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.019
Your doctor will diagnose anemia based on
your medical history, a physical exam, and

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.400
the results from tests and procedures, such
as a complete blood count or CBC. Once your

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.409
doctor knows the cause and severity of the
condition, he or she can create a treatment

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.219
plan for you.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:08.700
Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia may
have no signs or symptoms. So, you may not

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.030
know if you have it unless the doctor discovers
it from a screening test or while checking

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.549
for other problems. For more information and
what to expect, including some of the tests

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.549
performed, read the full article linked below.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.109
Blood loss, poor diet, or an inability to
absorb enough iron from foods can cause Iron-deficiency

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.480
anemia, a common but easily treated anemia
condition. This condition develops over time,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.819
as your body runs out of stored iron causing
less blood cells to be manufactured. Severe

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.879
iron-deficiency anemia can lead to heart problems,
infections, growth and development problems

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.180
in children, and other complications.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.650
People at highest risk for iron-deficiency
anemia include infants and young children,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.069
women, and adults who have internal bleeding.
On rare occasions, severe iron-deficiency

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.299
anemia may require treatment in a hospital,
blood transfusions, iron injections, or intravenous

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.340
iron therapy. See the link below for an overview
of the different causes of iron deficiency

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.430
anemia, its treatment, and a great deal more
info on iron. Another type of anemia is sports

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.050
anemia. This is actually not considered a
true anemia, but an anemia like condition.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.910
See my previous video on sports anemia for
a full explanation, the link to which should

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.070
