Hi, I’m Steve from Fibre Glast. Today we’re taking a look at the Sandwich Core materials available

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.060
at FibreGlast.com. This category includes
Nomex Honeycomb, End-Grain Balsa, and a selection

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.640
of foam products. We use the term Sandwich Core because these materials are sandwiched 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.529
between layers of reinforcement within your part. They are used to build bulk and strength for a part

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.769
without adding significant weight. Parts made with sandwich core achieve a much higher flexural

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.049
strength than using skin laminates alone.
Sandwich core materials 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.200
also build thickness into any composite part, which in turn, builds stiffness.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.350
Let’s take a closer look at each of our
sandwich core categories, beginning with Nomex

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.459
Honeycomb. Nomex Honeycomb is a sheet of cells, nested

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:57.549
together to form panels with much the same look as a cross-section of beehive. It’s

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:03.269
extremely flexible, and when fully expanded, is almost entirely open space. It offers good

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.930
impact resistance and is also fire retardant. Among sandwich core, Honeycomb offers the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.690
very best strength-for-weight ratio. It is
used primarily for structural applications

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.890
in aerospace. End-Grain Balsa is the most widely used sandwich core material.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 It is constructed using small blocks of wood each bonded in succession to

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.850
a light scrim fabric backing. As a result,
it conforms to nearly any simple curve and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.980
most gradual compound curves. It offers a
high compressive strength due to the density

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.770
of the wood blocks. Balsa is often selected
as a more affordable option compared to honeycomb

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.280
or vinyl foams.
Foams make up the last category of Sandwich Core.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.540
All foams at FibreGlast.com are rigid, closed-cell foams, meaning they resist water,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.000
gas, and oil. They deliver added strength,
stiffness, and insulation for parts, without

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.400
adding significant weight. Foam is easy to
handle, provides excellent flotation, and can

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.920
be easily carved or shaped. Our foam selections includes sheets of vinyl foam; Divinymat flow media

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.160
mix-and-pour polyurethane foams; and sheets of polyisocyanurate foam.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.300
All the Sandwich Core materials at FibreGlast.com are compatible with epoxy, polyester, and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.040
vinyl ester resins, and can be used for most lay-up techniques, including vacuum bagging

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.439
and infusion. Because of their combined strength, stiffness and bulk for low weight, they are

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.319
popular for use with marine applications,
like boat hulls, as well as aerospace and

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.010
structural panels. To get more details on our entire selection
