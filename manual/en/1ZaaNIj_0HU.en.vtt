00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.830
Almost half of the world’s wealth is now
owned by 1% of the population

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.460
7 of 10 people live in countries where economic
inequality has increased in the last 30 years

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.620
85 of the world’s wealthiest people own
as much as half of the world’s population

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.439
Issues of inequality may lead a person to
the biggest unofficial settlement in Santiago, Chile.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.740
It’s located right in the middle
of a high-income class district.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.790
Poor people are forced to sell their land,
and as a result must move to the outskirts.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.860
This means that they will lose their jobs,
they will join the marginalized mass of very

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.140
low-income society, and they will stay in
that place for many generations to come.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.030
The point is to convince underprivileged people
not to leave this area.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.020
Staying on this land is the only way to improve
the level of living for those people and to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.800
reduce the social gap in the next generations.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.620
“I want to live here, in this house, but
I have a family of seven, eight kids.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.490
What I should do?”

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.160
After coming back from the exchange program
in Chile, I felt a huge need to tackle this issue.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.040
Polarization of society is a global problem
and this project presents a universal solution

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.940
that could be applied in many different places.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.480
“With the use of architectural thinking
and analytical tools the project is able to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.980
detect the problems and address them in very
precise ways.”

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.320
The idea is to keep the entire existing urban
structure.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.440
Fulfilling the inhabitant’s basic needs
by providing: water, electricity and the possibility

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.289
to build multistory structures.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.249
And to do all this in the cheapest way
and be fully compatible with inhabitants wishes

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.489
and without any damage to existing green spaces.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
With this project, The Chilean Government
has the opportunity to get rid of its neoliberal

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.380
social housing. Chile has now the possibility
to create social housing which is bigger,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.620
better related to existing context and makes
use of the energy and ideas of the inhabitants.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.060
The proposal is to build supply towers which
contain toilets and kitchens connected by

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.489
stairs. And a concrete structure with a roof.
Everything is made of standard Chilean beams

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.599
and columns. Each structure is designed according
to the owners wishes, with a rule to follow

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.840
existing urban flow.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.069
Typical social housing in Chile consists of
a $20 000, 55m2 flat - per family. This

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.069
solution, for the same money, can easily give
a 160m2 bare structure. 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.880
All the fill inn’s are up to the inhabitants.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.650
With this simple move, inhabitants of low-income
areas are transforming into the owners of

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.209
solid structures. Their wealth increases as
realestate prices of this land also increase.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.200
With time, they may upgrade their structure,
rent some space, open businesses or get a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.340
loan on their house, allowing their kids to
go to a good school.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.379
The result is an architectural symbol of resistance
that may stop the polarization of society

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.110
and improve the standard of living for future
generations.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.290
The project is very simple, but it demands

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.980
a significant change in thinking.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.400
So remember, don’t sell yourself short!
