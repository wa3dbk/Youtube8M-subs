00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.160
Hi everyone!

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.300
This is Kimura U

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.660
I am the pinkest Creator in the Universe!

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.080
Todays challenge is shiny eye makeup using color mascara

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.420
I start with the Base makeup.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.620
First, the powder Foundation.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.760
Let's apply the eye shadows.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.720
I will use this purple color.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.580
Mix different types of purple and balance the color.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.280
Cover the edge of the eye with a darker color and make a gradation.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.320
Apply this gel eye color over it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.360
Put some on your finger and adjust the amount before applying.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.880
The eye lid is thin, so gently blend it in.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.160
Add some more purple eye shadow to the edge of the eye.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.480
Adding thick colors along the edge will make the eyes look wider.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.340
Voila!Lets add this red color mascara.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.200
Apply by waving the mascara like this.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.400
The lower eye lashes are shorter, compared to the upper ones. So apply by holding the brush vertically.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.240
Using this glitter eyeliner, lets make the eyelid shiny.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.400
Apply along the eye lid.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:46.160
From the corner stick out a bit and pull up to make its like a cats eye.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.980
Do the same to the bottom eye lid.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.460
Apply less to the bottom than to the top. Less is better.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.540
Add a little to the inner corner as well.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.700
Shiny shiny!

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.900
This is how the eye is done.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.820
Lets mix these three colors for the cheek. Fluorescent pink, pale pink and a little pale pink.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.200
From under the pupil, stretch to the side.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.700
Normally I put it around here, but I apply it higher for this loud makeup.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.920
Lets put some on the nose to make it look like sun burn.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.300
Next, put this Lip  Gloss.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.400
This is pastel pink.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.300
Lets put pink gloss over it.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.660
Sticking out on the top with narrow the nose-lip distance and enhance the "baby face" look.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.640
Now I will apply mascara on the eyebrows.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.040
Using this gold color.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.600
Shake sideways, just like whenn you apply it on the eyelashes.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.800
Now I will use this pink brow pen made for cosplays.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:59.600
Brow pens for cosplay have very strong colors, so apply gently.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.180
Use a Cotton Bud to blend it in.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:22.280
I will use this eye brow color and this cheek color to add shadow to the eyebrows.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.380
This one and this one.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:34.820
Place some on the inner corner of the eye and blend your skin and eyebrow.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.960
Add some brown to the outer corner and blend it in.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.640
Lets put these nail stickers like freckles.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.420
Now I will arrange the hair a little.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:14.500
Comb the hair and straighten it up, use a hair tie to make the pigtails.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.060
Twine a little bit of the hair where the knot is.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.440
Make it fluffy and straighten it as if you used an iron.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.700
The fashion theme today is pink, as in "Kimura U - the pinkest creator in the universe".

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.320
So I tried to blend completely the fashion and the makeup with pink.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.280
The candies pattern is designed by myself, and I call it "Candy Mille-feuilles pattern".

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.660
It's like a mille-feuilles with layers of candies, a very sweet girly design.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.780
This Cardigan and these Tights feature the candy mille-feuilles design.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.740
The shiny color mascara makeup is now complete with fashion.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.740
Do you like it?

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:28.880
This was my first time trying color mascara but I'm very happy with these colorful eyelashes!

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.600
Why dont you try it as well?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.600
Bye bye!
