00:00:00.347 --> 00:00:03.014
(playful music)

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.120
- Homemade oven fries are
always a crowd pleaser.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.360
They're tasty and go well as a side dish

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.000
to many many dishes.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.400
And because they are
baked they have less fat

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.470
and I don't need a fryer to enjoy them.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.010
I love that about this recipe.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.840
Let's give it a try.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.790
Wanna taste a bite?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.240
You can use either white
potatoes or sweet potatoes.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.280
Or even mix the two together.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.110
Today I'm using sweet potatoes.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.320
An easy favorite in my house.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.140
Similar to roasting vegetables,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.100
you only need a handful of ingredients,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.340
but can add some variety

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.500
and excitement with different spices

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.980
or by making a dipping sauce.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740
Although I'm using sweet potatoes

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.570
you can use white if you prefer.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.490
The taste and nutrition are different,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.440
but they are both high in potassium

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.100
and they taste great when
you mix them together.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.520
Vegetables are divided
into different sub groups

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.910
because they have different nutrients.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.750
Sweet potatoes are in the
red and orange sub group

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.790
and white potatoes fall
into the starchy sub group.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.210
Sweet potatoes are higher in carbohydrates

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.200
and therefore higher in calories.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.700
But they are a better source of fiber,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.090
vitamins A, B, C, and iron.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
I've already washed my
potatoes with a vegetable brush

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.510
and preheated my oven to 425 degrees.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.070
So I'm going to start
by cutting the potatoes

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.210
into 1/4 inch thick slices.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.590
Use caution when cutting your potatoes.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.870
Make sure your knife is clean and sharp

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.670
and grip it properly.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.180
You wanna hold the potato like this

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.573
to prevent accidentally
cutting your fingers.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.753
I start by cutting my
potatoes in half lengthwise,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.340
and I lay the flat side
on the cutting board,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.340
this way I can get a better grip.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.570
As I cut I leave the tip of
the knife on the cutting board

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.633
and I slide the potato along.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.430
Use the back of the knife

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.940
and not the blade to move the potatoes.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.030
You can also use your hand
to move them out of the way.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.963
Once cut, I need to combine the potatoes,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.053
with some Canola oil, one tablespoon.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.563
And some salt.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.210
I'm gonna stir this all together

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.330
to make sure the potatoes are coated well

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.293
with the oil and the salt.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.280
I've already covered this
cookie sheet with foil

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.603
and greased it with a little spray.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.180
Having the foil on here will
make it easier for clean up.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.470
I'm gonna spread these
out in a single layer.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.010
Once you get these in the oven,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.440
you only need to bake
them for about 30 minutes

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.380
and you need to stir them halfway through,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.323
after about 15 minutes.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.700
If you wanna make a
dipping sauce for these,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.383
while they're baking is a
great time to make that.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.550
I have all my dipping sauce
ingredients right here.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.773
It's really easy.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.263
Just a tablespoon of ketchup,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.293
a 1/4 of a cup of mayo,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.453
and a little chili powder.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.023
Stir it all together.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.250
I'll keep this in the fridge
till the fries are done.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.230
Once the fries are done in the oven,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.460
serve them immediately

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.160
because they're best when they're hot.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.430
Well, that's it,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.290
a little prep time, some baking,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.980
and you can enjoy delicious
homemade oven fries

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.813
with any meal.
