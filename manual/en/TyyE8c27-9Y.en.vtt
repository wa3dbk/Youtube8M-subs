Intro

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.189
A while back we talked about the mechanics villain and the narrative villain, but since we just recently talked about heroes again

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:16.460
I figured I'd use that as an excuse to talk about a particular type of villain that I've wanted to talk about for a long time:

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.680
The Force of Nature

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.980
The Force of Nature is akin to the narrative villain in the fact that its primary purpose is to enhance the narrative

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.520
But how the force of nature goes about it is radically different.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.000
Where the narrative villain is a person,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.460
a character with their own needs and desires and motivations, the force of nature is the embodiment of some primal aspect of reality

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:41.009
They're more a representation than a character. They allow us as creators to confront the hero with some aspect of themselves,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.370
or of society and through doing so either learn more about the hero themselves or explore concepts through the lens of that hero.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.949
The Joker is a perfect example of this, a lot of the time he isn't really a character in a standard sense

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.270
He's not even really a person

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.839
He's the embodiment of chaos, as such he serves as a perfect foil to Batman. He doesn't need rational motivations,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.480
he doesn't require standard human emotions. He is simply a force of nature, chaos personified.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.760
He serves as a contrast to Batman, as a way to test and push the limits of a character built around control and order, to make the hero

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.440
examine his code in the face of its extreme opposite.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.699
He forces Batman to face the question of whether he's really bringing order to society or whether as a vigilante operating outside the law

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.680
He really serves the law at all.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.980
As a force of nature Joker allows the Author's to examine these questions subtly through his very

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.339
interactions with Batman rather than bludgening the reader with these questions through exposition

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.960
Sauron is of course another such villain. He isn't the character in a standard sense either

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.460
And he's certainly not a relatable human being in any way,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.200
instead he serves to let tolkien address questions of the use of power for its own sake,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.030
militarism and fascism and the value of hope, he stands as the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.009
opposing force for the main characters in order to make their virtues and their flaws have greater meaning;

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.000
Kefka, Pyramid Head,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.709
Sin, all of these are force of nature type villains and in many ways

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.699
force of nature villains are easier to deliver on in games than your standard narrative kind because this type of villain is primarily created by

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.000
how they act rather than what they say,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.280
So how does one go about creating this type of villain?

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.719
Well first you have to decide on what primal force they represent

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.240
This is actually the easy part as it simply depends on what type of story you want to tell, the hard part is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.430
specificity. These characters only work if you have a clear idea of exactly what they represent. They can't just represent evil; they can represent chaos,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.369
insecurity, the dangers of the military industrial complex.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.320
Drill down as much as you can and then make sure they stick to what they are throughout your story.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.700
There will be moments where you feel like you should make them narrative villains,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.320
but you actually may not have to worry about that at all, so long as they serve to represent a way to explore questions and

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.649
your chosen themes and show more of the character of your protagonists,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.830
they won't fall into the trap of simply being the big bad. If you do decide to walk down the difficult road of trying to

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.969
add character and humanity to a force of nature villain though, the only times I've seen it done

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.490
successfully is in the context of them wrestling with the very fact that they are a force of nature and by definition

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.280
can't deviate from their single focused worldview.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.130
This has been done with the Joker a few times too. The killing joke probably being one of the most notable and best examples.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.139
But whatever you do, while you're searching for the specificity you need to really deliver on one of these characters,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.700
understand that to get it

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.649
you really have to know your world and the rest of your characters. Which means these villains are often a late

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.929
creation in the cycle of your work. If you look at Sauron the form of him we know from the lord of the rings, comes

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.780
after more than a decade of Tolkien playing around with the world of Middle-earth, and the Joker evolved into the primal force

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.179
we know him as today through years and years of

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.149
stories and iterative work. That doesn't mean you can't put one in your story on the first go by any means, you just have to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.980
understand that force of nature villains finds their value entirely in what they let us say about the other

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.469
characters and the rest of the world. So we'd better have those figured out first so we can understand how our villain relates to them

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.160
Okay,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.150
two other quick things. First the obvious

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.010
Force of Nature Villains can be a literal force of nature or not, either way, you'll notice that many of these types of villains actually

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.500
end up being

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.779
beasts or gods, which removes the necessity for us as players to understand them on any human level.This is an easy narrative device and

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.709
you'll see it all the time in classic literature.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.099
These tend to deny you some of the subtleties you get with the human force of nature. And it also denies you the

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.559
possibility of creating the kind of quirky and interesting

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.170
antagonists who the player might even root for just because the logical extremes of an ideology can be so interesting.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.380
But these bigger

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.990
monster godlike force of nature villains will save you a lot of time and effort in trying to explain

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.690
them or make them seem reasonable. As we're kind of trained to just accept monsters and gods as forces of nature.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.669
Lastly if you do choose to make your force of nature villain a human, that doesn't mean that they can't have

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.889
character. To be a human force of nature,

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.469
you almost by definition have to be mad or obsessed to the point of insanity, which can create some fantastic

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.610
characters. The more that you can explore that, the more that you can play with how their particular brand of force of nature-ishness interact

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.089
with the world the more opportunity you'll have to let them be colorful characters as well.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.850
Just stick to your guns and no matter how crazy

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.400
they're inflexibility makes a situation, run with that and see where it leads you. See you next week!

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:33.540
