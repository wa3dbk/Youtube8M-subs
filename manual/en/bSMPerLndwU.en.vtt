00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.370
All right

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.540
if you [own] [a] [holley], and you're having trouble with it and

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:09.749
You got maybe a check engine light?

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.980
Coming on or something

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.560
And you don't know what it is or you you're just having some kind of problem in General

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.420
And you don't know what it is is it?

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.330
There's an easy way to check your codes and your computer if you happen if you have a holley

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.899
That has a computer is computer controlled which mostly

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960
pretty much all the newer ones have

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.050
there's a way of checking the [computer] to see if there's any codes in it any current codes or any stored codes and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.420
It's pretty simple

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.139
What you do is you put [your] one switch on on?

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.599
You go over to the reset button, [just] put your automata

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.079
And you push that on

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.110
and you hold it [alright] takes another hand for me to do this and hold the camera, so I'm going to

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.409
flip this switch all

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.790
the ignition

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.029
It's only turn to with [Nishan]

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.889
And what you'll see now is on the odometer. [I] can look over

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.539
You see on the old dominant. It's going to be like a bank of readings

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.960
And it goes from 1 to 10

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.040
And if there's any problem in your bike

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.159
One of these banks will pick it up

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.420
and

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.049
You'll see when I push the reset button each [time]

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.439
The bank changes to walk to 2 to 3 [the] 4 goes up all the way up to 10

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.290
You'll notice right after that there's us. There's a

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.129
[Clr] which means clear just telling me that a

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.968
Bank for is clear. There's no codes in it Make [5]

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.179
There's no codes in it 6 is no codes on it hit it and it goes and it keeps on going right on up to

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.990
10

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.280
and it comes up to this one here which I'm not sure what it is and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.780
See my video called: Harley Davidson PPU code for updated info on this subject.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.239
It gives you this this number which comes up also which I'm not sure what it [is], but that son

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900
That's a that is an easy way to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.929
Check your codes to see if you have any I don't I don't have any of this bike. I did have some while back

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.540
because

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.200
My injectors were followed up and old

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.959
and I did I ended up having some problems back then but I've taken care of it since so

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.559
[that's] an easy way to check them. She go to Holly and

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.700
Save yourself a little time aggravation and just google the cold find out what's wrong. So you can get it fixed
