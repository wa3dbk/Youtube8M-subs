00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.249
You got me up so nicely this morning. I really appreciate it.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.829
&gt;&gt;Oh, you're welcome.

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:15.599
It was my pleasure.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.229
&gt;&gt;Well naturally I've gotten older

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:22.589
and knowing you're older you can't do the things
you do when you're younger.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.390
&gt;&gt;After you get a certain age and your family

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.479
die off

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.199
you have to really depend on them

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.199
to help you through the day. You know?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.399
&gt;&gt;Everybody that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.690
takes care of you here

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.379
don't they treat you nice?

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.080
&gt;&gt;Yeah. &gt;&gt;and do things for you. Well, what do they do for you?

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.180
&gt;&gt;Honey, you ask me them questions I can't remember.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.060
They do everything for me.
&gt;&gt;Absolutely.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.079
&gt;&gt;They're very nice

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.719
I have one woman that I,

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.710
she's a dear,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
she gets me into bed without any pain.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120
&gt;&gt;Oh yes, somebody helps me bathe

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.530
and helps me get dressed.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.390
I have to have somebody in there. I wake up in
the middle of the night

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.520
and I say "who's here?" [laugh]

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.220
&gt;&gt;you was getting all dolled up.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.220
&gt;&gt; Who? &gt;&gt; You were!

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.120
You look so pretty. &gt;&gt;[laugh]
&gt;&gt;so pretty.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.030
See how it's making you smile now? Yeah?
Feels so good.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.350
&gt;&gt;If I don't want to get up right away, she'll get me

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.910
all washed up and everything and then she'll come
back

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.150
and put my clothes on me and get me up.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.220
She is just like

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.270
a daughter.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.030
I don't have any, but she's just like a daughter
would be

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.350
and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.340
she does everything.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.420
&gt;&gt;Well everyday they show that 
that they are our family.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.990
They help us every way they can.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.140
&gt;&gt;[laugh] You know I love you.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.860
&gt;&gt;Likewise.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.760
[laughs]

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.869
&gt;&gt;She had ways

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.449
of making you feel at home.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:15.189
They just like a brother and sister,
that's how they treat me.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.350
&gt;&gt;I like the lovely people I've met

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.069
attendants,

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.219
the activities people, the all on the staff have been wonderful.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.249
I couldn't ask for any better people.

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.269
&gt;&gt;You love all the people that take care of you.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.639
and you also

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.509
they tell you they love you.

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.229
&gt;&gt;Yes. &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.149
&gt;&gt; I say thank god. [laugh]

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.749
Thank god they love me!
