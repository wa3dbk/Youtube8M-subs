00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.160
 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.219
I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com Nissan revives the four-door sports car moniker

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.330
for its redesigned

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.220
2009 Maxima that's the brands not quite
full size flagship

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.689
we cover the Maximas interior styling
and another video they're really talk

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.020
about how it drives

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.510
isn't three and a half liter v6 a
standard makes 290 horsepower and works

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.260
with a continuously variable automatic
transmission

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.449
decided offer a manual transmission in
the previous macro but said

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.830
know about it so I shake my fist at all
you who didn't buy it

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.129
on this year's CVT is actually pretty
good as far as they go goes from a

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:42.899
fuel-saving

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.840
1800 1900 rpm although after three or
four thousand for better acceleration

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.820
just have to press the gas pedal a
little bit down get there

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.690
I and in fact when it's really high up
in the TAC it sounds a lot like

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.690
the same engine in the Nissan 350 Z in
the Infiniti g35

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.739
but it doesn't actually emulate all
those characteristics because it doesn't

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.399
actually have an eight years to run
through this is where responsive five or

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.710
six speed automatic might suit
performance drivers

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.710
a little better CBT here wonders a
little bit around trying to match

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.369
performance and efficiency

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.950
and sometimes doesn't really do either
if you want the city does have a manual

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.530
mode

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.440
with six preset gear ratios that does
restore some balance under the cars

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.599
actually faster from the stand on the
gas

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:28.140
let's sort things out drive handling
depends on whether you get the sport

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.610
package or not which adds ninety

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.560
wheels a sport-tuned suspension without
the max was entertaining it's got like

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.840
steering fairly balanced and corners but
it doesn't really bear you go out and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.580
take a drive

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.780
get the sport package that really
changes the string bills for birds have

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.080
your

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.300
it's more direct the car doesn't mean so
much interns or

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.050
go back in squad is here celebrating
with or without the sport back and ride

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.319
quality is pretty good

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.200
the suspension wheels a sort a balance
between comfort and handling

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.640
that you'd expect in a much more
expensive car yet the Maxima start

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.009
under thirty thousand dollars ya gotta
lotta roominess for that money

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.360
the insides actually a little bit
smaller than the mid-size Ultima

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.099
but you do get a lot more refinement
both in driving and features quality

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.840
so if you're shopping an Acura TL Alexis
yes don't count Nissan out

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.840
the maxima is a premium car and it
deserves a lot for additional

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.210
information on this car

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.770
