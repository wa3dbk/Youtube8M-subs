About the difference between good and evil –

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.990
答えは求めていない
I'm not looking for the answer.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.310
そんな世界の常
Scandal and reputation are blended together

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.090
醜聞と外聞を混ぜて
and a shallow ‘virtue' is handed down.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.550

Such is the state of this world.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.770

I've been a bit bored with the world lately.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.610

If no-one's gonna do it, then I'll do it!

Hah! My sword's strokes bear the name of justice.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.670
迷う人も　謀る詮無き人も
Those who are lost, and those who aren't worth duping…

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.510
まとめて全てを　打ち払い百花繚乱
I'll brush them aside, all at once, like countless flowers.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.710
終ぞ知れずに
They'll never be aware of it

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.230
心に雲のかからぬよう
I'll do it so their hearts won't be clouded over

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.390
鞘を投げ捨て
I throw my scabbard away.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.230
この身一つ正義の名の元に
With this body alone, I make my way to the name of ‘Justice.'

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.930
この世に蔓延る　善惡混じりの弁は
This world is infested by petals of good and evil mixed together

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.690
路肩の屑と変わらぬ
Though they're identical to rubbish on the side of the road…

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.790

Ahh, don't you think

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.810

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.410
綺麗な空気がただ欲しくなる
I find myself just wanting to breathe clean air…

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.850
見せ掛けの善意
They pretend to have a virtuous mind

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.390
張りぼての相槌に
With their paper mache signs of comprehension

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450
鉄槌下すだなんて
After all, dealing a crushing blow

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.990

As my body receives this feeling of bareness.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.150
映る刃に仏の顔を映し出してる
Buddha's face is reflected upon my blade…

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.270
人は恋すると強くなると言う
They say when you love someone, you become stronger…

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.710
人は信じる強さがあると言う
They say that believing in other people is a form of strength, too…

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.170
何故に人を守るのだろう
But I wonder, why do you protect other people?

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.390

I ask my blade, reflected before me.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.570

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.550
心無く語る騙る人の多き事
All of those people who thoughtlessly talk and lie to others…

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.130
そんな言葉に　踊らされ有象無象
And the masses, who are made to dance through phrases such as:

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.290
誰か信じて
Put your trust in others,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.810
裏切られ傷つくことはない
And they will never betray you or harm you.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.490
そんな手合いは刃の錆だ
Hah! Those kinds of people… are rust on my blade!

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.610
そして　惡を討ち善の御首級挙げる
Thus, I defeat evil, and raise the severed head of virtue.

The evil of the world was reflected on my drawn sword.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.710
私の顔を映し出していた
So, too, was my face
