00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
A girl in Algiers was prevented from entering an exam

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:08.467
because she was wearing a short dress or a knee-high skirt.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.620
The girl was studying for a whole year to enter the exam and you,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.320
prevent her from entering the University campus because she was wearing a knee-high skirt.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.120
In which dark age are we?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.060
When I first heard the news, I thought the girl attempted entering the University nude.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.920
I have a question for you:

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.740
This is me and this is a short skirt

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.120
if I enter the University what will happen?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.000
Will I cause any threat to the Algerian national security?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.440
or did I puncture the ozone layer, for example?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.800
Let us see this picture together.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.140
It is a picture of late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, with two girls from Algeria in 1962.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.540
So what happened then?

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.240
Did the Nile River flood?

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.200
Or were morals negatively affected?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.700
I cannot understand why you are doing this!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.160
I know that many people will accuse me of advocating nudity and corruption

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.520
but I will not respond, Zainab will respond instead.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.840
Zainab: Freedom for everyone to wear whatever he likes,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.540
dress does not represent who we are.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.440
You heard what Zainab said?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.800
Dress represents personal freedom and any girl is the one who decides whether to wear a short skirt or a veil.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.460
This incident did not only happen in Algeria but also in France.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.360
A girl was prevented from attending school lessons and entering the campus

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.760
because she was wearing a long black skirt.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.380
So you didnâ€™t like the long skirt?

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.080
Did you want the long skirt shortened so the girl does not face any problem?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.420
Be reasonable you too.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.207
Do you want to convince me that,

00:01:53.207 --> 00:01:56.887
if the girl wearing the long black skirt was European,

00:01:56.887 --> 00:02:01.007
you would have still prevented her from entering the school?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.500
Whether we lengthen or shorten the skirt you will not be satisfied, nor will you stop harassing us.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.280
What's even worst is that there is a slogan in Algeria saying:

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.840
if dress is personal freedom then harassment is a national duty

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.731
Hell no!

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.180
Dress is indeed a personal freedom

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.020
and respecting this freedom is the only national duty.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.900
And as they say in colloquial Algerian:

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.580
Being a man is something for you to be, but you will not have control on me.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.080
