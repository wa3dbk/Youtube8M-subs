00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.260
In this video I'll show you sgraffito. 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.170
This comes from "sgraffiare" scratching. 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.280
Scratching like a cat. 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.560
I'll show you how to sculpting a frog pond
from Fimo. 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.350
I use dark green polymer clay. 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.480
I roll out on Level 2.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.860
I wrap the lid of a metal box with polymer
clay. 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.010
I cut off the edges. 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.940
The surface must be very flat.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.050
For sgraffito you need water colors,
water, a brush, a scraper tool and a

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.390
kitchen roll. 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.820
The water color must lather. 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.530
I paint the background. 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.770
I mix the light blue with dark blue. 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.920
I dab the moisture on the Fimo. 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.650
I re-paint the background. 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.690
I carve a water lily. 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.700
If the water color is dry, I wipe off the
remains with a brush. 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.300
I model a frog. 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.440
The frog body is a big green ball. 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.490
From two small white balls I model the
frog eyes. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.980
I model the frog arms and frog legs. 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.830
I glue the arms. 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.030
I paint on the pupils and the cheeks. 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.540
I cut five pieces of equal size for the
flower. 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.480
From the five pieces I model small balls. 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.190
From the balls I make drops. 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.860
The drops become to the petals.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.060
In the flower center I glue a gemstone.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:16.320
I stick the frog and flowers on the tin. As
an adhesive I use Fimo Liquid.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.430
The box comes at 100 degrees for 30
Minunten in the oven.
