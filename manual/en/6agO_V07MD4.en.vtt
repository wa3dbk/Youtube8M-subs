00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.730
Hey, you know you don't 
have to liquify your 401K

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.540
just to get a nice 
big screen notebook.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.420
This thing is 17.3".

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.780
It's from Toshiba, and we're going
to tell you all about it right now.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.990
Hey, check this out.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.280
Nice, big, 17.3" notebook 
for you here.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.840
It's the 
Toshiba Satellite L555-S7916.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.150
Bunch of letters and numbers, 
don't worry about it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.640
because it's just 
got great specs.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.610
It's got Intel Core 2 Duo
2.1GHz Processor;

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.910
that's the T6500.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.350
It's got 3GB of DDR2 RAM.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.580
It's got a 320GB hard drive.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.330
It's got a big 17.3" screen;

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.790
and of course that's running at a 
14 or a 1600x900 resolution,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.620
which is a really, really nice 
high resolution screen on this thing.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.270
Of course that being driven by the 
Intel GMA 4500 Graphics Chipset.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.740
Now, not a huge gaming Chipset,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.210
but it is going to be able 
to run a lot of your games,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.320
and it's going to have absolutely 
no problem with Windows Vista,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.720
with Windows 7, with anything that 
you really would run on your computer;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.590
other than hard-core games you're going 
to be able to do with no problem

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.540
with the graphics card that 
is onboard this particular PC.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.500
Now, it's very very nice.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.570
Integrated webcam 
and microphone

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.640
that you're going to find 
up here in the top bezel.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.840
A nice, big 17.3" screen.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.780
And like I said, 1600x900,
very, very nice resolution as well.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.930
Right below that you've 
got your stereo speakers

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.280
and your media controls 
and power button right underneath there.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.590
And then of course we have 
our big, giant key board.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.890
One of the benefits when you 
get a large screen notebook,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.440
you know it's not just a 
screen that's getting bigger,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.930
it's also the keyboard
that's getting bigger.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.470
You're going to get a full sized
keyboard with this thing,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.700
with a full size 
numeric keypad as well,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.630
which should make all of you 
accountants really, really happy.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.340
I know who you are.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.050
We also have this nice trackpad.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.480
Two button located 
right up there.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.920
Along the front edge you're going 
to find your volume control

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.560
and your SD card - 
your SD Media Slot Reader as well.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.100
Over here, you have got 
your DVDRW/CDRW -

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.600
you can burn both of them.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.330
And it also has Labelflash 
technology built-in,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.260
which means you're actually going to 
be able to burn your images and labels

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.560
directly on to the discs 
that you're burning.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.680
So, after you back-up something, 
or after you burn a CD,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.620
you can just burn whatever it is 
right onto it, which is very cool.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.900
You've got a couple of 
USB ports over here as well.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.550
You also have your modem and power 
over here on the right-side of the notebook.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.910
Turning it around to the left-side is where
you're going to find your VGA port,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.900
your LAN port, 
a combo eSATA/USB drive,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.010
and headphone and microphone ports 
located right over there as well.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.010
All of this in a 
relatively small package

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.150
for being a 17" notebook.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.950
It actually doesn't 
even weigh all that much.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.850
We're only talking about, 
what is it?

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.990
Just 6.99 pounds.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.230
Just shy of seven pounds

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.310
for a really, really good size computer.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.940
So, that's not going to break your back
when your out traveling  with it either.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.200
But it can also act as a 
full desktop replacement

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.340
because it has a 
screen that's larger than

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.050
what comes with a lot of
desktop computers out there.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.250
Very nice notebook.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.330
Very big screen.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.720
Not going to break the bank.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.120
It's the 
Toshiba Satellite L555-S7916.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.800
