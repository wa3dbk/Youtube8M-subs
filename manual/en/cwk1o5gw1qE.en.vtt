00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.760
Let's go into the laundry room because
now that's clean, even though it, and

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:10.570
you think that there would only be one
spot of blood. For several semesters, we

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.730
would take a mock crime scene and we
would get a mannequin and have the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.910
students and you know, take the pictures
and so forth, and it became clear. We

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:27.840
thought we must be able to do something
better. How about that one? New. Clean. Oh

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.600
very good. Forensic nursing really has
come into its own in the last 20 years,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.870
and what it does is to help bridge the
gap between the patient and the law, and

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.629
it is usually a collection of evidence and
observation of the patient whenever

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.210
there has been any kind of incident that
interfaces with the law. I got into forensic

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.089
nursing because of my research, my
research and clinical interest in

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.610
victims.
Well, my first experience with a

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.260
crime scene was when I was asked by the
behavioral science unit down at Quantico,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.500
the FBI division, their training division,
to come and talk with them. And so, they

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.330
brought the cases down to the Quantico
and they would show the crime scenes and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.049
then try to recreate from the crime
scene, and of course all you had was the

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.689
victim.
So victimology became very, very

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.430
important, and very few of them of the
agents were trained in victimology at

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.049
that time. A high-profile case, I've
worked on several, and probably the one

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.929
that many people would know did happen
in the 1990s, and that was Erik and Lyle

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.030
Menendez, who shotgun their parents to
death in their home out in Beverly Hills.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.679
The crime scene was very important on
that case. It was over a weekend that

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.909
this happened. It was a Sunday night and
so, I had to talk to them about

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.850
from actually Friday through Sunday kind
of thing to get the full picture of it.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.700
I'm always asked, "Well how can you do it?"
or, "Why do you do it?" And I do it because

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.319
I can bring it back to the classroom and
be able to then teach what I've learned

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.120
for the benefit of the students. Follow
the case and let's use the usual police

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.440
procedures. We found this young software
engineer who was able to take the crime

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.540
scenes and embed them into a case. The
tool is actually set as a virtual crime

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.850
case, where the aspects of video game
technology are used in an actual crime

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.910
and that the student can
observe, can take pictures, can zoom in to

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.560
the actual crime scene. I put together
the forensic science piece because

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.220
that's how you get the evidence and
how, and which of course, is very

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.840
important for students to know, of how to
look at evidence, how to observe, how to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:09.410
assess. What is evidence? All of that
becomes critical. Could it be a

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.130
fork? Absolutely.
Good, good suggestion. Anything else? The

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.110
first case we did was the Z case, and
this was a 74 year old woman who was

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.880
found dead in the kitchen by her husband
at 3:00 in the morning, and he checked

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.870
all the windows and doors. Couldn't find
anything open and because he was such a

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.250
concrete thinker, he thought, "I must have
done it." Because we had the crime scene,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.350
and it was an important case is how we
built this virtual crime case and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:47.209
decided to try it out with students. Well,
that's a very good question. Why would he

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:58.640
call and say he did it? Wonderful.
Okay, we got some answers over here. Z

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.070
case is what we would call a blood case
because there's so much blood, and how

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.019
how did the victim get approached? How
did she get hit? How did the blood

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.160
spatter end up where it is? What was the
murder weapon? They have to go and find

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.169
the murder weapon. My teaching has
changed since I've been able to add the

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.330
tool in that I feel that I'm giving
students something really concrete to

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.320
work on, very different from a more
passive kind of assignment, where you

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.030
have to read something and then answer
some questions. I've been amazed at how

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.350
much I've learned about the student and
what they've observed, and how varied

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.690
their opinions are, so it keeps me
learning and it hopefully helps the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.160
students to keep learning. So that's
really the way I've developed much of

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.310
the material that I use. I use all cases
that have been completed and

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.210
students like it.
Here it is. Okay, this is what we want.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.120
This is a door that wasn't locked and
when we go inside, these are his tools,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.759
and when you go further inside and what
does it say?

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:19.870
Back door garage. How many found this?So
maybe about half have you found it. Okay,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.400
now what do we have? What do you think
happened here?
