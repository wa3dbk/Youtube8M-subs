hi friends welcome to quickie session of chai 
making today I'm going to show you a

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.690
chai

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.030
this is gud ki chai have you ever tried
it if you have not tried try it tea lovers

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.140
I suggest you try different kinds of tea
flavors so

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.220
let's start here i have the water which
I kept it ready to boil in this we're

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.020
going to add the milk

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.430
I have taken 1 cup of water i'm going to
add half a cup of milk

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.610
you know it depends on how you want to
have the tea you can add 1 cup of milk

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.510
and 1 cup of water or half a cup of
water and half a cup of milk

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.750
so choice is yours in this we're going to add
tea powder as per your taste and we're

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.790
going to crush some ingredients

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.480
cardamom and some fennel seeds just to
get nice flavors here

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.489
I crushed it now we're going to add this
into milk mixture and we're going

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.509
to boil this and in the last we are
going to add the gud

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.429
don't add before and you try to boil
because sometimes the milk may curdle

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.439
so try to add last

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.459
so I'm just going to keep this aside
we're going to boil this friends

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:17.569
always

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.929
if you want a good tea you need to nicely
boil the tea

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:27.439
so here it is boiling nicely and now i'm
going to add the gud that is jaggery

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.490
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
just grate it little bit or you can just

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.119
crush it a little bit and then switch
off the flame and then add it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.049
so here I crushed little bit and now
switch off the flame and i'm going to

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.749
add this you know as per sweetness you
can just add the jaggery mix it once

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.459
with this heat itself the jaggery will
melt and you can serve it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.299
the jaggery has melted and it's ready to
serve

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.380
you know I'm not found of tea but I love
to collect different kinds of teacups

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.939
and keep it in my house so that i can
serve my guests in different types of

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.830
cups so if you love then you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.550
can get different kinds of mugs or
cups and here is our gud

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.550
tea which is ready

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.850
this is not that sweet but a little bit of
that gud flavor and the fennel flavor

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.520
its so so nice

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.140
