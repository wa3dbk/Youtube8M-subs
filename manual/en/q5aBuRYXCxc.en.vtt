00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:02.441
because I'm so proud of her.

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:04.426
So, to Macy because I'm so proud of her,

00:00:04.426 --> 00:00:05.477
'cause she's so,
- Okay, don't cry.

00:00:05.477 --> 00:00:06.564

00:00:11.716 --> 00:00:13.958
I haven't had tequila in 35 years.

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:14.804
- I don't drink.

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:16.801
- Sometimes I do, take shots.

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:17.227
- Really.

00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:18.981
- It's been a really long time.

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:20.556
- [Voiceover] Don Julio.

00:00:20.556 --> 00:00:22.141
- I think this smells
more like a Margarita.

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.263
What is, what are you doing?

00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:24.248
- I clear my nose.

00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:24.932
- Oh.

00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:25.822
- What is a shot?

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:26.608
- Oh my God.

00:00:26.608 --> 00:00:28.137
- Are you going to take the shot, Mom?

00:00:28.137 --> 00:00:28.929
- I'm giving myself a shot.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.555
- I'm, going to take some of the shot.

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:32.246
- You do that in college?

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:32.871
- No.

00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:34.245
- Oh.

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:35.229
- Oh my gosh.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.958
- (expressing disgust)

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.086
- I know my face is saying they're really,

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:38.430
but that wasn't horrible.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.591
- [Voiceover] Sua, suave?

00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.914
su, suave?

00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:43.125
sua vah?

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:43.947
- This is, no!

00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:45.247
- Oh, I got a whiff.

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:47.290
- When people do shots
together, they cheers.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.063
- Oh, okay,

00:00:48.063 --> 00:00:48.880
cheers.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.801
- Well, not like that.

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:52.299
Why'd you say it all throaty,
you're not Marilyn Monroe.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.100
- [both] Cheers.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.433
- You ready?

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:53.951
- Cheers.

00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:55.307
- Hit me.

00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:56.546
- Ew.

00:00:56.546 --> 00:00:56.949
- (breathing out)

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.010
- Mom, to the left, to the left.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.819
- I don't like this one.

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.432
- I actually like this one.

00:01:01.432 --> 00:01:02.265
- What!

00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:03.764
- This is what I drank in college,

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.396
it's all coming back to me now.

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:08.435
- This one tastes like mistakes.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.319
- Shinacco, shinnuh-cow?

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:12.681
china-koh, should we open it?

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.983
- I guess if we want to taste it.

00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:16.035
- Now I know where I got it from.

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:17.006
(pops)

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.523
- Whoa, it's like a bottle of champaign!

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:22.793
Popping bottles with Mom!

00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:24.709
- Oh, I can, I can tell
it's going to be bad.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.039
- What lemon are you smelling right now?

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.118
- I don't know.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:31.682
- Ugh.

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:32.549
- Ooh.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.917
- Ooh.

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:35.203
- Oh my God, that.

00:01:35.203 --> 00:01:36.465
- What are you doing right now?

00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:38.565
- It tastes bad going down,
and then there's the after.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:39.622
It's still hurting me.

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:41.467
- I think I'm like getting blotches.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.324
- (laughing).

00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:44.630
- Jose Cuervo, we know
how to say that one.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.028
We have no problem with that name, at all.

00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:49.127
- This brings back some memories.

00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:51.008
- This is a brown paper bag tequila.

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:52.260
- I don't want to drink this one.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.221
- How you feelin'?

00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:55.470
- I'm great.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.678
- Ooh.

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:58.536
- And I'm not breaking
out in a rash, am I?

00:01:58.536 --> 00:01:59.452
- Hit me with it.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.845
- She's a lightweight.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.577
(music continues)

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:06.876
- Oh.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:08.198
- (funny voice) Oh my God, Jose Cuervo.

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:09.916
- Oh, God.

00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:12.738
- (singing) I think my mouth is on fire.

00:02:12.738 --> 00:02:14.153
- That one is the worst.

00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:15.778
- It's really not that bad.

00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:16.588
- Seven,

00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:19.643
wait, uno, dos, tres,
cuatro, cinco, seis, siete.

00:02:19.643 --> 00:02:22.523
Siete le-gu-as.

00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:25.167
- Oh, this one definitely has no smell.

00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:29.420
- Oh, it has a smell,
what is wrong with you?

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.188
- Oh boy.

00:02:31.188 --> 00:02:32.453
- (coughing)

00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:33.318
- Okay, that did not,

00:02:33.318 --> 00:02:34.826
that went down pretty smooth, mine did.

00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:35.969
- I like this one.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:36.828
- You're kidding.

00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:38.464
- Maybe we should swish
it around in our mouths

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:40.556
and stuff, right?
- And gargle with it?

00:02:40.687 --> 00:02:41.923
- Oh.

00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:43.327
- Didn't I bring you up better?

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:46.276
- That was a bad idea, oh my gosh!

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:47.352
- [Voiceover] Okay, this one looks--

00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:49.192
- [Voiceover] Patron on ice!

00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:50.976
- Oh my God, my ship's come in.

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:53.418
- Stop, I need to smell it first.

00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:54.578
- We'll make these ones a little bigger.

00:02:54.578 --> 00:02:55.641
- Oh. (laughs)

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:57.858
- Just, cheers and then we drink.

00:02:57.858 --> 00:02:59.241
- I'm going to give you a full glass

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:00.676
since you seem so excited.

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:02.127
- Mm.

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:04.546
- Trying to get every last drop there?

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:05.437
- (laughing)

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:06.420
- Just one more.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.748
- I'm going to have another one.

00:03:07.748 --> 00:03:09.867
- (laughing)

00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:10.237
- It just means I'm--

00:03:10.237 --> 00:03:12.438
- Oh, you just did it
again, I didn't even notice.

00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:13.901
- This guy knows what he's doing.

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.057
- (singing)

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:17.378
- We learned that you like bad tequilas,

00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:18.505
and I like good tequilas.

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:20.533
- That's what I learned, I can
take shots with my daughter.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.077
- Ooh.

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:22.074
- Would you do it again?

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:23.410
- No!

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.639
- What if you did it with me?

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.997
- No!

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.333
- What if it's for my birthday?

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:28.075
- No!

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:29.304
- I'm actually happy that you did the

00:03:29.304 --> 00:03:31.216
tequila testings, Erin.

00:03:31.216 --> 00:03:31.760
- See?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.362
- I am, I'm very happy you did this.

00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:34.420
- BuzzFeed brings people together.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.785
- I know, it does.

00:03:35.785 --> 00:03:37.918
- (humming)

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:40.811
Right? (humming)

00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.269
- Are you eating when you're
doing your shots by the way?

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:43.876
You should be eating.

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:45.614
- Yeah, definitely.

00:03:45.614 --> 00:03:46.394
- I love you.

00:03:46.394 --> 00:03:48.294
- Oh I love you too, baby.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:51.230
- Last time I drank too much
tequila, it wasn't good.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.292
- When was that?

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:53.848
- Never.
