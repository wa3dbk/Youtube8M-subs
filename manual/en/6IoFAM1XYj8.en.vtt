Encaustic painting iron - All you need to know

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.800
Hello dear ones. It's me Monika Romer from the Encaustic academie.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.320
Today I'm going to show you some news or generally what you need to know about the iron.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.040
But we don't even call it iron! It's called painting iron.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.080
Encaustic painting iron.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.740
Everyone is probably wondering "why doesn't she take a usual iron everyone has at home?"

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.080
Well, that's easy!

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.840
Because this one is particularly directed to the temperature of wax.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.360
With a normal iron the wax would 
boil away and vaporise.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.820
Because it gets way too hot.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.360
And here we have electronics inside that are purpose-built for wax.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.200
But that's not it!

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.780
As you can see there is a completely even bottom.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.620
No teflon cover.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.680
No steam holes underneath. 
There's no use in them for painting.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.880
At the side we have a very thin bottom
with a very beautiful edge grinding.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.300
For the specific effects you can create with the encaustic painting.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.080
That was one important point.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.540
And another important thing is that the wires inside the iron are completely sealed so that it's no problem if some wax goes inside.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.360
But your common iron at home
 can easily short-circuit.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And that's way too dangerous.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.440
Here you can regulate from low to high temperature.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.540
Depends on what you draw.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.140
When I draw on a cardboard 
I put it inbetween low and high.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.320
For cold grounds like wood, stone, tiles 
or canvas I adjust high.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.080
Another highlight:

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.440
I really like that one.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.240
You can remove this gadget at the back.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.840
As you can see I didn't clean it 
that's just how it looks like.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.480
I will show you how to properly clean 
the iron another time.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.120
Now you can turn it around.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.440
Push it once with a paper towel, because it's hot.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.000
And now you have a little painting board.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.920
So you can put a paper on top and draw.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.780
These were the most important things
I wanted to show to you.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.600
WeÂ´re going to put it back together now.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:43.860
At the front there is a little notch where you can place it on the iron and then latch it into the back again.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.500
You know it's locked by the clicking sound it makes.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.140
So much for the painting iron.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.180
Important information for you 
so the painting can't go wrong.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880
Bye! Until next time.
