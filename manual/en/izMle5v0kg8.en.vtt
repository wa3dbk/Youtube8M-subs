00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.499
I want to talk you to today- get a lot of
questions.

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:09.830
First of all, welcome to my world the wonderful
world of hair.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.549
A lot of times people come into the hair boutique
and they want to know various things.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.660
They come in for the virgin hair and then
they see little things like this and like

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.880
this, even things like this.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.980
And they say, "What are those and how do you
use them?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.980
Should I use them?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.000
Should I not use them?"

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.960
And I think it's a great question so I wanted
to share that information with you today.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.440
These are what you call closures and they
do come in various shapes, they come in various

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.210
sizes and they even come in various textures.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.680
As you see, this is a very very small closure
and it's made just for the very top of your

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.680
head.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.290
So, and this right here, this is called a
frontal.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.290
Ok?

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.550
And what a frontal is for, usually frontals
are for people with thinning edges or severe

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.150
alopecia or burnt victims or any times that
you've had problems with your hairline.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.399
But let's talk about closures first because
again, like I said, they come in all shapes

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:10.399
and sizes.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.759
So, what is my recommendation?

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.490
Closures are not great for every style.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.360
A lot of times people want to wear closures
and they want to wear them very close to your

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.209
hair because they want all of their hair braided
up which is great- that's when closures are

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:28.119
really great to use; when you want to braid
up all of your hair, you want to give your

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:35.649
hair a break, you want to make sure that you're
getting the growth or you don't want to over...

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.459
over curl, over perm , over press your own
hair so you wanna kinda want to take the break,

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.209
braid all your hair up you're going to need
a closure.

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.979
Because you have to remember without the closure,
how are you going to cover the tracks if all

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.209
your hair is braided?

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.679
What this gives you that luxury.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.880
Now, let's talk about different types of closures.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.060
This is what you call a skin or silk based
closure.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:07.849
As you look up very close, what you see when
you open it up and when you part it, it looks

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.009
like an actual skin or your actual scalp.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.519
So, those look really really natural when
you want, umm, a more, say for instance if

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.930
you want to part your hair down the middle,
the thing is- the thing is what I like about

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.349
them as well as you look at the very front
of it, it has baby hairs so that means you

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.740
can bring it as close to the front as you
can.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.709
For instance, I have a closure on my, uhh,
luxury unit so this is a wig that I'm wearing

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.730
and it's a luxury unit but I made it by putting,
actually, a frontal across the front , from

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.189
here to here.

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.500
When you do it like that and it's thin and
it has baby hair, it blends in with your hair

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500
beautifully.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.909
So, that's why I chose to do that but this
is the silk based closure, it looks more natural

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.159
and when you look down into it, so women that
are a little bit more self-conscious, they

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.860
actually spend the more money for the silk
based closure.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.599
This is just a top off closure and what this
is, if you have short hair or if you just

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.510
kind of want a, you know just kind of basically
closing up your installation and you don't

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.379
want a lot of, you know, you don't want to
spend a lot of money- these are more inexpensive

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.230
and actually, you can find these in your local
beauty supply stores.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.730
If you're buying a 27 pieces, never throw
these, always keep them; you never know when

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.069
you'll need them.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.280
Umm, these actually, if they're made out of
human hair, they can be colored, just remember

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.459
any time you...

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.920
use color, moisture, moisture, moisture with
shampoo and conditioner.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.900
This one is your typical- this is kind of
small.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.859
Like I said, they come in small, medium and
large but this type of closure is just your

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.219
regular lace closure.

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.639
I personally like the lace closures.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.680
The reason why I personally like lace closure
is your scalp needs to irrigate.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.609
Your scalp needs to get the air... it needs
to breathe, it needs to be able to allow the

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.349
shampoo and the conditioner to actually hit
the scalp and clean the scalp and the hair.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.219
When you're using a lace because it's so light,
that's why I like it because it's able to

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:12.400
allow the scalp to breathe; when your scalp
is able to breathe... you have... healthy

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.790
scalp, healthy hair- healthy hair, gorgeous
woman.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.579
So always remember when you're picking your
frontals, your closures, regardless, make

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.900
sure that the material that they made it out
of is light, durable and your scalp can breathe.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.680
So yes, I would say use a closure- they're
actually very very good.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.259
Umm, so closures are to be used when you wanna
braid up all of your hair, frontals are used

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:44.290
when people have alopecia or they just kind
of want to bring the, umm, the wig or something

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.460
like that closer to the face or you're having
problems or you have special needs with your

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.460
edges.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.830
This is my strong recommendation.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.310
I would never, ever ever use a frontal because
I see some women, they do it.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.020
I'm not saying you shouldn't, I'm saying my
recommendation as a professional and as an

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.510
expert in hair extensions, I would never use
a frontal if you have -- let's say, I'll take

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.690
my, my hairline.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.020
My hairline for the most part is kind of healthy,
meaning it's not really broken off around

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.591
the edges I would never use a frontal and
then glue down because over time when you

00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:26.389
continuously glue down the frontal and your
edges are perfectly fine, you're going to

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.510
notice that your hairline is going to back
up a little bit more because what's happening

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.210
is, you're taking those baby fine hairs and
you're actually removing it with the glue

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.380
when you remove the frontal.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.520
So, if you do not have edges, that would be
the best recommendation for you.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.920
