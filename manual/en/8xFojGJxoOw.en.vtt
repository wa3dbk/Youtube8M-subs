00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:09.641
Welcome back to our tour of the MotionBuilder interface!

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.230
In the previous video, we opened an FBX scene, 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.610
set some preferences, 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.750
checked out the viewer, 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.230
merged in a character from our project folder in the asset browser, 

00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:22.481
and played back its animation with the transport controls.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.400
In this video, we'll manipulate our character's control rig, 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.550
set some keys, 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.000
create an animation layer, 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.610
check out what's in the Navigator, 

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:32.297
and create a custom layout.

00:00:35.038 --> 00:00:38.193
The Character Controls window plays an important role when it comes to 

00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:40.875
setting up and animating characters in MotionBuilder.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.890
The Controls tab displays a figure representation of your character's control rig, 

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.409
letting your easily select the effectors.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.090
Effectors are control objects that let you pose and animate your character when you translate them,

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:01.978
or rotate them.

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:14.631
The Keying modes on top let you decide whether an effector moves only that body part and its branch,

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.868
or the entire body.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.170
If your character doesn't have a control rig yet, this body will be blank â€¦

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.206
Which means that you need to use the figure on the Definition tab to define, or characterize, your character.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.030
Characterization is a tagging process that all characters need to go through 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.890
for MotionBuilder to understand their skeletal structure.

00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:48.904
Once that's been done, as with Natasha here, you can create a control rig.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.080
We'll go into this process in more detail in other videos, 

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:57.593
since this is a core concept to understand for using MotionBuilder.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.630
To create keyframe animation on your character, or any object in the scene, 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.660
you can use the options in the Key Controls window.

00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:10.151
These controls let you create keys that record an object's property, 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.050
such as its translation or rotation, at the current frame set in the timeline.

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:19.340
You can also remove keys at that frame.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.520
The Animation Layers editor lets you use adjust an animation 

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:28.732
without changing or duplicating the original animation that's in the BaseAnimation layer.

00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:35.736
For example, you can create a layer on top of the original animation,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.790
and adjust the animation there without touching the original animation.

00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:53.006
To the left of these windows is the Navigator.

00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:58.902
This is a commonly used tool that lists all the assets in your scene and organizes them by type, 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.050
such as Cameras, Characters, Lights, Materials, and so on.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.230
To edit an asset's properties, double-click it to show them in the area on the right, 

00:03:08.513 --> 00:03:10.603
then change them as you like.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:19.166
The four other tabs in the Navigator window help you edit and control your animation.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.080
The Dopesheet displays the keyframes on tracks for animated objects in your scene, 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.680
making it easy to edit multiple keys at once.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.080
The FCurves, or function curves, editor also shows the keyframes for the animated objects in your scene,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.010
but instead of being on tracks, it represents animation as a graph, 

00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.935
showing how values change over time.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.060
This makes it easier to adjust individual key values 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.500
and the interpolating curve between them.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.485
The Story tool is a great help for visualizing your animated scene using multiple cameras.

00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:08.821
Or use it to create and edit the animation for your characters.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.340
For example, you could create animation clips and cycle them,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.000
or blend them.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.040
The Animation Trigger tool, as its name implies,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.520
 lets you set up triggering mechanisms to execute one or more animation clips.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.400
For example, you could set up a trigger to drive a character's motion 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.380
using keyboard keys, other clips, or even a game controller.

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.340
Now that you've seen all the different windows in the interface, we'll change their arrangement, 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.190
which is known as the layout.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.860
The default Editing layout is a general purpose layout that is well-suited for creating and playing back animation.

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:50.286
You could also use the Preview layout to have a large viewer,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.210
or the Scripting layout to display the Python Editor on the side.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.920
These preset layouts support multiple screen resolutions 

00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:01.455
and will optimize the interface to fit within your current one.

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:07.664
To create your own layout, choose Create Custom from the Layout menu, and give it a name.

00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:15.310
It's added to the list in the Layout menu and set as your current layout.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:24.120
Now you can undock the windows and move them around, resize them, or close them, in order to arrange the interface as you like.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:37.130
You could also move all other windows to a second monitor so that the viewer has the maximum amount of real estate.

00:05:40.097 --> 00:05:44.465
Any window that you removed can be brought back into the layout from the Window menu.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.490
When you make changes to the interface, 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.330
MotionBuilder automatically updates the current layout if you have Auto-update Layout on.

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:56.462
If you want to update it yourself, you can turn this option off 

00:05:56.728 --> 00:05:59.723
and use the Update Current Layout command instead.

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:04.979
The next time you launch MotionBuilder, it will reload the last layout that you selected.

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:09.270
So that was a tour of the MotionBuilder interface.

00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:15.852
In the following videos, we'll stop and take a closer look at each of the parts of the interface.
