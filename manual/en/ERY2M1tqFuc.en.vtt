00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.829
Today we're going to be installing the bathroom in my Lego custom creator house,

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.739
Today we're going to be installing the bathroom in my Lego custom creator house,

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:14.399
and a lot of you have been asking me

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.119
how do I build a toilet?

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.490
Well first thing's first is I got to figure out where am I going to put the toilet at? Alright?

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.970
I think I'm going to put the toilet here.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.259
In this little nook here. Maybe going this way.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.529
So one of the things first that we are going to start with the toilet

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.089
So one of the things first that we are going to start with the toilet

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.240
is we need to tile underneath it.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.410
So what we're gonna do is we're going to start placing some tiles

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.430
So what we're gonna do is we're going to start placing some tiles

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.530
Some white tiles ... I think that it'll look good.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.590
In this whole area here and I'm going to leave just a spot here, a 1 by 2 spot open

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.240
for this part where the toilet to be installed.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.810
for this part where the toilet to be installed.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.560
So you can see how I'm putting the tiles in there.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.000
So you can see how I'm putting the tiles in there.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.440
Let's zoom in here.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.780
Let's get started.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.970
Okay, we have installed tile here.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.390
So now we are going to show you how to build a toilet.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.200
The first thing you're going to need

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.979
a 1 by 2 base plate,

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.080
a plunger,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.130
a little bucket,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.869
a blank sign,

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.560
and what looks like a life preserver.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.560
One of the things we're going to start with first is take the plate and stick the plunger on here like so.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.620
You're basically going to take the little bucket

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.780
put it through the little ... the plunger through here,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.180
put it through the little ... the plunger through here,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.750
and stick it down like so. So see it looks kind of like that.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.420
Now you take the little life preserver

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.700
with this part here going down,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.190
the peg going down, you stick it on this right here like so.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.500
So you're going to have to fight this little bit to get this on here.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.390
Make sure all this right here lines up.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.010
And there, you got your toilet bowl.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.009
This sign, we're going to clip on here like this.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.459
This sign, we're going to clip on here like this.

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.620
We will be using it as a seat.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.659
A lot of you have been asking me about toilets, there you go. This idea came from the Lego jail set.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.560
A lot of you have been asking me about toilets, there you go. This idea came from the Lego jail set.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.989
Just showing you guys how to put that together. So we're going to set the toilet right in this little spot here.

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.209
Just showing you guys how to put that together. So we're going to set the toilet right in this little spot here.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.079
Press it down,

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.679
and there you have it.

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.939
A toilet in a bathroom.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.089
Now building the kitchen cabinets, or the bathroom, whoops,

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.719
are about the same,

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.159
but I'm going to use a chest of drawer and a cupboard.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.669
but I'm going to use a chest of drawer and a cupboard.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.009
but I'm going to use a chest of drawer and a cupboard.

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.730
In this part, if you watched the kitchen video, is the same,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.329
but I'll still walk through it anyways.

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.299
So I'm going to take this 2 by 6 plate,

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.029
So I'm going to take this 2 by 6 plate,

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:07.439
put my cabinets on here like so.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.699
It kind of looks like that.

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.950
Now' I'm going to put a faucet.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.129
I like to put my faucets over the .cabinet

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.919
Everybody know you just take one of these

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.779
with a single peg on top and you stick the faucet in there,

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.779
like we did with the kitchen.

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:29.489
Now let's start tiling around the sink.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.150
Now since we can't do a traditional sink, I just tile over this.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.579
Now I've seen people use the bowls. That looks good. I'm not a big fan of those so I won't use that here.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.409
Now I've seen people use the bowls. That looks good. I'm not a big fan of those so I won't use that here.

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.999
I'll start tiling on the cabinet.

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.009
Wow, that's really a bad piece of tile.

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:53.519
Some of these are like different shades of white, and I don't know how all that happened.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.549
So it kind of looks like that.

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.549
Stick some of these big large tiles here.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.789
There you have it, a nice kitchen counter,

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:14.659
and I'm going to put that.... Now I wish i could put it there but I can't because of the door.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.829
So I'm going to put it right here.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.039
Now you don't have to necessarily put it here, you can put it back here.

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:29.039
I'm also going to be planning for a bathtub so we're just going to stick this here.

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.199
Okay, now the bathtub, well that's pretty straightforward. 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.870
But what I'm going to do,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.439
I'm just going to takes some 1 by 8 blocks.

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:48.439
one I'm just going to takes some 1 by 8 blocks.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:55.360
Kind of frame in around the tub here.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.159
So it kind of looks like that.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.449
I'm going to take a 1 by 2 block,

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.699
stick it like so, 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.780
and I'm going to take one of these 2 by 2s and stick it here.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.959
Now all we have to do basically is the same thing like we did with the sink.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.599
You're going to sit in.

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.680
We're going to start tiring inside the tub.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.680
We're going to start tiring inside the tub.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:34.089
I'm trying to find some nice-looking tiles.

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:39.749
I'm going to tell you something, you can never  not have enough white tiles three tiles, or any tiles for that matter.

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.259
Make sure that matches the white. There we go.

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.349
And it kinda looks like that.

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:51.880
And now we're going to come in around the perimeter of the tub and put tiles around here.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.669
So one thing that I'm going to start with first is I'm just going to take one of these 1 by 4 smooths, stick it in like so.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.229
So one thing that I'm going to start with first is I'm just going to take one of these 1 by 4 smooths, stick it in like so.

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.589
So one thing that I'm going to start with first is I'm just going to take one of these 1 by 4 smooths, stick it in like so.

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:04.229
And basically I'm just gonna repeat this process around my tub.

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.080
Take a 1 by 6 smooth, put it there.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.979
Take a 1 by 6 smooth, put it there.

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.949
One on the side.

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.150
Take another 1 by 4 and cap this off at the end.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.530
And now basically, you can stick your faucet in here like the one we made for the sink.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.389
And now basically, you can stick your faucet in here like the one we made for the sink.

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.179
And now basically, you can stick your faucet in here like the one we made for the sink.

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:28.759
And there you have it.

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.110
Okay, there's my bathroom. It's completely finished.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.270
Okay, there's my bathroom. It's completely finished.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.719
It looks pretty good.

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:41.150
It looks like a real bathroom.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.549
Some day I'm actually going to try to find a white bowl here

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:49.069
instead of that blue one.

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:53.460
It looks like a nice bathroom.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.530
And here's the rest of the house, what it looks like. As you may see, it's still pretty much a mess.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.970
And here's the rest of the house, what it looks like. As you may see, it's still pretty much a mess.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.389
This is a bedroom. This is a balcony. Here's the master bedroom.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.319
Here's a bedroom right up here in front of the house.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:08.409
You noticed those arched windows, I'm going to be doing tutorials on windows and doors, on different styles you can do.

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:11.159
You noticed those arched windows, I'm going to be doing tutorials on windows and doors, on different styles you can do.

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:14.479
I think that would be kind of cool if anyone wants to see that.

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:15.899
So yeah.

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:17.729
That's basically what it looks like.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.209
The next tutorial will actually be building
a roof for this house.

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:25.960
So I'm going to finish up the walls.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.759
Finish up all the smooth tiling on the top. I don't know if I'll have enough whites for that.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:35.629
You never know with Lego so.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.889
I hope this tutorial helps out.

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:48.339
Thanks for watching.
