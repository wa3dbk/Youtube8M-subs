00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.780
I'm here with two new Sony Ericsson smartphones,
the Sony Ericsson Mini and the Sony Ericsson

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.291
mini pro. Now we've seen a load of large smartphone
devices recently with 4 inch screens, and

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:19.590
even a 4.2 inch screen, and these devices,
although from the other end of the market,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.980
they're really compact, really petite devices
that'll fit easily in your pocket or handbag.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.430
Now the mini pro is the larger of the two
devices because it's got this sliding QWERTY

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.190
keypad and even with that it's a small device
although a little chunkier. Now QWERTY keyboard

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.900
aside, the two phones are very similar. They've
got very similar specs, very similar features,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.570
so we'll concentrate on the mini for now.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.250
So on the front of the phone is a three inch
touchscreen; as I've said it's much smaller

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.620
than the screens we've seen on other smartphones
but it's actually larger than the screen that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.940
we saw in 2010's Xperia X10 mini, which was
2.6 inches .Now, the Mini has a screen resolution

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.100
of 320 by 480 pixels. Now, that might not
measure up to devices like the IPhone 4 but

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.420
it's perfectly respectable.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.500
And then I show hands on trial with the device.
Video looks really crisp and really clear.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.220
That's probably helped by the Sony Bravia
Engine than Sony-Ericsson have fitted into

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.640
the device. If we flip over the phone, you
can see there is a 5 megapixel autofocus camera

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.170
with a LED flash here on the back and this
can also record video in 720 p.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.240
Now the Mini will come with a 2 gig memory
card although you can add to that, you can

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.000
expand that up to 32 gigs in total. On the
bottom of the device here we have got a 3.5

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.049
millimeter jack, so if you're listening to
music or you're playing videos, it's quite

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.510
easy to connect your own headset if you prefer
that to the bundled pair.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.670
Inside the phone is a 1200 milliamp-hour battery.
Now Sony Ericsson told us that this should

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.420
give about four and a half hours of talk time.
There's also a 1 gigahertz snapdragon processor

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.910
- that's up from 600 megahertz in previous
incarnation, so everything should run pretty

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.910
smoothly.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.500
Now the mini and the mini pro are both Android
Smartphones. They run on Android 2.3.3, and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.260
so you've got access to the Android market.
You've also got Google Maps and Google Mail

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.799
built into different devices but Sony Ericsson
customized them slightly with their own interface

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.769
which I'm going to show you here.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.900
So we've got the five home screens that you
can customize by adding widgets. You've also

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.890
got these corner widgets, or corner shortcuts
that Sony Ericsson have introduced. Now in

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.050
previous Sony Ericsson models they've just
had just one widget in each corner, here though

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.230
you can have 4, so that gives you 16 shortcuts
in total on the phone.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.960
Now, a new feature that Sony Ericsson are
very excited about and that is present inside

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.660
the mini is Facebook inside Xperia. So what
that does is it gives even deeper Facebook

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.690
integration. Now most Smartphones use Facebook,
but this is a way of accessing all Facebook's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.340
different features, without having to log
in to Facebook every time that you want to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.340
use them.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.430
Now, the Sony Ericsson mini that we've been
looking at is too new to have this feature,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.131
although it will be available at launch. So
I'm going to demonstrate it on the Sony Ericsson

00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:02.400
Neo. So if you look at the phone here the
first thing that we'll see is in contacts.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.400
We go to contacts, now as usual there's all
your contacts there, but we go to one of them.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.319
We can see that their Facebook birthday is
there. There's a link taking you to the Facebook

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.220
profile. But interestingly enough at the bottom
is a link to all the photos, so you don't

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.660
actually have to go to Facebook, open the
photos application, you can see all the photos

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.550
that this contact has put on their device
and you can see their interests.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.760
Go back to photos, if we were to open up any
of those you'd be taken straight through to

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.030
that photo, and you can add captions and read
any other captions have been left. what you

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.860
can also do with photos, if we go to the gallery,
instead of having to go to Facebook, open

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.280
and see, browse through all your different
Facebook albums, they're present here in the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.810
gallery, as well as all the photos that you've
taken normally with the phone.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.819
Now Facebook inside Xperia will synch your
phone's calendar with your Facebook calendar

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.020
so any sort of birthdays or any events. It's
also got this neat new feature called Media

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.790
Discovery. Now press it here - what that means
is whenever any of your friends or contacts

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.490
or relatives add any active links onto Facebook.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.230
So if they post a You Tube link, or they recommend
a video, or something from Spotify, these

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.370
all active links will appear here on your
phone, and you can press it, it will play,

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.430
and you can see all the comments on your own.
You can also sort these at the bottom. So

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.270
we've got the top links that you've been sent,
all the recent ones, or you can see your own

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.270
links.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.910
It's a really clever way of seeing what's
been posted on Facebook without having to

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.610
wade through all the status updates or where
people might be or those sort of things. The

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.210
Xperia and the Xperia mini pro will be available
in Q3 this year, so we expect that to be August

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.400
or September time. Now, there's no information
yet on pricing or network availability, other

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.080
than to say Sony Ericson told is that they'll
be low- to mid-tier devices, so we expect

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.440
that to mean they'll be around 20 pounds,
maybe 25 pounds a month on a contract.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.310
