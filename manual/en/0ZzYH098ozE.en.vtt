Sloe Gin Fizz Recipe

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Today on Drinks With Diablo.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Hello, and welcome once again 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to TheFNDC.com's YouTube channel.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Today we're making a drink called Sloe Gin Fizz.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Sloe gin is made from the Blackthorn berry or something like that.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Anyway, it....

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We need some of this [ Sloe Gin ], 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You can find it at the cordial section of your liquor store.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We've got some regular gin,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We've  got some club soda.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We've got some freshly squeezed lemon juice,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Which I already have ready.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
A little bit of simple syrup which I have made.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And we got our Cocktail shaker.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So we add our lemon juice, this is about ¾ oz. or about half of a squeezed lemon.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That works out fine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We got an ounce of our simple syrup.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And what I do is just...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 You get the superfine sugar 2:1 with water, 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and just kinda heat it up and let it cool down and you're good to go.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And an ounce of Sloe Gin.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And an ounce of regular gin.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Makes sense huh?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Some people do this drink with 2 ounces of Sloe Gin,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But a lot of people will prefer it with one ounce of regular gin

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Because it takes some of the sweet off.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And it gives it like a little bit of flavor that it wouldn't normally have.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So shake this up.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Strain that out

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Top it off with some club soda

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Give it a little fizz, that's where the fizz comes in see?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And garnish it with a little orange wedge,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and a Couple cherries.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Oh that's beautiful! look at that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's see how it tastes

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
[ mmmm. Sloe Gin Fizz. ]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's not bad

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's pretty good.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
