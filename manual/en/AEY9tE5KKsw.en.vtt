Hello, my dear friends!

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.171
Summer's coming, so it's hot outdoors

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.171
and it's time for tasty and cold lemonade!

00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:25.657
I gonna show you how to make it quickly.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.085
Here we have one big lemon,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.085
2 table-spoons of sugar,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.371
one melissa stick,

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:36.857
1 L of carbonate water.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.371
Let's peel lemon zest with fine grate,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.114
but don't touch the white peel.

00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:52.571
Pour zest into the jar

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.200
express lemon sap over here

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.228
add melissa and pour in sugar.

00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:17.428
add some hot water for dissolving sugar.

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:23.942
add cold carbonate water

00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:38.285
filter it and leave it for half an hour in the fridge

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.371
Let's taste our home-made quick lemonade

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:55.600
It's very nice drink with typical lemon taste

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.171
I think it will be more tasty if I add here some home-made Becherovka

00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:10.457
with Becherovka it's delicious!

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.542
taste is lemon-spicy and very rich

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:20.285
So we made very nice lemonade very quickly and easy.

00:02:20.342 --> 00:02:26.857
You can make from one lemon one liter of very tasty, healthy and natural refreshment!

00:02:26.857 --> 00:02:28.850
