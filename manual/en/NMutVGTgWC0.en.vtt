00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.060
- [Nicole] They're not from here,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.678
they're not supposed to be here

00:00:06.678 --> 00:00:08.834
and I think it's very important to control

00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:10.957
something that can be so destructive.

00:00:10.957 --> 00:00:12.721
- [Kevin] One adult sea lamprey

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.269
will kill an average of 40 pounds of fish

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.602
in its lifetime.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.115
- The Upper Great Lakes,

00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:22.619
they were invaded in 1930s, '40s and '50s

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.774
and they came in through
the shipping canals

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.747
that bypass Niagara Falls.

00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:28.565
- I'm researching with Nick Johnson

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:31.568
on sea lamprey pheromone research.

00:00:31.568 --> 00:00:33.912
- [Nick] Going to State for six years,

00:00:33.912 --> 00:00:35.864
getting my master's and PhD,

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:38.878
it's great that you can take something

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:41.253
that's been developed at Michigan State

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:43.016
and apply it to a major problem

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:45.368
like sea lampreys in the Great Lakes.

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:46.946
Basically on a given day,

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.124
we go to the river.

00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:49.831
- Okay, 1.75.

00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:51.055
- 1.75?

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:51.888
- Mmhmm.

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:54.779
And we measure how much water
is moving through the river.

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:56.862
- 0.70 meters per second.

00:00:58.305 --> 00:00:59.950
Then my assistant Nicole

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.650
will go and prepare the vials of pheromone

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.286
for each given night for
the next three or four days.

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:06.757
- And it's plugged into a data sheet

00:01:06.757 --> 00:01:08.591
to determine how much pheromone

00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:10.901
we need to pump for one evening.

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:13.751
We'll pump anywhere from
approximately one milliliter

00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:16.224
all the way up to around 10 milliliters.

00:01:16.224 --> 00:01:17.563
The first thing that I'm going to honor

00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:20.970
is how much water is
moving through the river.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.069
- [Nick] And then we'll set
up a simple pumping system

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.547
that will pump the
pheromone into the trap.

00:01:26.547 --> 00:01:28.071
- [Nicole] It doesn't
take very much pheromone

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.556
for the lamprey to be able to detect it.

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:33.603
If you're interested in fishing

00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:35.644
for any of those larger fish species,

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:38.121
then you should be at least educated

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.057
about the effects of sea lamprey.

00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:42.442
- So right now in Michigan

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:46.526
we're pumping the pheromone
3kPZS into 10 streams.

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:50.947
That's an abbreviation for
3-Keto Petromyzonol Sulfate.

00:01:50.947 --> 00:01:53.174
Some people have called it a love potion

00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:55.455
but I mainly call it 3kPZS

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:56.712
because we kill 'em,

00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:57.713
it's not a love potion,

00:01:57.713 --> 00:01:59.660
it's a death potion.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.230
- It attaches onto a fish
with a suction cup mouth

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.606
and then the air will suck the
bodily fluids out of a fish

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:08.606
and kill it.

00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:12.631
- [Nicole] When the lamprey
are out in the lakes,

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.870
they are parasitizing
fish like lake trout.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.343
- [Kevin] We're trapping
thousands and thousands of lamprey

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:20.010
out of these rivers.

00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:23.549
If you just do the math,

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.323
that's a lot of dead fish.

00:02:25.323 --> 00:02:28.022
- [Nick] We actually monitor
our application to the stream

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:29.468
by taking water samples

00:02:29.468 --> 00:02:32.821
and those water samples then
we ship back to Michigan State

00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.350
and in the lab of Wei
Ming we analyze those

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.703
and we're able to detect the
pheromone we add to the stream

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:42.716
using some pretty cool
chemistry techniques down there.

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:44.832
- Our lab has been devoted

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:48.652
to finding a new method to
control the sea lamprey.

00:02:48.652 --> 00:02:50.655
That is to use the pheromones

00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:55.617
that we believe are highly
potent and highly specific.

00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:57.941
- The research in Wei Ming's lab

00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:01.238
started the development of
identifying the pheromone,

00:03:01.238 --> 00:03:02.276
synthesizing it

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:03.635
and characterizing it

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:06.377
and now we're gonna
hopefully see it being used

00:03:06.377 --> 00:03:07.957
to control lampreys

00:03:07.957 --> 00:03:11.889
in one of the coolest, I think,
lake systems in the world

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.406
where you have very diverse fishery.

00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:17.191
When you look at how
many fish a lamprey kills

00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:19.484
and how many humans kill,

00:03:19.484 --> 00:03:21.774
in Lake Superior, lampreys still kill

00:03:21.774 --> 00:03:24.009
twice as many fish as humans.

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.313
The idea was to diversify
the control technique

00:03:27.313 --> 00:03:29.396
and also to explore

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:32.311
environmentally benign
and cheap alternatives.

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.911
In our design, we have
two traps at each stream

00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:37.247
and one trap is baited and the other isn't

00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:39.841
and looking at the preliminary results,

00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:42.680
it looks like the baited
trap that has pheromone

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.205
is catching about 50% more
than the trap that's not baited

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:50.835
which could be a major help
to the control program.

00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:52.283
- [Nicole] The data
that we've seen so far,

00:03:52.283 --> 00:03:54.774
it looks like we're
definitely making an impact

00:03:54.774 --> 00:03:56.892
on the amount of lamprey
that we're catching.

00:03:56.892 --> 00:03:58.451
I think this project's really important

00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:59.973
because it has a lot of potential.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.046
We're early in

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:02.842
but this could be something

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:07.009
that really helps control sea
lamprey in the Great Lakes.
