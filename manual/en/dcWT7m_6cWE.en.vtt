00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:06.929
Hey everybody what's up?

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:12.870
This is a quick video on how to rip or copy
your DVD movies onto your Mac so you can put

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.789
them on any device - your iPhone, iPad, iPod,
Android tablet, Android smart phone, or just

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.550
keep them in iTunes.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.279
This is a fantastic piece of software that
I'm using.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.579
It's called Mac X DVD Ripper Pro.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.349
And if you click the annotated link at the
top of this video it will take you to their

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.750
site where you can download it and buy it
at a discounted price.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.489
I highly recommend it.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:38.489
It's very awesome.

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.510
You'll get your use out of it so go ahead
and do that right now.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.260
Once you have it downloaded and installed,
start it up.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.399
It'll bring you to this main screen here and
most people are just going to load the DVD

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.200
disc so if you click this DVD button it'll
load your DVD disc that is in your DVD drive

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.260
right now.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.329
Or you can click this Load DVD folder if you
already have a folder on your computer.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.889
Or if you have the ISO image you can click
this ISO button.

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:05.880
Most people are, like I said, are going to
be using the DVD button so click that.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850
And here the Source DVD disc window pops up.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.130
It'll show you what's loaded into your drive
right now.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.020
It'll show the main title of the movie here
in this box.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.930
You'll just hit OK.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.930
Alright and here it is.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.280
It'll pop up the output profile window and
here is where you can select what output format

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.370
that you want your movie to be in depending
on what device you're going to put it on.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.510
So I can choose anything from an Apple device,
iPhone, iPod, iPad, all kinds of stuff, Android

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.720
tablet to Android smart phone, and even YouTube
video and PC General, all kinds of stuff.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.760
So right now I'm just going to choose iPhone.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.730
It gives you these recommended settings which
is really awesome because you won't have to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.630
go in here and change any of the settings.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.860
It's already chosen for you.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.490
It gives you the best quality option and it
gives you, even gives you the option to choose

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.540
older models which is pretty cool.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.060
So I'm just going to leave mine on iPhone
5.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.170
Click Done.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.170
And here it is.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.099
It automatically detects the main movie title.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.099
It's got a check right here.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.879
You can see how it's the longest.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.890
This is the duration so it's an hour and six.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.100
That's the main movie.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.800
If you just want to copy the main movie it
automatically selects it for you and you just

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
hit Run.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.880
But if you want to select any of the extras,
if the DVD has any extras you can go ahead

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.480
and select any of these here.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.100
You can select them all if you want to and
you can go ahead and click Run.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.100
That's pretty easy.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.670
That's as simple as it is.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.370
I will show you what the settings look like
if you want to go in here and change some

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.370
of these.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.380
Basically the default audio language we'll
just leave that at English obviously.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.040
And then you can choose this Open Output Folder
that's by default.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.930
And you can actually check this Add MP4 files
to iTunes library after conversion.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.190
What this does is it automatically adds the
video movie to your iTunes so you don't have

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.240
to do it manually after it's converted, after
it's copied to your Mac.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.030
And you can actually choose this Shut down
computer after conversion if you'd like.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.190
And here you can choose the default location
of where the backed up copy of the DVD video

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.270
goes onto your computer.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.870
I just have mine set to the desktop by default.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.060
You can change it to whatever you'd like.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.240
So now, yeah we'll just hit Run and let it
copy the DVD to your Mac.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.040
And there it is folks, simple as that.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040
The output folder will pop up.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.520
Your movie will be there.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:36.400
If you want to put it into iTunes, just open
up iTunes and you can drag and drop this movie

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.069
in there and then once it loads there it is.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.870
And you can load that onto your iPhone, your
iPod, iPad by syncing up your iDevice to your

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.989
computer via the USB cable and it'll sync
onto your device.

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.840
So go get that program now it's called Mac
X DVD Ripper Pro and again the link is on

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.280
the top of this video, and the link is also
in the info section below this video so you

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.319
can click on it there too.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.070
So go get that, highly recommended program
by me.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.850
