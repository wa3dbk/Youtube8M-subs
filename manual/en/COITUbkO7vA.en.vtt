What up people this is Lee from "The
Review Pre" giving you a quick look at

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.959
Xbox Media Center for Android

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.900
XBMC is Developed by a Team xbox
media center

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.750
and is in the beta three version
12.0 which is also known as

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.310
"Frodo

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.630
First i'll give you a quick look at the
weather app

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.119
the weather app is what you would expect
from most whether apps

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.970
Yea...
it shows you the weather

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.220
um... On the left hand side,it shows you the weather forecast for the current city, and on

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.680
the right hand side shows you upcoming
forecast for your current area

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.210
i've also noticed that they don't so any
sort of animations

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.030
like you get with HTC Sense or even beautiful
widgets from the play store 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.550
but you will get over it pretty quickly its not like
you will be using this app just for weather anyways

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.500
Next ill show you the photo app,
The photo app works like how most photo apps work

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.670
It shows you photos, um...

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.839
That you either have stored locally 
on your SD Card or

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.150
on your network

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.830
uh... I noticed that when browsing on your network it loads extremely slow

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.430
and its like laggy

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.050
half the time it doest want to load at all so if
you want to use it I suggesting wait

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.590
till its out of beta or till they address the problem 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.640
um...

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.650
but for viewing photos locally

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.070
it was just fine

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.280
....

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.380
as you can see it took a lot of Random photos

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.020
...

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.530
... Lets move along

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.239
um...

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:44.050
Next we'll look at videos

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.069
Videos is the main reason why i think People would download the app

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.930
just because it plays pretty much any
Format that you throw at it 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.719
uh... Even MKVs which i was kinda shocked that they actually worked 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.650
my only issue with the MKV's is that it
does'nt

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.490
Remove subtitles so if you have 
subtitles

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.970
Embeded into your MKV videos

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.800
it's gonna  play w/ them no matter what you do
you cant shut them off...

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.979
..

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.219
but also noticed this is what the desktop app it
does the same thing

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:12.510
so um... 
yea

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.489
So team xbmc if you are l
listening you might wanna address that

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.829
we'll dont have to 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.089
its an issue people may run into

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.409
um...

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:30.159
also when you stream anything like over 720p
I found it to be laggy 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.659
even playing 1080p videos that are 
stored on your SD Card

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.989
the video and voice isnt always sinced
correctly

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.739
i don't really know what the issues with
that but

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.610
Just stick below 720p

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.319
is 720p and it works just fine

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.739
also the button are like super small

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.279
this is mainly because it is a direct
port of the windows app

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:54.439
and

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.569
the app on windows is normally being clicked
by a mouse and

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.189
so it doesnt really  translate to well when
switching it to a touchscreen device

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.449
but i heard that there is a skin out
there that um...

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.259
converts this whole UI to a more

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:10.519
Touch friendly

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.529
If you get what i mean

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.449
next we'll look at music

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.649
music works just how like photos and videos worked 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.849
you choose to stream from your
network or

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.919
play locally and

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.119
uh... it works pretty fine and i noticed that
the album art  sometimes get mixed up

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:30.789
or dont work at all

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.719
but it's not really big deal

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.349
i dont think many people will use this for  music
anyways

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:43.349
but its there if you want to

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.709
Ill play the Ken theme i made 
if i can find it... 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.229
uh... uh...

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.229
it works pretty good

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.010
Other apps that are on xbox media
center are programs which basically allows

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.010
you to launch apps that are installed
on your phone or device or whatever else you are using 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:13.549
The other one would be settings Which basically allows you to configure 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.400
Settings inside the app 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.360
um

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.909
thats pretty much it

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.210
