00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.529
In this video tutorial you will learn how to access and use the snipping tool

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.840
in Windows 8 to save and send screen shots with ease.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.160
To access the snipping tool,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.320
hover your mouse over the right side of the screen and select the Search icon.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.609
Enter snipping tool

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.119
in the search box and you will see it appear in the results.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.590
Select the Snipping Tool. Once the snipping tool is open,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.770
select New. Here you will see a few options for creating a snip.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.180
You can create a Free-form Snip, where you can draw a shape

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.309
around the area of the screen you wish to capture with your mouse,

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.500
a Rectangular Snip,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.239
where you drag the cursor around an area of the screen

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.070
to form a rectangular screen capture, a Window Snip,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.350
where you choose a window or dialog box

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.539
for your screen capture, or a Full-screen Snip, which you would use to capture

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.670
your entire screen.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.350
I will select the Rectangular Snip option

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.000
as I only want to capture small area of my screen.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.460
Once selected, I can just click (holding down my left mouse button)

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.750
and drag to draw a rectangle over the area

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.720
I wish to capture. When I let go of the mouse button,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.189
my snip will automatically appear in the snipping tool window.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.329
Now that I have created my screen capture I have a few options.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.159
If I am happy with my capture I can either save it

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.420
or send it in an email,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.500
in the body or as an attachment. I can also add annotations to my snip

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.500
using the highlighter and pen tools. If I want to delete my annotations

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.259
I can use the eraser tool. Now that I am happy with my snip

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.439
I will go ahead and save it by selecting the disc icon.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.319
I can select the image file type from the drop down list at the bottom

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.060
of the save as dialog box. I will select

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.270
JPEG. Enter a file name, select the directory

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.250
I wish to save my captured image in and click on Save.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.860
You have now successfully created and saved a screen capture.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.200
Thank you for watching and we hope this helps.
