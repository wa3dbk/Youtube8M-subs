00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.120
I’m Joe Marshall with expertvillage.com
and today we are going to learn how to predict

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.520
the future. This is the explanation for the
colored back prediction. The set up is you

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.869
are just going to take a card out of a different
colored back than the blue back, which will

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.460
always be red and stick it anywhere on the
deck you want, just remember what it is and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.979
in this is case it is the 10 of spades, put
it back in the box and set it aside, that

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.699
portion is done, you can just have them hold
on to that. The only set up you will need

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.590
to do with the actual deck is have the card
that you want them to select on the bottom

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.660
of the deck and give it a shuffle, when you
shuffle just make sure the pack that you have

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.300
has the 10 of spades on it that is the first
card to get down and you shuffle it up like

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.399
that, so it is always going to stay on the
bottom, be careful not to flash the bottom

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:01.460
card and that way they just feel the deck
is thoroughly mixed and to force the card

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.870
on them, to get them the pick the 10 of spades,
you are going to do the hindu shuffle, in

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.580
which you will just hold the deck from the
top and the hand comes up from underneath,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.160
it is going to take small packets off the
top of the deck like that until they say stop,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.020
whenever they feel free to say stop, you are
actually going to show them the bottom card,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.780
done slow, you can see what is happening,
but when you get practice you can grab the

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.680
cards like this and do a hindu shuffle, it
just looks like you are shuffling the cards

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.160
until I say stop and I stop you at that card
and it is always going to be the card that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.410
you put on the bottom, so you just tell them
to remember it, keep it in their mind and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.250
set the deck aside from there, you will have
them go ahead and open the pack and get the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.160
cards out, just tell them to thumb through
them face down like that and as they go through

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.720
they are really not sure what is going to
happen, so when they see that there is a red

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.640
card in there they will stop and you just
tell them to set it aside and go ahead and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.420
take a look at it and when they look at it
and realize it matches their card, they will

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.600
be really shocked for a couple of reasons,
one they thought they had a free choice from

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.220
a shuffled deck, two it is a different colored
back than the packet it came out of, which

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.620
makes it in their mind undeniable and there
cannot be a chance, there is no chance for

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.350
failure this had to been it and that’s why
it is really hard, so give it a try and have

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.780
fun with it.
