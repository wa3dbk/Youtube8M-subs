00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
This is a quick summary of Ender's Game by Orson Scott Hall.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.410
This is a story about a boy named Ender who
lives with his mother, father, and two older

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.160
siblings, Peter and Valentine. All of the
children are highly intelligent, but unlike

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.369
his siblings, Ender shows promise as a brilliant
military leader. As such, he is taken away

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.589
to be trained by Colonel Graff for the war
against the buggers, an alien race looking

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.999
to invade Earth.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.369
When Ender arrives at battle school, he is
put through a series of tests and introduced

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.489
to various battle simulators, video game-like
simulations of space battles. He excels and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
is placed into one of the several armies.
At first he is told to stay out of the war

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.730
games, but he develops a superior strategy
for winning. Despite his success as a tactician,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.160
Ender is further hated, but teaches those
who want to learn from him on the side.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.760
Meanwhile, Peter and Valentine create fake
personas and begin political discussions on

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.800
the net.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.390
After graduating early from battle school,
Ender is trained on a dedicated battle simulator.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.830
And when that becomes too easy, he trains
with Mazer Rackham, an old war hero.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.520
Under this new training, Ender is pushed to
the limit and nearly breaks down as his battle

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.060
simulations become increasingly more difficult.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.710
Ender finally has one last battle simulation
that involves a planet and several thousand

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.960
ships. He wins the game, but then is told
that all of it was real. That he was commanding

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.999
real ships in what he thought was a simulation.

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:37.039
Ender is proclaimed a hero, but still fears
Peter, who has great political influence on

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.280
Earth. In the end, Ender finds a bugger cocoon
and takes it with him as he travels in space

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.569
with Valentine.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.189
As always a lot can be said about this story,
but what draws my interest and attention is

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.359
the idea of using children in intergalactic
war.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.679
Throughout the story, it is sometimes difficult
to remember that most of the main characters

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.740
are children. In Ender's society, children
are often forced into maturing quickly for

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.450
military endeavors.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.069
But why children? Wouldn't it make more sense
to train more physically mature individuals

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.260
to fight? The explanation given is that the
military wants individuals who are willing

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.150
to react to situations without thinking about
the consequences. Children are able to act

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.950
this way because they haven't lived long enough
to understand scope and bigger consequences

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.890
of their actions.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.040
While cruel, this type of thinking is valuable
and necessary in the battle against the buggers

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.129
because of how the buggers learn and adapt.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.420
Also, a lot of the battles are battle simulations,
or at least perceived as battle simulations

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.110
to the children. It's this perception of a
game that allows the children to learn, strategize,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.000
and take risks that would not be possible
had they known it was happening in real time,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.650
which says a lot about how children learn
and how humans learn in general.
