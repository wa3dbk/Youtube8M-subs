Hello, my name's Oscar Moreno with Moreno
Custom Home Visions and today we're going

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.240
to teach you guys how to properly use an orbit
sander. One of the things to tell you guys

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.160
is when and where to use it. Real simple thing
is that this piece of wood here, I'm showing

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.830
you, you can use an orbital sander in order
to get this down to a nice even surface. One

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.340
thing you don't want to use an orbital sander
with, which is, just to be very time consuming,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.199
is actually having this type of wood here,
where you see a lot of the ridges real high

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:39.640
up. Basically, you want to get this done with
a plainer first and then follow up with your

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.280
orbital sander. So, we want to get started
here is we're going to go ahead and load up

00:00:45.280 --> 00:01:10.780
our orbital sander and go ahead and attach
the sandpaper to the actual sander.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.079
Once we have that secure and fastened, we're
ready to start sanding. One more tip, you

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.380
guys, is that depending on the actual wood
you're using and how much wood you want to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.259
remove, if you want to stay in between, just
to get this to a nice good surface, just go

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.550
ahead and use a hundred and twenty grit sandpaper.
If you want to get a little smoother, you

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.189
want to go maybe a two twenty and if you want
to go super smooth, there are higher numbers

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.070
to go on but you really don't need that for
lumber. So, basically, we want to use this

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.500
to go ahead and get started on our orbital
sander, go ahead and start your machine and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.189
apply pressure over your actual surface, as
you're moving the machine back and forth,

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:05.899
back and forth, until you are happy with outcome
of the actual sanding has come out to. That's,

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.160
pretty much, how you use a orbital sander.
