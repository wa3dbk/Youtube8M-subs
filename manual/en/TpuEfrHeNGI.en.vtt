Hey everyone, this is Mark Wiens with eating
Thai food dot com.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:10.530
I'm at one of my favorite Thai street food
neighborhoods in Bangkok, Thailand, Ramkhamhaeng

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.949
Soi 29 and I'm heading to a tasty restaurant
just down the road, going to grab some Isaan

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099
style Thai food.

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.310
One of the most important things about ordering
a Thai meal is to get a well rounded combination

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.180
of flavors and tastes.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.310
So my meal has just arrived and I'm going
to show you guys exactly what I ordered and

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.620
how you can also order it that way.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.750
This dish is called som tam thai prik ha met,
green papaya salad with five chillies.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:55.510
It's crisp, it's a little bit sweet, a little
bit sour, it has a nice chili kick to it.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:03.399
Another dish I ordered is a smoked catfish
salad known as larb pla duk, this is one of

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.091
my favorite dishes actually, I eat it almost
everyday.

00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:10.420
And then I ordered up a pork dish known as
nam tok moo.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.880
It normally comes with a lot of fat mixed
in, but I'm not big on the fat, so I ordered

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:26.201
it mai man, which means no fat, it's like
a grilled pork salad, it's fantastic.

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:33.190
Then I ordered something called yam ruam mit
talay, it's like a clear mung bean noodle

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.740
salad.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.760
Lastly to round out this meal, I've ordered
tom saap sekong moo, a sour Isaan soup made

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.390
with pork ribs to make it extra flavorful.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.470
Wonderful!

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.880
To accompany all of this food it's most typical
to order something known as khao neow, sticky

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880
rice.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.010
So you grab a piece of sticky rice and what
you want to do is flavor it with the different

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:15.830
sauces from the dishes, so I'll dip it in
the som tam first, it flavors it wonderfully.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.910
If you love Thai food and you want to take
your eating to the next level, be sure to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.190

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.350
So all the remains of the feast are a few
fish bones, I'm stuffed and very happy.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.680
OK, so that two hundred and forty baht for
this whole meal.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.910
