00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.549
Jermaine Brown: Wow, what this campus means
to this city?

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.170
It means life!

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.009
This campus means life to the community.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.830
Gary Ashley: The University of Michigan-Flint
is located right downtown.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.830
So it starts with us.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.210
If we're going to be a college town we've
gotta lead the way.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.759
Amber Cochran: To see now the progress Flint
has made in um, in revitalizing Flint to um,

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.189
maybe perhaps the college town that people
hope for it to be.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.559
I see it coming along and it's really nice.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.609
This is a city filled with potential.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.590
Traci Currie: Now you have two communities
coming into the same space and it's like okay,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.590
we're merging.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.629
Joel Rash: One of the great things about college
towns that people don't really consider is

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.879
the fact that a lot of folks that are at those
nightclubs, seeing concerts, throwing a frisbee

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.719
you know, on the lawn are there because they
can walk there easily.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.629
And so all the housing downtown, the core
neighborhoods downtown that have more rental

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.800
houses, the university housing on campus,
has made it easier for students to be out

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.400
you know, not just during the day when they
have classes, but also you know, dinner time

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.780
and at night and really participate.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.450
And just those feet on the street, students
walking around, you know, going to downtown

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.110
businesses, getting a bite to eat, going to
dance at a downtown club, is part of that

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.110
college town vibe.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.670
Paul Knific: Last week I was walking down
Saginaw Street at like 6 o'clock at night

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.160
and it was packed with students at the bars,
at the clubs, hanging out, having fun.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.320
It wasn't like that 5 years ago.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.890
Qiana Smith: A lot of our first year, second
year students, don't know what Flint was like

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.700
before we had a residence hall.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.950
So this is what they see.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.130
Of course they'd like to see more restaurants
and more things to do um, on the weekends

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.700
and in the evening but they see it as a college
town and they enjoy it.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.600
Unknown: People love living in this part of
Michigan and you know, we need to give them

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.979
a reason to.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.750
Having a vibrant, diverse, active downtown
that's moving toward being a 24 hour city

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.100
that has a lot of options for living and restaurants
and entertainment is a big part of that.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.830
Antonio Brown: Flint has tremendous opportunities
here.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.210
Flint has so much to offer.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.490
James Thigpen, Jr.: People are actually navigating
towards this, this central area of downtown.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.840
It's bringing people together and it's bringing
pride back to Flint.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.450
Cade Surface: It's really made kind of a 24
buzz here.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.220
I mean, there's always something to do.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.921
Unknown: The addition of students to downtown
Flint makes downtown the destination that

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:35.450
everybody wants to go to.
