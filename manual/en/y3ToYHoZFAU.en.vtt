00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:26.339
Listen, if you’re going to put a kart racer
on a Nintendo system, it’d better be good.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.779
And you’d better have some brilliant idea
that sets it apart from other kart racers,

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.370
specifically that one that has defined racing
on every Nintendo platform since the formation

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.309
of the Russian Federation.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.199
Anything less than that, and no one is going
to care.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.340
That’s why you’ve probably never heard
of Face Racers.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.690
Of course, for a game no one cares about,
Face Racers: Photo Finish actually has an

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.329
impressive list of accolades.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.280
It has one of the worst box covers since Karnaaj
Rally, it’s one of the few third-party games

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.930
to actually use one of the 3DS hardware features
and...it was the very first kart racer released

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.390
for the system.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.530
Quite the promising start.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.920
Too bad it stalls out immediately afterward.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.730
Face Racers: Photo Finish is a kart racer
with one hook—you put your face in the game.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.890
You’re prompted to take four photos of yourself
with the 3DS, each one for a different emotion.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.360
Those photos are then pasted onto the face
of a kart racer...who evidently was faceless

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.360
beforehand.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.009
Then, you race.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.119
Against three people.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.230
I’ve played and even covered Nintendo systems
for a long time, so I’ve come across plenty

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.969
of Mario Kart clones.

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.400
Some have been fun, some not so much.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.119
But this...this is legitimately the worst
kart racer I think I’ve ever played.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.421
In fact, I’m not even sure where to begin,
so we’ll just...we’ll start with, you

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.119
know, the visible stuff.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.600
I realize this comparison is often used as
an exaggeration for ugly games, but Face Racers

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.720
legit looks a Nintendo 64 game.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.920
In fact, Diddy Kong Racing?

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:28.530
Sharper looking today than this game.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.360
Face Racers coasts on every idea that has
ever come before it from a design perspective,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.290
so you have all the typical kart levels...without
any of the charm or character.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.940
It’s almost like this game had a checklist
during development.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.610
We need a beach, a forest, a volcano and some
snow.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.150
Doesn’t matter how levels the actually play,
as long as they are designed around those

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.310
painfully general concepts.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.069
And that’s another area where this game
really disappoints.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.720
The track layouts are almost thoughtlessly
put together.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.041
Unlike a Mario Kart title, in which the tracks
evolve and progress throughout a cup, they

00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:09.480
stay unremittingly boring in Face Racers.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.830
There aren’t any fun passages or cool obstacles...there’s
just really dull and thoughtless racing.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.950
Oh, but your face is on the character.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:29.220
And it beat Mario Kart to retail, so...you
know, the first 3DS kart racer!

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.970
As you might expect, the game mechanics are
even worse.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.099
It’s slow, you can’t even powerslide—but
you know what?

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.319
There’s no sense kicking a dead horse here.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.200
There’s four player multiplayer, but you
probably won’t care.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.989
There are 20 courses, but they’re all slow.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.010
And you can take the game online, but there’s
no **** way anyone else is playing this game

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.540
online.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.319
Face Racers is a game that exists for one
purpose—to occupy the bottom shelf at the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.319
game store.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.879
The one only the cheapest parents even know
is there.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:04.920
Mario Kart 7 costs almost twice as much as
Face Racers: Photo Finish, but in this case,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.969
you really do get what you pay for.
