00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.759
[Darris McNeely] We've had several episodes
on BT Daily here talking about the Day of

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.910
Atonement, one of God's Festivals that is
coming up and will be upon us here this coming

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.140
Saturday.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.630
The Day of Atonement is one of the most impressive
of all of the Festivals of God because it

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.789
pictures, as we've covered in previous ones,
the removal of Satan: the god of this world,

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.800
the great serpent that Revelation 12 says
that deceived the nations and all of the world.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.770
The symbolic meaning of this Day of Atonement
from both the Old Testament and the fulfillment

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.570
of it as prophecy in the New Testament shows
us points to this one great fact of the source

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.690
of evil in all of this world today and in
the past finally being removed and being placed

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.120
upon the head of Satan.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.010
[Steve Myers] Revelation 20 puts it this way
in verse 3, it says, verse 2: "This angel

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.290
comes and lays hold of the dragon."

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.810
And it tells us who that is.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.330
It says, "Who is the devil and Satan and bound
him for a thousand years and cast him into

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.440
a bottomless pit and shut him up and put a
seal on him" (Revelation 20:2-3).

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.780
So ultimately the Day of Atonement is pointing
to this event where Satan will be put away.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.490
And it doesn't short change the fact that
he has deceived the whole world.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.520
Not just a few people, but the whole world.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.240
And ultimately the time is coming when he
will be put away.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.860
[Darris McNeely] This one event Steve just
read from Revelation chapter 20 is the one

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.229
event that must happen before there can be
an understanding of all peoples and truly

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.360
people becoming at one, which the Day of Atonement
or the word atonement means to become at one,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.020
in this case, with God.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.960
When the source of spiritual deception is
removed from all of mankind, then atonement

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.740
can take place.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.299
And God then can begin the reign of peace
that the scriptures point to of the time of

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.939
Jesus Christ on this earth and His Kingdom,
the Kingdom of God ruling over the nations.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.409
The time to look forward to.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.979
It's an important festival.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.690
It's an important key to understand our world
and the future.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.820
[Steve Myers] That's BT Daily.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.450
We'll see you next time.
