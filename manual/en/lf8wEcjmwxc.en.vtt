&gt;&gt; Secretary Salazar:
Thank you very much,
Neal Muholland,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.500
and thank you to all of the
members of the National Parks

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.800
Foundation for your
outstanding work and

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.200
for making this day possible.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.033
Thank you for the work you do
to protect America's natural

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.467
heritage and its culture.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:18.367
On behalf of the Department of
the Interior and the National

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:22.767
Parks Service and my colleagues
on President Obama's cabinet,

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:26.166
we are honored that you are
all here with us tonight to

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.667
celebrate this great
American holiday tradition.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:33.233
Seventy years ago this month,
just weeks after the bombing of

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.200
Pearl Harbor, in
those dark days,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.667
President Franklin Roosevelt and
Prime Minister Winston Churchill

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:43.400
joined here together in the
White House to light the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.400
national Christmas tree.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.066
During those dark days,
President Roosevelt called on

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:52.333
the nation to view the lighting
of the tree as a reminder that

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:57.734
we set our faith in human love
and in God's care for us.

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:02.867
Tonight let this tree
remind us that in all times,

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:06.600
the light of love and good will
shines brightly across America

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.734
and around the world.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.767
This occasion is also
special for all of us,

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:13.233
because we are gathered
here in Presidents Park,

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:17.934
one of the 397 national parks
under the care of the service,

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:20.800
and here we light our
nation's spirit of peace,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.367
hope and joy for the holidays.

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:30.266
Now on this remarkable night
in these remarkable times,

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.967
it is with great honor that I
introduce someone who never

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:39.133
rests, someone who never tires,
someone who never quits,

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:43.166
someone who is a champion for
American peace and prosperity

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:46.967
for all of its citizens, the
44th President of the the United

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.467
States of America, Barack Obama!

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:53.000
(cheers and applause)

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:22.200
♪♪ (music playing) ♪♪

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:25.133
The President:
It's nice having your own band.

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.166
Please have a seat, everyone.

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:37.133
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:41.567
Thank you, Secretary Salazar,
for that introduction and for

00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:46.133
your hard work to preserve and
protect our land and our water

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.967
and our wildlife.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.834
I also want to thank Minister
Rogers for the beautiful

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:54.800
invocation, as well as Neil
Mulholland and everyone at the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.533
National Park Foundation and the
National Park Service who helped

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:01.300
put this outstanding
event together.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.734
I'd like to thank Carson
Daly and Big Time Rush,

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:07.533
and all of tonight's performers
for joining us to kick off the

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:10.734
holiday season here
at the White House.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:15.367
For 89 years, Presidents and
Americans have come together to

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:19.200
light the National
Christmas Tree.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.500
And this year is a special one.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.633
This year, we have
a brand new tree.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:29.767
The last one stood here for more
than 30 years -- until we lost

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.467
it in a storm earlier this year.

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:36.767
But we all know that this
tradition is much larger than

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:38.700
any single tree.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.400
And tonight, once again, we
gather here not simply to light

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.600
some decorations, but to honor
a story that lights the world.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.800
More than 2,000 years ago, a
child was born to two faithful

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.100
travelers who could find
rest only in a stable,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.200
among the cattle and the sheep.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.000
But this was not just any child.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.500
Christ's birth made the angels
rejoice and attracted shepherds

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.300
and kings from afar.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.367
He was a manifestation
of God's love for us.

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:20.834
And He grew up to become a
leader with a servant's heart

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:25.200
who taught us a message as
simple as it is powerful: that

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.834
we should love God, and love
our neighbor as ourselves.

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:34.967
That teaching has come
to encircle the globe.

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.633
It has endured for generations.

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:41.133
And today, it lies at the heart
of my Christian faith and that

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:44.133
of millions of Americans.

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:49.600
No matter who we are, or where
we come from, or how we worship,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.300
it's a message that can
unite all of us on this

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.367
holiday season.

00:04:54.367 --> 00:05:00.066
So long as the gifts and
the parties are happening,

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:04.633
it's important for us to keep in
mind the central message of this

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:09.233
season, and keep Christ's words
not only in our thoughts,

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.500
but also in our deeds.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.900
In this season of hope, let's
help those who need it most --

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.400
the homeless, the hungry,
the sick and shut in.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.400
In this season of plenty, let's
reach out to those who struggle

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.400
to find work or provide
for their families.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.700
In this season of generosity,
let's give thanks and honor to

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.967
our troops and our veterans, and
their families who've sacrificed

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:38.233
so much for us.

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:41.500
And let's welcome all those
who are happily coming home.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:48.433
(applause)

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:51.834
And this holiday season, let us
reaffirm our commitment to each

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:58.767
other, as family members,
as neighbors, as Americans,

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:03.700
regardless of our color
or creed or faith.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.367
Let us remember that we are
one, and we are a family.

00:06:09.367 --> 00:06:14.000
So on behalf of Malia and
Sasha and Michelle and our

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.633
grandmother-in-chief, Marian --

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:17.967
(laughter)

00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:21.500
-- I wish you all the
happiest holiday season,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.934
the merriest of Christmases.

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:27.266
God bless you all, and may
God bless the United States

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:28.133
of America.

00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:34.200
(applause)

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.800
And with that, I'm going to
invite the entire Obama clan

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.300
up here to light
the Christmas tree.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.367
I need some help, and
there's a lot of technical

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:42.333
aspects to this.

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:45.600
(laughter)

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.300
Come on, guys.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.800
(applause)

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.166
All right.

00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:59.133
Okay, we're going to
start counting down here.

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:00.834
We've got the switch right here.

00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:02.834
The First Lady:
All right, come on.

00:07:02.834 --> 00:07:05.233
The President:
Everybody ready?

00:07:05.233 --> 00:07:07.900
And this is the new tree.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.233
I know it's not quite
as big as the old tree,

00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:13.633
but it's going to
take time to grow.

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.667
But we're going to fill it up
with some spirit and start a

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:17.400
new tradition right now.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.433
All right, everybody ready?

00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:19.967
We're going to
start counting down.

00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:25.700
Five, four, three, two, one --

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.000
(applause)

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.934
There you go.

00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:39.533
That's a good-looking tree.

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:45.667
Thank you, everyone.
