00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.609
Hi, my name is Ken Kraft.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.370
I am Treasurer of Yankee Publishing, and for
the last seven years or so, I've been interested

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.240
in creating fused glass art.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.560
Fused glass is different from hot glass in
that hot glass is done using a glass furnace

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.710
where an artist will blow glass, creating
either a bowl or a goblet, whereas fused glass

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.930
is done where the glass is worked cold.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.910
You cut the glass, and layer it, and place
it in the kiln for firing.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.510
For quite some time now I have harbored an
interest in nautical themes, largely because

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.140
of the fish on the wall.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.420
Nautical glass is based on nautical themes
where I find glass that reacts with one another

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.290
and creates shading where the two pieces of
glass meet.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.949
Today, I'm going to show you how I make my
glass coasters.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.920
The first thing I do is pick out the color
of the glass I want to use, and I put it on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.180
a cutting mat and score the glass with a glass
cutter.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.890
Using a glass breaking tool, I break the glass
into a 4x4 piece.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.360
After repeating the process with a cream colored
glass, I then cut it corner to corner to cut

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.110
the triangles.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.430
With a similar process, I then cut a 4x4 clear
piece to use as the base of the coaster.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.770
Depending on your cutting skills, you may
need to wet-sand down some of the edges using

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.370
a disc sander.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.950
I also then round the corners of the glass
to avoid any sharp edges when the piece is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.950
fired.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.950
I then wash the glass using a pair of latex
gloves to avoid getting any fingerprints on

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.240
the clean glass.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.060
I then arrange the pieces of the coaster like
a puzzle with one piece on top of the other

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.030
so they are tightly fit together for placement
in the kiln.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.180
So, this is my kiln, and you initially have
to start by putting a kiln wash or a piece

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.320
of shelf-paper on the shelf, so that when
the glass melts, it doesn't stick to the shelf.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.390
I prefer to use shelf-paper, so I cut these
the size of the shelf.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.430
I place them on the shelf.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:26.829
Then, I proceed to load the kiln with my glass,
trying not to have it fall.

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:32.830
Once in the kiln, you just make sure that
the pieces are put together snugly and that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:42.850
the top layer is directly over the bottom
layer so that it all fuses together nicely.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.110
Once you're ready to go, you close the lid
gently.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.019
Today we're going to do what's called a full
fuse.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:03.590
I have a program that I've set up that allows
me to slowly heat up the kiln and slowly cool

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.130
down the kiln.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.900
I recall the program, and it's program number
3, and I hit enter, and you're ready to hit

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.880
"start" and have it start.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.640
And so, we're ready to open the kiln.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.970
For me, this is the best part.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.350
It's like Christmas morning, going downstairs,
seeing the brightly colored packages under

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.620
the tree.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.530
Here we go.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.530
Voila!

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.389
We have a set of finished coasters.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:38.010
We have four perfectly formed coasters.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.130
Thank you for letting me share my passion
with you today, and if you have a passion,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.600
please share it with us at YankeeMagazine.com.
