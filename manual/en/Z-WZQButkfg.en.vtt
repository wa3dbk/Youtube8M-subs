Hi, I'm Shaun Schaefer on behalf of Expert
Village and today we are going to be learning

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:12.160
how to play a few basic flam rudiments. Now
that we have learned to play the flam tap

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.249
pattern without the flams it is time to add
the flams in. So it is a little more difficult

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:26.619
but with our piece of music here, this is
going to be our guide. So just make sure you

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.640
have this close by so you can see it and you
can cheat off of it as I like to say. So what

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.091
we are going to do is we are going to play
the flam taps with the flams. So here we go.

00:00:39.091 --> 00:01:08.400
1 e and a, 2 e and a, 3 e and a, 4 e and a,
1. Let's slow it down. I might have started

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.520
it just a little bit too fast okay so let's
slow it way down so we can think about what

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:36.350
we are doing. So let's do 1 e and a, 2 e and
a, 3 e and a, 4 e and a, 1. Once you keep

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.050
practicing that, it sounds really cool when
you play them fast. That is what I kind of

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:51.790
wanted to show you right now is speeding it
up a little bit. It is really neat and it

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:04.210
sound pretty cool when you speed them up.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.610
Now that we know how to do that, keep practicing
them slow and then you can build yourself

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.730
up and build your way to playing them a little
bit faster. Let's go ahead and take a look

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.250
at our next step which is trouble shooting
how to play flam tapes.
