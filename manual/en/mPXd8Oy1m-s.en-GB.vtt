00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.559
Heather Ingram: The KEYS Program is a seven
week summer program. It's now in its seventh

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.710
year and we've connected 188 interns with
internships across the UA campus. It's a one

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.029
week training where we teach them about basic
bioscience techniques that they can take into

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.650
their internships. The second week they go
in for a full time internship

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.240
Shelby Yuan: So I'm working in Dr. Trouard
lab, he's a biomedical engineering professior

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.560
and what this lab usually does is they work
with MRIs and drug delivery to the brain.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.570
So what my project is about is I'm trying
new methods to try and get around the blood

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.420
brain barrier to deliver drugs to the brain.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.680
Justin Lopez: I'm working in Dr. Fernando
Martinez' lab. He does asthmatic research.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.250
Brandon Dorr: In this lab they mainly research
NRF2 which is a transcription factor which

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.869
binds to the DNA which just helps regulate
the different genes that help maintain cell

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:08.869
homeostasis.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.140
Danielle Richard: This is Dr. Lau's lab we're
doing kidney cancer research we went through

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.640
an interview process where we just kind of
explained what parts of science we were interested

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.691
in so I expressed an interest in cancer and
more molecular and cellular biology and this

00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:28.050
is that lab I was placed in so I'm very happy
about that.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.840
Lopez: My favorite part is working with all
the bio technicians and lab managers and getting

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.550
to know them and actually just working on
lab work which is a lot different than just

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.250
learning about it in school.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.729
Marti Lindsey: In high school science is a
little bit abstract. The experiments, everybody

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:55.590
knows how they're going to turn out, the information
seems to be a lot of memorizing information,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.840
but when you get into the lab and you understand
that science is actually very dynamic and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.841
science is discovering the unknown instead
of discovering the known then the bud of the

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:17.920
idea that I might want to be a scientist takes
hold and the students really can do so much

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.989
with their lives if they get passionate about
science.

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.330
Dorr: It's really eye opening there is so
much to learn that I just really enjoy talking

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.730
to all the lab members here and I can just
talk to them and learn all sorts of cool stuff.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.019
Yuan: Like meeting other students and learning
about what they're doing in their labs, because

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.450
there is such a great range of interesting
topics that they're researching too so I think

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.439
its really great to not only go into depth
about your own research, but also to learn

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.689
about what others are doing.

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.349
Ingram: I think the students themselves are
the most surprising, just seeing what they're

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:58.010
capable of, that's been probably the most
surprising thing about the program. And, you

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.230
know, just the generosity of the people on
the campus who take them into the lab and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.989
give them those opportunities.
