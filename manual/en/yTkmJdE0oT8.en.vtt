00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.300
Do you want to carry your team to victory with your ButtFucking Friend every single time?

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.900
Then let uncle Couille show you how to play...

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.290
To begin the game with a good start, you have two options.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.000
First, you can buttfuck each other while letting one of you suck up all the experience from the jungle to reach level 2 faster

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.450
and immediately go straight to the enemy's red buff to steal it.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.100
After that, wait in that brush like good little kids until the enemy jungler shows up to grab him and rape him in the brush.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.300
The second option is to separate yourself from your Butt Buddy to get both buffs at the same time so you can both reach level 2 faster.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.300
And then, you will be able to play rodeo all day all night without letting any fuckabish escape from your clutch.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.870
But, since you are double jungling, your bot lane will always be pushed,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.700
so turn that into your advantage to ninja gank the enemies without letting them do a single thing nor escape from your tower to deal tons of damage like Phreak.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.400
With Threshcrank, you can have a sexy party with that cosplayer while blocking every exit possible to have a fearsome fivesome with that woman.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.800
Sometimes, you should randomly send your big D to scout the brush and you might be able to find a Chinese Spear imitating his fellow comrade.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.980
If an enemy notice you and run away at the speed of light,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.250
you shouldn't worry about that tower because you can pull him away from it and play with him until you're satisfied.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.750
The best thing about Threshcrank is that even if one of you fail to hook someone, your partner has a second chance to redeem your stupid failure.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.250
Since you roam everywhere on the map like excited kids playing in the park,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.680
you might get caught by a molester, but do not give a single fuck since you can always save one another like real bosses, no problem!

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.910
With your combo partner, you can easily bring back a running enemy to the starting point to shit on him in mid-air like never before.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.150
And that is why you can simply towerdive to bring anyone on your home turf to have the best night of your life with any bitches.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.700
If that trick doesn't work well for you, just do the old school combo and you will be able to bind anyone on your bed long enough to kill him without mercy.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.190
If you want, you can use a Double Hook to hold an unlucky fuckabish firmly beside your tower to show him how hookers get the job done.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.150
And that is how kids learnt that walking in the park at night is dangerous.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.150
Now that you screwed the enemies over and over again, it's time to (MY D IS 2CM LONG) and steal every single buff with no respect.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.300
If an enemy is in an epic fight with the golem, just steal it with your smite and use that clown to play tug-of-war with your ButtFucking Friend until he's ripped apart.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.700
When double jungling, you should keep both smites to secure the Dragon every 6 minutes to swim in a gold bath with your team.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:40.100
If Spiderman's bitch is already engaging the Dragon, just laugh at her non-stop until your partner arrives to steal it and squash that bug to thank her for her hard work.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.900
If the enemies are trying to take Baron, grab their jungler to the other side of the wall and kill him to remove any potential Baron killer on the other team.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.950
Then, The Jumbo Combo Terror should take a shortcut to the pit and use a Double Smite to steal it.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.500
The only thing left to do is to wipe out the opposite team to put them in an state of despair.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.400
That's it for today, people!

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.980
Don't forget to check out my channel for more boring League of Legends videos.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.600
Feel free to leave a comment in any language you want, but I'll only answer those in English and in French because I'm a racist fuckabish.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.000
Ciaossu!
