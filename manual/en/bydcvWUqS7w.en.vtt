So Sulphur Springs, Texas, has a total population of about 15,000.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.800
We know the people across the street. We know the people down the street.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.940
Real family-oriented. It just gives you that warm feel.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.280
I finished the Fire Academy and I currently work at Plano Fire Department.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.160
I've been there for about six and a half year now.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.000
Vivint comes through with this awesome promotion and at the time we had nothing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.800
I think we had two smoke detectors in the house. It's like yeah, sure, sounds great. Sign us up!

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.340
Everything was great. We got the system installed in April.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.560
And then in July I had been smelling plastic burning, like melting plastic.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.760
Well we had plugged up an old computer the night before and I thought it was the old computer so I unplugged it.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.580
I got the boys ready and we left the house.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.360
I got almost to my mom's–it's about 15 miles away–when Vivint's security system called.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.020
They told me that the smoke alarm was going off.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.780
And I told the lady, I said, "We just left there. There's no way there's a fire. I mean, it has to be a false alarm."

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.880
And she said, "Well, since you're 15 minutes away, we're going to go ahead and send the fire department out."

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.260
The neighbors actually, their kids were in the backyard, and had seen the fire coming out of our bedroom window.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.960
And by the time they ran through the house, and they got their parents, and their parents came outside

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.120
the fire department was here already putting out the fire.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.740
While all this is taking place, I'm an hour and a half away in Plano, working for my own fire department.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.900
Had the system not already alerted the fire department locally here in town,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.820
those guys would have been at least another 8 to 10 minutes, just on average.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.280
Had that happened, it would have vented into the attic.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.520
The fire just would have ran from end to end and the house would have been gone.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.280
It would have been nothing but a slab.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.840
So our rep that we had, I called him the next day and I I thanked him

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.260
because if he wouldn't have come to our door, I mean we would have lost everything we own. Everything.
