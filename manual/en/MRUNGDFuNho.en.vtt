Self Tanning Tips from London Fashion Week
the St Tropez Way

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.819
Roksanda Ilincic, Designer
Skin is beautiful.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:07.819
It’s super polished.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:08.819
It looks healthy.

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:09.819
It looks glowing.

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:14.839
It looks like the girls were basically taking
care of their bodies for the last six months

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:15.839
while I was designing.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.060
David Koma, Designer
Working with St. Tropez this season was quite

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.060
amazing.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.090
Michelle Feeney, CEO – PZ Cussons Beauty
At St. Tropez we’ve really worked very hard

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.540
on partnerships with designers that we believe
are the future.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.570
Nichola Joss, celebrity Self Tanning Expert
It’s all about the skin.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.680
I’m in love with the skin.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.181
Ellie Goulding
Skin is the foundation of everything with

00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:33.181
beauty and hair.

00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.920
If you haven’t got good skin, you have to
work on that first.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.980
Henry Holland, Designer
We’ve been working with St. Tropez now for

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.980
three seasons.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.730
You get to know more about the product, and
you know what you can achieve a bit better

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.470
and then sit down with Nichola and go through
what you want to achieve.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.160
They’ve always got new products coming out
as well, so it’s good to incorporate them.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.670
You can definitely achieve different looks
every season that we’ve been working with

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.670
them.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.670
So it’s been good.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.670
Nichola Joss, celebrity Skin Finishing Expert
We’re going to do a how-to.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.510
Here’s the step-by-step guide.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.510
First of all we’re going to do a base colour
of tan.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.240
We’re going to spray it on really lightly,
evening out skin tones and just giving that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.691
lovely undercurrent of a glow to the skin.

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.409
Now what we’re going to do is we’re going
to apply the illuminating products.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.409
We’ve got two.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.560
We’re going to use the Rose Illuminator
which we’ve had for a couple of seasons.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.789
It’s a pastel, light rose illuminator, but
it gives gentle illumination to the skin.

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.060
We’ve mixed it with a silver rose, which
is a ramped up dewiness.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.520
When we mix two of the products together,
we get that perfect sheen that we’re going

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520
to have on the skin.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.039
We’re going to do it right down the legs,
back and front, same with the arms and across

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.079
the shoulder blades, the collar bone.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.520
We’re really covering the skin.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.770
Everything that’s on show is going to be
illuminated.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.659
Karen Heras-Kelly, head of PR – PZ Cussons
Beauty

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.960
The inspiration for this show, for Erdem Spring/Summer
2012, is Chloe Sevigny.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.409
She is known for her beautiful, beautiful
skin and a very, very naturally polished look.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.369
Erdem, Designer
The girl is very much a continuation of our

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.709
girl from last season, but I think she’s
probably gone on holiday.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.569
She’s gone somewhere hot, which is where
St. Tropez comes in.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.290
We really worked on the polish of the skin
and the finish of it.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.569
She’s going to look really healthy with
a wonderful polish and a wonderful kind of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.569
refinement hopefully.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.200
Roksanda Ilincic, Designer
Obviously, I love using and incorporating

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.459
with St. Tropez beautiful products, which
we specially mixed for this season.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.950
David Koma, Designer
This season we wanted to do something very

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.439
focused and very directional.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.549
Working with St. Tropez this season it was
quite amazing because the product and the

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.180
concept linked so well.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.860
From the very first minute of the meeting,
we were excited and got a lot of ideas of

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.310
what kind of skin tone we wanted and kind
of dressing the skin in many different ways

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.310
and different layers.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.370
Nichola Joss, celebrity Skin Finishing Expert
The references are tribal inspiration.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.390
There’s lots of light.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.390
There’s lots of iridescence.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.159
We’re using a silver rose and really ramping
up the illumination.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.510
Because we’re shooting and there’s lots
of daylight here, you can see how it’s going

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.640
to look at home when you use the product.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.719
Michelle Feeney, CEO – PZ Cussons Beauty
Whether you’re going to a nightclub in Newcastle

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.620
or you happen to be at the Cannes Film Festival,
you should be able to go into Boots and buy

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.859
a product that makes you feel a million dollars.

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.220
Nichola Joss, celebrity Skin Finishing Expert
The girls at home can watch the shows, watch

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.190
the TV, see what’s on the catwalk and then
go to the shops and pick it up and do it themselves.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.190
It’s really fashionable.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.959
It’s modern and we’re a step forward.

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.920
It’s all about embracing the skin.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.209
If you’ve got really good skin, your clothing
looks immaculate.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.360
It’s easier to put on your make up.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.569
It’s all about the skin.
