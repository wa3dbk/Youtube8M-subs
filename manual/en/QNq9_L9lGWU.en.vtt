Patricia: Hi there. I’m Patricia, a former
homeschool teacher and mom, and I love kids.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.410
Don’t you? Thought so.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.849
Nothing is more important to the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.419
education of a young child than classical
storytelling. But so many of these tales we

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.999
know and love have such controversial themes
and messages. For example, did you know that

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:31.139
Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn uses the n-word over 30,000 times?

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.980
Here Johnny, try this one.
Johnny: Pap ran after him with a pitchfork

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.780
and shouted, "Get out of here you stupid ‘n...neighbor’."
Patricia: Sounds better, right?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.089
Thought so. Here at PC books we’ve taken
all of the childhood classics and altered

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.120
them so that they’re more politically correct.
Like this old tale.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.989
...and then the Prince kissed Sleeping
Beauty, and she slapped him, because he didn’t

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.859
ask for.
Kids: Consent!

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.390
Patricia: Doesn't that flow so much better? Thought so.
We are teaching our children to be culturally

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.640
sensitive and socially knowledgeable with
titles such as Where the Indigenous Things Are,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.720
The Oppressed Native American in the
Cupboard,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.460
Snow Caucasian and the 7 Little People, 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.420
and my own personal favorite, Bi-curious
George.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.080
Tommy: Ooh Ms. P, can we read To Kill A Mockingbird?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.520
Patricia: Oh, Tommy, don't you mean To Put Down a Mockingbird because it’s for the Best?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.380
Why not?
And, now that it's December, make sure

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.670
you check out our special holiday collection!
Timmy: Oh Ms. P! Can we read How The

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.370
Grinch Stole Christmas?
Patricia: Well, Timmy, The Grinch, he could’ve

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.690
stolen a lot of things: Christmas, Hanukkah,
even Diwali!

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.130
Kid: What about Kwanzaa?
Patricia: I’ve never heard of that.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.310
Patricia: My name is Patricia and here at PC Books I’ve made it my life's goal life to make sure our

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.120
children's literature is politically correct. My kids, they even call me PC Patty.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.580
Kids: We love PCP!
Patricia: Thought so.
