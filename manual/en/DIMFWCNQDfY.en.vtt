00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.809
Hi! I'm Jordan Pederson for Expert Village.
We'd like to talk a little bit about safety

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:18.090
on the trails with bears. One good thing that
you always want to remember is never sneak

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.060
upon a bear. Always make a lot of noise. Let
the bear know where you are. Give them a chance

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.990
to leave. There's 3 times when you're liable
to have problems with a bear, especially a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.420
grizzly. When you come around a corner or
you surprise a bear and you violate the distance.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.390
Every bear has a distance. What the distance
today may not be the same tomorrow. They're

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:58.820
much like people in that their moods change.
You have to accommodate them on their level.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:07.420
Another time is a mother with cubs. A mother
with cubs will protect those cubs at all cost,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.800
especially a grizzly bear. A female black
bear if possible in the right habitat will

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.520
send her cubs up a tree and will usually run
off to try and lure you away from them. Another

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.939
time when you could have problem with a grizzly
is on a carcass. They will what we call lay

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.430
up on carcass, one that they have either killed
or one that they have found. If you find a

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.729
carcass or what looks like a carcass, do not
walk over to it so see what it is. Just back

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.509
pedal and leave the area. Several people in
Yellow Stone have been hurt by going up to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:01.009
investigate a carcass. These are 3 things.
If you're on the trail a good thing to carry

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:10.100
with you in one of the pepper spray chemical
pressurized cylinders. These are available

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.420
in small size, in larger size, and then there's
another size larger than this one. They're

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.050
usually available in most of the large sporting
good store. This is a good thing to have.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.480
It's a good thing to have in your tent at
night. It's a good thing to carry on your

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:40.591
belt or to carry on the strap on your backpack.
Do not put it in the bottom of you pack. You

00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:46.540
just aim right at the face of the bear and
give it about 5 seconds.
