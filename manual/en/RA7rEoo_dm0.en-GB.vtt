00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.429
Round 2 of the FA Cup brought ex-City keeper
Steve Wilson to the KC Stadium.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.800
It wasn't to be a pleasant experience!

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200
Clips it in Facey with the flick on

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.250
it was
a good flick on. Comes out to France

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.200
and it's in the back of the net.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.600
And the Tigers have
the lead, Ryan France drills it home

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.000
well taken goal for the man filling the shoes of
Stuart Green this afternoon.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.300
Weaver

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.309
Welsh

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.600
he's got Barmby snapping at his heels, goes
forward

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.670
and it's given away and the Tigers

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.500
have it back with Elliott breaking forward Stuart Elliott

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
goes past one challenge, still

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Elliott. Shoots it goes to Facey. Oh Yes it's
2-0 to Hull City a goal made by Stuart Elliott

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.969
but converted by Delroy Facey and the Tigers
go 2 up and Stuart Elliott just skipped away

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.360
down the left there unleashed a bullet shot
at the goal Wilson couldn't hold it and Facey

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:28.149
mops up the spilled ball into the roof of
the net and City are 2 goals to the good.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.969
Facey did well came a long way to get that
one Barmby lays it across to Elliott then

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.799
Barmby goes into the penalty area Elliott
will have a run here Elliott shoots, oh it's

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:46.900
3-0. Stuart Elliott has got so much power
in that left foot but that was an awful piece

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.609
of goalkeeping you have to say from Steve
Wilson. But Elliott won't care about that,

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:58.569
it's 3-0 to Hull City and Macclesfield just
cannot live with Stuart Elliott down this

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.000
left flank.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500
Oh it's careless play and Ryan
France is alert to that one here's Ryan France

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.500
braking through sends it across to Facey against
Steve Wilson. Oh it's 4-0 and Delroy Facey

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.030
with an absolutely clinical finish and the
Tigers are surely in the hat for round 3 of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.290
the FA Cup now. Ryan France it was who made
the searching run through the middle, he switched

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.280
the play and Delroy Facey with a clinical
finish into the bottom left hand corner.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.879
It's Hull City 4 Macclesfield 0.
