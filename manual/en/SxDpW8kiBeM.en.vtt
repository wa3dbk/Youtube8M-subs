COOKIE MONSTER: [SINGING]

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.562
Me am what me am.

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:07.350
Me Cookie Monster.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.200
That all there is to it.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.610
Me love to eat cookie, sometimes
eat whole, sometimes

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.384
me chew it.

00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:26.560
Who care if me eat carrot
or collard greens?

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.030
Me also like broccoli, and
lettuce, and lima beans.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:41.180
Me still Cookie Monster,
that not a sham.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.190
Hey, me am what me am.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.300
Me am what me am!

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.620
Not Veggie Monster,
not one scintilla.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.629
Me love to eat cookie,
chocolatey

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.200
fudge, or lemon vanilla!

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:17.220
So what if me like okra,
eggplant or zucchini?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.073
So what if me munch mushroom,
pea pod or green bean?

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:35.600
Oh, life not worth a yam
'til me can say, hey!

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.640
Me am what me am!

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.770
ALL: [SINGING]

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.840
Belly breathe, gonna breathe
right through.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.312
Belly breathe, this
is how you do it.

00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:50.777
Belly, belly breathe.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.256
Belly breathe.

00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:54.228
Everybody breathe!

00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:58.172
We were counting and finding
the amount, and we

00:01:58.172 --> 00:01:59.651
counted up to five.

00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:03.595
One, two, three, four, five.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:04.088
GROVER: [SINGING]

00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:10.010
Of course, it is me, Super
Grover, with a [INAUDIBLE]!

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.260
Ha!
