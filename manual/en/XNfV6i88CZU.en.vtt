Hello,everyone.
This is  Asahi.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.540
Today, I'm gonna show you a free gift of ELLEgirl Japan January Issue and how to use it.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.800
A free gift of January issue is a cosmetic bag set.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.295
A cosmetic bag and REVLON's lipstick come with the regular edition.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.196
Big edition is a set of nails"Revlon" and a cosmetic bag"MILLY".

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.480
At first,I'm gonna show you 3 ways I use a lipstick in my beauty routine.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.000
1,You can use it as a lip pencil because of a type of crayon,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.338
Just follow your lip and fill your lip with it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.540
It's gonna be a beautiful line.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.537
2. I do this way when I don't have a mirror.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Hold the top of the lip just a little and move it from side to side.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.807
Color the inside of your lip.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.878
And then blend it with your finger.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.800
Or applying a gloss also looks cute.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.700
You don't need to worry about going out of your lip without mirror.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.000
It makes your lip soft even if you don't like vivid color. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.862
And I use it instead of a sharpener.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.356
And keep it sharp.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.965
3. I always use it with this way.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.482
Take it as a cream cheek.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.252
Apply it wherever you like and blend it with your finger.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.894
I usually bring only a lip for makeup.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.597
I can change color easily, so I recommend it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.774
Next, I'll show you how to make gradient nails with the 2 colors.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.763
Prepare some makeup sponge. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.452
Shapes have nothing to do with this way.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.700
Base coat is done.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.407
At first, apply a color for the base color, 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.020
It depends on the color how much you apply it.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.760
Next, apply the glitter nail polish on flat sponge.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.100
Painting the color is bigger than your nail.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.580
Color twice and don't dry quickly.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.684
And then, apply the red color along the glitter color.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.190
To make a beautiful gradient, color the red polish on the glitter one.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.497
And dab the sponge on your nail wherever you like.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.314
It's done!

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.820
If you're still not satisfied you can also do a second.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.760
Then, remove the excess polish with some nail polish remover.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.076
Apply the topcoat. This is a way to make a easy gradient.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.454
When you make a gradient, I think you need to apply it many time,.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.620
But you can do a gradient easily with this way.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.613
You can of course always start with one color,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.159
I hope you enjoy this video.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.475
Free gifts of ELLE GIRL are always gorgeous , so I'm looking forward to it.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.500

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.216

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
