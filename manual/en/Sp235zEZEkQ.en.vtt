Hi! I'm Beth Brown-Reinsel and I'm happy  

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.350
to be able to show technique on YouTube for you!

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.539
I'm going to show you the Invisible Cast-on
which is actually

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.850
a type of provisional cast-on.  Provisional
cast-ons are used when you want to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.670
knit in one direction for a while and
then pick up stitches from

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.890
the cast-on edge and knit in the other
direction.   This can be quite useful

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.090
sometimes.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.110
So this is one of 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.399
many ways to do a provisional cast-on.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.440
I start off with a slip-knot with

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.110
a contrast color yarn and my main color
yarn

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.050
which is the white yarn.  

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.149
And, I'm going to hold the waste yarn closer to my body

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.820
and the yarn that I want to keep for the
main color

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.790
will be further away over my forefinger.
I'm holding the arms as though I were

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.670
going to do the Long Tail method.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.540
And I want to tell you that there are
four steps to this cast-on

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.820
and it makes two stitches at a time and
I'm going to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.440
describe the needle movement, not the
yarn movement.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.170
After every step of the four steps,
bring your needle up

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.190
into... in between the two yarns

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.280
just for clarity until you really get
the idea 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.070
of this cast-on.  So,  I'm going to take my needle

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.110
and go over and behind the back yarn, 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.470
over and in front of the front yarn,  over

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.010
and behind the back yarn, and now under

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.990
the front yarn.  Again, over

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.299
and behind the back yarn, over and in
front of the front yarn,

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.590
over and behind the back yarn, 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.290
under the front yarn.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.780
Over, over, over, under.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.360
Over, over, over, under.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.400
Now, if you just put this down

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.590
you're going to lose your cast-on,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.480
so make sure that you keep the waste yarn wrapped around the  needle...

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.800
wrapped around the other yarn... so that
you don't lose those stitches

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.430
and immediately knit them with your main
color yarn.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.480
Don't let go of the slip-knot

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.560
or you might lose a stitch.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.020
Here's an example that I knitted, showing

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.510
this invisible cast-on.  I've knitted a few rows,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.920
and so you can see that if I want to
knit in the opposite direction now

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.120
I can just slip these stitches onto a
needle.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.560
Here's my slip knot. I'll just pull that
out, 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.830
and slip the stitches onto the needle.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.340
Now, one thing you want to realize is that
this particular cast on

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.660
twists every other stitch.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.739
Here you can see is a stitch and

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.420
note that this is the right side of the
stitch and this

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.950
is the left side of the stitch.  So

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.410
typically knitters work with the right
side of the stitch

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.459
in front of the needle.  Now if you work

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.840
the Combination Method, you have the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.099
left side of the stitch in front the
needle.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.050
So both ways are correct, it's just being
consistent,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.920
knowing your style.  The provisional
cast on causes every other stitch to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.890
be twisted,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.310
so you want to put all the stitches on
your needle

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.400
and then go through again

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.819
and make them all consistent

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.370
on the way that they are oriented on the 
needle.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.870
Here I've slipped some of the stitches

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.330
onto another needle from the holding
yarn from the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.620
Invisible Cast-on, and if you can see...

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.750
some of the stitches seem to be angled,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.569
 and that's because the left side

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.449
at this stitch is in front of the needle, rather than the right side of the stitch.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.869
this stitch is oriented

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:28.710
the way I normally knit, which is the
right side of the stitch in front of the needle, 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.099
so I'll just slip that off purl-wise.

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.169
The next stitch you can see that the
left side of this stitch

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.110
is in front of the needle and I'm going to
slip that

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.240
from the back so that that causes

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.240
the right side of the stitch to be in front now.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.339
The next one is normal for my way of
knitting

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:53.879
and again, the next stitch has the left-side of the stitch

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.009
in front of the needle, so I am  going to 
slip it over from the back.

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.521
