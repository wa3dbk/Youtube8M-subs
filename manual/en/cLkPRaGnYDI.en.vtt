Hiya, I thought I’d take a

00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:02.543
little time out just to quickly 

00:00:02.543 --> 00:00:04.259
do a little video blog. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.229
A little bit out of breath 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:06.395
because I’ve just had to go back

00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:08.065
and forth from Knights Park.

00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:10.315
Today is our second Open day

00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:14.090
and it is very busy at the minute. 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.358
I’m really enjoying the sort 

00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:17.036
of hustle and bustle of things.

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.939
I also did Top Tips sessions today

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.311
 which I’m really enjoying 

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.451
at the minute. 

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.649
I get nervous when I have say 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.361
specific...well not specific things

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.435
erm...Tips, I just get nervous 

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:32.450
talking sometimes. Anyway it’ll do,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.325
as we can have little walk 

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.846
through Knights Park back to, not Knights Park, Penrhyn Road!

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:38.317
back to the Main Reception.

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:41.307
So let’s go for a little bit of a wonder shall we.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.569
This is the back entrance;

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.440
let’s have a little look around.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:55.146
Walk slowly down the corridor, the many columns.

00:00:57.675 --> 00:00:58.517
I’ve walked into one of these

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:02.839
columns once...it wasn’t good.

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.696
I got hit in the shoulder by a door today; 

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:07.428
some lady kicked a door at me. 

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:09.405
But she didn’t mean it. 

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:14.167
Right...so we’ve got the library 

00:01:15.668 --> 00:01:25.682
then we’ve got the John Galsworthy.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.767
Continue to have a little a bit of a walk. 

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:33.053
If i start staggering round it’s mainly 

00:01:33.053 --> 00:01:36.090
because I may walk into people. 

00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:39.784
Hi, I'm doing a video blog!
(Gracia) Hi everybody!

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:42.867
Thats Gracia!

00:01:44.053 --> 00:01:48.266
Keep going, going....

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.885
Picton Room – nice food in there, 

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:51.890
Post Grads only apparently 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.192
and main reception. 

00:01:57.192 --> 00:02:02.728
The welcome desk, ASK Me Booth, KUSU.
