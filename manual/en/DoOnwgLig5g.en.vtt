00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.080
Hey, everyone!

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.340
Today I’m going to show you wire an electrical
outlet or install an electrical outlet.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.010
This is for my friend, Denise, and my friend,
Heather.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.630
They recently asked me to do this tutorial.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.480
So guess what, here it is.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.700
So I’ve got a special surprise for you at
the end.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.550
Stay tuned, and I hope you enjoy this.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.939
So let’s jump into it.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.820
Grab yourself a circuit analyzer or a receptacle
analyzer like this one here because it will

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.760
tell you whether or not your outlet is wired
the right way.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.810
So plug it into the outlet, and look at the
two lights that are yellow.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.440
That indicates that it is in fact wired correctly.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.940
Then go ahead and turn the electric off at
the panel of fuse box.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.940
Grab yourself your non-contact voltage sensor.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.110
Double-check the electric is off.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.300
And you can see how this outlet is wiggling.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.030
It’s a no-no. and I’m going to show how
to fix that next.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.780
So you can take the outlet cover off.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.940
And you see how the outlet moves back and
forth?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.070
Grab yourself or go out and buy some of these
plastic inserts, these plastic spacers.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.860
You can fold them over themselves, and then
put them down over the screws on the top and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.940
the bottom of your outlet screws that attach
the outlet to the electrical box.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.770
And what that’ll do is provide a spacer
so that the outlet will not wiggle.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.440
In this case, the box wiggles a little bit.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.960
Now if you have an outlet that has the tabs
painted over, you can score the tabs with

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.490
a utility knife.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.561
That way, the outlet will not tear the paint
off the wall.

00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:35.810
Again, double-check that the electric is off
with the voltage tester.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.940
Pull the outlet out with your hands using
the tabs.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.909
Then as you can see here, I want to show you
the insulation is stripped off too much from

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.300
these wires.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.979
The insulation, when it’s stripped off too
much, it exposes too much copper, and the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.729
copper wire could touch the electrical box,
creating an electrical problem.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:56.800
All right.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.090
So what you need to do first is unwire the
hotwires.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.990
Again, here I wanted to show you something.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.370
The wire loop isn’t properly looped, and
that’s dangerous because the hotwire could’ve

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.830
came off the terminal screw.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.360
Then undo the terminal screws that hold the
white neutral wires onto the outlets.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.360
There you go.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.740
And then the last thing you want to do is
unwire the ground wire.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.200
Again, just counter-clockwise, turn that screw,
and then pull the ground wire off the outlet.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.569
The next step is to choose the correct kind
of outlet.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.420
So in this case, I have a 15A outlet.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.380
I’m going to replace it with, you guessed
it, a 15A outlet.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.890
I chose to get a Pass &amp; Seymour 15A tamper-resistant
outlet.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.880
And these days, you should always buy a tamper-resistant
outlet, especially if you have kids.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.190
And a lot of local codes require it.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.290
So make sure you check your local code.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.330
Here you go.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.370
Here’s the outlet.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.510
There are the brass screws.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.370
Here’s the back of the outlet where you
can push the wires into it.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.720
And then you have your silver screws for your
neutral wires.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.489
And then your green ground screw.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.610
Now in this case, I wanted to show you there’s
a little strip gage on the side of the outlet.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.670
This is really handy because what you can
do is put your wires up against that strip

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.360
gage, and you can cut them to size or you
can strip the insulation off according to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.420
the gage.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.400
Once you do that for one wire, you can simply
just put the wire up against all the other

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.620
ones and strip off the appropriate amount
of insulation.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.190
So as you can see here, there you go.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:42.099
My neutral wire is appropriately sized, and
then I just cut both my hotwires to the same

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.610
size as my neutral wire.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.080
I wanted to show you this.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.530
Inside the electrical box, you have your ground
wires.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.550
They should all be pigtailed together and
then have another wire coming out of that

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.800
pigtail.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800
So there you go.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.060
There’s the wire nut, and there’s the
pigtail.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.240
Take some emery cloth and rub all the bare
copper wires with the emery cloth.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.830
That way you can be certain that you’re
going to get great electrical contact with

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.630
the bare copper wires, and that you’re going
to have a really good contact with your outlet.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.409
So wire up the ground wire first to the green
terminal screw.

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.859
Make sure it’s looped around clockwise.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.050
Then tighten down that green terminal screw.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.740
The next wires that I like to wire up are
the neutral wires, and they go with the silver

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.830
terminal screws.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.249
So loosen the terminal screws by turning them
counter-clockwise.

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:42.990
And in this case, for this Pass &amp; Seymour
outlet, I just pushed the wires into the slots

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.990
at the back.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.270
And I hold the wires down with one hand while
I tighten down the silver terminal screws

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.349
with my screwdriver.

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.630
Make sure those terminal screws are really,
really tight if you’re not going to loop

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.039
them around the terminal screws, okay?

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.520
You can see there’s barely any copper wire
showing.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.159
I do this exact same thing for the black hot
wires.

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.330
They go with the brass screws.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.249
So push them into the back of the outlet,
and then tighten down the brass screws.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.559
All right.

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:24.650
Make sure again those terminal screws are
super, super tight with your screwdriver.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.370
Then the last thing that I do—well, almost
the last thing—is I take my vacuum, and

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.080
I suck up any of the debris that’s in the
electrical box just to make sure that it’s

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.080
safe.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.169
Push all the wires into the box.

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.180
Plug your receptacle analyzer into the outlet.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.180
Turn the power on.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.520
Be careful—do not touch bare wires.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.319
And double-check that your outlet’s wired
correctly.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:46.659
In this case, it is.

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.119
It’s indicated by the two yellow lights.

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:54.099
Screw the electrical outlet to the electrical
box with the two screws that came with the

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.099
outlets.

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.099
There you go.

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.099
The outlet doesn’t move.

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.069
And then you can put the cover plate on.

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.889
Do not over-tighten the screw to the cover
plate because the cover plate will break.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.649
There you go.

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:08.349
That’s how you install an electrical outlet.

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:09.349
Really simple.

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.949
Follow all the basic tips that I have in this
tutorial, and you should be good to go.

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:15.680
