00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.180
Hi. I'm Frank Simpson for OP/TECH USA.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.220
I'm here today to tell you about the
Sling Strap Adaptor System Connector.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.180
The Sling Strap Adaptor allows you to
convert your existing OP/TECH USA camera (strap)

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.579
to an over-the-shoulder, sling-style
strap.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.730
The camera's looped over the left
shoulder and hangs at your side.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.790
The camera hangs from the strap
connection point

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.200
which is designed to support the weight
of the camera.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.400
This also keeps the tripod socket available

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.200
if you should need to use it.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.500
The Sling Strap Adaptor makes use of OP/TECH USA's exclusive Uni-Loop Connectors.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.600
For most cameras, you will only need to use 
one Uni-Loop Connector.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.200
For cameras with two connection points
on the same side,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.329
or for cameras using a battery grip, both
Uni-Loops will be used.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.370
If you use a quick release plate on your
camera,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.600
it may have an additional strap
connection area

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.420
where you can attach to the 
second Uni-Loop Connector as well.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.450
Now it is important when putting the Uni-Loops on your equipment that you put

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.930
the male quick disconnect

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.940
on the right-hand side as you're holding
your gear for use.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.090
This will assure that when you move your
equipment from one strap to another that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.460
it will match up correctly.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.110
Simply thread the loop of webbing
through your gear's connection area.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.450
Sometimes this is facilitated by using a
loop of thread

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.500
or fine wire through the connection area to grasp the loop.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.430
Then place the quick disconnect through the loop,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.600
and pull it snug to tighten the slipknot.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.510
The Uni-Loop is small enough that it can remain on your gear

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.200
even when a strap is not attached to
it.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.380
To put the Sling Strap Adaptor onto your strap pad

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.600
begin by releasing the quick disconnects

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.729
and placing the existing system connectors aside.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.290
Snap the Sling Strap Adaptor onto
the pad,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.400
making sure that there are no twists in
it.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.220
It should form a smooth, continuous loop.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.000
Snap the quick disconnect on the
Uni-Loop onto the Sling Strap Adaptor.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.750
The length of the sling can be adjusted by

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.390
sliding the tri-glide into the desired
position.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.019
There's a second tri-glide that that can be
placed to act as a stop for the camera

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.470
in its down position.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.200
It may take a bit of experimenting to find
the length and stop position that's best for you,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.260
but once you do you'll be able to enjoy
many years of comfortable photography.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.010
There are a couple of options for making
the double sling longer for anyone who

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.279
might prefer to do so.

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:33.099
By using OP/TECH USA's Extension System Connectors

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.950
you can add 7.5 to 11 inches of length 
to the sling.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.000
By simply adding the Extension Connector to the back side of the Sling Strap Adaptor,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.890
you make a larger loop.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.200
Another idea is to use the extension to
create a short tether between the sling

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.400
and the Uni-Loop connector on the camera.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.200
Some people like this configuration as it can be a little less restrictive.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.500
Here's a little tip for those who might
want to be shooting with

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.660
a larger camera and lens configuration

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.020
and would like just a little more peace
of mind when using a sling strap.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.230
By adding an OP/TECH USA Extension System Connector

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.100
you can fasten the Uni-Loop connector 
on the camera's left side to the sling.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.810
While this extension won't normally be
carrying the camera's weight,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.600
it can be just that extra little bit of
assurance.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.120
The quick disconnect that is fastened to the extension glides up and down the sling as usual

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.000
and the extension hangs out of your way
while shooting.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.270
For even more security consider adding OP/TECH USA's exclusive Secure-Its.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.600
These handy touch fastener tabs wrap
right around the quick disconnects.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.430
Now there's really no reason to fear the
connector coming unfastened before you

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.570
are ready for it to!

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.320
Remember that the Uni-Loop connectors
allow you to move your gear to other

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.150
wrist straps

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.570
neck straps and harnesses quickly and
easily.
