00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.460
Students today are creating a diverse range of
projects that demonstrate their

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.479
knowledge but they're still being
assessed and tested in the old ways

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:17.429
we really needed an alternative and
ePortfolios have provided a comprehensive

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:24.429
evidence-based way to assess their learning.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.779
And the ePortfolio is a more holistic type
assessment for students.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.199
It really gets them to understand that
we're not just looking at their test

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.359
scores we're not just looking at their writing ability on one paper

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.979
we're looking at change over time and
growth over time and that's really what

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.500
we're aiming for in this program.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.739
It was really great to have this medium

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.940
to visually represent my body of work. I
really am expressive I like

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.910
utilizing that creative outlet

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.340
so I thought that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.220
using this website, this ePortfolio, it
provided me with the canvas to really

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.520
kind of paint my story.
(Stephanie): I think one of the nice things about eFolio is that

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.420
it's not stagnant.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.590
It's always growing and always progressing

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.370
along with whatever you're doing. And it
can always be changed and modified to

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.320
fit

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.440
what it is you're looking for in your
life.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.530
I think the eFolio would be valuable to students

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.150
and um...

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.560
Just like it helped me build up
confidence

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.940
it would also help other students
build up confidence as well.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.780
It allows them to see their own growth and
i've had students comment, "Wow

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.040
my paper when I wrote it in the very
first course was terrible and now I see

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.900
that I've changed, I see that I'm improving, I see that my

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.619
level of skill is going to up." And I think that

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.799
for students is a really powerful
indicator of, of authentic learning.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.690
I know I wanted to be a part of public health but I did not know

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.200
exactly what I wanted to do.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.850
So it helped me think and really organize my thoughts... this is who I want to be, this is what I want to do..

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.570
and it just really helped me

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.950
just decide what I wanted to do in the future.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.020
Students are taking courses all over the University, not just environmental

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.420
studies but geography, social science,
biology, chemistry

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.640
and the eFolio is a way for them to
bring that information together in one

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.560
piece and sort of then reflect on it and say what are the linkages here.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.259
The eFolio really forces them in a way to kind of
do that reflection

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:25.540
but uh... we find that for a lot of our
students they find it extremely helpful

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.049
and uh... helps them think about the value of
their education and the value of an

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.499
interdisciplinary education

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.729
how they will actually graduate with a
whole bunch of skills that

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.019
they can then apply to whatever career that they chose.

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.790
We have them built their professional philosophy page.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.129
By the end and I think that's one of the
strongest pieces, of the students

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.430
ePortfolio is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.119
who they want to be professionally.

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.769
So that's been a really great outcome.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.939
So for me creating

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.219
an ePortfolio was like taking the
next step

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.689
to becoming a professional, because

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.689
it helped me link what I had learned
with where I was going with what I learned.

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.549
The online identity we try to reach

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.879
students the difference between

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.109
an identity that they would have for
social networks as opposed to

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.909
educational or professional presence
online where it features their work and

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.139
experiences in their electronic portfolios.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.349
I didn't really know

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.429
what I wanted to do but now as a senior
I've done so many things

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:24.859
and I just feel ready

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.389
and the eFolio just really helped me
express myself in a professional way.

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.019
The first thing that we notice when we
transition from a paper-based portfolio

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.429
to the electronic portfolio is how
sharable it was. 
(Stephanie): I sent a link for my eFolio

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:41.289
along with my resume and I
encouraged them to look at it

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:45.240
and they responded very positively and
they said they were really impressed

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.019
it was very cutting edge that I was the only person

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.609
that had ever applied to their programs with
an eFolio

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:52.929
And

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:53.449
I got a job.
