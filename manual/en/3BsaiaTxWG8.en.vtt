00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.310
Chroming out the rear end.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.420
We’re going to take this stock VTX 1300C.
We’re going to add six parts to it and completely

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.789
chrome out the rear end.

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.549
We’re going to add a rear brake caliper
cover, rear shock tops, drive hub covers,

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.910
drive shaft cover, frame cover, and swing-arm
cover.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.090
Take a look. On the pipe side here’s what
it looked like before the caliper cover and

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.730
shock bolt covers. And this is what it transforms
into.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.379
And here’s a preview of the non-pipe side
before, and after.

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.251
So let’s get started transforming this caliper
cover as well as the shock bolt covers.

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:40.160
Here’s what the caliper cover looks like
stock. We’re going to take the KuryAkyn

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.510
piece, peel off the double-stick backing,
and we’re going to affix the caliper cover

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.370
to the caliper. And this is the finished product.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.219
The shock bolt covers are really simple as
well. You remove the stock shock bolt, you’re

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.550
going to affix the KuryAkyn cover, and replace
the bolt. It’s just that simple.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.609
And here we have the pipe side before those
two modifications and here it is after.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:08.830
Now let’s move up to the swing arm and the
swing arm pivot. This is what it looks like

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.570
stock. It’s really dark back inside there.
You add a couple pieces and boom, there it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.560
shines. It’s hard to see, but the swing
arm cover really looks good back behind the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.409
pipe. Take a look.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.250
With the absence of pipes on the other side,
the swing arm and drive shaft transformation

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.709
is awesome. Here’s what they looked like
before--we added a couple parts, and presto,

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:31.849
take a look at all that chrome.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:37.599
Let’s take another close-up look at the
before, and here is the after.

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:38.599
Gotta love it.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.219
Now let’s step away for a second and get
a distance perspective. Here’s what it looks

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.409
like from afar before and here’s what it
looks like after. Gotta love that chrome from

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.409
KuryAkyn.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.169
Here’s the pipe side before and the pipe
side after.

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:58.469
Moving back in on the pipe side. This is the
shock bolt and caliper before, and here it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.770
is after.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.139
Now, with all these pieces on the bike, this
is what it looks like sitting in the parking

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:05.139
lot.

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.429
But let’s see what it looks like out on
the road.

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.470
A special thanks to all the guys and gals
at KuryAkyn who make it possible for us to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.920
take more pride in our ride.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.170
Chroming out the rear end of just about any
metric motorcycle is possible via KuryAkyn.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.450
This particular build was done on a VTX 1300.
And here are the parts listed for the build.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.170
Thank you for watching this week’s Cruiser
Customizing tip of the week. Until next week,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.560
take care and ride safe.
