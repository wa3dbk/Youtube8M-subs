00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.460
we get a lot of videos actually from
students studying abroad to make the

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.319
case that their country's universities
are better than university in the u_s_

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.190
has had belgium eva canada we've had the
u_k_ will finally we get a video from a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.040
student is making the opposite cases
from will he's studying in the u_k_

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.330
right now and he makes the case that the
schools there are much easier than

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.529
schools in the u_s_ abacha's reviews on
the three years long

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.429
i mean given did you do dissertation at
the end of the provision of only eight

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.109
to ten thousand words long

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.050
coverage

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
anyways at the airport managing upon the
results

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.530
another point is that people need to be

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.510
six classes and your

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.340
they don't one of the semester system if
the terms of some sort of returns

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.550
the same classes for the four-year
embark on we have a lot more assessments

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.030
here there's maybe one or two research
papers and one of them

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.940
there's an exam of all and that's what
the whole entire year you need thirty

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.110
five percent

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.250
to path

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.880
carrying five percent

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.930
possible solution don't think there were
two sisters on

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.670
i mean i don't know if it's just the u
dot bye ma'am right

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.810
people don't refer cost

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.049
promising american who's standing in the
day right traveling abroad so i don't

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.670
know maybe that's is way up like you
don't take a jab at institutions in the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.990
u_k_ while saying that you know american
study a lot harder

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.710
it's interesting that he brings that up
because there is a sin tire documentary

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.160
called race to nowhere where they talk
about how there's too much pressure on

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.910
students in the united states right not
i've personally don't buy that out all i

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.960
don't think there's too much pressure in
terms of academics i think there's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.300
definitely too much pressure when it
comes to standardized testing

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.480
um... but you know their students who
complain about too many study hours too

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.830
many classes to take too many test too
many books to read

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.770
online on it so difficult why can i just
focus on living my dream in final and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.479
most passionate

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.190
it's the model that they're trying to go
after in in this particular school he's

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.340
going to in the u_k_ i don't know what
there

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.760
i guess objective is do you think this
is just some slacker school or do you

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.820
think it's just a different model the
more used to in the united states and it

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.590
could be a very successful model

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.080
uh... i'm not sure enforcing business
say which particular school this is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.180
possible that he's going to universities
that isn't as rigorous is like oxford or

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.689
can produce

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.689
they've been anyway oxfam kolkata it's
possible he is going to school it isn't

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.399
quite as rigorous um... he doesn't say
unfortunately uh... but capital of the

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:31.299
things like

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.099
isn't pennies in the middle studies like
this stuff is so is young and they could

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.749
be a fancy word to you about the threat
of unelected that the philosophy behind

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.810
the schools is definitely different in
different countries with a focus on

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.870
we're focused on cigarettes testing you
gotta get the grades

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.220
there they need thirty five percent the
past year we need sixty five or seventy

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.010
or something like that or more focus on
the numbers

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.839
well that's a sort of the general
education sort of liberal arts aspect

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.859
uh... but that's what i love about
getting his views from different

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.329
countries you get the car window into
those different worlds right after we

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.779
leave you see how different models could
work for students seen a lot

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.999
and definitely

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:13.379
the power of the pressure to do well on
standardized testing here in the u_s_

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.790
keeps kids in like this box where they
don't focus enough on their futures with

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.349
their passion about and would be really
wanted to

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.809
so maybe man

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.680
avoiding focusing on number so much to
be a really great thing

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.870
so um... and i i would love to get
another video from him to get a better

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.659
idea of what university he goes to and
why they use that kind of model um...

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.909
and of course perception is everything
maybe to him it's like the easiest thing

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.239
in the world into other since he can be
difficult no
