As animals go, humans are weird.

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.380
I mean, really weird. We're the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.300
only animals to drink milk beyond infancy,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.620
and we're the only animals to drink the milk of other animals.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.140
Which is pretty gross.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.600
So, why do we do it? And should we be doing it in the first place?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.130
Cow milk goes to produce all sorts of our foods; from clotted cream to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.200
cheese and yogurts. But cows have literally

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.890
changed our lives, and along with it our
very genes and our evolution.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.800
So to find out how, we've come to University of Bristol's Wyndhurst Farm.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.920
This is a Holstein-Fresian cow, and she can produce more milk

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.400
every year than any other dairy animal on the planet.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.000
That's 10,000 litres a year and that's 60,000 bowls of cereal!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.400
Adda-girl.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.780
But the only reason she can do that is because we made her that way

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.590
with selective breeding and evolution.  So first of all,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.600
let's find out what we mean by selective
breeding and head back to At-Bristol

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.800
So for us to understand selective breeding, we first need to think about evolution.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.300
Now, when it comes to evolution, I've always heard of the term 'survival of the fittest'.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.440
What do we mean by fittest? Is that just the strongest animal in a group?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.140
So, we would usually be talking about the animals which are best suited to their environment.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.500
Such as having a really good sense of smell so you can

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.800
smell a predator or sniff out a food source to enhance your survival. 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.160
So only the animals with those characteristics are the ones which will

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.800
go forward to be the future population.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.940
So that's what we mean by 'natural selection',

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.320
how is that a different on a dairy farm?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.640
The main difference would be that it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.730
human beings which are providing the selection pressures.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.620
So it's not the 'natural' selection that's going on, it's us doing the choosing for them?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.460
Yeah, exactly, so 'artificial' selection.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.049
So evolution by natural selection is an accumulation of lots of small changes

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.200
over a very long period of time.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.000
But with artificial selection, these changes
can happen much faster.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.760
David Barrett is professor of Bovine Medicine, Production and Reproduction at Bristol University

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.940
So how have these cows changed from

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.640
cows say forty or fifty years ago?

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.020
Well, essentially they've gotten a lot bigger. They eat more food

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.920
and they've just been developed to produce more and more milk.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.440
When I was a young boy at school, cows were much smaller than this,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.120
they probably weighed about 500 kilograms.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.000
these cows - in this herd - weigh somewhere around 700-750 kilograms.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.220
So because of selective breeding, cows are now 50% bigger than they were fifty years ago.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.340
We've learnt about our impact on cows.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.980
But how have cows changed out lives?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.580
About 10,000 years ago

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.750
we started domesticating wild animals, and a few thousand years after that,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.200
humans made a significant switch from
being hunter-gatherers, to becoming farmers.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.600
By growing crops and raising cattle, 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.840
our next meal no longer relied on what you caught that day.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.900
Instead, small communities began supporting one another

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.160
with agriculture and regular harvests.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.580
Young children produce an enzyme which helps

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.150
them to break down the lactose in their mother's milk.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.820
But as they mature, the gene for the enzyme is switched off,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.560
making milk essentially toxic to
humans.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.600
So if you're lactose intolerant, drinking
milk can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.540
But after a couple of thousand years, a
genetic mutation spread throughout Europe,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.920
which left the gene switched on.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.840
ninety percent of the population of northern Europe

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.270
now has the ability to digest lactose
and drink milk,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.020
but we remain the exception.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.900
65% of the human population including most of

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.300
China and India remain lactose
intolerant. But it still astounds me at

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.300
just how much agriculture and farming
has impacted our own genetic makeup.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.040
And even though we've controlled the
evolution of Daisy here,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.900
she's had a pretty big impact on us as
well.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.860

That's 10,000 litre of-ppppssshff hahahaha

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.000
Fine, I won't touch you there again, I get it.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.880
No, come back, you're the best cow!
