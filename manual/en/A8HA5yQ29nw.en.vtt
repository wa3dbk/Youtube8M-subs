00:00:01.203 --> 00:00:03.786
(gentle music)

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.720
- We're pleased to introduce new additions

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.802
to the preschool language
scales known as the PLS.

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:17.596
This exciting suite of tools
includes the popular PLS-5.

00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:19.900
It assesses the receptive and expressive

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.281
communication skills of children
ages birth through seven.

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:26.480
Included are new items
for early play behaviors,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.331
early school language skills,

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:31.245
literacy skills, and theory of mind.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:34.030
Additionally, growth
scale values are available

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.470
to help you track the development

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.422
of early communication behaviors.

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:39.870
You'll be pleased to know
that the manipulatives

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.900
have been updated so that most of them

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.138
are plastic that's easily cleaned.

00:00:44.138 --> 00:00:47.730
Use PLS-5 Spanish to
streamline your assessment

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.816
of monolingual and bilingual
Spanish-speaking children.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.070
It yields a dual language score

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.730
for auditory comprehension,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.986
expressive communication,
and total language scores.

00:00:57.986 --> 00:01:00.400
If you already use the English edition,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.970
you can use the same manipulatives

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.923
for the Spanish administration.

00:01:03.923 --> 00:01:07.253
New for 2012 are the PLS-5 Screening Test

00:01:07.253 --> 00:01:09.990
and the Screening Test, Spanish.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.930
They provide a snapshot of six emerging

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.090
speech and language skills.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.140
As a result, you can
identify young children

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.773
at risk for a language disorder
in just five to 10 minutes.

00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:21.370
No manipulatives are needed

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.453
for children ages three to seven.

00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:25.343
When testing infants and toddlers,

00:01:25.343 --> 00:01:27.440
you can simply use toys and objects

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.701
found within that
child's play environment.

00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:32.210
As you might imagine, these new additions

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.840
of PLS instruments are based

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.573
on evolving best practices in assessment.

00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:39.821
Also, take into account is
the changing U.S. population,

00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:42.640
and most importantly,
improvements recommended

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.630
by clinicians like you.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.323
