00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.170
With our new notes on the D string, we can
now play a new melody (a hymnal called "Amazing

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.280
Grace". So, with this in mind we want to consider
that the songs we've played before have been

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:25.289
in common time, or 4/4. "Mary Had a Little
Lamb". 1,2,3,4, etc. It was in 4. So was "Yankee

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:34.040
Doodle". 1,2,3,4, etc.. That's how the measures
are broken up. "Amazing Grace" is a song that's

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:44.070
in 3/4 time (3 beats per measure). So we count
1,2,3, 1,2,3, etc.. and we start on a pickup

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.840
note. We actually start on the third beat.
So you would count (1,2,3,1,2) D, G, 2. B,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:06.039
B,2. A,G,2. D, D, 2. Notice that? Okay, our
first three notes are open. It's D and G.

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:12.590
D is a quarter note as a pickup. Our downbeat
on one then, is G. We hold that for two beats.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:27.450
G, 2. Then on the third beat we play B. So.
 . 1,2,3,1,2 (Sings out the notes). Let's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.479
stop right there for a second. Let's think
about that. Our strings seem to be ringing

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:46.319
a lot. We can use our fingers to barely touch
the string, to mute it between. So, D, G,2,

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:56.979
B, B,2,A,G, etc. Notice how I use my finger
to barely touch the string to mute it (sings

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:22.719
out the notes).
