00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.020
You’re the show I love and you air today

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.820
You’re my favorite of all Anime

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520
And as I sit down the opening song plays

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.140
Then my heart is filled with such dismay

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.709
The show was great last week. 

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:26.600
Now something isn’t right!

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.100
Why are they having tea?

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.220
Weren’t they about to fight?

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.580
The sinking feeling in my stomach
is upleasant but familiar

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.060
It has me screaming, no no no

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440
I hate this f**king Filler

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.080
I think its time we had a talk 
about these Filler episodes

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.900
I’m tired of flashbacks that recap 
things from half a scene ago

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.060
follow the ninja ostrich up the hill 
and down the rabbit hole

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.620
I know the manga’s lagging 
but you're acting like a troll

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.060
and I don't have to deal with this  
the world is full of other shows

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.280
anime that won’t waste my time
 with pointless Filler episodes

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and one episode might be fine
 but this here is a Filler arc

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.940
and now that it's a Filler year

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.420
I think we need some time apart

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.040
Before we carry on think we should reminisce

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.600
About those summer days when I was six

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.920
My cousin Annalynn was over for a week

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.160
and it was her idea we head down to the beach

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.060
Our cute new bathing suits
called fourth a giant squid

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.001
who had a thing for girls who like to swim

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.940
Then we were rescued by my evil twin

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.560
who was there to kidnap Annalynn!!

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.611
She shouldn't have to deal with this 
there’s enough problems in her life

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.179
When someone messes with my friends.
that somebody had best think twice

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.460
cause I have got a laser gun 
I’ll have to upgrade eighty times

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.880
and also I hate Filler

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.780
This line is just here because it rhymes

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.740
La la la la la la la la la la la

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.220
La la la la la la la la la la la

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.040
I think its time we had a talk 
about these Filler episodes

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.740
I’m tired of flashbacks that recap 
things from half a scene ago

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.110
I love you but you’re such a tease 
you promised answers and then chose 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.230
to have him charge his power up
for six more Filler episodes

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.960
and I don't have to deal with this  
the world is full of other shows

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.780
other shows that won’t waste my time 
with pointless Filler episodes

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.940
Follow the ninja ostrich up the hill 
and down the rabbit hole

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.900
I've had my fill of Filler 
think it's time for me to let you go

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.840
follow the ninja ostrich up the hill 
and down the rabbit hole

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.180
I've had my fill of Filler 
think it's time for me to let you go
