00:00:00.327 --> 00:00:02.697
- If I had my way, sir,
every fool who goes about

00:00:02.697 --> 00:00:04.981
saying, "Merry Christmas,"
should be boiled

00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:07.460
with his own pudding
and buried with a stake

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.839
of holly through his heart.

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:09.672
He should.
- [Fred] Uncle!

00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:12.428
- Nephew, you keep Christmas your way,

00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:14.390
and let me keep it in mine.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.740
- Ah, that Ebenezer Scrooge is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.487
the quintessential Christmas crank.

00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:18.767
- Ah, bah humbug.

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:21.075
Maybe he was just suffering
from a little something called

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:24.158
Post Traumatic Embitterment Disorder.

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:28.002
(funky music)

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:29.991
- [Robert] Let's take a close look

00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:31.617
at Ebenezer Scrooge's file.

00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:34.920
Subject is a miserly titan
of the money lending industry

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.974
who is visited by multiple
ghosts on the eve of Christmas,

00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:42.234
including ghosts from the
past, present, and future.

00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:43.229
- [Julie] TO say that Scrooge is bitter

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.694
is an understatement,
and this is perhaps why.

00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:47.393
Scrooge's mother died in childbirth,

00:00:47.393 --> 00:00:48.846
he was abandoned by his father,

00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:51.275
he soured an engagement
to a woman he loved,

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:53.986
and every Christmas Eve,
the anniversary of the death

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.603
of his only friend Jacob Marley,

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:57.411
he's reminded of all of his losses

00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:59.512
and his deep sense of loneliness.

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:00.914
- [Robert] This, it would
seem, would qualify him

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:04.145
as suffering from Post
Traumatic Embitterment Disorder.

00:01:04.145 --> 00:01:06.328
In a 2003 paper published in Psychotherapy

00:01:06.328 --> 00:01:09.265
and Psychosomatics,
psychiatrist Dr. Michael Linden

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:13.581
compared PTED to Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder, or PTSD.

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:17.076
Except those with PTSD suffer
intense fear and anxiety

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.476
after experiencing a
life-threatening event.

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:21.029
- [Julie] He noted that those with PTED

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:22.341
were mentally healthy people

00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:25.367
until a triggering event
shattered their basic beliefs

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:28.221
and caused them to cast
away their core values.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.797
- [Robert] According to
Linden, the core criteria

00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:32.142
of PTED are as follows.

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.588
Number one, a single
exceptional negative life event

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:37.770
precipitates the onset of the illness.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.692
Number two, the present
negative state developed

00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:41.885
in the direct context of this event.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:43.315
- [Julie] Three, the emotional response

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:45.142
is embitterment and feelings of injustice.

00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:47.573
Four, repeated intrusive
memories of the event.

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.990
Five, emotional modulation is unimpaired.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.141
Patients can even smile when
engaged in thoughts of revenge.

00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:55.946
And six, no obvious other mental disorders

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:57.559
can explain the reaction.

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:59.115
- [Robert] So how did our
subject pull himself out

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:01.696
of this debilitating PTED funk?

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.280
Why, psychotherapy of course,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.686
in the form of the three
ghosts of Christmas.

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:07.181
The Ghost of Christmas Past,

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.583
the Ghost of Christmas Present,

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:11.082
and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.

00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:12.472
- [Julie] Clinical and
forensic psychologist

00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:14.837
Dr. Steven Diamond posits that the ghosts

00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:17.328
could be a manifestation
of Scrooge's unconscious,

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:19.270
effectively ushering him through a kind

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.099
of psychotherapy boot camp.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.661
- [Robert] And they really
put him through the paces.

00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:24.774
Scrooge sees the errors in his past,

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.685
how he allowed his love
for money and power

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:28.750
to eclipse his love for his fiance.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.985
He observes the present,
one featuring Cratchit's

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:33.341
sickly son Tiny Tim,
who is in desperate need

00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:35.919
of medical care that the
family cannot afford.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:36.987
- [Julie] And here's the kicker.

00:02:36.987 --> 00:02:38.502
He gets a preview of the future,

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:40.502
one where little Tiny Tim dies,

00:02:40.502 --> 00:02:43.936
and Scrooge's own lonely death
crowns the hollow achievement

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:45.784
of a fortune amassed.

00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:47.218
- [Robert] Sure a few ghosts of the mind

00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:49.047
can walk you on a path to redemption,

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:50.266
but it may have taken Scrooge

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.403
hitting rock bottom emotionally
to have that epiphany

00:02:53.403 --> 00:02:56.380
that his time on Earth wasn't
about amassing a fortune,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.899
but rather about contributing
to the great good.

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.440
- [Julie] But maybe it's just
that Scrooge hit rock bottom.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.835
John Skalski and Brigham Young University

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:05.270
psychology professor Sam Hardy

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.241
conducted a study of
14 people who underwent

00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.000
important life changes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.731
The parallels they found with
the participants and Scrooge

00:03:11.731 --> 00:03:14.698
was that they had all hit
rock bottom in their lives.

00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:16.921
They couldn't experience profound, sudden,

00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:18.326
and lasting change without

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:20.529
having the rug pulled out from under them,

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.190
either emotionally,
physically, or economically.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.561
- [Robert] Of course, another
explanation for Scrooge's

00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:26.289
change of heart is that
someone maybe have just

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.782
spiked his gruel.

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:29.114

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:36.305
- Is a Christmas Carol
actually a psychedelic journey

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:37.343
into the great beyond?

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:39.402
Did Ebenezer Scrooge take DMT?

00:03:39.402 --> 00:03:40.235
- Hello, human.

00:03:40.235 --> 00:03:42.045
Did you know that snowflakes are tiny,

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:44.634
condensed of ice cyrstals,
and they could be

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:46.677
a clue to galaxy formation.

00:03:46.677 --> 00:03:51.591
♫ It's the most wonderful time of the year

00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:54.091
♫ for sexism.
