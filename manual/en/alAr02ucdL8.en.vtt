00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.360
Hello! Today we'll deal with a common problem:

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.250
The scooter doesn't stop well any longer, because the brake pads are worn down! 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.350
No problem. I'll show you how you can easily change them! 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.270
First of all, I remove these 5 nuts from the rim. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.010
The brake pads sit here right under the brake drum.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:35.190
We use a flat head screwdriver

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.420
to remove the dust cover.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.160
We insert the screwdriver here and simply lever it out.

We use pliers to remove this splint. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.180
The splint prevents the nut from opening. 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:12.020
We need a 22mm socket now to loosen the nut in the middle. 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:23.070
As soon as the castle nut is opened, we can remove the brake drum.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.000
The brake pads sit right here. They press against the brake drum and make your scooter loose speed.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.170
We demount it 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.190
and remove the clip by simply pulling it out.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:51.250
Then we lever out the first brake pad...  

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.350
...and the second one.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.060
Now we can remove the pads.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:11.250
We mount the new pads in the same way that we removed the old ones. 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.350
Then we attach the spring.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:37.060
As soon as you have installed the first pad, you insert the screwdriver below the second one. 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.060
and lever it in. 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.060
Now you can reattach the clip. 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.060
The new brake pads are mounted, now we reassemble the whole thing.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.060
First of all the brake drum

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.060
Tight!

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.060
Loosen the nuts and remove the mounting tool. 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:24.060
We use a new splint of course.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.060
Bend apart its two ends. 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.060
Then the dust cover.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.060
That was all. You see, quick and easy! 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.060
You find all parts that you need in the descriptionten of the video.
