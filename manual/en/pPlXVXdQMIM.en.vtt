00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:36.733
Captain's log: Guybrush Threepwood. Lost at sea for days now. I have no crew or navigational instruments. No provisions except a half-eaten corn-dog and, unless I find water soon, I'm surely done for. Only the hope of finding my love, Elaine, keeps me going.

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:53.133
My quest for the fabulous treasure called Big Whoop has left me in this sorry state. I thought it would bring me fame and glory. Instead, it delivered me into the clutches of my enemy, the zombie-pirate LeChuck. I had thwarted his evil plot to marry Elaine and he was after revenge.

00:01:54.267 --> 00:02:02.233
&lt;Cough&gt; Really, really thirsty now. If only I could have a small drink of fresh water, I might have the strength to sail on.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:05.800
Oh, but I know there's nothing but ocean for miles and miles...

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:16.067
If I could reach land, I might find water and some food. Fruit, maybe...something to fight off the scurvy and help me get my strength back. Mmmmmm...maybe some bananas...

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:24.467
Oh, why do I torture myself like this? I might as well wish for some chicken and a big mug of grog for all the good it will do me.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:36.800
Oh, sweet Elaine...am I cursed to starve here on this ocean...without seeing your face just one more time? Am I--

Incoming! Aaaaaaah!

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:04.200
How many times do I have to tell you, LeChuck? I just don't feel that way about you.

00:05:05.733 --> 00:05:06.633
Elaine!

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.700
By my congealed blood, you'll learn to love me! Sail with me and I'll make ya queen of the dead!

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.367
I...I can't. I'm washing my hair tonight.

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:32.467
Blast be yer hair, woman! Can't you see that this salty old sea-corpse pines for your every gentle caress?

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:41.967
You know...I don't think my father would approve of me dating the undead-

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:46.967
And you're probably too nice a zombie-pirate for me anyway--

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.800
...Let's just be friends instead.

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:54.633
Daaaaaaargh!

00:05:55.067 --> 00:06:04.733
(Breathy Sigh) Let's face it, LeChuck. You're an evil, foul-smelling, vile, codependent villain and that's just not what I'm looking in a romantic relationship right now.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.967
Darn yer riddles, ya saucy female!

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:11.633
What d'ya mean?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.533
Ahhh! Ohhh!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:24.467
You're a blood-thirsty monster who's already kidnapped me once, tortured my friends...and taken from me the only man I ever loved: Guybrush Threepwood.

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:29.700
Awwww...how romantic...

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.133
Ship Ahoy!

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:40.200
Threepwood?!!!

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.633
Fish him out!

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.200
Guybrush?

00:06:51.067 --> 00:07:01.533
Guybrush Threepwood! By my gangrenous gut, I don't know how you escaped my carnival of the damned, but you won't escape the taste of my blade!

00:07:03.733 --> 00:07:05.133
Daaaargh!

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:13.300
Ooooh. The lass has spirit! Eh.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:17.200
Throw him in the hold! I'll finish him after the battle.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.533
Turn loose the longboats.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:28.767
...and prepare the flaming voodoo cannon-ball!
