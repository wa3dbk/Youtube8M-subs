seventeen seven of his toward a friend's
titles

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.420
uh... because the u_s_ entitled the
agency has accused him

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.510
of that taking a legal drugs and as a
result he doesn't want to go through the

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.119
investigation and the trial and he just
says you know what i'm just gonna give

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.480
the south and move on that people who
loveless armstrong

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.679
are often arms over this they think that
he's been railroaded and he's got some

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.490
evidence on his side is there some
evidence against them

the told this is taken on my family and
my work for a foundation and on the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.820
leads me to wear and today finished with
this nonsense

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.200
let's go to the evidence and then we'll
see if uh... if uh...

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.620
weekend uh... give some credence for
like a i'm tired of in nuances for a

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.640
long cepastat drug tests during his
extraordinary runneth toward titles from

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.350
nineteen ninety nine to two thousand
five boxed up my score one for him

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.130
and now this is evidence against him he
walked away from the sport in twenty

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.980
eleven following a two year federal
criminal investigation of dumping

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.610
charges bliss federal criminal
investigation but they never

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.610
jacket convicted of the u_s_a_ d_a_
announced it had evidence armstrong use

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.130
banned substances and and that's that's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.509
and also said it had blood test and two
thousand nine

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.670
and twenty ten

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.720
that were fully consistent with blood
doping

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.740
okay nya that since the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.520
for a really bad against them

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.490
more evidence against armstrong emails
written by armstrong's former teammate

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.610
floyd landis

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.029
who was stripped of his

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:56.549
two thousand six tour de france title
after

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.990
that positive drug tests detailee
allegations of a complex doping program

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.830
on the team

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.210
alright that is pretty good

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.369
more evidence against last months trying

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.760
u_s_a_ d_a_ also said he had ten former
arm armstrong teammates ready to testify

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.040
against him

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.499
and suggesting they include landis in
tyler hamilton both of whom have

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.249
admitted tudo king offenses

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:27.249
are i'm ready for by uh... bird

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.260
uh... so

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.870
that has a big when you say that there
are strong supporters he survived cancer

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.510
i don't know what that has the with the
doping or not guilty

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.239
i know what it does it makes a
significant and i got it

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.280
and god bless anna and i love the strike
price i'm a little worried the some

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.689
people are not as they are naked donate
this cause about

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.739
it you know trying to help with cancer
because he might achieve

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.650
i think those two things are wholly
unrelated and of course you should help

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.359
his cause right now having said that
found a separate issue

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.879
look this guy's not know what he's not
like these dvds tire like i you know

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.489
what i'm gonna go sit on the beach
well-established

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.799
no is appropriately

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.939
you know strong guy i mean it is the
braces as late as strong right

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.749
and he has been fighting the sizzle he
wanted to give up a separate

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:19.369
championships

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.879
they got ten witnesses against them they
got the guys who were on the team saying

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.460
yeah we saw him do it

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.790
they have some blood tests

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.879
he's

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.119
not find it cuz he he'd lose

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.020
not guilty

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.870
i definitely get the sense that he's
guilty as well that i don't think that

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.150
that should lead people to dislike him
or stop supporting me and he's still is

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.569
an incredible athlete

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.219
especially considering the fact that he
overcame you know testicular cancer

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.489
i see is a survivor he's a fighter and
you know he didn't go on to

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.669
and be this tremendous athlete and he
did when the titles even though it seems

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.339
like you might've cheated uh... but
still i'd feel like

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:01.699
you cannot afford to be upset at the
same as the computers and just don't

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:02.699
care

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.849
cortez until in sports and feeling a
inactive exhilarated

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.279
frazzled can we keep it real i mean is
there a single office alignment and they

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:16.099
have found that is that massively on
steroids that isn't taking like a gallon

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:21.690
of steroids every hour on the our right
ok that let alone you know mark mcguire

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.470
with these exploding said said barry
bonds with his showing intake rediculous

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.960
bobble head right

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.419
and apparently invites lee

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.129
vic aldo

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.560
but they all do it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.740
okay they all did it millis armstrong
kick their ass

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.119
so i'm not

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:41.949
being judgmental misses like i hate
structure but this is not an emotional

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.219
thing for me ivy dot

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.389
adlai cannot i'd like to look at these
all these other guys that were helping i

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.340
would even to you is that

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.389
debate

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.259
that policy they showed me that there
was like seven guys that were in the

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.020
race that actually didn't go

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.050
according to believe that would be
showdown said so level playing field

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.860
knees guilty

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.520
but let him go

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.020
yeah actually i totally agree with that

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.419
uh... yeah i do we have processed on the
supreme court

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.110
i think so

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.610
i put this thing

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.020
would to fair

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.999
we're to reserve list hardly disagree
there's a certain element of yugo

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.719
involved i don't care how humble you are
as a person

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.559
you care about those titles and you care
about your legacy and your reputation

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.830
you're not going to walk away from any
investigation just because you're tired

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.569
of being investigated but you know
you're innocent right you want everyone

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.009
to know that you mentioned earlier one
those titles summit look look look you

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.030
tell me

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.840
but again it doesn't matter

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.550
is gonna say articulate take away by
seven times the thing that i work my

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.330
entire life

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.449
claim to fame

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.050
