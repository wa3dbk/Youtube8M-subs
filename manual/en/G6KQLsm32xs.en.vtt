00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.690
The Vulture Spider-Man villain

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.549
he's a Marvel Legend part of the "Fearsome
Foes" box set by Toy Biz included 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.310
Spider-man, the Rhino, the Lizard and
Carnage and what's unique is they made

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.150
this new sculpted action figure for a
box set and the only way to get it was a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.050
box set you couldn't buy it in a solo
card and they never solo card released it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.810
and it new sculpt on it and new sculpt
details so pretty unique that they did

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.579
that for a box set

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.320
he's a Spider-man villain

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.530
one of the earliest he started in
Amazing Spider-man number 2 other

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.239
then the Chameleon he was the second
super villain that Spider-man fought for

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.340
years Marvel has interpreted the
character with a younger version of the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.090
Vulture or other costume ideas but this
classic costume

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.110
this classic design has been a winner
and you just look at the wings a lot of

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.300
characters who have bird themes took the
wings idea so just Falcon and they use

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.660
these type of wings and other characters
from other companies as well you see a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:26.450
nice sculpting here on the neck area
here green costume is a body suit tells

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.660
you all you need to know sometimes that
the best designs are the simplest the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.530
wings look great in terms of posing even
from a Down view

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:46.850
or just wanted up one hand view great
character great detail

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.910
look at this guy because he is old

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:58.910
you can see he's like smiling thinking
of some evil plots

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.780
just a really really good action figure

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.150
the head sculpt is nice is a unique
sculpt up down side to side collar here

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.820
don't move is attached permanently glued
on the ball joints shoulders up and down

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.790
up and down side to side you know gets
hindered by the wings same thing has

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.660
bicep cuts does have one point of
articulation at the elbow

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.480
the wings are permanently attached the
wrists go in and out

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.610
same here wrists go in and out the four
fingers here

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.810
articulated it on the costume

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.910
one thing to notice is the articulation
of figure the joints are loose I'm

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.190
not sure if it's just my figure

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.990
maybe because has been a couple of years
the plastic got looser

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.750
or maybe it was just about that way and
the joints are pretty a week in terms of

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.330
that have something to notice up and
down

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:22.150
crunch side to side balljointed here side
to side up and down upper thigh

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.630
cuts it has double knees

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:40.080
has articulation here right where boot
top would be articulated feet up and

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.920
down

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:51.000
same thing feet up and down toes
articulated and might be tough to see

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.060
but all the body has lining down it like
like a little lines throughout sculpt

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.959
the body

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.410
that's because the Vultures comic book
interpretation his body has all these

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.000
separate little lines on it also want to
show you the wings notice how it has

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.010
shading all across the wings here
shading

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.359
look at that and you can see the
different layers and the sculpt the

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.200
wings

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.720
what's really nice is how to wings here
just really go out for a nice long bit

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.810
you see that looks really nice the
Fearsome Foes boxset goes for like

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.800
about a hundred dollars in the secondary
market if you wanted mint but you do

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.180
get five figures if you don't get a
classic Vulture a Rhino a Lizard and a

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.550
Carnage you get all those four figures

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.460
plus you get a a good Spider-man figure
as well that's five figures and I mean

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.940
figure out that be like twenty dollars
figure in terms of a box set but just

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.479
this Vulture figure a really nice Marvel
Legend the joints here or on my

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:15.450
figure at least loose in terms of the
articulation points but just overall

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.210
great look in action figure

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:26.160
definitely stands out on display and it
features classic Spider-man villain

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.260
can't go wrong with that

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.260
so thanks for watching and talk to you
later

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.550
Hey Vulture Spider-man's not here right
now would you settle for fighting his

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.030
clone
