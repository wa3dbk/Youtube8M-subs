00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.061
"Hi, my name is Marcus Milius.

00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:05.510
I play harmonica.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:12.000
I got a degree at the University of Southern
California, a Bachelor's of Music, in Jazz

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.179
Studies - Chromatic Harmonica.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.429
I play and teach harmonica here in New York
City, and I'm happy to show you what I do.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:30.769
Playing a 12 bar blues on a harmonica can
be as simple as just playing along with accompaniment

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.390
that is doing a 12 bar blues so as long as
you in the same key and you're playing in

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.180
the correct position, blues can still be played
in 2nd position which means you'll be playing

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.080
in the key of G on a C harmonica, and that's
also called a cross-harp.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.010
As long as you're playing in a cross-harp
or second position with the accompaniment

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.580
of a 12 bar blues, you'll be playing a 12
bar blues.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.280
The form is dictated by the accompaniment
and your participation could simply be improvisation

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:32.550
or on top of that, it would sound something
like this.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.510
So there are 8 bar blues, 16 bar blues, and
even three-two-bar form.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.530
And so what you want to do is learn to play
the roots for each chord just like you would

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.530
with as a bass player.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.139
The root is the lowest note of each chord
and so for instance in a 12 bar blues in the

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:59.439
key of G, the G chord, also known as the 1
chord, because there are 7 notes in a key

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.500
typically and 7 chords.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:11.070
The 1 chord in the key of G is a G chord so
you would play a G for the 1 chord and that

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.260
is two draw.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:25.780
And then you go up to the 4 chord which is
one blow, the 5 chord and one draw.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.060
And the 12 bar blues is 12 bars or measures
of 4 beats each that repeats over and over

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.790
again.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.310
Let us divide this into three lines.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.160
The first line being 4 bars of the 1 chord.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.320
Follow the progression playing roots, you
will want to play the 1 chord for 4 bars;

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.800
that's a two draw.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.960
The 4 chord for 2 bars; that's the one blow.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.640
The 1 chord again for 2 bars; that's a two
draw.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.950
The 5 chord which is one draw, 4 chord which
is one blow, and the 1 chord which is two

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.120
draw, and then the 5 chord will turn you around
back to the top that's a one draw.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.910
So it will sound like this.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:52.150
And 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.010
that's back to the top."
