00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.129
David: Texas Governor Rick Perry has declared
April 22nd to 24th, which just passed, the

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.990
Easter weekend, official days of prayer for
rain. He said, "I urge Texans of all faiths

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.070
and traditions to offer prayers on that day
for the healing of our land, the rebuilding

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.800
of our communities... the restoration of our
normal and robust way of life." This is as

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.730
a result of some of the natural wildfires
that they've been having because of the weather

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.619
there. And you know, my thought was shouldn't
he have called for this at the beginning of

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.160
monsoon season? It would've made the probability
of success, of apparent success, much higher.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.470
Louis: Or if they just prayed to not have
wildfires in the first place.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.550
David: That's right. You know, you would think
instead of just waiting until the fires start

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.190
and then praying for rain, what about just
if you know that the area is subject...

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.190
Louis: Is prone, yeah.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.710
David: Is prone to that, just have a regular
prayer that there are not wildfires. That

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.030
seems more... I'm more into prevention rather
than addressing the symptoms.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.030
Louis: Right.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.030
David: State-sanctioned prayer for rain, by
the way, isn't unprecedented. Officials in

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.469
Tom Green County inWest Texas declared an
official day of prayer for rain last Sunday,

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:15.710
Lubbock city officials did it in 2006, in
'07, Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue led a prayer

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.030
service for rain at the State Capitol, so...

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.140
You know, the thing is, how is this different
from the state of Texas calling in a shaman

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.840
or a witch doctor for rain? Is there any difference,
really?

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.659
Louis: I guess that depends on your faith.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.189
David: Well, that's the other question, if
it rains after the prayers, this is a call

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.070
for multi-... what was the word here? Of all
faiths and traditions.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.070
Louis: Who did it? Yeah.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.290
David: Does one religion get credit? Which
god gets credit for the rain if it rains?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.430
Louis: I wonder in Texas which one will get
credit.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.520
David: Yeah. It's hard to say.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.520
Louis: Is it?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.950
David: It's very hard to say. And the other
thing is honestly, ladies and gentlemen, these

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.069
prayers for things that are so specific really
strike me as incredibly pompous, because if

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:04.079
you believe God exists, OK, why do you think
he's paying attention to the day-to-day weather

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.080
pattern requests from people? In other words,
God created everything, he created the universe,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.430
he created all of these different...

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.470
Louis: Yeah, but Earth is the only place where
life exists and it's the focus of his attention.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.580
David: Oh, I see.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.580
Louis: Right.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.500
David: I see. And also, God favors certain
countries based on country-- imaginary lines

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.840
that were drawn in the last hundred years,
few hundred years, right?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840
Louis: Yeah. Of course.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.170
David: I mean, the guy creates the entire
universe from scratch, and he's getting involved

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.290
in Rick Perry's state's weather patterns.
It seems pompous to me to think that that's

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.910
the type of thing that God would get involved
in if he or she exists.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.470
Louis: I'm going to pray for a Bentley.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.890
David: You know, maybe Texans should be praying
for a governor that believes in climate change.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.570
[Laughter]

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.810
That might be a better use, if we're going
to open this door at all.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.730
Louis: Hey, there's got to be at least a handful
that are.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.680
David: Can you imagine if Barack Obama came
out and said he is declaring an official day

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.350
of prayer to help with the financial crisis?
Could you just imagine if that were... if

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.350
he did that?

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.681
Louis: I can't.

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:04.681
David: No.

00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:05.681
Louis: No.

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.230
David: And why not? Because he would be completely
grilled and destroyed.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.420
Louis: Yeah.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.940
David: But also because you can't imagine
him doing that, period, because he is, of

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.940
course...

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.940
Louis: It would just be out of character.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.451
David: Right, because he's a Muslim Native
American anarchist socialist Marxist...

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.970
Louis: Indonesian fascist...

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.170
David: [Laughs] Absolutely.
