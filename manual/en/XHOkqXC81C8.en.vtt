00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.000
This week on SciShow News, we’re talking
about things that have been lost, and things

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.250
that have been found.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.050
But you might find -- when you’re dealing
with the world -- things that are lost might

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.130
be lost forever.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.289
And things that have been found … well,
they’re not always exactly new.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.520
For example, one thing that we’re losing,
and fast?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520
Ice.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.929
We’ve talked many times before about how
some of the world’s biggest ice sheets are

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.760
shrinking, like those in Greenland and in
West Antarctica.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.050
But this week, researchers said that they’d
discovered a huge and sudden melt going on

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.500
where they’d never seen it before: the Southern
Antarctic Peninsula.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.150
While ice sheets in other nearby parts of
Antarctica have been losing mass as the climate

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.010
warms, the Southern Peninsula has stayed unusually
stable … at least, until 2009.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.329
That’s when, according to scientists from
the University of Bristol, the coastal glaciers

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.940
that feed the peninsula’s ice sheet suddenly
began to melt.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.940
Fast.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.969
Over the last five years, they say, the glaciers
there have released 300 trillion liters of

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.790
water into the ocean -- that’s a 3 followed
by 14 zeroes.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.040
This rapid melt was originally detected by
the CryoSat-2 satellite, which uses radar

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.179
to measure the thickness of Earth’s polar
ice.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.090
And its data showed that some of the glaciers
on the Southern Peninsula were thinning by

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.909
as much as 4 meters a year.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.070
The melt was then confirmed by another satellite,
called GRACE, which found that the peninsula

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.490
lost enough mass, in the form of ice, to actually
cause a measurable change in the region’s

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.490
gravitation.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.049
However, researchers say that this melting
doesn’t seem to be caused by the same factors

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.760
we’ve seen elsewhere, like a decrease in
snowfall, or a rise in air temperature.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.759
Instead, these glaciers are melting from underneath.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.299
Ice shelves that surround the glaciers used
to give them some protection from rising temperatures.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.450
But changes in wind patterns around Antarctica
have brought warm ocean currents right up

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.979
to the coast of the peninsula, and they’ve
been -- as the scientists put it -- “eating

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.490
away” at the ice.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.770
Eventually, the ice shelves got so thin that
they weren’t doing much shielding anymore,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.189
and the glaciers started to melt.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.230
So, considering that Antarctica is basically
hemorrhaging fresh water into the ocean as

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.110
we speak, the researchers say that Step One
in understanding this problem is to start

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.149
broadening our study of the polar ice caps
beyond just the biggest and most obvious problem

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.149
areas.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.930
Because, it turns out, we might be losing
more ice than we knew about.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.170
Alright, let’s go to the “Found” department,
because it’s time we welcome some new forms

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.959
of life into the scientific record.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.690
Every year around this time, the International
Institute for Species Exploration, based out

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.510
of the College of Environmental Science and
Forestry in New York, celebrates the birthday

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.080
of everyone’s favorite founding taxonomist,
Carl Linnaeus, by announcing the 10 most important,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.160
most endangered, or just plain weirdest new
species that have been discovered in the past

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160
year.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.389
For example, allow me to introduce you to
this Sulawesi fanged frog.

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.610
Yes, it is a frog with fangs -- or, more accurately,
two spikes that protrude from its jaw.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.139
But that’s not even the weirdest thing about
it -- it’s also the only known frog that

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.359
gives birth to tadpoles.

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.820
Most frogs lay eggs in the water, which are
then fertilized externally.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.690
But a handful of frogs are known to fertilize
their eggs internally -- and then lay fertilized

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.080
eggs, or give birth to tiny “froglets.”

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.820
But this new species, named L. larvaepartus,
takes the middle route, and gives birth to

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.730
live, but immature, tadpoles.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.730
How do we know?

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.630
Well, scientists in Indonesia got a clue when
a biologist picked up a specimen, and it suddenly

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.729
went into frog-labor and spurted out a bunch
of tadpoles into her hand.

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:16.850
Not amazing enough for you?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.780
Well then, what could’ve made this?

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.260
I’m not saying it’s aliens ….

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.202
...No, I mean I’m literally not saying it’s
aliens.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:27.510
But it did take 20 years or so for scientists
to figure out who was behind these strange,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.400
perfectly symmetrical formations on the sea
floor.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.410
Last year, biologists in Japan figured out
that they were the work of the white-spotted

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.410
pufferfish.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.040
Underwater photographers first identified
the weird formations in the mid-1990s, and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.850
after years of scouting around Japan’s Ryukyu
Islands, scientists discovered that male puffers

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.260
made these ornate patterns as nests to attract
mates.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.200
The puffers with the most fastidious nests
get the ladies, it seems, but the nests are

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.790
only used once, to spawn, and then they’re
abandoned.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.820
But the fancy circles aren’t just for show
-- scientists determined that male pufferfish

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.880
shimmy over the sand to create its ridges
and hollows, which protect the fertilized

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.430
eggs from ocean currents.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.190
And then there are the discoveries that remind
us that being new to science is by no means

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.410
the same thing as being quote, “discovered.”

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.600
Botanists came across this plant in the mountains
of southern Mexico, where locals have been

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.370
using it for centuries in their annual Christmas
displays.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.489
But scientists had no idea that it was its
own species until last year.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.590
It turns out to be a type of bromeliad,, a
mostly-tropical plant with stiff, colorful

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.590
leaves.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.600
The one that you probably most recently saw
was a pineapple.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.840
But this newly-discovered species only grows
on cliffs and rock faces in Mexican forests

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.000
between 1800 and 2100 meters in elevation.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.440
These bromeliads’ bright pink and green
leaves have made them favored by locals for

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.200
use in Christmas nativity scenes, so scientists
gave this unusual new plant the species name

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.400
“religiosa” or “religious,” in honor
of how it’s been used since wayyyy before

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.180
scientists knew it was a thing.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.180

of great stuff, and thank you for discovering
