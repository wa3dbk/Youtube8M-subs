00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.100
What's up guys?

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.519
This is Kevin from SnowboardProCamp.com.

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:07.210
In this video I've got a few tips for buying
snowboard boots.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.320
Boots are probably the most important piece
of snowboard equipment that you can own and

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.940
a bad pair of boot can really ruin your day
on the mountain.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.890
Hopefully these few tips will help you find
the right pair of boots for you.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.670
So the first thing you need to know when shopping
for boots is how to find the perfect fit.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.570
So when you're trying on a boot, do up the
laces fully and stand up in the boot.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.399
Your toes in the boot should actually be touching
the end of the liners.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.630
You don't want your toes to be too squished,
but you also don't want there to be any kind

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.039
of a gap.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.129
Because what's going to happen is that as
you ride the liner is going to pack out and

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.100
there is going to be more space created.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.350
So if you start out with your toes touching
after a few times of riding there gonna be

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.660
a gap created and then they'll fit perfect.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.050
The next thing you need to look for is what
type of lacing system you're going to get.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.519
There are three types of lacing systems.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.129
Traditional, cable and boa.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.320
Traditional laces are great they tie up like
regular laces do.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.930
If you break a lace it's east to replace.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.940
The down side to these laces are that if you
are not strong enough to tighten the laces

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.110
that could be a problem.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.880
The second type of lacing system is the cable
system.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.340
Cables are great because they are fast and
you can get your laces really tight.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.010
The only down side is that if you break a
cable, it's kind of a pain to replace.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.240
The boa lacing system has metal laces that
you tighten by turning a dial.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.280
Which are great because it fast and you can
get your laces super tight.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.820
With boa you want to make sure you have seperate
dials for the top and bottom sections of the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.820
boot.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.070
A lot of people like to have the bottom section
of laces a bit looser and the top section

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.159
of laces a bit tighter for comfort or performance.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.200
If the boa lacing system does break it can
also be a pain to replace.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.520
So decide which lacing system you're going
to get the most benefit from.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.520
The third thing you want to look for is the
flex of the boot.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.000
Snowboard boots come in all different flexes
from very soft to very stiff.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.800
Depending on what kind of riding you want
to do, will tell you what kind of stiffness

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.840
to get.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.120
If you want to do a lot of tricks and jibbing
and getting your snowboard positioned on all

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.300
kinds of different angles then you probably
want to get a softer boot.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.611
If you're into doing a lot of carving or racing
then you want to get a stiffer boot. this

00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:27.670
will give you more ankle support and more
responsiveness between your boot and snowboard.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.480
If you are into doing a bit of everything
on your snowboard, then check out a boot with

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.920
mid range flex.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.830
I hope that these tips will help you guys
find a great snowboard boot.
