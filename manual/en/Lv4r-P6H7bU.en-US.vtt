Alright so our subject is blood sugar and
this is a really popular one with all the

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.880
clients I talk to because I feel like with
I started in my practice 10 years ago when

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.939
I talk to people about their blood sugar they
may or may not have known what it was and

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:23.179
kind of like, oh my friend over their has
diabetes. And know I feel like everybody knows

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.279
somebody who is diabetic, you know its all
over the place. So blood sugars is something

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.079
that is really really concerning in most diets
regardless where you live, how old you are,

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.969
blood sugars a big issue. Know we do think
of blood sugar when it comes to diabetes and

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:48.460
basically what happens is when you eat carbohydrates
or sugar of any sort, that goes to your digestive

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.839
system pretty quickly. The moment it hits
your blood stream, it acts like no other nutrient

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.089
does. Proteins and fats, they kind of take
their time getting into your blood stream

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.720
but carbohydrates hit it immediately give
you an a immediate rise in blood sugar. Then

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.159
what happens is you get this signal sent to
your pancreas and your pancreas releases insulin.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.040
So insulin is a hormon. So its released, it
takes all that blood sugar and pushes it into

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.969
your cells where your cells then where your
cells use that blood sugar to do the things

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.310
they need to do... help give you energy, help
you focus when you're at work, all those things

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.329
that we can think of that carbohydrates do
that are good for us.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.870
However the problem is again we get too much.
We have diets that are way too high in sugar,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.570
way too high in refined carbs. Therefore,
our pancreas just kind of gets tired and its

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.210
not able to produce as much insulin as it
needs. Its not able to keep up and so what

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.770
happens is that blood sugar is stored as fat
in the body and eventually your panaceas just

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.880
start to not work at well as it should. Thats
when people start to go on insulin, thats

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.920
when you get the diagnosis of diabetes. So
its really important to know what your blood

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.840
sugar levels are, Kind of where you're at
and I know that there is a lot of people out

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.160
there who start to feel like I can do this,
I can live with diabetes and you can, but

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.970
the goal would be to not go on medication
for diabetes, that you can actually control

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.180
it with your diet and exercise, which you're
going to really get tired of hearing me say,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.840
that you can deal with it through diet and
exercise, but its true. And of course there

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.761
is the genetic factor and I'm going to talk
about that next, but when you look at it,

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:47.740
you really want to try to live a lifestyle
thats going to allow you to not put all your

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.210
money into maintaining your healthy with medication.
Instead taking that money and putting in a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.490
place thats going to help you be healthier,
its going to allow you to do your exercise,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.300
you can get access to exercise, access to
healthy food, supplements that you need. all

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.741
those things. Instead of putting all your
money at the pharmacy. So again, blood sugar

00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:14.880
a very important thing. Know your numbers
when it comes to that and know that you can

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.690
control it with diet and exercise.
