Hey guys,
Chef Mark here.

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:04.400
I'm gonna show you
how to make a very impressive

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.533
yet super easy
to prepare dish.

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.167
We're gonna make lamb racks.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:09.600
I'm gonna grab these guys here.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.267
It's our Australian lamb racks.

00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:14.400
We're very proud of 'em,
have a very nice clean flavor.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.500
We're gonna put a little crust
on the outside of 'em,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.967
they're gonna be great.

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:21.533
We're gonna build a flavor layer
between our lamb and our crisp crust,

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.900
so we're gonna use
this Basil Pesto sauce here.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.667
Imported straight from Italy,
it's got classic flavors

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.600
of basil, some pine nuts,
some Grana Padano cheese,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.933
and it's gonna offer
a nice green color to it

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:35.267
which'll look beautiful
when we go to slice it.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.800
Last thing I need to grab
is our panko breadcrumbs.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.367
It's a Japanese breadcrumb
which,

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:41.300
when we apply it
to the outside of the lamb,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.033
is gonna offer us a crisp
yet very light texture

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:45.233
on the outside of it.

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:47.667
Let's go put this thing together.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.167
All right, let's show you
how to put this

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:51.533
easy yet super impressive
dish together.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.333
First, I have my lamb rack here.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.567
What I'm gonna have you do
is we get started on a plate here.

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.067
We're gonna reserve that,
and I'm gonna season this

00:00:58.067 --> 00:00:59.633
with salt and pepper.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:03.100
And I season it
a little aggressively here, right?

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.267
Little salt,
some cracked black pepper.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.433
Right, and I like to get
both sides of that.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.233
And this is just about
all the prep

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:13.900
that you're gonna need
to do to the outside.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.567
We're gonna make
a little crust first.

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:19.367
Pretty easy to do,
and then what I'm gonna do

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:24.433
is I'm gonna take a cup
of our panko breadcrumbs,

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.533
and we're gonna do a tablespoon
of our basting oil.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.400
And this is gonna be
the outside crust for this.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.467
We're gonna flavor it a little bit.

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:35.500
The basting oil actually helps this
to brown nice and even as well.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.033
So tablespoon of that.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:38.533
And we're gonna mix this together.

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.400
This recipe here actually does enough
for two lamb racks.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.767
I'm gonna show you the one today.

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:47.767
So we mix that pretty well.

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:50.900
And then, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna take our lamb rack--

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.567
we can start on the backside--

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:54.700
and we're gonna take
three tablespoons.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.067
Reserve the three tablespoons
for the other.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:02:00.667
Three tablespoons of this,
and we're gonna actually spread this

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.967
on the outside of our lamb rack.

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:08.267
So again, like I mentioned before,
this is gonna be a nice flavor layer

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:11.367
between that and the panko
breadcrumbs.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:15.000
Gonna take the rest
of our panko breadcrumbs

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.200
and place it on here
after I put this sort of like a glue

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.400
on the outside
of our lamb rack.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.167
Okay?

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:26.467
Right there.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:28.167
And then what I'm gonna have you do,

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:30.300
take that plate that you had before

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.200
and place your panko breadcrumbs
out evenly on there.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.700
Then simply take this up like this

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.433
and place it
and press that down inside,

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:43.433
and what you're gonna have
is a nice even coating

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:45.367
of that panko breadcrumb,

00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:47.167
and you can even get
your hand on there

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.367
and place it on the top edge.

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:52.000
So you get a really nice coating
on the top,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.967
and then, it's gonna be
as simple as this.

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:57.467
You're gonna have an oven
heated up at 450 degrees.

00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:59.533
The oven stays constant
the whole time.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:01.733
About 20 minutes
for a medium temperature,

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:03.667
which is 130 degrees.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:06.500
I'm gonna pull it out of the oven
at 125,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.000
allowing for that last five degrees
of carryover as it sits and rests.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.967
All right, what I've done here
is I've pulled this out of the oven

00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:17.033
at 125 degrees,

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.033
and then we've
let it rest for ten minutes,

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:20.867
and that's what we have here.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.667
And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
place this on the cutting board,

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:26.033
'cause the meat's gonna relax
and the juices are gonna redistribute

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:28.933
to the outside,
so when I go to slice this,

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:31.067
and I'm gonna go
right in between the bones here,

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:33.467
so what you do is
you lift it up to the top.

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:36.100
I'm gonna go right in
between the bone.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.233
I'm gonna pull,
and that's gonna be a gorgeous...

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:43.633
medium on the inside of this, right?

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:47.967
So then, all we're gonna do
is we're gonna place this

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:50.500
on a platter much like this.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.333
What you wanna do is
you wanna show your guests

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.433
how beautiful it is
on the inside of this.

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:57.467
I've got a little pesto
on the side here,

00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:59.367
which is always great
to serve with it.

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:01.233
I don't know what it looks like
from over there,

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:03.567
but it looks delicious
from over here.
