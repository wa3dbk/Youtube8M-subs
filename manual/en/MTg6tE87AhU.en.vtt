00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:02.329
- I've got a Linzertorte
in the oven right now,

00:00:02.329 --> 00:00:03.976
let's see how it came out.

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:07.567
I just lied to you, this is a beer fridge.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:11.785
(classical music)

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:14.813
The scent of a Linzertorte baking,

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:17.027
orange, almond, clove and raspberry,

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:18.933
simply is the holidays to me.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.539
It's a personal family tradition,

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.449
and nothing makes me feel so cozy.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.460
So I wanted to find out what foods

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.304
might invoke that same feeling
in people around the world.

00:00:27.304 --> 00:00:31.871
(classical music)

00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:34.912
For Christmas, some German
families bake Stollen,

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:38.374
a dense marzipan-filled cake
studded with dried fruits.

00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:41.097
It dates back to the 1300s
and was sometimes made

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:43.657
without milk or butter,
which were once prohibited

00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:45.974
by the Catholic Church during Advent.

00:00:45.974 --> 00:00:49.102
The Vatican eventually relented
and issued the Butter-Letter,

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:52.130
saying these products could
be used as long as bakers

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.645
paid a fine that would go
towards constructing churches.

00:00:55.645 --> 00:01:00.235
(classical music)

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:02.370
Hanukkah is a celebration of the story

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.560
that one small pot of lamp
oil lasted for eight nights.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.628
So lots of Hanukkah's
foods are fried in oil.

00:01:08.628 --> 00:01:11.105
Also, fried things are delicious.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:14.235
Take sufganiyot, these
small sugar-crusted donuts

00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:16.449
filled with jam or custard arose in Israel

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:18.887
soon after its formation in 1948.

00:01:18.887 --> 00:01:21.387
Austro-Hungarian immigrants
may have blended recipes

00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:25.633
for familiar European jelly
donuts like pÄ…czki or Berliner,

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.888
which were not part of
their holiday traditions

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.570
with sfenj, a type of plain donut common

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.988
in North African Hanukkah feasts.

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:37.153
(opera music)

00:01:37.153 --> 00:01:39.287
On New Year's Eve some Japanese families

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:42.761
eat toshikoshi soba, or
year-crossing buckwheat noodles.

00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:45.707
Fresh soba are long,
symbolizing longevity,

00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:48.339
and they're thin and tender,
reflecting the eater's ability

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:51.243
to cut through and overcome any hardships

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.645
of the previous year.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.494
The noodles can be served hot or cold,

00:01:54.494 --> 00:01:57.399
in soup or with dipping
sauces, and with garnishes

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.427
from sweet-fried bean
curd to salty fish cakes

00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:02.072
to simple green onion.

00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:06.482
(classical music)

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:09.022
In Italy, Spain and many other places

00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:12.130
grapes are a major player
in New Year's festivities.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.198
The Spanish version is 'las
doce uvas de la suerte'

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:17.026
or the twelve grapes of luck.

00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:19.545
The tradition goes that you eat one grape

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:21.374
at each chime of the clock at midnight

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:24.279
to ensure good luck in
each month of the new year.

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.388
In Italy, the grapes still
symbolize prosperity,

00:02:27.388 --> 00:02:29.481
but the tradition is to eat as many

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.350
as possible come midnight.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.955
How many grapes can you eat in a minute?

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:35.740
So my favorite holiday
food is Linzertorte.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.755
What's yours?

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:38.908
Share it in the comments,
especially if you've got

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:39.985
the recipe.
