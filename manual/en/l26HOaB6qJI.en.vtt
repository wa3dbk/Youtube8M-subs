00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.210
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: As you just heard a Southern California
woman took on a big car company in small claims

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.280
court and won, Heather Peters joins me in
studio to talk about her battle with Honda,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.310
thanks for being here.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.310
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.160
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: This began with a 2006 Honda hybrid.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.490
It's promise of good gas mileage, how did
it end up in court?

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:31.280
&gt;&gt; God only knows, I offered to trade the
car and they never called me they lied in

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.640
the brochure they said 50 miles in city and
town and it never got any more than 40 but

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.670
I wasn't going to Sue over there, average
mileage may vary.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.760
What happened is they reprogrammed the car
and they used the battery less and the gas

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.460
more, and now I get 28, 29 and I was waiting
for the class action saying maybe they will

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.460
replace the battery.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.850
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: Because there are 2,000 hybrid
owners

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.590
&gt;&gt; Actually there are 500,000 owners, 200,000
cars.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.369
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: Oh, okay, they're part of a class
action?

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.460
&gt;&gt; They are trying to settle and unless the
judge disapproves they are trying to settle

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.670
where people can get a maximum of $200 and
a coupon toward their next Honda.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.240
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: That was not good enough for you.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.020
&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to be a lawyer 10 years ago and
real court is too long and too expensive so

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.869
I went to small claims and it's like judge
Judy in California there are no lawyers and

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.610
fancy Rules of Evidence, you go, talk for
half an hour, plain English like we're talking

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.390
here andÊ
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: Honda didn't have a lawyer there?

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.390
&gt;&gt; They're not allowed.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.510
They had a technical specialist who was a
mechanic who worked his way up to litigation.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.780
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: The judge ruled in your favor and
how much were you awarded?

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.790
&gt;&gt; He wrote a 26 page opinion and gave me
$9,867.19.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.220
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: And the maximum in California is
$10,000.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.400
You didn't stop there.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.600
You started urging people to not settle for
the $200 class action, go to small claims

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
court.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.740
&gt;&gt;&gt; Right, I could have taken my money and
went but I was upset for everybody so don't

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.490
settle with Honda is my web site ask I'm going
to share with everyone my fancy legal education

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.310
and tell them you can do it themselves.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.660
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: You don't opt into a class action,
you have to opt out.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.060
&gt;&gt;&gt; That was one of the reasons I got involved
because people were writing me saying I'm

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.600
not sending in my paperwork so I'm not going
to be part of it, and I was like, oh, no,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.140
if you don't do something you're part of it
like it or not.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.989
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: So you asked people to sign a petition
and say let's ask the attorney general from

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:13.260
various states, Attorney Generals to say we
don't want to accept this class action settlement,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.780
so what happened today?

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.620
&gt;&gt; The regular folk had until last Friday
to tell the judge I don't want to be a part

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.900
of it but we got over 1400 this morning, signatures
and all 50 state attorney generals got the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.041
petition and California came in today they
heard us, they came in and said, under honor,

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:39.660
we want more time to look into this and they
got it and five states joined them

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.530
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: I wanted to read a statement from
Honda because they plan on appealing your

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.140
small claims court judgment.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.750
"American Honda believes that the judgment
in this case is a radical and unprecedent

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.189
departure from California state law and we
intend to appeal this decision."

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:09.000
It is unusual because most times when you
have a class action suit the money that people

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.739
are awarded isn't necessarily a lot of money.

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.299
The intent is something else, what is it?

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.620
&gt;&gt; Exact and I'm not here to say get out of
every class actions some of them are really

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.960
good, somebody puts $20 cents on your phone
bill you're not going to Sue them but you're

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.660
glad somebody is is, and great, go get 'em,
it's to punish them and keep 'em honest.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.680
But when you have $10,000 out of pocket that's
a different story.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.639
That's a case where a class action is inappropriate,
frankly.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.199
At least it should be a lot more money.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.590
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: We haven't got a lot of time but
when will the attorney general of California

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.280
make a decision whether or not they want to
object to this class action settlement?

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.990
&gt;&gt; They have to move quickly, the judge gave
them until FebruaryÊ29th to get something

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.729
on file and the final hearing is March 16th.

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:57.850
&gt;&gt; JOANNE: Thank you for being heater, Peter
Peter.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.979
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.
