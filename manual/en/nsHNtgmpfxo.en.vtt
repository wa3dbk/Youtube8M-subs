00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.480
Hey guys.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.870
Matt here from Epic Soccer Training.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.359
I want to teach you how to do a chest trap
in soccer.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.400
So this is, I think, one of the funniest traps
that people do when they do it wrong.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.769
So I want to teach you the basics of actually
how to do it right.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.449
So what you want to do is think of it like
if you ever played that egg tossing game where

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.119
you throw it to your partner and you kind
of have to cushion it, that's the same thing

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.619
you do with any trap in soccer.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.329
So it doesn't matter if you're trapping it
with your foot or with your neck or anything

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.329
like that.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.850
You want to actually kind of brace the ball.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.160
So again, I'm going to have Chas kind of throw
one here and kind of show you what you want

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.160
to do.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.800
So when you chest trap it, chest trap it with
either the center or if you want to have kind

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.530
of a little bit more control, I would move
it up a little bit to the side.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.090
For me, it's the right side is where I like
to chest trap and so go ahead.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.940
A little bit higher.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.809
So again, just chest trap and you will see
me kind of like I will kind of take some of

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.120
the power off of it which will help it drop
down so that's usually if I'm going in the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120
space.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.890
But if I'm chest trapping right below me,
just let it hit you.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.850
You don't need to like throw your chest out
or anything like that because you don't want

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.990
to go ahead.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.110
You don't want it to just go too far out.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.060
So again, you want to really just try and
kind of brace the ball and then throw it right

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.440
back down to your foot.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.140
So yeah, go ahead.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.620
So that's the basics of how to do it and then
what you want to work on, go back and forth

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.260
with a partner or with a teammate or something
like that.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.660
Then you want to start working on trapping
into space, trapping where you want to go

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.050
because a lot of times, if there's a defender
coming straight at me, I don't want to chest

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.050
trap it right here.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.890
You should see him coming and then if you
need to chest trap it away and get away from

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.100
him and go into space.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.910
So those are some of the things you need to
be concerned with and really practice because

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.440
that's what's going to enable you to kind
of have what they call like a sticky foot

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.819
on the ball but obviously in this case, what
that means is you're keeping the ball collectively

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.040
right near you.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.909
It's always within a yard radius where you
always have control of the ball and that's

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.379
what you want to do with a chest trap.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.409
So remember that you actually let the ball
do the work.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.319
You don't need to always just go after it
or anything like that but just let it hit

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.189
you and just drop right down or if you need
to go into space, turn, hit and go into space.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.549
Just think of it in terms of kind of like
angles where you want to go with it.

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.430
So again, that's how to do a chest trap in
soccer.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.599
