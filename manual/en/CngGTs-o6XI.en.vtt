00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:14.239
When the war of the beasts brings about the world's end

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:20.869
The goddess descends from the sky, Wings of light and dark spread afar

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.889
She guides us to bliss

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.939
her gift everlasting

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.609
Infinite in mystery

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.810
is the gift of the Goddess

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.180
We seek it thus, and take to the sky

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.000
Ripples form on the water's surface
The wandering soul knows no rest.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.090
There is no hate, only joy
For you are beloved by the goddess

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.920
Hero of the dawn

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.650
Healer of worlds

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.090
Dreams of the morrow hath the shattered soul

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.920
Pride is lost

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.090
Wings stripped away, the end is nigh

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.490
My friend,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.850
do you fly away now?

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.040
To a world that abhors you and I?
All that awaits you is a somber morrow

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
No matter where the winds may blow

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.100
My friend, your desire

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.120
Is the bringer of life

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.820
the gift of the goddess

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.659
Even if the morrow is barren of promises

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.800
Nothing shall forestall my return

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.400
My friend,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.700
the fates are cruel

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.700
There are no dreams, no honor remains
The arrow has left, the bow of the goddess

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.380
My soul, corrupted by vengeance

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.850
Hath endured torment, to find the end of the journey

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.000
In my own salvation
And your eternal slumber

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Legend shall speak
Of sacrifice at world's end

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.670
The wind sails over the water's surface

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.920
Quietly, but surely

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.920
Even if the morrow is barren of promises
Nothing shall forestall my return

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.760
To become the dew that quenches the land

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.779
To spare the sands

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.179
the seas

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.949
the skies

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.549
I offer thee this silent sacrifice
