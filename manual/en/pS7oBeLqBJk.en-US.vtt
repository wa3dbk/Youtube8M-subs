Hey guys, I'm Gio, this is the Nerd Herd,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.960
and today we're taking a look at my favourite budget headphones, the Sennheiser HD 439

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.080
You know that top notch headphones are likely to be more than a few hundred dollars

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.440
or, well, in my case, euros,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.420
you've probably almost immediately thought of Beats by Dre

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.680
but there are many other manifacturers, such as Audio Technica, 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.560
Behringer, Bose or well, Sennheiser

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.200
The point is you don't always have to pay so much for your headphones

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.420
and that's why I appreciate so much this pair

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.420
The three main factors I decided to consider when buying these headphones were

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.080
sound quality, build quality and price

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.460
Now of course there are many specs to check when buying a pair of headphones

00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:17.073
so I'm not going to explain them right now

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:21.253
but let me say that compared to the Monster Solo HD

00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:24.272
which are double the price

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:26.033
these headphones win in almost any possible cateogory

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.000
and I'll link the specs right below so that you can check by yourself

00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:34.003
However specs are not everything

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.880
and that's why I've bought them and tested them

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640
The result? They sound amazing.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.900
Expecially if you think that I've paid them just 50 euros

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.513
at Amazon.it

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.120
The lows sound good, the highs sound good, they never screech even when pumped to the max

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.020
Never had any kind of issue as far as sound quality is concerned

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.580
I've also actually used them without an amp

00:01:59.948 --> 00:02:01.948
because I simply felt it wasn't needed

00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:04.607
they sounded good right out of the box

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:08.902
However when build quality comes into play

00:02:09.554 --> 00:02:11.554
things are a little bit different

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:14.473
First, let me explain something,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.240
headphones are mainly divided into two categories

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:20.734
on-ear and over-ear

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.740
on-ear have smaller ear cups

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.160
and they do not isolate as much as the over-ear do

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.860
And that's why the over-ear are usually more common among the DJs

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.380
These headphones, the Sennheiser HD 439,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.033
are over-ear

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.980
so they are supposed to isolate better and to stick better to your head

00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:44.788
Well, they don't.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.240
The isolation is acceptable, but definitely not the best

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.780
but they tend to slip-off too easily

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.120
They are way too loose even for someone with a big head like mine

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.180
Their size is adjustable, of course, but that doesn't help much

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.980
On the other hand however, they are the most comfortable I could ever imagine

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.240
I could use them for hours and don't feel a thing

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.540
They're absolutely fantastic under this point of view

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.780
Also, as the ear-cups are not leather, they won't make your ears hot as much leather would

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.367
so, again, one point for the comfort

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:25.074
On the aesthetic side, 

00:03:25.074 --> 00:03:26.694
they're not exactly beautiful

00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:28.784
but I've come to get used to it

00:03:29.382 --> 00:03:31.382
The third and last point is price

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
As I mentioned earlier, 

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:36.248
these headphones are 50 euros at Amazon Europe

00:03:36.434 --> 00:03:38.434
and 60 dollars in the US

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:40.633
and that's a price worth considering

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.300
Furthermore, they also come with some welcome bonuses:

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.400
the removable headphone jack

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.153
the extra 3 meters cable

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.160
-very useful if you use them in a large room-

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.520
and the 6.3 mm adapter plug

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.235
So, bottom line is:

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.900
if you're looking for a pair of headphones that sound good,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.380
don't cost much and you don't care about the aesthetics

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.320
The Sennheiser HD 439 will serve you just fine

00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:12.014
So, that's been it, thank you for watching
