00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.080
Often, weapons become associated with the
forces that wield them: their role and alignment

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.679
help shape their identity.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.100
Lawful good through and through - this is
a gun for the good guys:

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.110
The MP5.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.710
So, how did it earn its heroic status?

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.750
What makes it a perfect fit for a counter-terror
role?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.910
And what's the deal with the slap?

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.490
The MP5 is a German weapon, manufactured by
Heckler &amp; Koch.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.510
H&amp;K were founded in 1949, directly in the
wake of World War 2.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.110
The company took its name from two of its
three co-founders: all of whom were former

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.670
Mauser engineers: Alex Seidel, Edmund Heckler
and Theodor Koch.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.030
At first, they manufactured machine tools
and precision metal parts - but in 1956 the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.010
West German government put out a tender for
a new rifle for the Bundeswehr.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.470
H&amp;K put forward the G3 design, based on a
rifle designed by former Mauser engineers

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.420
at CETME, a Spanish technical institute.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.020
Their bid proved successful, and H&amp;K developed
a number of G3-derived designs to fit different

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.400
roles - with the MP5 amongst them.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.420
Originally known as the HK54, work began on
the new SMG in 1964.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.810
It fires the 9Ã—19mm Parabellum round, the
standard NATO pistol calibre.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.430
Original magazines were straight, but a slight
revision in 1977 gave the weapon its distinctive

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.850
and slightly curved 30-round mag.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.680
Like its parent G3 design, the MP5 has a roller-delayed
blowback mechanism - a simplistic but effective

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.030
enough action that has roots in German prototypes
made near the end of the war.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.159
There are quite a few MP5 variants available:
from the original HK54, also known as the

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:27.129
MP5A1; the fixed stock MP5A2 and A4; retractable
stock MP5A3; and sliding stock MP5A5.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.719
The MP5K - or Kurz - is a shortened variant,
pared down into the smallest package possible:

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:39.819
The MP5SD variants boast an integral suppressor,
for covert use; and there are larger-calibre

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.780
variants too: such as the MP5/10, which fires
powerful 10mm Auto rounds; and the MP5/40,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.650
which fires .40 Smith &amp; Wesson.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.969
A flexible and configurable weapon, then - and
one that has found favour with a large number

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.260
of police and special forces units.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.769
In 1980, one event in particular secured the
MP5's iconic status: a siege on the Iranian

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.749
Embassy in London.

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:17.559
6 terrorists, 26 hostages, a densely-populated
urban location and a live television feed:

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:23.650
it was a very tense situation with an awful
lot on the line.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.239
On the sixth day of the siege, a hostage was
killed. This prompted immediate action by

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.609
the British Special Air Service - under the
codename Operation Nimrod.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:41.300
17 minutes after their first breach, 5 terrorists
were killed, the final captured - and all

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.689
remaining hostages were rescued.

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:51.969
The mission's success reinforced the SAS's
reputation as a deady special operations force:

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:59.930
and these events served as the perfect advertisement
for the SMG they used.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.749
Its proven track record, and suitability for
the close-range fighting typical of urban

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:10.079
terror operations, make it a fitting choice
for any counter-terror role - and a must-have

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.730
inclusion for any games that depict such forces.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.190
The SAS' legendary live-fire exercises in
the Killing House are depicted in the tutorial

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:28.040
of Call of Duty 4: in which you drill the
following mission's plan with plywood simulacrum.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.060
The MP5's presence here is true-to-life, and
the game shows a recreation of the real training

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.730
exercises that the SAS would have undertaken
in preparation for the embassy siege.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.830
The MP5 sees prime placement in the armouries
of tactical shooters, then: and it's a flagship

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.280
weapon of the Rainbow Six series.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.950
When it comes to tackling a terrorist threat,
there's nothing better for the task.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.290
One quirk that crops up during the MP5's reload
is the infamous 'HK slap': an open-handed

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.450
tap on the cocking lever after inserting a
fresh magazine, sending the bolt forward and

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.630
chambering a round.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.480
It might seem reckless to smack your weapon,
but it's actually recommended procedure: a

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.740
softer approach might not drive the bolt home
properly.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:25.280
Besides, the MP5 is a working weapon - and
one that can withstand a little rough-housing.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.730
The 'slap' isn't unique to the MP5 - but it's
a cool move that has helped to bolster its

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.430
iconic identity through fiction as well as
fact.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.640
Its distinctive on-screen presence and association
with heroic action makes it a prominent choice

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.140
in cinema.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.860
The weapon has turned up in hundreds of films
- normally seen in the hands of the good guys,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.570
but sometimes revealing a more impetuous side.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.020
With notable appearances in Die Hard 2 and
The Matrix, the weapon appears outside its

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.810
counter-terror role in games inspired by classic
action movies.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.210
Games like Max Payne and Modern Warfare 2
indulge a more brash side of the SMG: far

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.150
from the tightly controlled discipline of
well-trained special forces, the MP5 can also

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.390
employ spray and pray tactics.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.180
It might waste ammunition, but it looks good
on screen - and more empty mags mean more

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.340
stylish reloads, complete with the slap.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:32.730
Today, there are a number of more modern SMGs
and personal defence weapons vying to replace

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.910
the fifty-year-old MP5 design.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:43.410
H&amp;K themselves even offer two alternatives:
the more modern and larger-calibre UMP-45,

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:50.430
and the armour-piercing power of the diminutive
MP7: but the classic 9mm SMG still reigns

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:57.050
supreme: well-loved by those who wield it,
and with ubiquitous use by police forces worldwide.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:07.300
A legendary submachine gun that earned its
reputation through a baptism by fire.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.770
Always cool under crisis, its the perfect
counter-terror weapon:

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.100
The MP5.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.370
Confident.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.300
Force for order.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.990
Terrorist's bane.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.820
Thank you very much for watching - Iconic
Arms will return: and until next time, farewell.
