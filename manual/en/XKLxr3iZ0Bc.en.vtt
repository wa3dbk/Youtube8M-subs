00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.660
My Name is Kate Frech and I am graduate of the Health Law Program at Case Western Reserve University.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm Ali Lakhani and I graduated from the Health Law Program at Case Western Reserve University School of Law.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.880
I came to Case with a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do and where I wanted to end up.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.289
What the Health Law Program let me do

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.900
Was put some structure around that and what areas of Health Law I wanted to really hone in on.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.940
The Health Law Program rally helped me to develop the practical skills that I would need

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.620
to practice Health Law in a law firm setting.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.720
My plan was, really all along, to get everything done. Get a Master's and a Law School degree.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.580
All in the three years, and Case has that program.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.460
We have a lot of faculty that's working on really groundbreaking research. Professor Mehlman has a grant from NIH.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.100
He was very innovative. He was

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.060
exploring a lot of different areas of law and Health Law that hadn't really been looked at before.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.380
One of my favorite things so far has been a series of courses.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.280
Hospital and Physicians Organizations Law

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.000
and Health Care Transactions, both with Robert Gerberry.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:15.120
And he actually works at Summa Health Systems in Akron, he's a staff attorney there. It's really great to hear those true life stories.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.060
entwined with what we're learning.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.260
They have a lot of topical speakers

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.640
come in that you can just go and sit there in your lunch and listen to someone talk about

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.460
something that you're Interested in. Someone who you kind of admired.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.700
They actually seek out people in the incoming 1L class

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.340
who have a demonstrated interest in Health Law, to come in as a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.340
Research Assistant and work with professors during your first summer.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.800
As one of those fellows, I had an opportunity to work with Professor Sharona Hoffman on issues related to Electronic Health Records.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.660
I'm an Associate Note Editor on Health Matrix.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.040
We're actively going through these notes and these articles that we received to be published in the Journal.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.300
I was a Certified Legal Intern with The Milton A. Kramer Health Law Clinic. In my 3L year you are thrown in

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.980
and you need to figure out how you're going to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.660
solve a real problem for a real client that is depending on you.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.980
That means that you're responsible for the whole spectrum of the client experience.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.240
From the initial interview to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.180
prepping them for a hearing, to following up with briefs and appeals.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.180
I worked with Professor Berg on my note that I wrote.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.000
Which is essentially a really long research paper.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.140
It's usually about 30 to 50 pages.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.140
You need to make a new argument and you need to take legal Academia and you want to contribute to the conversation

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.300
I wrote mine about childhood vaccination. There are several interests that need to be balanced. It was eventually accepted for publication.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.300
You have the opportunity to either grade on or write on to a journal and I

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.140
graded on to Law Review.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.300
And as part of that experience I was able to write a note that is very timely, about a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.160
Health Care Reform Issue that affects many hospitals

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.020
that are moving toward a value-based reimbursement

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.220
for Medicare Services.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.760
The fact that it's published is a great thing. So I'm very happy about that and it does come up in practically every Interview.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.440
I was able to participate in a hospital externship where I got to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.740
work in the law department at the Cleveland Clinic.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.120
I am currently at University Hospitals working in their health law department.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.680
I knew I wanted to be something public interest oriented. I found a legal aid firm in Akron

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.680
That had this thing called the Medical Equal Partnership. I started looking around as to how I could

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.040
get funding, because like most public interest stuff it was unpaid, and heard about the health law summer stipend.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.129
I wouldn't have been able to work there and get the experience I have without it.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.200
Cleveland is actually affordable. Cost of living is really low, but the

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.570
actual standard of living is really high.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.780
There are a lot of great things to do in all the different neighborhoods. The West Side Market Is great, the Tremont area.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.800
I'm enjoying it here. And Cleveland is a place that I can see my future.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.940
