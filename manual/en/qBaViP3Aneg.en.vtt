8 Foods That Help Lose or Burn Belly Fat and
Even Weight Loss

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.110
You may find it hard to believe that there
are delicious foods you already love that

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.689
can actually help you fight belly fat.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.710
Lucy Danziger, editor-in-chief of self magazine
is here to tell us, what those foods are and

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.710
how they work.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.950
She's also gonna clear up the mystery of blue
berries based on the last segment, but we'll

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.190
have to wait until we get to that.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.310
So, stay tune for the blue berries.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.450
Luzy it's good to have you with us as always.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.450
Thanks for having me...

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.050
I like it because I look across this table,
these are all really delicious, yummy foods.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.890
Probably we all made this resolution to get
to the gym and not eat fat foods.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.050
The truth is, when you eat the right foods,
you can eat a lot, and you can get rid of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.050
that belly fat.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.089
I'm in, without doing all the upper exercises,
it doesn't hurt to that as well.

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:36.089
First, we have the avocado.

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.649
We've heard so much about avocado being a
healthy fat.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:39.649
What so good about it?

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.449
Your body needs fat, and so I say instead
of using mayonnaise on your bread, try a little

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.159
guacamole because this has mono-saturated
fat which help your body keep that blood sugar

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.850
nice and steady.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.210
And so, obviously, you don't want too much
fat, but half of an avocado with a little

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.850
bit of dressing is a great way to get healthy
fat.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.789
Ok...that's gonna keep that blood sugar nice
and low.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.040
So, you don't have to spike too hungry...that's
right...so tired.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.040
Bananas also.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.080
Ok, potassium is the anti-sodium.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.290
So, if you're bloated, if you're feeling a
little puffy have a banana or half a banana...really...and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140
that's gonna get rid of that bloating right
away.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.140
I love that...

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.340
I know, so really works,too.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm obsessed of great yogurt, I eat a lot
of these...me too.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.490
Mainly I like it because it's such a high-protein
level.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.490
That's right.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.490
So, you can find one you like.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.320
I happen to like this, but some people like
a smooth quality.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.660
And, when you have that in the morning, that
protein helps set nice steady blood sugar

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.950
all day long.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.070
Talk to me a little about for peope who may
not, who may just eat a different kind of

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.070
yogurt.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.070
Right.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.110
Great yogurt has really a high protein content
because it's strained which make us so sick,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.110
correct?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.810
So, what you want is that densed protein because
what's that gonna do is keep your blood sugar

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.610
from going too high.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.200
If you have a sugary cereal for breakfast
or a pastry, your blood sugar goes way up,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.000
your insulin goes way up and if you're not
going out and ran around, your body learns

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.550
to store it as fat.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.550
Ok.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.550
So, let's not do that.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.640
Let's have this high protein and keep the
blood sugar steady.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.480
I know a lot of people eat yogurt, so many
people eat yogurt, is doing yogurt is going

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480
to benefit them most.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.069
If you have certain sugary yogurt in the morning...not
as good as the plain....you say add berries.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.590
I tell my kids, this is nature's candy.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.680
You can have as much blueberry and strawberry
as you like.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.480
Just wash you teeth afterwards so they stained
away.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480
Exactly...

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.349
The good thing about this is that it's full
of antioxidants.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.900
So, when you do go and exercise or walk, this
is gonna make all those oxygen go to the muscles

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.900
so much easier.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.170
You gonna have great orgap and your blood
sugar stays nice and steady.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.920
Yes, it's the nature's blood sugar, nature's
sugar is gonna keep it steady.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.819
Ok, a little perhaps sugar, though isn't so
bad.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.920
You're saying we can have chocolate, skim
milk.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.510
I love chocolate and after you workout, this
is the perfect recovery food.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.849
Some muscles can get little sore, maybe the
muscles can get ache or tired.

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.249
This is gonna help them recover faster, so
you can feel great, and you want to do it

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.249
again.

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.459
What about chocolate and skim milk, helps
me recover faster.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.840
So, it's a perfect combination of protein
and carb, and try to find one that's low in

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.840
sugar.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.790
Ok, because that's really gonna make the difference,
you're not gonna replace everything, but not

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.790
fake sugar.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.469
Well, I like the kind of little less sugar
added.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.469
OK...

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:16.540
I mean it's good stuff.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.440
Chocolate milk, common... it taste great.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.579
Green tea once again.

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.840
It has a special compound called ECGC that
helps rev the metabolism.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.610
And in fact people who drink 3 cups a day
have their metabolism spikes, that they're

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.560
burning more calories and more fat, all day
long.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.909
Typically a switch for coffee.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.879
I love coffee, but if you place a couple of
cups a day, you gonna rev that metabolism.

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.529
Alright, I'm making a note of that one.

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.299
Also, citrus fruits and peppers.

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.890
OK, any vitamin C, they have found that this
will help you burn 30% more fat.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.930
You gonna zap fat.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.590
When do I have to eat it to make it that happen....Anytime...Vitamin
C in your body, and I say any woman say to

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.111
me, I don't know what to bring with me as
a snack, this is a perfect snack right in

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:01.111
your purse.

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:02.470
It will keep for hours.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.319
And better to have this in the morning than
say a glass of orange juice, right, because

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.299
you have more fiber from the fruit itself.

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.319
And speaking of fiber... look for a brand
that has 4 grams.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.540
4 grams of fiber in your bread and whole grains.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.650
Yes of course, but a lot of the labels will
boost all sorts of whole grains.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.020
4 grams of fiber is it, and if you're gonna
have a sandwich or toast, that is a way to

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.020
go.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.750
It keeps you full, it keeps that pressure
nice and low, and you will feel great.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.330
And, in fact if you get 35 grams of fiber
a day and this says 10 grams, you are burning

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.139
6% more calories than if you didn't.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.139
Just by sitting still.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.690
So, eat fiber, it's not just for old ladies,
it's good stuff.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.020
There you go, I think that sums it all perfectly.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.949
And you can go to self.com, and get recipes
for all of these...or do a jumpstart....
