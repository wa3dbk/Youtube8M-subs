00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.270
“Hi excuse me, do you know where I can collect
my OSAP?”

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.580
Finding your way around U of T’s campus
for the first time may be a daunting task,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.830
but a number of U of T staff and students
will be donning badges saying “ask me”

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.870
to help those new and returning students looking
for information.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.100
It’s all part of the Ask Me ambassador program.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.070
Introduced in 2008 the program is one more
way the University of Toronto provides a welcoming

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.119
and supportive environment for new students
arriving on the St. George campus this September.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.289
I really enjoy working with students.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:41.469
A lot of times students felt, and I felt when
I was a student that you’re “just a number”.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.469
People don’t know you.

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.559
I think it’s imperative that students feel
that they belong and that they matter.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.889
When you have staff that have nametags on
that say “ask me” students are hopefully

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.659
comfortable asking the questions and hopefully
they feel that they belong to the U of T community

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.960
and the u of t family.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.500
My job as an ask me ambassador has been answering
questions for students, because a lot of incoming

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.659
frosh don’t know for example where classes
are.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.579
Don’t know where to get their T-card, their
books.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.899
Me and the other ask me ambassadors are going
around campus and answering these basic questions.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.770
Where the book store is, where the nearest
health clinic is.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.229
How to go about using ROSIE or any of the
academic resources we have.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.021
From where to get their T card to how to get
back to campus if they get lost, it’s a

00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:34.211
big campus and it’s scary at first.

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.100
When I first came, I had no idea where anything
was located.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.280
Finding things on a large urban campus can
be difficult at times.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.380
Knowing that there are services out there,
like Ask Me would have been very beneficial

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.320
to me at the time.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.920
I thought this would be a good way to help
incoming students find their way around campus.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.369
A lot of us are connected via smart phones
to everything we need to be.

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.450
So if we don’t know the answer, we can definitely
find out on the move.
