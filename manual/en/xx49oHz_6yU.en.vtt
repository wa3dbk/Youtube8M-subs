00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.960
Hi! I'm Gary for Expert Village. Now we are
going to put our tape down the sides. It is

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.470
going to cover up this knot and it is also
going to protect the strings from ripping

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:18.439
and give it that nice clean look. Because
this particular book is missing its back over

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:26.340
here and it is exposed, I am going to use
the thicker roll of tape and what it is going

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.980
to do I am going to put 1 piece. It is going
to go down the length of the whole spine of

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.840
the book and that will give this part its
cover and its protection. If it was just a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.940
normal book that was still in good shape down
the side, I would just run thinner strips

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.990
of tape; one down this side and one down this
side but the thicker piece of tape will accomplish

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.600
the same thing. It will cover the strings
on both sides and it will also give this part

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.840
of the book a nice protection. So let's go
ahead and get a piece of tape. We are going

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.020
to do the same thing that we did on top. We
left it a little bit over the edge so we can

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:22.179
stick it in. So when you measure your tape,
when you cut it a little bit over the top

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:29.829
and also the bottom as well. So if I cut it
right about here, that should give me enough

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:40.700
space on both edges. Actually we don't need
the knife. We can just rip this tape, put

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:54.740
the book on its side, try to get right into
the middle and also we want to cover up those

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:04.229
strings that we made. Again, we have to make
our snip its into the top so we can tuck it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.870
down, make it easier. So we have our 3 sections
and we seal over here on the side but we were

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:21.820
able to cover up the holes that we made and
the strings let's go ahead and cut the edges

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:36.530
here. We'll go ahead and tuck them in. It
goes right over the previous one we made.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:49.710
Same thing here. Right over the previous one
and again this one, on the top we are going

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:58.709
to have to tuck that in, in between the pages
there.
