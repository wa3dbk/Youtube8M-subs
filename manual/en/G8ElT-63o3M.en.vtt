00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.480
Holding the violin, for a beginner, is one
of the most important things to learn when

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.870
you are first learning how to play.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:22.620
I feel it is one of the mistakes that is made
sometimes where children learn to hold the

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.810
violin with their hand.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.350
Really they should be learning how to hold
the violin with their chin only.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:37.980
Here is a demonstration of what should be
happening when you learn to hold your violin.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.579
First of all, you start in rest position.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.970
Again, this is for a young, a beginner.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.630
Your feet are together.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.360
You make a V for violin.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.560
Then you step out with either foot, it doesn't
matter which one so that your equal distance

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.280
apart from your shoulders.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.680
Your shoulders should be the same, parallel
to your shoulders should be your feet.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.670
Then, you take the shoulder of the left side
of your violin with your left hand and you

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.030
put it out in front of your left foot.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.240
Your arm should be nice and straight.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.200
Then you turn the violin over so it's upside
down and you fly it into your neck.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:36.009
Now, this part is the most difficult part
because you want to make sure that you can't

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.570
really see the top of your shoulder.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.780
A lot of the mistakes are made when the violin
is held like this and you can see the whole

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.780
shoulder.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.039
Then your not really holding the violin well
enough.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:57.250
If it is on top of the shoulder you should
be able to let go and even put your left hand

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.200
on your right shoulder.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.349
Your head position, your head should be turned
but also relaxed and a little laid backward

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:08.349
like your sleeping.

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.989
Not too much but a little bit.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:19.270
You're staring at the D string and your using
about half of your chin and half of your cheek

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.850
to hold the violin.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.970
Half of your chin, not the whole thing 'cause
that's what that would look like, and half

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.250
of your cheek right over here.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.000
This is the right way to hold the violin.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.840
You could walk around your house demonstrating
how well you hold your violin.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.300
Shake somebody's hand.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.900
Have a destination to where you are going
and practice this.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.650
This is how you need to do it in order to
keep your fingers.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.070
Letting them free.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.650
Keeping them free so they can shift all over
the violin instead of having to hold them.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.760
Hold the violin.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.240
Then they won't be able to shift as freely.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.850
This is a beautiful violin position.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.580
Again, feet together.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.560
Make a V, step.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.250
Left hand to left shoulder.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.860
A straight arm over the left foot.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.850
Flip it over, fly it in.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.480
Make sure it is on the shoulder using half
your chin, half your cheek.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.450
Left hand flies to the right shoulder.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.360
And you have a beautiful violin position.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.319
The violin is also nice and flat.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.680
And that's the right way to hold the violin.
