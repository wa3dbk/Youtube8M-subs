00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.300
Welcome to CyberAuto TV!

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.010
Today we’re going to take a look at the

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.700
Corbeau LG1 Racing Seat, a high-end touring
car seat.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.209
The LG1 is a great seat for individuals who
want show car looks

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.730
But are not willing to sacrifice performance.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.010
The LG1 provides a relatively broad seating
platform

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.119
In what is overall a relatively narrow seat.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.189
It may be a bit wide for the smallest sports
cars

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.000
But the standard-width LG1 is narrow enough

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.540
To fit the C5 Corvette with some accommodations.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.960
Be sure to compare the space in your vehicle

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.200
To the dimensions shown on Racing-Seats-USA.Com

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.710
To ensure the LG1 will fit in your car.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.710
The standard-width version of the LG1 will
suit drivers

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.430
Up to about 38 inches in waist size

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.080
And there is a wide version that is appropriate
for drivers

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.780
Up to about 42 inches in waist size.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.010
The LG1 is a reclining seat with a tough steel
tube-frame interior

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.530
Comfortable padding, and moderate side bolstering.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.939
It is super-comfortable

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.390
And not as difficult to get into and out of
as seats

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.950
With taller side bolstering in the thigh region.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.549
Still, customers find this seat to provide
adequate support

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.210
For sporty street driving and light track
work.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.200
Take a look at the reviews provided on Racing-Seats-USA.Com

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.460
To see what buyers think of this seat.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.909
Because this seat is primarily used on the
street

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.999
It features harness slots for 3- and 4-point
harnesses.

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.590
When ordering, it is also possible to have
the slot added

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.210
for an anti-submarine belt.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.280
If you’re in a cold climate you should consider

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.069
The optional seat heaters that Corbeau offers

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.259
And the optional lumbar support is never a
bad idea

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.009
If you expect to find yourself spending longer
periods in this seat.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.609
The Corbeau LG1 is available in broad range
of colors and materials.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.770
The one you see here is finished in black
cloth with a black center

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.549
But it is also available with a blue or red
cloth center.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.350
If you’re looking for an especially nice
seat

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.410
Consider ordering your LG1 in either microsuede
or genuine leather

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.670
To add an exceptional look to your vehicle.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.090
You can browse all of the color combinations
and ordering options

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.360
Of the Corbeau LG1 on Racing-Seats-USA.Com.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.390
The LG1 features Corbeau’s bottom-mounting
system

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.660
Which means you can use one of the hundreds
of

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.081
Vehicle-specific brackets to make the LG1

00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:39.870
A direct bolt-in on your car, truck, or SUV.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.180
That’s all the time we have for now.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.650
