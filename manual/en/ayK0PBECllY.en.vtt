00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.699
October, 1996. The InGen Corporation is taken out of my hands by a vote of the board of directors.

00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:11.134
My nephew dispatches his team.

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:26.254
The hunters landed on May 13, 1997, deep in the island's southwest.

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:33.623
Most of them had worked at my African parks for years. They never stood a chance.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.253
Hunting dinosaurs is quite a tricky business.

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:49.328
I recommend helicopters, if you've got them.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:58.273
Lindstradt guns, by the way. Swedish-made, unbeatable for accuracy and rate of fire.

00:00:58.273 --> 00:01:01.824
American-made tranquilizer darts.

00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:07.604
The effect changes with the target's body mass, temperament, and mood.

00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:11.800
I believe the phrase is “Results may vary.”

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.182
The InGen hunting party carried the pass codes for our perimeter fences.

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:31.672
The hunters scattered, their prearranged hunting routes forgotten.

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:35.676
Only a third of their number appeared at the rendezvous.

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:52.810
Marden, A.S. – still missing.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.259
Karamcheti, V. – still missing.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.620
Sullivan, R.M. – still missing.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.469
LaSalle, P. – still missing.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.245
Van Holn, S.T. – also… still missing.

00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:18.496
Lystrata, A.L. – deceased.

00:02:18.496 --> 00:02:23.099
I was unable to find any records whatsoever on Michael Sullivan, beyond the sole fact

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.629
that his flight to the rendezvous originated in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:36.939
LaSalle was a disciple of Roland's; a sometime poacher, fancied himself a master hunter.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:43.091
An ex-policeman from South Africa, a sort of a soldier of fortune character.

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:49.267
Known as “the Maharaja” to his fellows, highly skilled, but only works alone.

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:54.248
He was meant to radio for picking up from the comm. station.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.229
I first met Harold Greenwood in 1992; he was an American,

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.669
introduced to me as a former Green Beret.

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:12.385
He asked a number of questions about the disposition of the InGen technology.

00:03:13.724 --> 00:03:22.287
Harry claimed to be a friend of my former son-in-law, I liked him. He was confident, dashing.

00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:31.709
Greenwood carried some sort of electronic device which we were told he built himself,

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.243
based on plans that he found on the Internet.
