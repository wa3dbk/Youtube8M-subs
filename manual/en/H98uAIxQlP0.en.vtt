00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:08.446
Deciding to attend university
full time after being

00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:11.396
out of high school for 25
years was a very big decision.

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:14.756
Yeah, I was really nervous about
it but I didn't need to be.

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:18.516
Being at York has been an
amazing experience in more ways

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:19.436
than I thought possible.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.196
Yes, it's a challenge, but it's
really been a new beginning

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:24.616
for me.

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:27.266
The ACMAPS office is a
place specifically geared

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:29.076
to my experience as
a mature student.

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:34.806
There is a lot of help available
here, all you have to do is ask.

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.596
Feeling overwhelmed and
lost is very common amongst

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:38.266
new students.

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:40.856
As a mature student
those feelings escalate.

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:45.116
At ACMAPS, our team is diverse,
filled with lots of experiences

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.756
and each one of us
is truly dedicated

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.916
to share our learning
experiences with you.

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:53.616
The trick to balancing
priorities in life while

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:54.816
at school is to connect

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:56.426
to the support systems
that are available.

00:00:56.876 --> 00:01:00.636
Support may come from your family,
or your friends, or the workplace,

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:03.416
or community organizations
that you might be involved in.

00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:06.906
But there is also a vast array
of support services available

00:01:06.906 --> 00:01:08.966
on campus, including
writing supports,

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.796
and learning skills sessions,and
disability supports --

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:15.276
even dedicated supports for
mature and part-time students.

00:01:16.486 --> 00:01:19.736
When I started at York I was
so overwhelmed after being

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:20.926
out of school for many years

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:22.766
that I actually made
myself sick...

00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:26.946
If I had to do it all again I
would have visited ACMAPS sooner

00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:29.586
and saved myself a lot of
time and a lot of stress...

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.176
As mature students you might
feel like your all alone

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.776
in this experience
but if you come

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:37.906
to ACMAPS you'll meet
helpful staff and peer mentors

00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:40.046
who are going through
very similar experiences.

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:42.236
We're here to answer
your questions,

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:44.416
connect you to resources,
or just hear you vent.

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:46.976
Who knows...you might
want to get involved too!

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:49.616
Looking for other mature
students on campus?

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:52.756
Wouldn't you like to see a
familiar face in the crowd?

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:56.226
The Mature Student Peer
Mentors at the Atkinson Centre

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.536
for Mature and Part-time
Students are here

00:01:58.536 --> 00:01:59.986
to help you be successful.

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:06.336
