00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:06.890
We're going to make
a Pemulen system.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.000
First will make the Pemulen
gel pH 6.5 with citrate in it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.640
And then we'll make an emulsion,
a conventional emulsion,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.480
into the Pemulen
with ShellSol D38.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.670
The first step is to make
the aqueous dispersion

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.950
of the Pemulen with whatever
modifications we want.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:43.310
We use a 5 milliliter
spoon and transfer that

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.150
into our little mixing jar.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.090
The Pemulen is made at 2%.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.370
The stock gel was made at 2%.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.390
And we want to use it at 1%.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.230
So it's been set up so that
we can use it with the MCP

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.530
components to add
additional components

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.050
and then have the
correct final percentage.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.970
So we're going to use
a 6.5 citrate system.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.670
And we'll use two mils of that.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.420
And then to make the balance
of the 5 mils of water

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.470
to the 5 mils of the
Pemulen concentrate,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.740
we'll add 3 mils of water.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.590
So we want to break
that big lump of Pemulen

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.610
up a little bit.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.750
And then we'll do
the rest of the work

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.749
with a magnetic stirrer.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.827
As the gel thickens,
it can sometimes

00:01:54.827 --> 00:01:56.160
start to spin the bottle around.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.320
So I like to put a
little piece of tape

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.520
to hold the bottle in place.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.070
After 5 or 10 minutes, we'll
have a nice smooth dispersion

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.720
of the Pemulen pH 6.5
with the pH 6.5 citrate

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.890
all in the correct final
proportion of 1% Pemulen

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.020
and the appropriate amount
of citrate as determined

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.610
by the formulas in the MCP.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.790
Normally I do this in
a little plastic jar.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.724
But for the sake
of visualization,

00:02:28.724 --> 00:02:29.640
I'm doing it in glass.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.830
So now we have a
nice even dispersion

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.500
of the Pemulen system.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.290
And this can be used just
as the aqueous material.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.310
You can see it's nicely jelled,
nicely transparent, easy

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.310
to work through with small brush
on the surface of the painting.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.010
To make an emulsion, we want
to add our dispersed phase.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.660
You'll remember this is 10
mils of the Pemulen system.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.750
So we'll add a mill
of the ShellSol D38.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.090
So we'll have essentially a 10%
solution of D38 in the Pemulen.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.200
In addition to a ShellSol,
we can also use xylene

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.410
for a higher polarity
with aromatic quality

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.420
or even for a yet
higher polarity,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.150
we can use something
like benzyl alcohol.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.240
But whatever we put in has
to be non-water miscible,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.840
so it can make the emulsion
as opposed to dissolving.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.921
So again we'll let this
stir for 10 minutes.

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:36.670
And we should have a
nice creamy emulsion.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.860
So it's been another
5-10 minutes.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.990
We now have a nice emulsion
of the ShellSol D38 emulsified

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:58.627
into the Pemulen system with
the pH 6.5 Pemulen and citrate.

00:03:58.627 --> 00:04:00.460
So you can see it's a
conventional emulsion,

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.610
milky white, nice body,
thanks to the Pemulen

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.480
and the Pemulen being a
polymeric emulsion stabilizer.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.440
There's no surfactant.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.010
In this it's just the Pemulen
polymeric emulsion stabilizer

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.320
which stabilizes the emulsion.
