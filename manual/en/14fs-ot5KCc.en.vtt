Hi I'm Lucy Spain on behalf of Expert Village
here to talk about cheerleading jumps and

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:15.019
tumbling. After you've mastered your round-off,
you're able to start moving on into more advanced

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.409
tumbling. Now advanced tumbling is most easily
done in combination from a round-off because

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:26.109
you're going to get a lot of momentum. Demonstrated
right here are the steps that you're going

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.769
to take in a back handspring. I highly recommend
starting out with spotters. This is going

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.070
to be the best way to learn the movements
in slow motion, then you can go ahead and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.070
take it from there. Now we can also do all
of these tumbles which we're going to call

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.240
standing format instead of running which is
linked onto the round-off. Now it's important

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.440
when you're learning your back handspring
to have tons of matted floors. These are going

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.350
to be provided by your facility when you're
tumbling. Now the correct position to start

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.900
off with a back hand spring, you're going
to want to bend at the knees and rock back

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.220
on your heels as you take off. So it's really
important, your spotters are going to be behind

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.650
you, we're going to end up going completely
back and landing on the palms of our hands.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.670
Make sure you can keep your arms straight
and you want to do a little shrug at the shoulder

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.240
and then you're going to pop out of it, similarly
to how you would pop out of a handstand. Now

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.870
it's also important to learn, once you've
mastered your back handspring, the second

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.140
high level skill is going to be your tuck.
Now first you need to master your tuck jump,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.470
which is going to be this position here, knees
high up on the chest. And a tuck jump is basically

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.240
going to be this form with both your knees
hugged tightly to your chest in the air. You

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.500
can do a running tuck which is going to be
attached to your round-off, or your handspring,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.980
or you can do a standing still tuck, which
is going to be a different prep from our handspring.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.600
We're going to start stationary. We're going
to get up on our toes to get some momentum,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.060
and we're going to go straight in. It's really
important to ride your jump up when you're

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.760
doing a tuck. You really need to pull yourself
all the way to the tippy top before you go

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.860
into the tuck position. You want to hold that
position tightly until you spin all the way

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.450
around. Now a lot of us, when we're landing
our tucks, you're going to be in this position

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.970
down here on the floor a lot when you land
your tucks. That's ok, you're still learning,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.290
just get up out of if, and get a spot until
you can make that full rotation. Another tumble

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.620
which is really advanced is called a layout.
A layout's going to be a flip that's similar

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.700
to a tuck where your hands never make contact
to the ground. In the air your layout position

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.090
is basically going to be this. We're going
to do a full rotation in a flat position like

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.580
this. After you've mastered your layout, you
can start doing fulls which are the most fun

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.140
tumbling. A full is going to be a layout in
this position with a full rotation in the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.460
air. Those are the most difficult of tumbling
passages. A good way to master those is using

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.989
trampolines. You can use foam pits and also
definitely use lots of mats.
