00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.540
Where are you going?

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.320
To the toilet. If that's okay with you.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.020
Do you want me to come with you?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.420
*sigh* Bronson.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.960
What are you doing?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.820
Protecting you from the ghost.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.570
There is no ghost.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.220
There's your ghost.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.720
Do you want me to come in with you?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380
Don't be such a drop kick.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.320
You alright in there?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.220
Are you still in there, Linda?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.400
Listen, Bronson. Nick off!

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.480
Okay. I'm going!

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.540
Goodbye!

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.720
You'll be sorry!

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.540
Buzz off, Bronson!

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.540
Bronson, is that you?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.840
Are you there, Bronson?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.560
Aaaaaaah!

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.960
What's all the noise about?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.780
A ghost!

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.670
A ghost?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.460
What'd he look like?

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.319
Well, he wasn't that old. And he had a white hat on.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.119
Hmmm. Young Ned.
