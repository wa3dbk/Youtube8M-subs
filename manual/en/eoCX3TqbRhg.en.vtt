00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.900
everyone and a plot by packing dirt

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.709
not today

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:07.320
I'm going to be

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.890
feeling a mistake

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.429
net for said made with my

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.489
that's what it called the incidents surrounding
this

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:20.739
and that I or heard one and you would not
believe how many ever seen

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:25.909
now I received about want to do provide six
of these as uses six

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:26.550
and now

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.990
I don't know what they were thinking I just
every American over these many this mainly

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.260
he didn't specify

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.660
I did not you could order to save me give
you this for the order it but on I have six

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.910
of the sectors and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.890
you know they just

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.880
the man maintain a distant of

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.260
hard on the issue

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.470
so it's all I do have one these up in which
rising and on

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.530
fashion talking I think it is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.280
if the rest of the decide on

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.899
now I know people be asking me I think that
one of them what you can to get in for free

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.310
on one

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.880
I'm enough to make the same mistake that you

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.040
and that rights act passed last few days

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.290
parties and that's what's that that's something
I'm onstage or thought that an attack on a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.650
cynical as well

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.050
and this is what the in southern sector only
open one of these I find anathema was a point

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.790
of interest

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.650
this looks like a on 'em

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.750
so it is what it is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.380
topic at you direct that a free trial

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.680
you have to have a credit card numbers so
I don't know if you're willing to do that

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.680
on

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.280
my parents were five is free in the sheik
and so what then

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.110
after the fourteen-day period end of the Chinese
nine but I believe about ten bucks

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.210
and on

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.350
this does depend on where you live as well

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.820
so think it's a with they were picking at
the pre-trial on it works well but sometimes

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.550
the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.580
up close ties to the videos in the with it

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.570
yes

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.690
if you are so high if I thought I did

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.689
that number

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.470
the second decide is it worth

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.850
I'm watching and we making too much of a computer
for free and these are a lot of slack

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.030
as a result

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.780
%um

so also research economic challenges America

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.629

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.579
