00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
반갑슴니다!

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:12.350
You know, I don't even know how I got tipped off on this story, but apparently there is this strange craze in South Korea where people tune in to watch girls eat food.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.821
Now this shouldn't be a huge surprise since people 
 will tune in to watch just about anything

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:18.321
even if it's just bad

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.839
But to sit and watch someone eat food just seems totally ludicrous to me, as Mike Tyson would say.

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:29.408
But somehow, I found myself sitting in front of 
 my laptop watching these K-girls eat their food.

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:32.959
After I finished watching the entire video, I realized

00:00:33.098 --> 00:00:35.798
I just watched somebody eat their dinner.

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:38.881
Now, all this zaniness is trumped by one thing

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:40.411
The way they eat.

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:44.896
When they're eating noodles, like ram-yeon or ja-jang myeon,

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:48.917
they take their chopsticks and grab a big bunch of noodles,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.030
and then swirl it around in their dish to 
get more noodles on their chopsticks,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.880
and then stuff the entire thing in their mouths.

00:00:57.034 --> 00:00:58.834
But that's not where it ends.

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:03.965
See, when I eat noodles, I get a big bite and 
 then I chomp it off and chew.

00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:09.448
But these girls keep inhaling until they reach the 
 very end of the noodles.

00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:12.800
It doesn't matter how much food they already have in their mouths

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:15.356
They keep inhaling until they reach the end of the noodle.

00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:19.962
And when they've finished one bite, like a 1/4 of the dish is gone.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.966
I have never in my life seen anything like this before...

00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:26.631
I don't understand why they don't just chomp the noodles in half.

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:28.900
Now I'm sure that somebody out there is going to say,

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.356
"Hey, look, this is just the way that Korean people eat!"

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:34.456
Well, you know what?  Korean people don't eat like that.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.800
I have never seen Korean people eat like these girls do.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.300
A lot of it seems like embellishing or overacting 
 for effect, but still it's amazing.

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:48.194
Ok, so here's my challenge for you.

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:56.690
I challenge you to go check out one of these videos and see 
 if you can stop yourself from watching before these girls finish eating.

00:01:56.775 --> 00:02:00.980
I honestly think that you're going to fall victim like 
 I did, but maybe I'm just a sore loser.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.730
Anyway, thanks for watching.  Check out these girls pigging out.

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:08.270
See you next time.  Peace!
