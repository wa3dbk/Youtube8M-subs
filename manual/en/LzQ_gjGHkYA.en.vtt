00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.230
 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.200
 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.200
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.410
I've come out today to the wilds of Berkshire

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.790
I met my friend Tom on his farm and one of the things I really want to cook is hare.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.800
we've got too many wild hares

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.510
sometimes I see

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.390
40-50 hares a month in one field so we do need to thin the hares out every now and then

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.000
so we try and shoot maybe 12 or 15 hares a year, 
something like that

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.250
shall we see into this field because quite often - oh look at these deer

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.200
and they must do some significant damage
to this field as well

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.080
there's plenty of wild ingredients for
us to go out for

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.289
there's tons of deer, tons of hare, tons of rabbits, tons of pigeons

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.320
and it's a great excuse to test my new
Air Arms twin cylinder

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.479
firearms certificate air rifle. So that's the challenge: we're going to look for

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.700
some wild hares - creep out into the fields and see if we can get one.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.920
this is the field I want to go out into.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.320
There's a wild hare

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.360
the wild hare is 120 yards away

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.270
too much for an air rifle. I'll have to somehow approach the hare

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.399
crawl out to the hare, do you think?

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:55.399
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.240
okay we've just pulled up and between us we've spotted at least 15 hares

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.960
is this one field here - there's a lot of hares here!

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.009
so I've got the .22 air rifle

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.220
I'm just gonna check I got plenty
of pellets in the air rifle. It works off a magazine;

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.000
all you do is drop a pellet in, move it round

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.310
and they will do the job if on a still day I get

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.660
within 70 yards of the hare on a day like today

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.239
probably fifty yards and that's loaded

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.650
safety's on we're good to go

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.760
air rifle loaded and ready to go I set off

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.250
in the wild hare's direction I'm gonna go gently

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.340
and keep myself crouched to blend in
better remember there's a hedge behind

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.590
me

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.190
for cover this hare though seems pretty
busy preening and generally keeping out

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.120
the wind so I think I'm gonna shoot that hare

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.140
suddenly out of the corner of my eye I become aware of a herd of fallow deer standing off to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.000
one side

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.769
the fallow deer know we're here but for once they don't seem too bothered

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.590
typical now however great this air rifle
is, it is not deer legal

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.329
so I've got to ignore my spectators and
keep my eye on today's prize

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.930
the air rifle shot

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.269
is completely silent and absolutely
deadly

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.670
instantly kills the hare and the
fallow deer are completely unperturbed

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.910
I really can't believe this

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.810
here's the irony of what we do - I just stalked a hare with an air rifle and

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.299
look over there at that herd of fallow deer unbelievable and all I
have today

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.170
is an air rifle right let's go and get
our hare

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.900
okay okay so perfect hare I managed to
get to

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.440
about 55-60 yards out from him all I could see was the hairline on the hare's form

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.390
windy day like this is actually rather
good because the hare is hunkered up

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.760
and in the end I could just pick out the
bum end and the eye

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.019
there's a big crosswind blowing so I aimed about an inch and a half to the left

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.169
of the hare's head and my thinking was

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.070
if the wind doesn't affect, it will either kill the hare or miss the hare

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.350
my air rifle pellet hit the hare and the freaky thing about an air rifle is there is no noise

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.769
the hare

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.800
didn't know I was there this animal
never felt a thing

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.330
just instant kill I can't actually find the pellet hole

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.510
it's got to be in the head there and oh
I can feel the pellet hole thats is right between the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.310
eye and the ear

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.260
I've got to make sure the hare has no piddle in him

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.550
he hasn't so what we'll do is we'll take
this hare back to the farm Tom

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.600
we'll get a knife and gralloch and gut the hare

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.990
we'll hang the hare up and let him bleed and
this will be the most beautiful pink meat

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.800
I'm so happy with that I'm so happy that
hare never suffered never knew anything

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.350
I'm incredibly impressed with my Air Arms TC 510 twin cylinder air rifle

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.389
it is so accurate

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.620
unbelievably powerful and completely
silent

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.440
what a tool for the hunter's repertoire
before we leave though

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.979
I spotted some fantastic free
ingredients on the nearby hedge rows

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.030
I just can't let them go to waste and
they'll be perfect for the hair recipe

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.570
I've got planned. now they always say
what grows together goes together

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.300
what we've got here is some beautiful clusters of sloe berries

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.410
I going to collect a

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.919
good pocketful and I think for our hare I'm going to cook a

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.440
a sloe sauce

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.669
so all in all a highly successful
morning

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.280
and I'm sure we'll be back another day to seek out those fallow deer

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.320
in the meantime Tom and myself are off to gralloch and prepare the hare we stalked

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.689
for the scrumptious meal I've got planned

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.270
the

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.280
knob of butter, some of that lovely quince
jelly

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.750
get some colour on them they were gonna
pop the whole thing

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.350
straightening up

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.080
early winter collection

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.240
