Hi this is Matt Dinatale representing expertvillage.com.
In this clip, we are going to talk about how

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.330
to clean your PC tower. Why would you want
to clean your PC? Over time, dust builds up

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.580
inside the PC on the PC components and it
acts like a blanket on the PC components that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.951
causes more heat. So we definitely want to
clean that out, so lets get started. Depending

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:29.949
on your case, it is going to open up a little
differently so you want to check your manual.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:37.760
Most of the cases two screws on the back that
usually don't take any kind of flat head or

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.470
Philip screwdriver. I'm usually going to remove
these easily just by unscrewing them. Most

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.841
PCs usually have one latch or two latches,
depending on the model. My has two so it is

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:54.870
easy as just I'm pushing the latch in and
taking your other hand and pushing out on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.940
the PC case, doing the other latch and it
pretty much comes out like a door. Remove

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:11.210
the side cover and we will clean this in a
little bit. Now this PC is fairly clean, but

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.790
usually this is the CPU fan and there will
be dust that builds around the blades on here.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.979
Just behind that is the heat sink. They have
like little fins where dust likes to hide

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.810
in there, where you definitely want to get
in with the compressed air can. Also, depending

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.100
on your model PC, I have two here and here
internal fans for more air flow to the in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.640
the PC case and through to get the key out
of the PC case. This right here, is the video

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.619
card and these are hard drives. You definitely
want to make sure we blow those off with our

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.860
can of air. Just right here you could pick
up this anywhere at Home Depot or any place

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.520
like that. So basically there is really no
left or right. Just make sure you get all

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.560
the dust out of the case. I like to start
with the fan first so the dust would fall

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.689
down and then you could blow that away. So
once you blow in here, you'll be able to see

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:22.260
the dust fly through there. You do want to
make sure that you either put some people

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.450
put like newspaper or just a cloth down so
that when you are done the dust would fall

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.349
on there you could either put in the washer
and dryer or you could just throw the newspaper

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:39.769
out. This is the power supply which has a
fan in it, which does have a lot of dust in

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.150
it. Make sure you get into these little grits
here and in this side to and all over the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.799
board; top to bottom. As you could see here
like I said the heat sink make sure you get

00:02:51.799 --> 00:03:00.540
the tip of the air there in those little grits
so it forces any kind of dust out of there

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.559
on both sides. Also in the video card, this
also has a heat sink so make sure you get

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:23.269
right in those little grits.
Also you hard drive and the fan and on the

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:36.079
bottom of the case. Now if you noticed, the
side cover of the PC case there was this.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.500
This was this helps the CPU fan and take air
so it cools it off better, so we definitely

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:51.069
want to make sure we clean this up. So you
could see the dust come out of there, and

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.209
sometimes there may be build up on the bottom
of the case or even on the walls that won't

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:03.510
come off with the air can. So you may want
to take a damp cloth and clean that off, but

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.650
this doesn't have any so I don't need to.
So that is pretty much it. Once you don't

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.979
see any more dust and you have checked all
the corners of the PC case, you could go ahead

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.789
and put the side case back on. Plug in your
PC and you are good to go.
