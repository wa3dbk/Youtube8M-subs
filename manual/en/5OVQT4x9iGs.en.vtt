00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:09.290
This is the improv warm up or icebreaker called
Sheriff, Bandit, Victim. And it's not as gruesome

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.240
as it sounds. This is a fun icebreaker that
you can use in any size group because you

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.800
do it in groups of three. So you can break
people into groups around the room. It's also

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.010
a good icebreaker for getting people kind
of flexible, getting them on their toes, and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.710
aware of what's going on around them. So how
it works once you get in groups of three is

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.850
you show them that there are three different
characters or signals or choices for this

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.960
type of game. The first one is sheriff. And
the sheriff has their hand on their hip and

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.670
they are showing the badge like this. This
is sheriff right here; I'm showing you my

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.659
badge. The next one is bandit: two guns slinging.
Stick 'em up. The third one is victim, with

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.979
the hands in the air. Okay? sheriff, bandit,
victim. So what you're going to do in your

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.790
group of three is you're going to have each
group count themselves in one, two, three,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.770
show. When you hit show each person is going
to strike one of those poses, or pick one

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.009
of those characters. They are either going
to be a sheriff, a bandit, or a victim. Now

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.251
they don't want to wait and see what other
people have chosen. They want to show at the

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:24.240
exact same time because what will happen is
you'll often get two people showing the same

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.659
thing. And what they need to do at that moment
is adjust and modify what they are so that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.210
you have one of each. So you want to end up
with one sheriff, one bandit and one victim

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.760
by the end of the round. So often times it
will go like this. One, two, three, show.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.829
So you can imagine that my other partners
are adjusting with me. So that's the important

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.460
thing to stress in this game. It's not to
wait and do the right thing. Everybody just

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.679
make a jump for it at the same time and then
see what's needed and adjust. That's the skill.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.061
The skill is looking at what's there, looking
at what's needed, and becoming what's needed,

00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:07.320
which is a great skill in improv and in life.
A good modification with this game if you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.530
are doing it with your business or special
organization is you can make those positions

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.340
whatever fits specific to your group. So if
it's in a classroom, you could do teacher,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.250
student, principal, and come up with your
own principal, and come up with your own poses.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.260
If it's firemen, you might come up with the
truck, the hose and the ladder. You know,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.150
whatever fits with your group. So customize
it. Make it personal. But my version that

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.260
I just taught you is sheriff, bandit, victim.
