WALK THROUGH A WEDDING
with Justin &amp; Mary

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.160
Shooting The Couple
When It's Dark Outside

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.130
Hey guys, we are Justin &amp; Mary

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.160
and today we are going to talk to you about
getting a night shot of the couple.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.160
Now, Justin and I live in New England.
A lot of you guys might face similar circumstances

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.760
where it's January in New England and
at 4 pm when you come out of the church,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.960
with the couple who didn't want to
see each other beforehand,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.060
it's already dark outside.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.560
As professional photographers we can either just do
a couple of safe shots and move on to the reception

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.360
or we can realise that whatever circumstances we are
given, it's our job to find a way to work it out

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.760
and get that shot that 62,5 years from now
they're gonna have on their mantel in a silver frame.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.060
We have to be the ones who step up and say:
"It doesn't matter what the weather is doing outside,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.360
or whether there's daylight or darkness.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.460
Whatever happens, we are gonna get that shot for you."

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.260
One of the really interesting things about this shot
that we got is that we can take these things that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.360
on their surface seem like a negative, that seem
like a draw back for where we are shooting

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.860
and if we know what we are doing, and if
we have the right tools in our tool belts

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.160
we can actually use that as our advantage
to get something that is really remarkable

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
and something that is worth remarking on.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.360
When we went outside we went to our number one
modifier for this kind of situation,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.760
which is the 2x2' Softbox.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.360
We really love this softbox because it's portable
and it's going to allow that ambient light to do

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.760
what it would naturally do in the background.
