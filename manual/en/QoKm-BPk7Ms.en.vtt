Hey, I'm Harry, and this is show and tell

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.460
That's where I show you something awesome,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.260
and then I tell you about it.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.960
Today, I brought my very own monster truck.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.280
Monster trucks are the COOLEST.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.300
They sound like this:

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.500
[makes truck noises]

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.900
Ha ha ha ha

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.160
And they get really sweet names like Big Foot,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.560
and Batman,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.360
and Big Dog,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.060
and El Diablo,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.860
and Iron Man,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.120
and Crash Master.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.840
I wish my name was Crash Master...

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.700
Anyway, I named my monster truck

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.320
Hercules, because he's the strongest monster truck EVER.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.920
Monster trucks start out like regular trucks,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.780
but then they get big and strong,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.820
and they grow giant wheels.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.620
That's because we eat all our vegetables!

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.300
Really?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.760
Yes, well mostly beans cuz they give you gas and lots of gas makes a truck run!

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.440
Ohhh, cool!

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.160
Monster trucks can do all kinds of tricks!

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.580
Like flip over and do big jumps over like 20 cars.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.200
Monster trucks can even jump sooo high,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.760
they could probably jump over a dinosaur!

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.420
Hey! Cut that out!

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.320
Monster trucks are so strong they can push other cars around!

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.280
Yeah, like this!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.440
Ha! And monster trucks can DANCE!

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.320
Uh, we do not call it dancing,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.140
we call it freestyle!

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.700
Oh, sorry...

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.420
But check out THIS freestyle!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.840
Hey...

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.780
What if a monster drove a monster truck??

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.180
Cool!

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.920
Hi Frankenstein!

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.460
[grunts]

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.920
Heh, he's not so good with words...

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.600
Anyway, basically, monster trucks are the COOLEST toys

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.320
and I play with mine every day!

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.180
And one day, I'm going to go to a real-life monster truck rally,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.060
Mhmm!

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.620
So what's your favorite toy? Tell me!

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.820
And if you had your own monster truck, what would you name him?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.500
