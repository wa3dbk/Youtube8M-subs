Hi.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.170
I am Phil, I am a food and diet writer.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.270
And welcome back to
my Lighter Option Series.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.279
This series is great for showing
some quick and easy family favorites.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.410
All the fat has been
stripped right back and been boosted with

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.740
lots of fruit and
vegetables.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.710
[Music]

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.490
In today's episode I am going to make a vegetable
packed

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.490
minestrone soup.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.730
It is great for lunch, dinner, or anytime
you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.730
want a quick snack.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.410
It is crammed full of vitamins and
minerals and it is all cooked in one pan.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.540
So spray a large deep pan with low calorie
spray or oil.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:45.249
Add 1 large chopped onion, 2 sticks of
chopped celery, 2 carrots, and a leek.

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.059
Try and make sure all the vegetables are chopped
nice and small so you get a

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.459
really nice mixed spoonful when you come to
eat the soup.

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:55.501
Leave that to fry for about 5 minutes, just
until the

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.399
vegetables are tinged golden and starting
to soften.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.370
You can find all the ingredients for this
in the description books.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.950
Once the vegetables have started to soften,
you will notice it

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.510
is a bit gold on the base of the pan.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.240
That will add lots of
flavor to the finished soup.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.680
Add in a teaspoon of fennel seed
that has been crushed, that adds a really

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.490
nice flavor, 2
tablespoons of tomato puree, a pinch of chili

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.310
flakes and 2
cloves of crushed garlic.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.890
Give that a stir and just let that cook for
a minute, just to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.170
release all the aromas.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:38.880
Then, add a can of chopped tomatoes, a teaspoon
of sugar

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.250
and 75 grams of small pasta.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.510
I am using chopped spaghetti.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.040
You can use macaroni, small pasta shells or
anything you

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.790
have got to hand.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.829
Give that a stir just to remove all the caramelized
flavor from

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.630
the bottom of the pan, and pour in 1 and a
half liters of hot

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.490
vegetable stock.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.329
I am using reduced salt
stock just so it is extra healthy.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.679
And season that with black
pepper.

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.020
Bring that to the boil, then reduce to a simmer
and leave to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.940
cook for about 20 minutes, until the pasta
is cooked through

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.150
and all the vegetables are tender.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.050

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.060
So now it has been simmering for 20 minutes.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.060
Everything is
nice and tender.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.560
Ready to add the 2 final ingredients, which
are 200 grams of frozen peas and a small bunch

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.200
of parsley
that has been finely chopped.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.190
Just stir that through and leave for 5 more
minutes, until

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.849
the peas heat through and the flavor is infused.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:34.849
Okay.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.260
The soup is completely cooked now, so it is
ready to

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.260
serve.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.560
It is the perfect soup for making ahead.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.110
It will keep in
the fridge for 3 to 4 days.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.659
Or portion up and freeze it.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.231
This
should cram in at least 2 of your 5 a day

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:46.939
in every portion and
it is a great complete meal because it has

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.150
got the pasta and
all the vegetables in it too.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.250
There you have my vegetable packed minestrone
soup.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.520
Come back, next time, for the next episode
of Lighter

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520
