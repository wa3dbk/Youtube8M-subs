Somehow the name Franken Camera seems to
have stuck. The idea is in fact to build a

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:09.005
camera that we can program right down to
the microsecond level. And where we can

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.703
swap out the lenses, we can swap out the
sensor, we can put other things inside the

00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:18.010
camera that we want to play with, and we
can program it easily. Existing cameras

00:00:18.513 --> 00:00:22.876
cannot be programmed. Single lens reflex
camera that you buy from Cannon or Nikon

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:27.447
is a closed proprietary platform. &gt;&gt; It
looks like very custom construction it

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.375
really actually is a bunch of off the
shelf parts &gt;&gt; In general confrontation

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:35.255
photography should let you fix more things
that you cannot currently fix by combining

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:39.701
the multiple pictures that it took in
different way or by fiddling with the

00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:44.147
optic so that more is being recorded than
a normal camera records. &gt;&gt; Itâ€™s bit too

00:00:44.364 --> 00:00:48.647
dark on the left side if you open up the
aperture that looks fine but now this is

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.058
too bright I can take those two shots and
throw them into Photoshop and get this

00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:57.347
nice result where both of those are well
exposed. I want my camera to be able to do

00:00:57.496 --> 00:01:01.789
that automatically right after I take the
shot. But the main large board here is a

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:06.453
development board for the CPU we're using.
&gt;&gt; But sometimes you'd like to be able to

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:10.828
adjust the focus after you take the
picture rather than having a picture in

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.722
which, in which just one thing is in focus
or in which everything is in focus. So if

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:19.868
you place a micro-lens array into the
camera we've shown that you can re,

00:01:20.098 --> 00:01:24.115
refocus it, change the focus after you
take the picture. &gt;&gt; You could have also,

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.182
this high dynamic range mode, in which you
are changing, setting the camera to,

00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:31.744
[inaudible], to go to three different
exposures. &gt;&gt; The whole field of

00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:35.651
computational photography is, and will
change, the way we do photography. The

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:40.015
question is, what do people work on next?
So for the last ten years, there's been a

00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:43.821
megapixel war, as everyone knows. That's
finally winding down. The Asian camera

00:01:44.177 --> 00:01:48.185
manufacturers can no longer compete based
on the number of megapixels, so they are

00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:52.499
beginning to compete on one other feature.
We'd like them to offer lots and lots of

00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:56.457
features that the research community is
currently working on. And to offer those

00:01:56.762 --> 00:02:00.568
all at once, not merely when they want to
compete with one another. &gt;&gt; The most

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:04.577
satisfying result would be something
completely unexpected. We would like to.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.298
To make these programmable enough that a
student in a course or another researcher

00:02:09.988 --> 00:02:14.507
in a university can pick one of these up
and create something that they couldn't

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:18.209
have been able to create on other existing
camera platforms.
