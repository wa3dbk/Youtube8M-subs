Hi, this is Tyson with another SketchUp Skill
Builder for you.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.400
This time around let's look at a tip for editing
Components and Groups.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.300
These beams are all components, and they're
embedded within this building so I'm going

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.829
to double click to go down through the nested
levels and start editing them.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.079
Now if I were to go in and want to edit some
of the details, you can see that the other

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.940
geometry might get in the way as I'm working
on this component, but there is a simple way

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.940
around this.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.239
If I go to the View menu to Component Edit
I can Hide Rest of Model.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:02.329
And I can also Hide Similar Components, making
it very easy to edit just this component.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.630
Go in and actually hides that component.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.159
And now, make some changes.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.970
And if I were to View, turn that off.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.690
You can see all these changes are perpetuated.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.320
Now that's really helpful, however going back
and forth to the View menu is somewhat cumbersome.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.440
So, I recommend opening up your preferences
and assigning this a keyboard shortcut.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.470
Filter by "component" and you can find Edit&gt;Hide
Rest of Model and Edit&gt;Hide Similar Components

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.740
and I've assigned each of these a keyboard
shortcut that works for me.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.060
And you can see now, I can toggle the rest
of the model or similar components on and off.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.630
I hope this tip was helpful.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.060
Give it a try yourself!
