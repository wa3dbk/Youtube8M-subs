double-sided whenever possible.

Print only when necessary.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.719

Encourage your office to purchase chlorine-free
paper with high post-consumer recycled content.

after use.

Step 3.

have to use disposable cups.

Plastic containers come in a wide variety
of shapes and sizes—from sandwich-shaped

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.299
to one that features separate covered sections
for dips and condiments.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.299
Step 6.

When the sun shines, open the shades and use
minimal artificial light.

Step 9.

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:48.799
Ask your employer to consider letting employees
work from home a few days a week, to cut down

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.799
on commuting.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.490

worth of electricity each year by being left
