Hi, this is Paul Lewis from Puppetsnstuff.com.
You can find us on the worldwide web at www.puppetsnstuff.com

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.520
on behalf of Expert Village.com. I would like
to welcome you. Today I am going to teach

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.490
you how to build a moving mouth puppet which
is a basic moving mouth puppet that you can

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.090
use in your next puppet production. First
we are going to start out with some supplies

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.870
that we are going to need so you might want
to jot this down as I show them to you one

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.339
by one. We are going to need a bunch of hot
glue sticks, hair dryer, and hot glue gun

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:53.410
and box cutters. This over here is a piece
of cardboard cut from a juice box and the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.760
cardboard is going to be cut in a rectangle.
It is going to be about 4 ½ x 6 inches. We

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.820
are also going to need some cataphyll fleece.
A half-yard cataphyll fleece will do the trick.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.560
Any color that you want your puppet to be.
The neat thing about cataphyll fleece is that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.970
it comes in a whole variety of colors and
by the way, most of the materials you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.420
buy at your local fabric store or craft store.
Over here we have a sheet of rubber. Normally

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.791
these come in rectangle but I have been cutting
pieces off building a bunch of puppets. So,

00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:35.360
it is not a rectangle right now but they do
come in rectangular shapes red rubber. Over

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.810
here, is a piece of 1 inch foam rubber and
we have cut it into kind of a square about

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:50.320
7 ½ x 7 inches. We are going to need a sheet
of felt, black felt preferably. We are going

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.740
to need right over here is kind of a little
brush with foam rubber at the end. We are

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.909
going to be working with contact cement later
on so this will be able to be your tool for

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.540
dabbing on the contact cement. Of course,
we are going to need our contact cement. We

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.340
are going to need some scissors. We are going
to need a pom-pom. Over here we have a bunch

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.560
of little tabs of felt and they are adhesive
pieces so you can peel them off the paper

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.290
and stick them on your character. I will show
you what they are for later on. But again

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.160
you can buy them at your local craft store
and fabric store. Magic marker and craft fur

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.639
and little marabou bows. Of course, we are
going to need a sewing machine. Over here,

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:38.299
we have a little glass of water and it is
not to drink. We are going to be using it

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.510
when we work with our hot glue and I will
show you a little trick there that will save

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.609
you a lot of time and could also keep you
from getting burnt. If I had a penny for every

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.730
time I got burnt with a hot glue gun for not
using that water, I would be a millionaire

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.609
by now. So, we are definitely going to keep
that water right over there. I think that

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.060
is about it for our supplies so when we come
back we are going to start building our puppet.
