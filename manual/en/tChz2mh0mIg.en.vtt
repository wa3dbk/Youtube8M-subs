Hi I am Andrea, this is Sarah.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.009
We are from the lifestyle blog Peanut Buttered.com.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.519
Welcome to our Keep Calm and Bake series and
today we are going to be making honeycomb.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:18.039
[music]
So we are going to put four tablespoons of

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.891
golden syrup into the pan.

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:22.439
For the full list of ingredients and method
just check the description box below.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.949
So the pan is on a medium heat right now.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.820
It will take about five minutes or so.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.120
You want to make sure it is nice and bubbling
and that all the sugar has dissolved.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.399
There is not a better sight in life than this,
it is like bubbling molten gold.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.280
It is very beautiful, and it smells delicious
as well, it smells really good.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.610
So we have got some reusable baking parchment
ready to go.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.770
The next step is going to happen quite quickly.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.160
We have got a teaspoon and a half of baking
soda, we are going to throw it into the pot

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.289
and whisk it up very quickly and it is going
to woosh up into a cloud.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.590
It is really cool but it happens very quickly
so we have to be nice and prepared.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.490
In goes the baking soda and here we go.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.370
Look at that.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.500
It is like a big frothy cloud.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.890
Just try and get all of it out as quickly
as you can.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.200
We need to let it sit for about twenty minutes,
half an hour, it does depend on the temperature

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.260
of your kitchen.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.970
What I like to do when I am at home is to
leave a window open so the nice cool air comes

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.970
through.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.320
But if your kitchen is a bit warm maybe put
it in the fridge to help it along for a little

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.320
bit.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320
We have taken it out of the fridge.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.690
[tap tap tap]
We think it is set.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.360
It is nice and shiny and hard so I am going
to give it a good bash.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.890
This is the fun bit.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.630
[laughs]
Oh gosh.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.280
Can I have one little go?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.280
Yeah.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.560
[laughs]
Because it does look so much fun

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.140
[laughs]
Maybe I should not have had a go.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.080
[laughs]
Okay, yeah, maybe try to keep it on the plate.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.110
Okay we have got a nice little presentation
box here to take around to our friends party.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.020
Just put in and it is going to look really
pretty.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.580
In addition to this you can also dip the pieces
in chocolate for kind of a crunchy effect.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.170

Should we keep a few for ourselves?

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.990
I think we need to try some, yep, definitely.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.989
