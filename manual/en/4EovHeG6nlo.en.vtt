00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.830
I'm Mandy Butler on behalf of Expert Village
and we're going to talk about tumble track

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:13.130
warm ups today. Next, I'm going to go through
the standing back hand spring. This is a big

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.280
deal for cheerleading on the middle school
and high school level because a lot of squad

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.420
require you to have a back handspring before
you're even eligible to try out, so a lot

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.180
of people try to rush through this skill.
It's very important that you take your time

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.610
and do it correctly because it's not safe
otherwise. What I'm going to do is I'm going

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.610
to sit with my chest up, knees slightly bent,
and I'm leaning backwards. Just before I do

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.362
the back handspring, I'll feel that if I moved
any farther back, I would fall on my back.

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:53.220
I must jump in order to keep myself from falling
backwards. It's a little bit tricky. Your

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.160
body will get used to that sensation, but
you're going to sit and move backwards. Right

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.260
at the moment where you feel like you're going
to fall, that's when you know to jump yourself

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.910
backwards into a back handspring position.
When I hit my hands on the mat, it's very

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.240
important that I keep my arms nice and straight.
Again, a tumble track is a great tool to teach

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.940
this because there's less resistance and so
you're less likely to bend your arms, hit

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.180
your head, and hurt you neck or your head.
I'm going to sit, swing my arms backwards.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.550
I'm going to extend my arms and go into a
bridge position. The last step of back handspring

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.900
once I hit my hands on the mat is to bring
my legs over in handstand snap down position.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.750
I'm going to bring my toes and my feet over
my head, squeezing my bottom, landing in a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.729
soft landing. I don't want to land completely
straight because it's dangerous for my knee.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.409
I'm going to land slightly bent. Again, you
have a little bit more leeway with tumble

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.460
track because it's a softer surface. If you
take the same skill to the floor, you land

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.940
straight legged. You're not going to get away
with it without hurting yourself. Chest up.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.340
This is the standing back handspring.
