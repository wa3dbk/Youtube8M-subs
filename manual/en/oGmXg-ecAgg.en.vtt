00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.060
I'm going to show you how to barbecue brisket.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.070
Now, what I've done is I've taken a round
strain of brisket, cut it into a very thin

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.660
steak; I've still got the string on.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.590
Now, I'm just going to lay that onto the barbecue.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.390
You do have to be careful because you do have
this happening there, it can fall to pieces.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.690
Now, what I've done to this particular barbecue,
is what you've done to all barbecues, is I've

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.290
put the coals on half of it.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.810
What you're going to do is drag the joints
of beef from one side to the other.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.200
If I feel it's getting a little bit overcooked
on this side, also once it's finished, you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.910
can also finish half a joint on the other
side, and there, carry on cooking the rest

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.380
of your barbecue with the meat here, retaining
its heat but not cooking a bit more.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.860
So, this now is going to cook now for probably
another minute and a half and then I'm going

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.619
to flip it over because I'm concerned that
this may break up.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.200
It's always kind of continuous, one of these.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.920
Just make sure that when you do run it, you
always run it this way rather than that way

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.450
which is a lot harder to work with.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.780
But that way, you can just get underneath
it and just turn it around.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.530
And if I've still got my tongs here, I can
still put that little bit there just to satisfy

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.810
myself, and we're going to carry on cooking
that meat now, probably for another two and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.810
a half minutes.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.009
Now, I'm just going to talk a little bit about
the cut of meat that we are cooking which

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.130
is about the brisket.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.750
It comes from the belly, really, and if you
think about it, the belly doesn't do a great

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.759
deal.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.380
I think it's probably better as a stew, or
by salting it and boiling it, is so big, and

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.749
that's the most traditional way of cooking
it.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.979
You see, I think any kind of meat works well
especially if it's been charred properly.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.620
We're going to turn it back around again and
as you can see, there's some really lovely

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.069
color on that.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.650
And that, ladies and gents, is how you barbecue
brisket.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.500
And I actually think, just to finish this
off, what you might want to do is once you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.390
plate it up, just add a garlic butter or an
herb butter, maybe barbecue with some tomato

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.360
or mushroom on the side, just to make it king
of all dishes.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360
But that's how you barbecue brisket.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360
In this VideoJug film, chef Matt Kemp, a regular
Video Jug contributor, shows you how to barbecue

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.360
a beef brisket.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.360
He shows you the importance of taking care
when turning the tender meat on the grill,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360
the part of the animal the meat is cut from
and some tantalizing ways to serve it with

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.360
various sauces, butters and garnish.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360
By watching and listening to Matt, you will

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.369
