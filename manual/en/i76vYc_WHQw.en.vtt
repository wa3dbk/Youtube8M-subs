00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.540
Space Fans and welcome to the first Space
Fan News of 2012.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.510
First up, the SETI astronomers have started
pointing their telescopes at the Kepler planet

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.650
candidates that you may remember were announced
in 2011.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.360
It is generally thought, that in our search
for extra terrestrial intelligence, it makes

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.460
sense to look for those signs from planets
that are more like the Earth.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.250
This doesn't mean that life can't form in
strange planets with harsh environments, but

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.789
when starting out, we should look in places
where we know live can evolve into a civilization

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.099
- places like the Earth.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.530
While the Kepler team has not confirmed all
of these candidates - also called Kepler Objects

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.449
of Interest - as being Earth sized planets
within a habitable zone, the SETI team started

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:40.679
looking anyway.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.499
Specifically, they are looking in a region
of the radio spectrum called the Terrestrial

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.209
Microwave Window.

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:50.299
These are the radio frequencies that can penetrate
the noise of both interstellar space and our

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:51.679
own atmosphere.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.449
They are looking in a special narrow range
of frequencies within this window known as

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.940
the “Water Hole,” which if you watched
the movie 'Contact' you will find it significant

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.650
that these frequencies are around 21 cm where
spectral lines that are associated with the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.899
disassociation of water are located.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.690
The argument goes like this: since water is
presumed to be necessary for life to exist,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.509
an alien civilization might choose to broadcast
their existence at this wavelength in an attempt

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.509
to find others.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.460
That assumes, of course, that they are looking
in the first place and want to be found.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.270
I know, it's a long shot, but hey, based on
what we know about life in the universe so

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.090
far, which is nothing, it's worth a try!

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.759
Anyway, after spending some months sifting
through data, they are publishing some of

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:37.969
the results.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.630
They are not reporting any alien signals,
but they are finding some interesting characteristics

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.689
of some of the signals.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.110
These are the results from KOI 817 and 812.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.409
What's interesting about them, according to
the SETI team, is that these signals, while

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.790
nothing more than interference they are careful
to say, look similar to what we can expect

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.069
to see from a broadcasting civilization.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.710
For example,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.159
The signals have a narrow frequency as you
can see from the very thin line, much thinner

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.629
than atmospheric noise, and they are drifting
in frequency over time, which make them look

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.409
like diagnonal lines in these plots.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.050
This is the signal shifting towards longer
or shorter wavelengths due to the doppler

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.590
effect of the motions between us and the Kepler
planets.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.920
If you look carefully you can see that the
frequency starts in one location, then as

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.349
time passes, ends up at another frequency.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.459
Which way this diagonal line points depends
on the actual motion of the planet at the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.299
time these were recorded: if the planet is
moving towards us, the line drifts toward

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.220
shorter wavelengths, going away, towards longer
wavelengths.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.000
So, while these signals are nothing but interference,
probably from us, these results are promising

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.890
because they are a confirmation that the algorithms
they are using to find these telltale signs

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.680
of life appear to be working as they continue
their analysis on other Kepler Objects of

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680
Interest.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.370
Next, astronomers have discovered that there
were supermassive black holes in the universe

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.319
much earlier than expected, as early as 700
million years after the Big Bang.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.140
What's surprising about this is that supermassive
black holes become supermassive only after

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.810
lots and lots of galaxy collisions, with the
black hole getting bigger after each collision

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.519
as the previously two black holes merge into
one.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.000
When the universe was a few hundred million
years old, the first stars and galaxies were

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.299
just forming.

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.079
Everything was just starting out: stars, galaxies,
even black holes.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.319
It has always been thought that most black
holes from this period in the universe's history

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.080
would be small because they wouldn't have
had a chance to gobble up enough material

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.560
to become supermassive.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.870
Well, it turns out that is not the case.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.099
Using observations from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, astronomers found supermassive

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.329
black holes at a time when the universe was
less than 1 billion years old.

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.989
They were the same size as today's most massive
black holes, which have had 13.6 billion years

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.219
to form.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.510
So this was strange.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.800
How could there be such big black holes from
so early when it takes the whole age of the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.579
universe for others to reach the same mass?

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.120
So this discovery was very surprising.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.390
For those who don't know, there are two main
classes of black holes: stellar-sized ones

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.850
that are around 30 times larger than the Sun
and are roaming around inside our galaxy.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.950
The second type is way more massive.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.450
These are usually found in the centers of
galaxies and are billions of times larger

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.490
than the mass of the Sun.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.010
These supermassive black holes are the largest
in the universe and are believed to form from

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.290
the collisions of galaxies when their central
black holes combine into a larger one.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.700
As more collision occur, the black hole gets
larger and larger.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.410
The problem though, is that in the first few
millions of years after the Big Bang, galaxies

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.630
were too few and too far apart to merge.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.670
So to find out how these black holes could
form so early, astronomers ran a massive simulation

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.830
to try to understand the observations from
Sloan.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.580
This simulation was so sophisticated that
it allowed them to zoom in on interesting

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.980
events occurring while the simulation ran.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.260
As they zoomed in to the creation of the first
supermassive black holes in their simulation,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.440
they saw something unexpected.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.950
Normally, in supermassive black holes we see
today, when cold gas flows toward a black

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.640
hole it collides with other gas in the surrounding
galaxy.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.140
This causes the cold gas to heat up and then
cool back down before it enters the black

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.540
hole.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.600
This process, called shock heating, would
stop black holes in the early universe from

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.720
growing fast enough to reach the masses found
in these observations.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.460
Instead, no shock heating was occuring in
the early black holes.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.770
They saw in their simulation thin streams
of cold dense gas flowing along the filaments

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.800
that give structure to the universe and straight
into the center of the black holes at very

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.160
high speed, feeding them at a fast rate, with
no shock heating.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.830
This uncontrolled consumption caused the black
holes to grow exponentially faster than the

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.230
galaxies in which they reside.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.810
So that's one possible explanation as to how
there could be such large black holes so early

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.460
in the universe.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.291
One more cool thing came out of this: since
a galaxy forms when a black hole forms, these

00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:21.000
results could also shed light on how the first
galaxies formed, giving us even more clues

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.630
as to how the universe came to be.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.010
That's it for this week Space Fans, don't
forget next week is the AAS where I will post

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.810
a video a day from Monday to Thursday to talk
about the amazing discoveries and science

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.070
that's sure to come out of the meeting.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:44.340
I can't believe we've been doing this for
an entire year!

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:51.780
Well, thanks for watching and, as always,
keep looking up!
