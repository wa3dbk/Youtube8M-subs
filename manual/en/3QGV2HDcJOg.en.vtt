00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.190
abilities failed in the colorado senate
committee that it was being discussed in

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.220
and i want to talk about particularly
with you one because colorado and also

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.830
because uh... were i'm from from
connecticut and texas uh... this is not

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.870
how to reform but

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.009
what c_b_s_ think

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.420
underscored the drinks with dad billing
but it would have allowed

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.699
is for people between eighteen and
twenty one two

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.140
purchased drinks

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.789
in like restaurants and things like that
as long as there was a legal guardian

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.659
now we're as i said i'm from connecticut
exit where this is already legal they're

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.859
actually eleven states that allow
eighteen-year-olds to drink alcohol with

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.630
parental approval now so that's going to
say i didn't know that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.110
because since i was not one of them i
didn't know that you were allowed to

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.969
play hillbilly blood river

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.920
income like adding nine predominately
both everywhere really that's funny

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.379
because there was nothing then stumbles
they grow up in every state it just it

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.639
just seems like people let's do some
details i will talk about the merits of

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:52.260
it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.260
uh... state senator gregg brophy us said
that he got the idea when he took his

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.469
daughter out with his wife for her
birthday

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.680
and because she was twenty she couldn't
happen to celebrate drink

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.590
i think there's interesting quote but
this is from senator t_v_ food at the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.669
dog democrat

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:10.799
uh... if i want my daughter to have
margaritas with the vote invite her over

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.259
to my house seven next in the polls
she's actually in opposition to the

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.869
should like do you have nothing you can
forget any negative through find then

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.690
they have a call from a democratic and
set by excel

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.470
and it's a republican introduce this
bill and at the state senate beginning

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.290
at this time of someone drinks

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.350
company apple not our but

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.430
on that note though there are actually a
couple of groups obviously mothers

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.880
against drunk drivers and expressing
concern about this so have the car at a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.430
restaurant association the car for trial
order

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.000
police the rest are association says
that puts all the burden of making

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.190
decisions of complaints and answered
alcohol entre servers enter operator's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.530
legitimacy and that the cancer in there

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.390
but i think it will probably see windy a
great thing if its capacity head

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.970
the way that i see this in u_s_ tell me
what you think is that the reason of the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.580
united states has such a problem with
alcoholism and with drinking n with

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.700
intriguing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.770
is because they're such just a minute
advil around drinking until you're the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.490
age of twenty one whereas in other
countries

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.479
lake in europe and the u_k_ oc

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.549
and thailand kit

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.939
pretty much if you can grow mustache and
the guy if you can look over the bar

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.400
you're allowed to drink

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.959
and i think that women that supports out
of the physical intimacy than seventy

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.589
without acceptance comes a higher

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:29.729
you know comes morally area that i don't
mean tolerance in a sense of building up

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.060
a number of cartons

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.940
i mean a tolerance of you know drinking
alcoholic is ok and teaching

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.790
they need to drink alcohol in moderation
and getting that acceptance passed out

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.889
from your parents

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.239
on any other when my parents were in
college they had three to wall which was

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.719
that if you were a tune up you could
drink free to be here

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.779
i don't know because i wasn't

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:54.040
freed himself most areas like six point
one percent on our site dot but reaching

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.499
there as three point decided on

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.449
well yeah i mean i think that allowing
it that drinking anything that's a legal

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:04.669
kind of any kind enticing which will be
going to make their i want to do it

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:05.749
because i can't do it

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.769
yet but i think that it and and that you
know i'm dozens of another one of those

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.129
issues where i was in a row but i can
swing cause i don't know but they say

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.170
that they think

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.790
but the higher prevalence but there's a
much higher problem today an underage

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.929
drinking in binge drinking and that
perhaps that is because

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:23.509
on the fact that you're not allowed to
drink it you know eighty not be reminded

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:24.929
that you care sub

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:28.519
i think in nineteen eighty four that the
states have these lines

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.060
where people are allowed to drink carry
out the colorado you can drink

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.639
legally at

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.819
horrible with apparently carried
scenario stop-gap live how they have she

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.370
also some yeah i think the anything that
makes it so that the first time with

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.529
somebody goes to a frat party they don't
absolutely was their shit

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:47.529
white because the light dot i can't read
if i want to like it should just be like

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:51.030
a steady gradient of slightly more
familiarity with drinking

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.890
and then your party might take a little
bit more than you would at a restaurant

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.579
family but shouldn't go crazy and i
think that that this is sort of

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.199
over your resident of prohibitions

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.369
when we don't think they should be a lot
what i think the same thing goes for

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:07.649
sacks like in households that teach that
sex is okay and sex is a normal part of

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.259
of human life and they need to be safe
about it

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:14.339
you see a lot higher rates of unsafe
acts and condom use and healthy attitude

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:15.450
about sex whereas

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.579
distrustful of and schools that teach
abstinence only you see a hugely higher

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.789
rate of unprotected sex

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.199
and what are you laughing at us

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.670
don hasn't really immature like

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.830
you see a much higher rate of
unprotected sex not safe sex abortion

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.650
rates

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.510
teen pregnancy rate at c_b_s_

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.600
uh... so and i just think it goes like
this in mind that if there's except in

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.340
certain ratios

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.509
talking to people deal that letter

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.069
sohc twenty fourteen let's see the
return of drinks with that's
