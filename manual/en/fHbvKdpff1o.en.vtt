00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.990
Welcome to Expert Village I'm Steve Blank
your electronic drum coach here to demonstrate

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.350
what we can do with electronic drums.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.970
We might use electronic drums with acoustic
drums or instead of acoustic drums. Let's

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.460
see how they are different!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:30.409
An acoustic cymbal you hit it very lightly
you can here them and if you get louder it

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:40.770
will keep getting louder. Electronic cymbal,
my softest hit doesn't trigger. But it's a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:51.870
point at which I have to hit it hard enough
for it to even make a sound. Then it gets

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.310
to a certain point, it doesn't get louder.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:24.840
Acoustic drum, same thing! Soft! Electronic
drum! So the dynamic range is much different

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.140
much more limited with electronics.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.960
You hit any part of the drum and it pretty
much sounds the same, the cymbal. With an

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.990
acoustic drummer cymbal, the sound changes
as you change where you are hitting the drummer

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.840
cymbal. There's another area where electronic
drums are more limited and that's just dynamic

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.910
feel. Something like the snare drum or the
high-hat, where you can have a lot of feel

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:59.600
on an acoustic set, you can really do those
same things on electronics. Let me see if

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.790
I can demonstrate the limitations without
looking to bad here.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:24.400
Most of what I'm presenting suggests that
I like electronics and that is the case. Probably

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.590
my favorite thing about the electronic kit,
is that you can move the volume of the drums

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.370
away from your ears. A challenge especially
live is hearing everything. One of the reasons

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.510
is an acoustic set is so loud, that's all
by your ears, and the other sound has to come

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.680
through that
to get to your ears, and they have to turn

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.790
up in order to hear themselves to because
of the loud drums.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.239
With electronic drums, you move sound away
from your ears. Everybody gets a balanced

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:57.299
volume!
