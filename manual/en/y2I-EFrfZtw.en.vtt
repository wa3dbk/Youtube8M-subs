WIL WHEATON: Hello internet.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.330
There is no new TableTop
this week.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.670
But we have a gag reel from last
week's episode Chez Geek.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.430
Next week we will be
back with a brand

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.750
new episode of TableTop.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.330
It is the first half of Dragon
Age RPG with Chris Hardwick,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.970
Sam Witwer, Kevin
Sussman, myself.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.230
The game is run by Dragon Age
RPG designer Chris Pramus.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.300
It's going to be amazing.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.870
I believe you will love it.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.400
Also.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.170
I think you will be interested
to know this is the most I

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.740
have ever spent on doing
an intro for you.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.759
You're welcome.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.330
The three most important
things in our life were

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.680
getting drunk, getting laid, and
doing another thing that

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.056
I've forgotten, slacking off.

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:41.932
-Still rolling guys,
still rolling.

00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:43.360
WIL WHEATON: That's what happens
when you spend all

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.760
your time getting drunk
and getting laid.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.900
You forget very simple
things like, I also

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.180
enjoyed goofing off.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.210
Chez means house.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.900
Actually, it doesn't.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.720
Maison means house.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.930
I don't know what Chez means.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.150
I just know that it ends with a
Z and it doesn't even sound

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.290
like a Z. French people
are crazy.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.971
At the beginning of the game
each player will receive a--

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:08.160
I nearly said each play
will receive a god.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.310
At the beginning of every
game, each player--

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.790
the game, not every game.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.490
We're only playing one.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.440
I know you want to watch us play
a lot, but you're only

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.940
going to get one.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.540
Don't be sad.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.330
You can rewind and
watch it again.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.845
The goal of the game is
to accumulate slack.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.380
That'd be way cooler if it's
just in one motion.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.620
[BLEEP]

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.680
you, one thing.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.140
Really?

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.090
Is that gone?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.750
Tell me that's gone.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.480
Is it gone?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.570
I've played so much poker in my
life that when I have two

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.060
cards in my hand I can't
help but do this.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.220
PAUL SABOURIN: How's that
working out for you on this

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.600
game there?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.386
WIL WHEATON: Uh--

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:44.960
PAUL SABOURIN: Because
apparently you got whooped.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.286
WIL WHEATON: Yeah.

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:47.470
STORM DICOSTANZO: I've
got a stick--

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.120
WIL WHEATON: I've got an S and
a D. But the flop's looking

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.636
great for me.

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:56.420
I have a pair of S's.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.640
I have two pairs.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.400
I've got an S and D.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.310
PAUL SABOURIN: Oh, man.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.724
WIL WHEATON: I'm all in.

00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:11.400
STORM DICOSTANZO: [SINGING]

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.410
WIL WHEATON: [SINGING]

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.050
STORM DICOSTANZO: [SINGING]

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.001
PAUL SABOURIN: So you
want how many?

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.230
You want one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.700
Six.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.842
WIL WHEATON: Why do you
have to count my set?

00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:29.750
That's awful.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.696
ANDREW HACKARD: It's fun.

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:31.870
WIL WHEATON: That's like walking
up to someone who's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.370
morbidly obese and going
[IMITATING JIGGLING FAT]

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.750
Yep, still morbidly obese.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.510
ANDREW HACKARD: Oh.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.010
[SINGING]

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.790
WIL WHEATON: Oh no,
too much bass.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.600
STORM DICOSTANZO: I'm
not going to sleep.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.082
PAUL SABOURIN: Wait everyone,
let's give

00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:44.020
him a little dubstep.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.230
[IMITATING BASSLINES]

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.210
STORM DICOSTANZO: Then fine.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.331
PAUL SABOURIN: Drop the beat.

00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:52.560
WIL WHEATON: Wait a minute,
this isn't the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.585
way we left the game.

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:54.963
STORM DICOSTANZO: It
looks like we won.

00:02:54.963 --> 00:02:56.580
I don't know how it happened,
it happened.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.620
PAUL SABOURIN: It just came over
here magically and wanted

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.430
to be with us.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.895
WIL WHEATON: That's
really weird.

00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:01.200
PAUL SABOURIN: Storm and I win.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.500
Yay.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.480
STORM DICOSTANZO: Yay.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.105
Good job Paul.

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:03.516
WIL WHEATON: Well, OK.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:07.380
I guess you guys can go to the
hall of we didn't actually

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.580
win, but we made it
look like we did.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:18.533
