It's spring cleaning time and you know
what that means, time to turn some household

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.600
chores into household cha-ching!

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.519
Stay Cheap!

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.820
Hey! I'm Jeff Yeager the ultimate cheapskate and host of the Cheap Life!

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.109
Today I'll show you a few simple things you can do around your house, to squeeze out

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.929
some spring savings. Keeping the coils
underneath your refrigerator dust free

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.480
can save you up to ten percent in electricity.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.050
Just unplug the fridge remove the grill plate, vacuum the coils and wipe.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.130
Woola

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.040
No more dust bunny rabbits.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.970
Dirty air conditioner filters use as much as

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.790
fifteen percent more electricity than clean ones. That's about twenty dollars out the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.990
window every month for the typical
medium sized window unit.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.020
Hang on MR. Jackson.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.720
I'm here to save ya!

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.540
LJ: Cool tip, big fella. Hey! Tell us

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.540
your best cheapskate spring cleaning tip in the comments section below for a chance to win a fifty dollar gift card. Jeff: It's usually worth the cost to replace

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.170
dirty filters a couple of times during the warmer months.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.180
Hey! a great approach is to install a reusable filter that can be cleaned

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.180
periodically which can save you some
major btu's.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.010
Time for a Cheapskate shout out!

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.909
Our friends at the minimanorblog
have a simple and cheap way to clean

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.180
your microwave!

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.890
Just put a few lemon slices in a bowl
of warm water and nuke it for one minute.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.890
The lemony steam is a natural grime fighter.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.880
And don't forget to clean the 
cleaner. The vacuum cleaner!

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.599
As one of the hardest-working home
appliances this little fella needs some

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.220
TLC to.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.150
Use a damp rag to wipe down
the machine inside and out.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.620
If it's a upright vacuum remove string
and other debris stuck in the rollers and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.740
don't forget to check the belts for
wear and tear. Replace vacuum cleaner

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.590
bags often and use a coat hanger to
dislodge stuff stuck in the tubes. Got

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.689
holes in your tubes? Get out the duct tape.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.979
and there you have it - good as new. This
machine is almost ten years old that's a

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:24.839
hundred and twenty in vacuum cleaner
years.

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.769
Here's a spring cleaning idea the won't
just save you money but it'll make you

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.769
money too!

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.769
LJ: What? Making money by cleaning your house? Jeff: That's right, just go through your junk and decide what you can

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:36.659
live without.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.260
You can then donate it and get a tax deduction or give it away using free cycle or a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.959
neighborhood listserve; or sell it!
Craigslist, ebay, consignment stores and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.249
yard sales are all great ways of
getting cash for your stash.

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.440
But if you really want a clean house
and maximize your fun factor

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.530
throw a purge party. Tag unwanted but sentimental items in your home with suggested

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.290
prices. Friends mingle while prusing
your home's cool stuff. You make some cash,

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.409
they get a great deal and your

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.059
meaningful possessions find a new home with
someone you love.

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.819
Just be careful what items you tag.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.889
Hey! That's not for sale.

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.259
