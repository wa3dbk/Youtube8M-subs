00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.080
An important guest is paying
a visit today: Vitali Klitschko

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.520
is here at the CDU's
Konrad-Adenauer-House in Berlin

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.920
He'll be meeting
General Secretary Hermann Gröhe

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.120
to discuss
political topics together.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.840
CDU.TV exclusively
accompanied Vitali Klitschko.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.840
Vitali Klitschko is currently
with the departmental heads

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.040
who are explaining to him

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.360
what kind of work goes on
in each of the departments.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
Mr Klitschko,
have you enjoyed your day here?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.680
I'm really glad to be here.
I've enjoyed it.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.240
I'm really impressed.
We had some great talks.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.200
Both conversations and, a few
minutes ago, presentations...

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.760
It seems we can use
 the CDU's experience

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.640
in our own party.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.280
What kind of tips could
an experienced politician

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.520
like Hermann Gröhe give you?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080
It was interesting.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.000
A very interesting conversation
with the CDU General Secretary.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.320
I have, of course, followed
his appearances in the media.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.160
And today I had the chance
to meet him in person.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.520
He has a lot of charisma
and is very interesting.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.440
I know he largely concentrates
on domestic affairs.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.520
I was very surprised

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.520
at how well informed he was
in terms of foreign policy,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.840
particularly Ukrainan politics.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.960
Why is a world champion boxer
so fascinated by politics?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.640
I'm originally from Ukraine,
and politics...

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.760
I have my roots there.
My parents live there,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920
as do my relatives and family.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.400
And...
Ukraine is a young country.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.080
And we hope
Ukraine will, one day,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.480
be part of the European Union,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.200
not only in terms of geography,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.360
but also in terms of
adopting European standards.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.280
For this reason,
we're working very hard

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.200
and hope that will be the case
very soon.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.320
What do your family and friends
think of your political career?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.520
My wife isn't happy at all
as politics is time-consuming.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.480
-Even more time?
-Yes, even more time.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.840
Unfortunately there are only
24 hours in a day.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.240
In any case...

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.800
I'd like to say a big thank you

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.640
to my family for supporting me.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.960
They all understand
how important politics is

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.760
for our society today.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.400
And...

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.560
Yes, sport is sport.
Sport has taught me...

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.200
a lot, such as concentration
and working systematically,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.760
in order to get
the best results.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.640
And inner strength, which is
what you need in politics too.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800
What do you hope to receive

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.960
for your big birthday
this year?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.880
-Let's not talk about that!
-I didn't mention your age.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.720
Well then, 20.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.680
We can see that.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.360
The best present...

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.480
Every present...
It's about value, not price.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.680
A present's value is
the emotion it makes you feel.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.880
It's my children,
family and friends

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.560
who can give me
the best present of all.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.480
But there's still half a year
to go before my birthday.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.120
So I'm not thinking
about it just yet.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.480
Thank you very much.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.200
Thank you too.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.040
I wish all CDU members
all the best and every success.
