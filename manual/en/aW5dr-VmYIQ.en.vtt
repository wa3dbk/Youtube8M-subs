Hi, I'm Graham Green.

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.400
Today I'm going to be looking at Nike's latest
addition to the marketplace: the VRS Covert

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.460
driver.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.900
Now it's no secret that Nike have really struggled
with their products in the past to get them

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.019
to perform.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.750
However I really do think they've cracked
the nut with this one.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.670
So let's take a look at it.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.590
Let's talk about the feel of the golf club.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.630
For me, I really enjoyed this.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.460
It reminded me of the Titleist 910 913 drivers;
it had a very solid feel to it.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.150
So those of you out there who like that sort
of product, you're really going to love this

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.150
one.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.250
Quite frankly it's my cup of tea, so I'm going
to give this one a nine out of ten.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.390
When we come on to forgiveness, it's still
really good.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.960
460cc head, with a very large hitting area,
the 45 per cent hot zone here on the club

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.960
face.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.700
So again for forgiveness, really good: nine
out of ten.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.340
When we come on to the adjustability, much
again like the Titleist it's got dual adjustability,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.370
which means you can alter the loft of the
golf club without affecting the actual face

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.620
angle, and that's an important part.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.830
So it's independent changing here, so you
can do loft and face angle independently and

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.030
I really like that.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.620
It means you can fine-tune the ball flight
exactly how you want it.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.980
I'm going to give that a ten out of ten.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.080
When we come on to the looks of the golf club
though, I think it's going to be a real mixed

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.080
bag.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.920
We've got here a huge power pocket, again
you can't see that which is great when you

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.340
actually stand to the golf ball and present
yourself to hit the shot, which is a good

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.340
thing.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.520
However, it has got this incredible red gloss
finish to it.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.950
Some people are going to love that, some people
are going to hate it.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.450
Quite frankly, I like it, my filming director
can't stand it, so it's definitely a candy

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.330
floss or a candy flop.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.850
I'm going to give that an eight out of ten.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.689
Overall, I thought it was a really good golf
club.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.150
It's definitely for me Nike's best ever driver.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.490
I urge everyone to come down and give it a
go.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.279
Do not think about this club as a previous
Nike product; this is new, this is innovative,

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.769
and everyone should come and have a go with
it.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.049
Overall, nine out of ten.
