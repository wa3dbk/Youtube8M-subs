00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.960
OK, now on this part I am just going to be
blending the yellow into an orange just to

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:14.240
slightly lighter darker orange that the yellow.
Now I just line my paint brush right into

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:23.210
the streaks that I had just drawn and so that
gives it a really tight textured layered look

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.250
and just keep up with it and it doesn't have
to be perfect just put in however you see

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.219
the lines work together. Now really when your
blending anything is possible so just have

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.579
fun with it. Go just over the yellow and make
sure that they can still see the yellow but

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:51.959
you can really create a awesome look just
like that. Now what I am going to do is I

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:59.420
am going to start in with the pink. Now you
just want to take a real a nice light pink

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.140
but dark enough so that it looks cool with
the orange and I am just going to start creating

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.400
the rest of the sunset thats going to go over
her face and streak it into the other colors.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:22.600
Now just don't take too much on your brush,
take a nice light amount and just go into

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:33.412
it. And once you have started to get it looking
pretty blended, what you are going to do is

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:38.950
your going to take your brush and just put
it into the water and try to just get the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.200
last bits of water out of it and then what
your going to do is start to blend more. So

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.750
what I am going to do is just go over the
face. Go over everything that you just did

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:59.450
but just pull it out to the edges. So there
you go with that blended beautiful look of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:17.719
the sunset. Watch out for their eyes and thats
just the first part of the sunset.
