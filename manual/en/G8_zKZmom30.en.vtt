Hi, everyone and welcome to Nicko's Kitchen's Budget Meals today.

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:07.757
We're going to be making something I tried out in the US

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.182
and I fell in love with.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.167
Cheesecake Pancakes.

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.167
So, let's get started.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.550
He's got Budget Meals Monday

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.362

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:19.215

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:20.712
What else could you share?

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:27.402
It's Nicko's Kitchen, where the satisfying meals are prepared.

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:30.190
So, guys, we're going to be making some cheescake pancakes

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.727
and it's something that I had a couple of 
 times when I was in the US

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:36.568
at a place called iHop and I just fell in love with them.

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:39.402
I thought the flavour was really, really cool

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:43.606
and I've been dying to get back home 
 and try them out in my kitchen.

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:46.842
So, just into the blender here, I've got some softened butter.

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:50.398
Of course, I've got our cream cheese.

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:52.787
I'm also going to be adding in some butter milk.

00:00:54.097 --> 00:00:55.431
One egg.

00:00:55.753 --> 00:01:01.029
Now, I know I said wet ingredients, but I'm going to add 
 in just a little bit of sugar to this as well.

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:08.087
And, also, I'm going to be adding in some plain cookies, 
 or biscuits, as we call them here in Australia.

00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:11.504
Now, if you're in the US, you'd use some graham 
 crackers for this. We can't get them here.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:16.584
But I'm just going to, just roughly crumble it 
 up. The blender will do the rest.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.860
All the elements of the cheesecake are in this little mixture here.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.008
It's got our cookie base, like a cheescake would and also that cream cheese.

00:01:26.262 --> 00:01:28.179
Just going to pulse it a few times.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.151
And let her rip.

00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:36.628
So, the smell in here is just amazing and that's what we're left with

00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:40.880
And another reason why we did it in the blender 
 is I want it as fine as possible

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:45.860
because I don't want a lumpy pancake. I want 
 our pancakes to be nice and silky smooth.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.580
So, I've got some self-raising flour in a bowl here, a large bowl.

00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:52.870
If you can't get self-raising flour, just use normal flour

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.470
with about half a teaspoon of baking powder added.

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:01.530
Now, I'm going to pour in our wet mixture to the flour

00:02:01.883 --> 00:02:04.310
And we're just going to mix this around.

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:07.780
And I'm using a whisk because I want to keep air in there.

00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:10.500
I want it to be nice and light and fluffy like I said.

00:02:11.337 --> 00:02:14.710
So, that's done. All we have to do now is fry them up.

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:18.500
So, just into a pan, I've got some butter, just some softened butter,

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:22.070
and I'm going to melt that down.

00:02:22.073 --> 00:02:25.320
So, you want a low to medium heat for the pancakes.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.890
Always cook your pancakes low and slow. That's the secret behind a good one.

00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:35.210
If you put up too much heat you'll burn them 
 and they'll be horrible and raw in the middle.

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.790
So, the first pancake, straight in.

00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:45.120
And you want to cook this for, about, two and half minutes each side

00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:45.120
And you want to cook this for, about, two and half minutes each side

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:49.810
or until you see those bubbles starting to pop up on the surface.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.140
Once that's done, flip it over, another two to two and a half minutes.

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:57.160
Keep repeating that process with all the batter you have

00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:02.560
and then we can serve up these bad 
 boys and they will be absolutely fantastic.

00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:17.540
Alrighty, let's get stuck into this threestack,

00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:20.320
if you want to make more, for an individual portion, go for it.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.450
I've just drizzled a little bit of maple syrup over the top.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.560
You can serve them with cream, some syrups if you wanted to 

00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:31.220
like strawberry syrup would be really good, but here we go.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.590
Oh... I love it.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.590
Oh... I love it.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.590
Oh... I love it.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.860
I absolutely love it and that cheescake flavour?

00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:45.480
If you haven't had these before, you will be blown away

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:49.280
by that cheesecake flavour that is happening right there in the pancake.

00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:53.090
Truly amazing, truly delicious, you've got to try that.

00:03:57.607 --> 00:04:01.350
So, I hope you enjoyed these cheescake pancakes as much as I did

00:04:01.348 --> 00:04:04.260
and you can make them at home and they are so, so good.

00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:05.730
All the ingredients are below.

00:04:05.734 --> 00:04:09.580
