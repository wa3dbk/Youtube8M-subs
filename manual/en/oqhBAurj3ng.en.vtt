00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:08.903
This is a 416 PS, 2500 kg full-size SUV. And we're in The Hague (NL).

00:00:08.903 --> 00:00:12.982
Where they figured you can get massive tax benefits when driving this.

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:20.881
Yes, this is the Cayenne S E-Hybrid, similar to the Panamera S E-Hybrid.

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:26.584
Both are plug-in hybrids. So EU law thinks it only emits 79 grams of CO2/km.

00:00:26.972 --> 00:00:35.613
So: major tax benefits and a price much lower than the regular Cayenne S.

00:00:35.613 --> 00:00:41.421
So, let's find out if this car is really that great for your wallet.

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.326
The drivetrain is like the one in the Panamera S E-Hybrid.

00:00:55.885 --> 00:01:01.849
A supercharged 3.0 V6 with 333 PS, and a 95 PS electric motor.

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:12.126
Max power: 416 PS and 590 Nm. Both motors are in front of the 8-speed 'box.

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:17.346
So it shifts even in electric mode. A funny feature, but mind you.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:29.871
Max torque is in each gear between 1250 and 4000 rpm. A bulk of power.

00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:41.038
It's nice and works very supple. Despite its weight, this is very quick.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:02:00.508
Fuel consumption then. Even on maximum charge you won't get the claimed 36 km range.

00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:09.856
But take it slowly and you may get 22 km in electric-only mode. Not a lot.

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:22.081
After that, it's a regular hybrid. You can still hit 70 kph with just electric power.

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:35.779
So, does it use much fuel? That's tricky with a plug-in hybrid.

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:40.579
The longer you drive, the less it can rely on electric power.

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:47.068
But during a 75 km drive just now, we got 1 liter for 15,6 km.

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:57.413
Subtract 20 electric km's and you'd get 1 liter for 11,6 km.

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:02.728
The good news: it's more economical than a regular Cayenne, but...

00:03:02.728 --> 00:03:10.077
if all Prius owners switch to this, air quality won't really improve. 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.563
It really does weigh a lot more than a regular Cayenne.

00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:41.345
The rear-mounted batteries are heavy, and this car rides on winter tires.

00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:52.593
You notice quite some weight-shifting around corners.

00:03:52.593 --> 00:04:02.338
It's still well-built and you notice the different suspension settings.

00:04:02.338 --> 00:04:09.250
Watching this corner at speed is like a tightrope-dancing elephant.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.690
Contradictory, yet it happens. For the rest, it's a Cayenne.

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:34.013
That V6 sounds nice and it's very quick. The Cayenne can do anything.

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.721
It's economical, quick and comfortable. Whatever you want.

00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:54.429
The Dutch Porsche importer loves this car, as it's financially attractive.

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:58.169
Still, it's basically a slightly less scharp Cayenne.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:05.021
It's a great all-rounder, especially with that optional air suspension.

00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:21.285
Like other extra's. So it can be more expensive quickly, though still attractive.

00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:29.151
Providing your company will allow you to get a car like this. It's worth it, mind...

00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:35.296
+ Nice drivetrain; Nice ride

00:05:35.296 --> 00:05:38.425
- Not that economical in reality; Pricy extra's
