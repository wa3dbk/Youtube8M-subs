00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.830
Reset.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.830
Rewind.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.840
RealFlight.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.199
Introducing RealFlight 6, the R/C flight simulator
that has been reengineered to perfection.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.360
We have enlisted the services of top pilots
to get their input on how we could enhance

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.260
the feel and accuracy of RealFlight and we're
proud to say that RealFlight 6 has earned

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.840
their stamp of approval.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.830
Major changes to the heli physics are among
the first things you'll notice.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.440
Helicopter flight is reproduced as accurately
as any simululator is capable of.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.140
Even when the model is hitting the ground.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.180
Practice blade-stop autos, climb rates, and
roll rates.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.680
They're all perfectly modeled to replicate
the aircraft they represent.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.159
Another RealFlight exclusive feature is the
Reset button.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:14.920
Push it, and you're instantly ready for your
next flight.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.590
RealFlight 6 also has Rewind.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.600
Just hold down the Reset button to rewind
your current flight and start flying again

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.220
from any point.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.280
You can always count on having a wide variety
of aircraft to fly on RealFlight, and RealFlight

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.620
6 is no exception.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.700
In fact, you get more than ever before!

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.780
Besides the over 80 planes and helis with
the RealFlight software, you also get a bonus

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.430
Mega Pack, with dozens more airplane or heli
models.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.990
Here are a couple of new time saving features
that you'll appreciate.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.090
Say you want to load a new aircraft or flying
site super fast.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.290
Just start typing the name and choices will
instantly be displayed for you to choose from.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.229
And you can now make simple changes to your
aircraft that will accurately reflect your

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.100
RC model with just a couple of keystrokes.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.119
The InterLink Elite controller in RealFlight
6 with the Heli Mega Pack also has some great

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.450
new updates.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.950
The knob is now on the face of the controller
and the switch is on the top where most heli

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.020
pilots want throttle hold.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.340
And there's no ratchet on the throttle stick.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.160
RealFlight 6 has so much to offer it's impossible
to cover it all here.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.000
To find out more visit the web site at realflight.com.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.280
There you'll discover that RealFlight 6 is
the only flight simulator that really is True

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.829
to Life.
