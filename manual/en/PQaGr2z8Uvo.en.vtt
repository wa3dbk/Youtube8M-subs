I'm Shaun Schaefer, on behalf of Expert Village,
and today I'm going to show you how to pack

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:13.510
up your drum kit efficiently. Now that we
have our floor tom, snare drums and rack toms

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.340
packed away. I know we still have the kick
drum to do that is not what I do next. I usually

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.780
save the kick drum for last. What I'd like
to do now, is pack away, my hardware and simple

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.090
stands, OK, that's like loose junk still lying
around. So what I'm going to do, I?m going

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.860
to get my trap box, and you know, I know,
maybe some people are like, wow, that's a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.410
really nice box, you know, how much is that,
or whatever. You know, I used to use like

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.730
an army bag, back in the day, and that works
really great to do. So, but, you know I got

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:58.440
some money, and went ahead and bought this
beast of a box. So what I have in here, um,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.039
just before I , you know, pack my simple stands
away. This is an extra kick drum pedal, just

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:11.360
in case I break mine, and then I have a cowbell
in here, so just so you know what's in there.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.000
But, what I do is I break down the biggest
simple stand first, OK. This is kind of a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.189
tedious process, but it's kind of nice, as
you can see, this is a double, a double braced,

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.770
double boom stand. All within one stand, which
is great, and they added these features, see

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.170
the boom tucks down to this stand right here,
so it saves a ton of space. You saw how big

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.800
the stand was, before I started packing it
down, watch how small it will get. This is

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:58.740
an incredible, incredibly sturdy stand. I've
had this for, gosh, ten years maybe. Eight

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.200
years. So, and I break this all the way down.
Some of the stands I don't break all the way

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.950
down, and I'll explain that later. But this
one goes all the way down to where it can't

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:29.370
go. Now we have to do these posts, and this
one, alright, and now let's break sown the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:40.859
legs. The stand does take awhile to break
down. Go ahead and tighten, and then lower

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.779
this. So, now look how small that stand is,
compared to what it was a couple of minutes

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:53.269
ago. So what I do now is I go ahead and put
this in first, and move my cowbell out of

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:00.450
the way. I put this stand in first, so the
smaller stands will be able to sit on top

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.540
of that. So, now that we have that stand packed
away, let's go ahead and take a look at our

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.139
next step.
