00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780
How do you notice when your husband/wife or girlfriend/boyfriend cheats on you?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.120
The most representative example seems to be in this story.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.180
The signs can be like.. when he suddenly doesn't receive your call, he doesn't text you back when he goes somewhere else.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.940
And there is this kind of sign. A full-grown adult suddenly said that he needs to go back home quickly because of his mother.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.680
(He suddenly ended the date with a woman, making up an excuse that his mother called him to come back home quickly.)

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.660
Unni, I think you met too young man?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.680
No, no. It's not my story. It's the story of my acquaintance.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.420
I think that man is lying! What he meant by 'mother' must be his another girlfriend!

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.800
And this is another sign. Like you know, a man needs to go home before sunrise.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.140
Yeah, you are right. Some men try to end the date by making up an excuse of his work.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.640
I met one guy for a few times a long time ago...

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.740
Wow, she's telling us another story! More stories to come up?! Wow!

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.960
The stories she tell us are very funny, very interesting!

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.460
She provides the stories to us continuously!

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.540
I went out with him for a short time, but this is the part I want to tell you. There was one day he never called me or called me back even if I called him.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.020
So I sent a voicemail.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.540
I sent a voicemail,saying that 'I'll be in the park. Just come to the park when you have time.'

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.980
And I went to that park..

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.980
But that man still didn't check my voicemail.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.840
But he was with another woman in that park!

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.680
So he was caught?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.860
What I still regret the most in my life is that..

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.320
When I saw that kind of thing, I should have ignored them and just left away as if I didn't see anything or I should have told him one liberating word and returned back home.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.200
But usually, my blood pressure falls down whenever I get a shock..

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.200
I didn't pass out, but my face got white all of a sudden and my hands started to tremble..when I saw him staying with another woman..

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120
I couldn't move at all.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.080
I am still mad at myself and feel like I'm defeated whenever I think of that time, thinking about that man who could have laughed at me reacting in that way.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080
You mean you still regret that the way you acted could have made him into an exultant man?!

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.560
I'm this charming man.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.960
I'm so mad at me..

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.420
I didn't love him that much though! I wonder why I reacted in that way.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.200
(Sung Si-kyung and Heo Ji-woong are pretending to be Sori's ex-boyfriend.)She's been hurt by me! Hahahaha!

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.860
Never! I've never been hurt by him!

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.400
He can't even join the 'list of 100 men' in my life.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.680
100th man?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.320
Wow, she's stronger than Narsha!

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.660
It's not even '100 movies you need to watch before you die.'..

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.740
Anyways, he can't be involved in the list of '100 men in my life'.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.680
And I couldn't even speak in the right way.. I just stammered.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
I was very regretful.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.880
Since I experienced this kind of thing, although I regret a lot, I can definitely agree with the person in this story!

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.880
You mentioned 'Signs of Cheating'.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.520
There are 'Allan Pease and Barbara Pease' who are well known as famous writers and couple doctors(people who pursued a doctorate). And the result after they had a meticulous research on 'symptoms of the betrayer'..

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.720
You said they are called 'Piji'?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.580
They researched 8 symptoms of the betrayer.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580
It's same as what So-ri told us.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.780
1)Someone evaluates his/her lover in a negative way all of a sudden(Although someone always used to be positive).

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.620
2)Someone just set up the password in the phone all of a sudden(Although someone never set up the password before).

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.620
3)Someone doesn't receive the phone call on purpose.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.500
4)Someone just hides the phone all of a sudden.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:50.160
What the men really should know is that women can notice men's lie by looking at their eyes more quickly than men.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.120
Men would have thought that they lied to women perfectly, but usually, women already noticed their lie.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.900
No, no! That doesn't happen!

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.580
But there are men who use this tactic against women.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.200
Even when they are telling women the truth, they just twinkle their eyes on purpose.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.700
So that people can assume that  that man always twinkle his eyes  in whatever situation he is in.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.660
There are these kinds of people who do this for a long time to deceive other people.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.660
You don't know well about fraud!

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.340
It's not a crime that someone changes one's heart.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.140
But lying to woman for three months like this is very bad.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.260
Um Jung-hwa also turned off their light after hearing everyone's stories.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.420
I turned the light off, but I think this woman also would be very confused..and she wouldn't know what to do.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.080
Because this man went out with this woman for 6 years.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:36.460
And I want to give him a high score that this man ended up a relationship in a good way with this woman by having a 'break-up travel'.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.460
No, they didn't end the relationship in a good way.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.940
If he would end the relationship with her, he should have watched the movie and traveled with her one more time!

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.780
Well.. He could have cared about her too much, so that he couldn't speak to her right away that he wants to break up with her!

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.580
He couldn't just end the relationship with his ex-girlfriend who went out with him for 6 years, so he couldn't have done that.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.120
(I can't understand it!)
