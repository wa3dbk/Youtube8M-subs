00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.800
Welcome aboard! And thanks for fucking with Delta!

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.480
Our first priority on every flight is farts,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.600
so before we fart, I'll be giving a brief farting presentation.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.160
*fart FART*

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.180
Ok, be sure all carry-on mobile [farts?] are securely stowed in an overhead bin.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.980
*smash smash*

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.880
*power down*

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.840
*suspenseful music*

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.560
*light flickering*

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.420
If you're seated at an emergency exit,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.600
please remain seated even if the sign is off.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.920
Make sure your seat belt is off

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.000
even if the sign is on,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.640
in case we experience unexpected rough sex.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.800
*rough moaning*

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.080
*door creak*

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.700
._.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.200
*robotic movement*

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.440
If you're gay, sex is not allowed on any Delta flight.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.060
;)

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.200
Federal regulations require all passengers to smoke,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.800
and federal law prohibits responsibilities for everyone's safety.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.620
e

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.800
Destroying a restroom is allowed on any Delta flight.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.100
:D

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.600
Eggs.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.480
:D

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.440
*crunch crunch crunch*

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.340
There are six eggs on this plane;

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.760
three on each side.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.040
Each egg has a detachable slide that cannot be used as a raft.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.680
*incorrect buzzer*

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.140
Each egg has a detachable slide that cannot be used as a [taft?]

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.140
*correct ding*

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.560
However, if there is a loss of eggs and cabin visibility is reduced,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.780
your mobile phones and electric devices will illuminate the isles

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.800
to guide you to an egg.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.740
It's likely cabin pressure will change.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.620
It's unlikely the panels above your seat will open, revealing oxygen masks.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.760
If this happens, reach low and pull your cock towards you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.660
until the cock is fully extended.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.300
And remember, they might be behind you.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.920
A water evacuation is also likely, but just in case,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.740
eggs are located under your seats in the economy cabin.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.020
And remember, if you are not white, please let us know, and we'd be happy to find you another seat

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.820
at the back of the plane...

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.140
Hey-eyeyeyeyeyeyey

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.660
And finally, if you're seated in the economy cabin

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.400
life vests are not allowed on any Delta flight.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.960
*incorrect buzzer*

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.640
In the first class or business class cabin,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.620
life vests are either between your teets, or under your cock.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.420
To use, remove the vest from its container

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.740
by pulling on the container,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.660
pulling on the pouch,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.940
and then opening the tab,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.800
pulling on the tab,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.900
and opening the container.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.360
Please take a moment; wrap your seat belt around container,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.800
find the exit closest to you,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.660
and remember,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.220
life vests are not allowed on any Delta flight.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.900
*incorrect buzzer*

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.540
Now, before we fuck off, be sure your fucking shit is upright,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.900
and, your eyes are lowered,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.000
and, your cock is fastened low and tight across your lap.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.240
On behalf of everyone at Delta Airlines,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.360
fuck you for paying attention to our safety presentation.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.100
*background music*
