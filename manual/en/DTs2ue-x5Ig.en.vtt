00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome to the ask a scientist series from
the National Weather Service Office in Las

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.090
Vegas, Nevada!

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.309
In this installment, we will answer the question
how often does it snow in Las Vegas?

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.770
When most people think of Las Vegas, they
think of a sunny, hot city in the Mojave Desert.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.680
In reality this is not the case!

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.840
Las Vegas does have 4 distinct seasons and
we do experience winter, just not to the extreme

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.990
that Chicago or New York does.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.990
Even though palm trees do grow here (although
not naturally), Las Vegas is located at the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.980
same latitude as Oklahoma and North Carolina
– places that people do associate with having

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.249
four distinct seasons.

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:42.729
However, these states receive much more precipitation
than Las Vegas does during the year.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.609
Even though these places are wetter, it is
not the primary reason that they see snow

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.710
more frequently than Las Vegas.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.410
During the winter, cold air drains south from
Canada and spills south and east of the Rocky

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.119
Mountains much more frequently than it does
to the west of the Rockies.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:03.600
The Rocky Mountains act as a barrier for the
cold air to cross and as a result make it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.409
difficult for Arctic air to move into the
Southwestern United States.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.759
The lack of a sufficiently cold air mass is
the primary reason that snow is not common

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.340
in Las Vegas even though we get precipitation
during the colder months.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.020
Las Vegas sits in a valley that slopes downward
from west to east.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.750
Elevations range from around 3300 feet above
sea level in Summerlin on the far west end

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.020
to nearly 1600 feet on the far southeast end
near Lake Las Vegas.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.010
The Strip sits on average around 2100 feet
in elevation.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.110
Typically, the coldest storm system of the
winter in this area will bring snow levels

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.420
down to around 3000 feet.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.469
This is low enough to allow for snow in the
higher western edges of the Las Vegas Valley

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.749
each year but not over the center of the valley
where our official long term climate station

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.369
is located at McCarran International Airport
on the south end of The Strip.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.200
The most favorable weather pattern for snow
to fall in Las Vegas takes place when the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.149
main storm track sets up to bring storms south
along the coast and across southern California

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.940
and Arctic air can drain south from Canada
into the southwestern United States.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.590
As long as these storms have sufficient moisture
with them and the depth of the cold air is

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.400
significant enough, precipitation will be
able to fall as snow in Las Vegas.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.680
Having the rare combination of a cold enough
air mass and abundant moisture makes accumulating

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.120
snow in Las Vegas even harder to come by.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.360
Often, the colder storm systems have little
in the way of moisture while the storm systems

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.940
that are accompanied by more moisture often
lack enough cold air to work with.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.379
Even though this storm track sets up a few
times each winter, it rarely has the right

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.930
combination of ingredients to produce snow
in Las Vegas.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.430
In summary, the climatology of snow in Las
Vegas can be summed up as follows.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.550
Snow falls somewhere in the Las Vegas Valley
each year.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.500
Snow has fallen in about two-thirds of the
years at the official climate station at McCarran

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.430
International Airport.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.980
Measurable snow has fallen in about 25 percent
of the years at McCarran International Airport.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.790
On average, measurable snow falls about once
every 4 or 5 years at McCarran.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.040
Measurable snow falls about every 2 to 3 years
in the higher parts of the Las Vegas Valley

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.590
such as Summerlin.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.620
Snow is most common in January.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.230
Earliest snow ever was on November 15, 1964
when 3 inches fell.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.340
Latest snow ever was on March 14, 1975.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.769
Measurable snow has fallen in every month
from November through March.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.010
Although official climate records for Las
Vegas start in 1937, two of the greatest snowstorms

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.180
ever known in the Las Vegas Valley took place
back in the early days when Las Vegas was

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.129
a little frontier town.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.150
In 1909, newspaper and volunteer weather reports
document a snowstorm on December 21st that

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.780
dropped 10 to 15 inches of snow in the Las
Vegas Valley with 13 inches measured on Fremont

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.260
Street by railroad depot employees.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.879
In January 1932, from the 10th through the
12th, a storm dropped as much as 12 inches

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.230
of snow in Las Vegas.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.879
Since official records started in 1937, 3
months stand out the most for snow in Las

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:04.879
Vegas.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.720
January 1949 leads all other months for snow
with 16.7 inches.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.849
More snow fell this month in Las Vegas then
in Chicago that entire winter season – their

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.630
total was only 14.7 inches!

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.540
This is the only time a month has had 3 separate
storms that have produced measurable snow

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.540
in Las Vegas.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.540
Las Vegas saw its biggest snowstorm ever in
official records from the 9th through the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.160
13th with 9.7 inches.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.940
A record 13 consecutive days had a least a
trace of snow on the ground.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.480
The combination of the snow and cold crippled
transportation and caused substantial losses

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.760
in tourism.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.700
January 1974 ranks as the second snowiest
month ever with 13.4 inches.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.100
A total of 4 inches fell on New Year’s Day
while another storm dropped a 24 hour record

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.600
of 9.4 inches from the 4th through the 5th.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.980
January 1979 had two measurable snowstorms,
the later which lasted into February 1st brought

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.420
7.8 inches of snow with it, most of which
fell on January 31st.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.790
Snow fell continuously on January 31st for
23 hours and 31 minutes totaling a calendar

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.660
day record of 7.1 inches which was enough
to close all Clark County schools as well

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.220
as UNLV.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.470
December 2008 ranks as the most recent month
in which significant snow has fallen in the

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.910
Las Vegas Valley.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.920
Two separate storm systems brought accumulating
snow to the Las Vegas Valley, however, the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.630
heaviest snow fell in different parts of the
valley in both storms.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.880
The first storm from December 15th through
the 16th was a more elevation dependent storm

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.930
and produced the heaviest snow on the west
side of the valley with as much as 5 inches

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.310
in far northwest Las Vegas.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.930
On December 17th, a storm produced heavy snow
over the south end of the Las Vegas Valley.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.380
As much as 10 inches of snow fell in far southeast
Henderson with 1 to 2 inches on the south

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.630
end of The Strip.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.830
In this later storm the heaviest snow fell
in an unusual manor largely due to the track

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.780
of the storm and a greater presence of colder
air in the south end of the valley.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.650
Many areas in the middle of the Las Vegas
Valley saw no accumulation of snow in this

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.880
later event!

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.400
