This edition of decorative paint techniques
we're going to be learning how to stencil

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.270
and I have a stencil that I've cut out myself
which is basically a spray of roses with lots

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.360
of leaves.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.800
So instead of doing the more traditional way
of using colors which would be green stems

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.399
and leaves and possibly red roses, we're just
going to do it in one color which is probably

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.220
going to update the look to a large degree
as well.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.690
So I have a little bit of artist color.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.820
It's a brown.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.210
I have a very, very important tool; paper
towels, which you offload your brush on.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.640
And a stencil brush.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.690
So the key is to dab on a little bit of the
paint.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.690
Offload.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:07.470
Try not to get a lot of paint on your stencil
brush because it'll start bleeding under the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.330
stencil.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.360
So using a circular motion you apply the color
into the stencil.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.040
You can also stipple it in but it usually
works really nicely if you use this circular

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.080
stroke.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.330
And one of the ideas when you're using a stencil
such as this let's say on a wall in your room

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.680
is that you can randomly place the stencil.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.390
You know, flip it over, have a mirror image
or you can just work on the same image but

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.400
randomly spaced out over the wall.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:08.500
It's also important to remember that you don't
want the same amount of paint in every opening

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:18.400
because that is how it naturally looks more
beautiful.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:29.219
Now the time for us to lift off the stencil.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.470
And try a different technique.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.930
Just bring this back up here.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:47.529
And this time use a roller which is using
the same paint that we used on the brush but

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:55.359
again very, very important to offload the
amount of color on the roller.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:02.150
And I find that a foam roller distributes
the paint much more evenly.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:18.760
This is obviously a much quicker way of doing
it, but you can see which way you prefer.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.610
And those are two different ways of stenciling
on a wall or a surface.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.040
One is using the stencil brush and one with
the foam roller.
