I'm confident!

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.066
Wow!

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:07.900
Which team first?

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.400
Eun-ji is the original of lips food air.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.033
Uh?

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.833
Wait... Is this okay?

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:14.533
Lips food air's original.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.400
Lips food air?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.666
What does this mean?

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.566
Let's check out the picket first.

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.166
Is this true? This?

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.700
No way, when did I eat my lips?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.633
You didn't eat.

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:25.366
No.

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.166
Alright.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.300
But we need to check everyone's opinions first, right?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.633
- Let's see, everyone? - Yes or no, right?

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.100
Raise your picket.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.800
One, two, three!

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.633
No, no, no...

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.466
It's no.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.600
Who didn't raise any?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.866
- Which means yes? - One, two, three.

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.066
Uh, even Eun-ji... So all in all 4.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.000
Yeah, it's 4.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.700
Eun-ji doesn't recognize about

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.166
this rumor now, right?

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.200
Ah... No!

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.433
I didn't do lips food air.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:51.100
Really?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.666
No.

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.300
Really?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.800
No.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.600
Now! We have the proof.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.633
Let's check the video!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.500
Ah, ah!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.700
We have here.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.300
- Ah! - Ah.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.933
In-gook, In-gook!

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:04.900
Wow, that's nice.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.033
Seo In-gook became popular than anyone nowadays.

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:12.900
Everyone is... Oh my! Oh!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.633
Oh no!

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.900
It's annoying!

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.200
Ah, my mom is watching this!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.833
No way!

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:18.400
Mom is watching this.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.800
Eun-ji's mom is watchin this.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.266
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.200
What did people say about this scene?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.466
Well...

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.800
- Oh my god! - Oh no!

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.900
Well In-gook, that's so...

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.533
What did people say?

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.933
My team members were extremely surprised

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.000
just same as now they're surprised.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.533
They liked it.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.000
I was also shocked whenI saw through TV.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.766
Ah...

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.366
Yeah.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:40.666
Okay.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.300
I know people were surprised.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.166
I'm curious how In-gook and Eun-ji

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:49.133
yourselves thought about this.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.733
Actually we ourselves were calm.

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:56.366
We are just close brother and sister playing around a lot.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:56.933
Yes...

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:01.466
You guys might think it's so romantic

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.933
when you see us through TV.

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:03.533
Right.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:05.400
We weren't embarrassed

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.433
when we see each other.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:07.400
Oh, really?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.966
In-gook's reaction...

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.466
I saw through TV.

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:12.700
He confessed his mind towards you

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.366
when he was on the program &lt;Taxi&gt;.

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:15.166
Did you watch it?

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.400
- Did you wawtch? - Ah, I watched of course. I watched.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.300
He exaggerated his mind

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.233
to make our drama more entertaining.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.500
- Ah, okay. I see. - Well, What he said was...

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.166
He didn't feel anything at first.

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.133
But he is feeling something now.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.366
Did he feel something for real?

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:36.300
If it was true, something should

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.500
havehappened to me too.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.966
But nothing has happened.

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:42.033
Don't worry.

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:42.833
I get it.

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:43.366
Ah, I see.

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:44.900
If surroundings keep encourage them,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.266
they might feel awkward.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.066
Yeah, we do.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.433
Isn't it true, Na-eun?

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:50.033
What? Yes.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.700
People keep on encouraging.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.466
Right? It might be awkward?

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:55.466
How are you now?

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.000
Don't you feel awkward?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I already feel awkard.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.666
So...

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.566
Did he send you any message before

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:07.466
you going up for come-back stage?

00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:08.333
Did he?

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.966
Ah... He told me to do well

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:13.766
when we were shooting.

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:14.200
Ah, is that so?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.866
Yes.

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:15.700
Okay, I see.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.800
My mom and dad are still awkward...

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.233
That's weird.
