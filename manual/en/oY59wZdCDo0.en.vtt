00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.028
We were hunters and foragers

00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:22.998
The frontier was everywhere

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:29.998
We were bounded only by the Earth, and the ocean, and the sky

00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:35.640
The open road still softly calls

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.640
Our little terraqueous globe is the madhouse of those hundred, thousand, millions of worlds

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:49.308
We who cannot even put our own planetary home in order

00:00:49.308 --> 00:00:51.808
Riven with rivalries and hatreds

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:56.299
Are we to venture out into space?

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.788
By the time we're ready to settle even the nearest other planetary systems

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.079
We will have changed

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.180
The simple passaged of so many generations will have changed us

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.620
Necessity will have changed us

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.079
We're an adaptable species

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.219
It will not be we who reach Alpha Centuri and the other nearby stars

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.939
It will be a species very like us

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.469
But with more of our strengths

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.200
And fewer of our weaknesses

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.200
More confident, far seeing, capable, and prudent

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.719
For all our failings, despite our limitations and fallibilities

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:46.060
We humans are capable of greatness

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.799
What new wonders undreamt of in our time

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.429
will we have wrought in another generation?

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.040
And another?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.040
How far will our nomadic species have wandered by the end of the next century?

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.269
And the next millennium?

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:12.310
Our remote descendants, safely arrayed on many worlds through the solar system and beyond

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.830
will be unified

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.560
by their common heritage, by their regard for their home planet

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.449
and by the knowledge that whatever other life may be, the only humans in all the universe

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.810
come from Earth

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.140
They will gaze up and strain to find the blue dot in their skies

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.979
They will marvel at how vulnerable the repository of our raw potential once was

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.560
How perilous our infancy

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.080
How humble our beginnings

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.990
How many rivers we had to cross before we found our way.
