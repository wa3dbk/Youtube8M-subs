00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:20.590
There’s a 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.450
dark side to fighting games.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.930
A painful, unfortunate side, that just can’t
be shaken no matter what.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.250
Not Street Fighter, not Mortal Kombat, not
even Killer Instinct could rid itself of the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.180
curse... for behind every excellent arcade
fighter that hits the home consoles, there’s

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.110
a stripped-down, low-res, two-button abomination
about to hit the handhelds.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.060
Have you ever tried playing Killer Instinct
with two buttons?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.420
I didn’t think so.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.720
It just doesn’t work like that.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.180
But there was a Game Boy version, which compressed
Fulgore, Orchid, Spinal and the rest to blocky,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.930
spinach-green sprites.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.260
The problem with curses is that they affect
everyone, even the rockstar of the fighting

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.150
world, Guilty Gear.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.550
Here’s the thing.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.290
The GBA, being about the equivalent of a Super
NES, should be able to handle the kind of

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.299
brawls that made the genre famous.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.650
Problem is, it’s outputting said brawls
onto a tiny, tiny screen.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.103
And despite the small display, framerate can
quickly become an issue if you’re trying

00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:25.119
to do all the Guilty Gear shiny stuff.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.910
And there’s plenty of shiny stuff to do.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.800
Dust attacks, overdrive attacks, faultless
guarding, roman cancels, air combos, instant-kills,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.360
they’re all there.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.950
Guilty Gear X Advance Edition is firm in its
desire to be, as much as possible, a faithful

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.119
port of the original.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:53.820
That said, we are talking about X and not
XX, so no Zappa, Slayer, Bridget, or I-No

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.820
for you.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.591
One of the primary issues with this cart-based,
super-tiny version is that the music, while

00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:04.409
attempting to recreate the iconic soundtrack
of the original... just fails miserably.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.979
If you’re familiar enough with the hardcore
rock pedigree of the Guilty Gear series, you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.700
will make out some recognizable tunes, but
there’s no putting these blippy MIDI versions

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.290
in the same room as the originals.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.710
So one of the most appealing elements of the
series is out the door right away, unfortunately.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.150
Not even the digitized attempts at recreating
the X announcer’s belch-like Heaven or Hell

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.150
can compensate.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.720
It’s just too far gone.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.390
Fortunately, though, the game is mechanically
faithful to its forebears, or at least, as

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.810
faithful as possible.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.760
The GBA’s 4 buttons are put to use as Punch,
Kick, Slash, and Heavy Slash, allowing for

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.590
a direct translation of the special attack
inputs.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.280
Combo timing is a little flaky to work out,
though, especially when the game itself is

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.819
less than stable.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.920
Get enough action onscreen and you can experience
Megaman 3-caliber slowdown.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.290
Not that it’ll matter, though, as the standard
difficulty is so mind-numbingly easy that

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.090
you’d have to have the GBA snatched away
by a rabid tasmanian devil before you’d

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.830
even begin to be in danger.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.580
And even then, you’ve got bigger things
to worry about.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.160
However, this GBA interpretation isn’t without
its quirks.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.660
While the Guilty Gear series is by and large
known for straight-up, one-on-one bouts, Advance

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.130
Edition includes a three-on-three competition.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.130
There aren’t any assist attacks, nor do
your teammates interact with the battle in

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.750
any way, but it’s a unique mode for the
series and one I wouldn’t mind in a proper

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.370
release.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.659
That said, we’re about as likely to see
a new Guilty Gear as we are to see a third

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.020
Legend of Legaia, and if you get that reference,
buy yourself a taco, you deserve it.
