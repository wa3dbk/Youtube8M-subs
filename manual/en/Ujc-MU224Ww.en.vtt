00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.159
If any point is being made at all, it's
surely the point, the point that's being

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.169
made is not the point and has never in fact
been the point. Surely the point, the search

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.500
for the point is pointless and that the whole
point of the exercise, i.e. these are the times in our life

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.500
the points of that make us think of
the darkest places under the lamp.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.500
There is a mixture of a few things really.
Basically, I wanted to find a course that

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.800
offered everything that I needed a lot of
that was facilities and resources.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.620
I chose Sunderland because, it was quite away
from home the course was really different

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.730
to alot of the other performing arts courses
that I've looked at. There is quite alot

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.730
of work to do, get assessed in many different
ways, there's practicals, essays, research

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.400
files, all the assessments. It's all spread
out and you get enough time to complete it all

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.249
Although I do alot of drama modules, it gives me the opportunity to pick elective modules
within other performing arts subjects.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:07.000
It is a really good course to pick because
you can mix up all the different modules that

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.180
you do... Some universities say that you can
only do 2 of the 3 like music, dance and drama.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.100
The classes and the modules that you do during
first, second and third year, all offer so

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.000
much.
It's mainly contemporary dance course, but

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.200
other aspects of dance are involved, such
as street. We get to perform at a professional

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.750
theatre at Customs House in South Shields
and go on tour in third year.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.900
We get to use theatres outside of the university as well, which is fantastic for us as we gain experience within the industry.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.200
It is not that we are brought to Rome to beautify thy triumphs and return captive to thee and thy Roman York. (Acting)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
One thing I know, and I've always known
(singing)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.800
Every year we have a musical theatre project,
last year we did Carousel, which I was one

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.000
of the leads and this year we did Blitz which
then I was one of the leads for as well, and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.500
it's a lot of fun its outside hours of uni
time but you can do modular in second and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.600
third year.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.700
The dance studios are really fully equipped
they've got spring floors, mirrors, and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.000
the courses and the modules that you do during
first, second and third year offer so much.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.200
There's quite a big space and we've also
got two rooms, so if someone's rehearsing

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.000
in one room, someone can rehearse in the other room.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.000
We've just had some rooms refurbished actually,
with the part of the new building, we've

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
got one main room upstairs, quite a few rooms
downstairs, and practice rooms. We've got

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a lovely Steinway piano which I actually want
to steal, it's great.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
It's not just the facilities and resources
that are great, not only that, the staff are

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.000
excellent, I can never feel like I can't
go and approach a member of staff

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.500
The lecturers on my course are really helpful,
they have got a lot of subject knowledge, we

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.700
can go to them about anything and they are
really friendly. There always there, you can

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.400
contact them through email, Facebook or see
them in the office.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.800
I'm used to a much bigger city so, coming
to Sunderland was a change, but, what I would

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.800
say about Sunderland is that, you get to know
a lot more people and you know more people

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.000
within the course because it's much more
compact.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.500
It's a lovely place, such large opportunities
here especially within uni, you have extra curricular things,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.400
I do cheerleading for instance and choir and
musical theatre. Sunderland has such a good

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.200
range of shops and entertainment.
There's a bowling alley, there's the beach

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.000
just around the corner there's lots and
lots of things to do and it's really enjoyable.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You know I can just have a great time and
you make new friends and it's lovely.
