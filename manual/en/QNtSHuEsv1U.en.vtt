00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.390
Hi I'm Tricia, an organic gardener.  I grow organically for a healthy and safe food supply,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.849
for a clean and sustainable environment,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.569
for an enjoyable and rewarding
experience.

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.370
Lettuces and greens are some of the easiest
greens to grow

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.820
and best of all you can plant them before
summer cops like tomatoes and then you

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.929
can plant them after the tomatoes are
finished.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.589
These are the four main types of lettuces
in order from easiest to grow to hardest

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:30.750
to grow:

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.000
loose leaf

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.730
cos or romaine

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.210
butter head or bibb and crisphead like an
iceberg.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.200
I want my butter head and my romaine to
get off to a good start so I'm going to start those

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.780
in trays in the greenhouse

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.220
Start your lettuces and greens in trays
about four weeks before you wanna

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.510
transplant outside into the garden

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.520
and they like daytime temperatures between forty five and sixty five degrees

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.990
Plant your transplants or sow your seed atleast a
month before the hot weather of summer sets

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.930
in

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.550
I'm sowing a few seeds into each cell

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.330
cover lightly with soil

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.620
about a quarter of an inch deep for the
lettuce and about a half an inch deep

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.150
for the greens

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.030
make sure and keep the seeds evenly moist.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.620
While my seeds are germinating and growing
inside the greenhouse I'm going to prepare my lettuce bed.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.379
 

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:21.270
Lettuces like full sun except in the
summertime and if you're in a hot

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.530
climate you probably gonna need some
shade

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.680
Lettuces like a pH of six

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.530
to six point eight.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.270
It does not tolerate a pH lower than six
point zero.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.640
So you may want to do a pH test on your lettuce bed

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.400
Work in a nice balanced vegetable
fertilizer into the top three inches of

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.420
soil

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.570
and any lime you might need to raise the
pH.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.350
Loose leaf lettuce is one of the easiest to
grow so I'm going to seed it directly into

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.600
the garden bed,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.990
this is called direct sowing.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.020
Greens like arugula mash mustard and tatsoi

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.439
have the same cultural requirements as
loose leaf lettuce so if you're growing greens or a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.640
mix follow the same steps.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.119
Make sure you have a level and cleaned
seed bed

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.659
lettuce is a small seed and large clods
in the soil will not give you good seed

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.529
to soil contact and it can reduce
your germination rates

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.969
You can succession seed lettuce every ten to fourteen days and that way you'll get

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.109
a continuous supply

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.499
When it comes to direct seeding loose
leaf lettuce there's a couple ways you

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:25.739
can do it.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.349
You can sow it a patch and harvest it
young

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.489
patches like this are great for seed
mixes like our mesclun mix or our gourmet

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.769
lettuce blend.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.419
You can also sow it in rows. Space your rows to about eight inches to twelve inches

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:39.719
apart.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.900
According to the instructions on the
seed pack the planting depth should be

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.199
about a quarter inch to half an inch.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.639
Water your newly planted seeds

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.959
and keep the bed

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.019
evenly moist, lettuces like

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.869
frequent light watering.

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:57.899
Now that my seedlings have sprouted it's time to thin

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:02.789
to the strongest seedlings and i'm
using these snips because I can thin without

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:04.849
disturbing the soil.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.239
Slugs snails and earwigs are the major pest of lettuce

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.429
in addition to hand picking we carry
traps and organic pesticides to help you

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.299
deal with these crawleys.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.059
It's time to harvest the lettuce

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:22.169
harvest early in the morning when the
turgor pressure is at its highest, that way

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.979
the leaves will stay crisp.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.749
Turgor pressure is like blood pressure for
plants.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.389
For your row grown looose leaf lettuce

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.239
just break up the outside leaves and allow the
center to grow more.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.360
After about thirty or forty five days

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.599
you can harvest your patch of loose leaf
lettuce.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.769
Using a lettuce knife or scissors

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.489
simply snip the leaves off a couple
inches above the soil You

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.169
can usually get to three harvests
like this.

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.899
For the romaine or bibb lettuces harvest
the whole plant when it is mature.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.259
These usually take forty to fifty days to
grow.

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.589
Lettuce is an easy and satisfying crop to
grow so grow your own salad and grow organic

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:01.089
for life!
