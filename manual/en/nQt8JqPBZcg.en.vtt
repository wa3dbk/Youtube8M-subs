00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:07.470
The next project in our bath remodel is perfect
for the novice DIYer—installing a new vanity

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.050
mirror and a new light to go above.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.730
Now let's talk about mirrors first.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.540
There are several different kinds—
like surface mount mirrors, surface mount

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.260
medicine cabinets, and recessed medicine cabinets.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.350
It's easiest to replace your old mirror with
the same kind.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.359
So now let's talk about how to remove each
type.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.840
Oh, and a word on safety.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.320
Glass breaks very easily, so you want to wear
safety glasses and wear gloves,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.940
and make sure you have someone help move it.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.699
Now, a surface mount mirror can either be
screwed or glued to the wall.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.350
If it's screwed on it's simple to take off.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.580
It's a little harder to remove a glued on
surface mount mirror.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.839
First put some packing tape on the face of
the mirror in case it cracks.

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.440
Tap some shims between the mirror and the
wall.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.540
Make them snug, but don't force them.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.290
Then, starting at the top, put a shim against
the wall and gently work a pry bar behind

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.850
the mirror, pulling it away a little at a
time.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.430
You want the drywall paper to tear.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.070
Have someone hold the top and work your way
to the bottom.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.760
When the mirror is free, carefully set it
aside.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.600
Then repair the drywall and paint.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.470
Next, taking out a surface mount cabinet is
simple since it's just screwed to the wall.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.620
Just remove the shelves and back out the screws.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.860
The cabinet comes right down.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.100
Finally, recessed cabinets.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.800
That's what we had before we redid these walls.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.630
It was pretty easy to take out.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.010
First, we got the shelves out of the way.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.010
Then we removed the screws and just pulled
the cabinet out of the wall.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.980
All right.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.750
Once your mirror is gone, you can take out
the lights.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.170
First, we turned off the power in the bathroom.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.870
And don't forget, with the power off you'll
need light, so it helps to have a work light

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.110
powered from another part of the house.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.810
OK, the next step was to remove the bulbs.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.360
Then we removed the shades.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.780
Next we unscrewed and pulled the fixture out
a little.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.549
If your house wires are all the same color,
mark how they're connected to the old fixture.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.450
Then disconnect.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.450
OK.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.730
Now it's time to install the new mirror.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.230
Whatever mirror you choose, the first thing
to do is figure out where you want it.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.900
Make sure it's centered above the faucet and
below the light fixture at a comfortable height.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.030
Then mark the wall.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.560
If you're considering a surface mount mirror,
most of them now-a-days come with a mounting

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.180
hardware kit.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.709
Just follow the directions that come with
yours.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.880
We're installing a surface mount cabinet.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.680
We simply hold the cabinet in place—level—and
mark the mounting holes.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.380
Then we set the cabinet aside and drill pilot
holes.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.270
Always use the right wall anchors if you don't
hit a stud.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.910
Then we just hold the cabinet in place, and
drive in the screws.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.660
Cap the screws and add the shelves.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.020
Done.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.849
As for recessed medicine cabinets you can
get one that will fit into the existing hole

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.090
in the wall.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.599
But if you get a larger one or don't already
have a recess in the wall, just follow the

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.600
cabinet's directions for mounting in your
wall type.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.440
Usually it's just a matter of cutting a stud
and framing the recess.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.730
And we're ready to hang our new light.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.310
We're moving the light from the sides to the
top of the mirror and we had an electrician

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.170
relocate our wiring.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.270
So once again, you'll want to make sure the
power is off.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.380
Pull your house wires through the fixture's
mounting plate, and secure it to the box.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.660
Next, use wire nuts to connect the house wires
to the fixture:

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.180
ground to ground, neutral white to neutral
white, and hot black to hot black.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.989
Carefully tuck the wires into the box.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.900
Position the fixture base over the mounting
plate and attach with the nuts.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.590
Then place the shades and the collar nuts.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.940
Add the bulbs and turn on the power.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.020
These lights and mirrored medicine cabinet
look fabulous, and they make the vanity the

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.510
centerpiece of this bathroom.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.420
