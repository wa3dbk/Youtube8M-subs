00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.520
Right now we're in the middle of the forest,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.600
close to Cologne in Germany.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.280
I'm sitting here waiting

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.160
for some cars with nice tail lamps and then

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm going to follow them.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.540
My name is Gerald Doerne I'm working for Ford

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.160
as a development engineer 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
for advanced light assist features.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.400
I'm following cars because I have to test

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.920
the new light features of the Ford Focus.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.760
When I'm out here driving

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.240
if I follow a vehicle 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.360
I'm not following more than 5 to 10 minutes. 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.360
I don't want the people to get scared or something.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.920
We're trying to relieve the driver from the task

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.200
of switching the high beam.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.880
So he can concentrate on the driving itself.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.140
One of the tasks of the system

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.380
is to reliably detect tail lamps of leading vehicles. 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.320
There are lots of different types of tail lamps

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.040
and we need to ensure that we are able

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.840
to detect all of those.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.920
We went all over Europe to different countries,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.280
we identified the most critical spots.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.940
For example there are some roads
in Northern Italy which are very tough to test on

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.940
because the reflectors are very bright.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.300
I like to drive in the Alps.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.040
There's a lot of roads and areas you can cover there

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.920
and nice roads.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.680
I like the British drivers

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.660
because they are very relaxed

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.300
and very polite.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.080
French people give you a lot of light flashes.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.900
They really don't like being glared. 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.160
So when we are on the road

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.720
we're all following cars every day.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.520
So I think that a good thing to do is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.900
trying to improve the cars,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.360
so that less people get into accidents.
