00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:07.624
Nice flavor, Bev.

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:11.064
Finally, a busy week at the ER.  Corpses everywhere!

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:13.971
I simmered some O positive, added a hint of B 
 and threw in a dash of rare AB negative.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:19.415
All thanks to a drunk driver who caused a 5 car pile up.

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:23.504
Tastes like good scotch.

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:26.361
Tomorrow night is the annual IRS tax party.  We're all invited!

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:30.096
A party!  I'm so exited!  

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.820
What am I going to wear?

00:00:33.052 --> 00:00:35.052
What about a collar and a muzzle.

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:36.619
I don't wanna go and you can't make me.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.911
You're going and no complaining.

00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:41.263
He's upset because tomorrow is his first day of real school.

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:45.244
Dweeb's first day of school.  Remember what I told you.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.775
Attack them from behind and rip out their throats.

00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:51.913
Kate!  School is going to be good for Jimmy.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.400
I loved school.  I ate my first friend at school.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.810
School is for losers.  I didn't go and it didn't hurt me any.

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:02.644
See?

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.959
School of life, that's all you need.

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:05.426
The home school teachers don't seem to be working out.

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.586
Be positive, try something new.

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:12.182
I'm gonna learn something new too.

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:16.092
doorbell

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.789
Come in, Mike.

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:19.708
Hi, baby.  Bought us some Chinese food.

00:01:19.982 --> 00:01:21.982
Ew,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.420
You are the pickiest eater.

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:26.529
Here, look what I got.  Eat whatever you like.

00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:28.307
Thanks, you're so sweet.  Let me see that.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.962
Uh... sorry?

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:45.500
Meow.

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.500
What's up Shadows?

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.070
I'm learning sign language so I can hypnotize Dewey and impress Denise.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.660
Who's she?

00:01:58.116 --> 00:02:00.120
Denise?  She's totally hot.  I love 
 my wife but... what should I do?

00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:07.740
Eh, bang her!

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920
Uh, hon... what are you doing?

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:20.960
Learning sign language.

00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:24.250
Why?

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:25.840
I'm gonna communicate with Dewey, my deaf co-worker.

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:27.850
Since when do you care about... people?

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:34.640
She's no ordinary person.  I can control the other humans 
 with my voice, but it has no effect on Dewey.

00:02:35.924 --> 00:02:37.920
But I'm gonna get to her.  You'll see.

00:02:38.893 --> 00:02:43.890
Uh, good luck with that.  I've got to 
 figure out what to wear to the party.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.770
doorbell... Come in Nancy!

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:51.630
Nance, thanks for coming. I really need your help.

00:02:51.492 --> 00:02:54.490
Not to worry.  I happen to be a fashion expert.

00:03:02.296 --> 00:03:04.300
I know Denise is going to be there.

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:05.720
Who's Denise?

00:03:05.327 --> 00:03:08.330
Some beautiful blonde who has a crush on Walter.

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:12.090
He flirts with her at the office all the time.

00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:14.580
I am so sorry, Bev.  I know what it's like.

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:18.320
My first husband left me for his secretary.  

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:22.290
That's why I married Hal.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.450
I've gotta find a way to make Walter notice only me.

00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:30.340
Like it used to be... love at first bite.

00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:37.660
I wonder what Denise is gonna wear...

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.480
Johnny, how can you eat that.

00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:48.610
Not very easy.

00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:50.980
See ya later kids. Nancy and I have work to do.

00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:55.110
OK, she's gone and your dad is busy. Hook me up to that internet.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.650
Grandma, those internet dating sites are full of jerks.

00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:04.460
I'm 5,000 years old and I've been around the block a few times.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.200
and believe me, I'm a serial dater.

00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:11.720
I don't need friends to hook me up... I love this century.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.820
Grandma, is this your profile?

00:04:15.486 --> 00:04:18.490
Vampy 1, fun loving girl who likes the night life...

00:04:18.512 --> 00:04:22.510
looking for a juicy man who's not afraid of the dark.

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.260
Grandma, is that you?

00:04:26.348 --> 00:04:28.350
That was before I met Vlad.,

00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:30.390
Oh!  I've got a message!

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.780
Gasp!

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:36.920
Dear Vampy 1, I'm definitely not afraid of the dark.  Signed, Your Stud.

00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:38.570
Click on the picture.

00:04:38.202 --> 00:04:43.200
Let's see... he's a man, looks juicy, and he's a good speller!

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:46.090
Everything a girl could want.

00:04:45.623 --> 00:04:49.620
Grandma, his profile says he's blind.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.280
Even better, I lied about my age.
