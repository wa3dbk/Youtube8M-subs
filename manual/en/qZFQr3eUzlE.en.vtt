00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.734
Chief!
We will find water here.

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:36.169
'Long live Bakka'

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:43.053
'I'm Bakka.
God of water.'

00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:46.965
We dug up half the
desert on your word..

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:48.381
Where is water?

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:49.458
Will find water?

00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:52.253
Get water or
die in there.

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:54.553
Look everyone,
wet soil.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.420
Wow!

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.718
It's dry sand.

00:00:58.137 --> 00:00:59.997
But we'll surely find water.

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:04.869
A madam from those foreign CDs
has come here!-

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:06.751
We call them 'Surkhab' madam.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.363
The long, pink-legged 'Surkhab'

00:01:16.114 --> 00:01:17.834
Why are you staring her?

00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:19.039
Go and sit in her lap.

00:01:19.648 --> 00:01:23.346
Such a loose woman!
Falling over every man...

00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:25.075
When will it be my turn?

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:26.907
Fools!

00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:31.074
Machine that digs out
water is coming...

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:36.909
If those villagers get water
our pride will be compromised.

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:51.317
Here people can kill for water.

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:53.886
It must be clear to this woman now.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:55.609
And yet what for birds?

00:01:56.028 --> 00:01:56.917
They are dying.

00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:00.864
There's no water for us...
Where will they find water for birds?
