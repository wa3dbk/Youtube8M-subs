00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.010
There's been some top-level racing this week on three continents, and we have full

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:14.010
reaction to a hectic week at the Giro d'Italia.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.310
It's been an incredible first week of racing at the Giro d'Italia,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.230
we've had two sprint stage wins from Mark Cavendish, we've had last year's winner

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.840
Ryder Hesjedal on the attack and off the back, we've had Bradley Wiggins on the podium with his Sky

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.100
teammates and on the floor, and two great stage wins from two hard-working team

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.300
riders: Adam Hansen from Lotto-Bellisol on stage 7, and Alex Dowsett from Movistar on stage 8.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.140
Alex is one of the riders GCN has chosen to follow for our 'Rider Diaries'

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.280
series at this year's Giro d'Italia and so we were
privileged to take a front row seat

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.739
as Alex waited nervously to find out whether he had indeed won stage 8's time trial.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.910
It's a massive ask to turn over the Olympic time trial champion

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.040
but we'll have to wait and see. I've done everything I can,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.330
if it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.420
It hasn't

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.039
anywhere near sunk in yet.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.630
It's just the most unexpected, crazy thing.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.350
First grand tour and a stage win

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.030
and spending a day in the white jersey,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.090
it's the stuff dreams are made of. As for Mark Cavendish, there's been a lot of talk about his leadout,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.800
or lack of it this season

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.060
and we caught up with Brian Holm, his directeur sportif at Omega Pharma-Quickstep, to find out

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.640
just exactly what changes they've put into
place for their team for this year's Giro d'Italia.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.490
We try to change it all the time until it's working, but actually, we know from

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.710
the time at HTC

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.240
it's not going to happen overnight. It's probably going to take

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.770
six, seven, eight, months so hopefully it's perfect for the Tour, but

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.770
we'll change things on and off. It's not just the pros that are tackling pro tours these days. We met Keith Tuffley, a man who has

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.790
completed the routes of the Tour de France and the Giro in previous years,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.850
but is tacking not just one, but all three grand tours this year.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.460
We caught up with the managing director of Goldman Sachs after stage eight.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.099
A few years ago, the Tour de France came through our home village in Switzerland, where I live. I'm obviously Australian, but I live in Switzerland.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.060
I thought on that day that it'd be a great challenge to cycle just one stage

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.559
to see if I could do it. It was a long stage, over into Italy and back into France,

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:25.379
but I was able to do it, and I thought if I could do one stage, I could do two or three

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.549
so the next year I did three stages and the year after that I thought I'd come along and try and do

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.299
the whole lot. So two years ago I did the entire Tour de France

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.309
and then last year I did the Giro

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.309
and this year I thought the next obvious challenge was to try and do all three

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.909
in the same season. I think only 23 pro

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.620
cyclists have done that. They're obviously racing while I'm

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.269
just cycling,

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.329
but it does highlight how challenging it is.

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.680
Another very prestigious race started on Sunday, featuring some big name riders,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.779
and the Tour of California peloton was greeted with scorching temperatures of over

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:02.349
forty degrees in stages one and two.
On stage one, the 10km climb of

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.479
Palomar whittled the bunch down, although Peter Sagan and a number of other riders

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.149
were able to rejoin over the top.

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.359
However, the stage ultimately went to a last-minute breakaway of two men.

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.739
Francisco Mancebo of 5-Hour Energy was outsmarted and out-sprinted by

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.720
Liuwe Westra of Vacansoleil-DCM, who took the win and the first leader's jersey.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.709
Stage two saw the first summit finish of the race,  with Javier Acevedo of the

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.810
US domestic outfit Jamis-Hagens Berman dispatching the pro tour

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.570
opposition to take a great win

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.239
and the leader's jersey from BMC's Tejay van Garderen.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.759
The European-based riders have been contending
with such terrible conditions this

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:41.059
spring, that the Tour of California weather may come as something of a shock to the system,

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.469
and it'll be interesting to see how the race develops as
to whether this tips the balance in

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.639
favour of the US domestic pros.

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.019
What do you think? Who do you think is
going to win this year's Tour of California?

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.069
Let us know in the comments section.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.230
the women's pro peloton made the long trip east, to Chongming Island in China,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.840
first for a three day stage race

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.349
and then a couple of days later for a
world cup. In the three-day,

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.269
Annette Edmonson of Orica-AIS took the final stage, and in doing so clinched the overall win.

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.689
The race also confirmed the talent of Lucy Garner of Argos-Shimano,

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.099
as she, too, took a stage win. The following world cup was a relative unknown:

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.949
Tetyana Riabchenko of the Chirio Forno d'Asolo team, who

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.289
made an audacious move with 15km of the race remaining.

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.280
She successfully held off a furious
chase from the sprinters teams

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.530
who were eventually led across the finish line by Georgia Bronzini of Wiggle-Honda.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.749
Back to the Giro d'Italia now, and we got our own Dan Lloyd's impressions from the commentary box.

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:36.770
Dan, we said last week that the Giro d'Italia is just fantastic to watch

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.340
from the very first stage, and the last week has proven that, hasn't it?

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.209
Yeah it did,

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:46.739
certainly in the first nine stages there wasn't one day where you could sit back and relax and think: "I can just come in for the

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:53.739
last 5km when it gets interesting." There was always something for the sprinters or the GC riders and it was very interesting indeed, especially when the wet weather really

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.110
hampered the chances of some riders.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.849
Let's talk about this, because Bradley Wiggins has been talked about

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:04.400
an awful lot

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.810
for his inability to descend.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.539
Can you pinpoint what it
has been down to, do you think?

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.219
No, everybody has been speculating, and I'm sure even

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.620
Brad himself has started to wonder why he

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.370
suddenly seems to be so scared on the downhills in the wet over here. In the past, just a couple of years ago,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.919
when I was racing with him at Paris-Nice, he actually tweeted after one of the wet stages in the mountains saying how good the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.469
Veloflex tyres of team Sky were in the wet on the downhills and that was the reason he was doing so well

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:39.589
and just a couple of months ago, in Catalunya, they actually split the peloton on the first stage and he went through on a group of about 15

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:44.849
that fought it out for the stage victory. So he can descend, he just seems to have completely lost his confidence so far

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.509
in the Giro and I think he'll be hoping

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.050
that the rest of it is dry.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.110
Let's talk about another of the recent losers from the GC contenders, if I may.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.910
We saw Ryder Hesjedal,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.259
flying at the beginning of the week, and then he obviously lost quite a bit of time

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.689
just the day after a time trial, where he really did quite well for him.

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.959
Yeah, he said that he had bad legs after that time trial.

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.930
Of course, it's a much different position

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.749
when you get on to the time trial bike and for such a long period of time as well, an hour and a quarter at least

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:16.159
for the riders on that bike, and I think he was just suffering in his glutes

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:20.759
the next day and I think especially with the cold and wet as well coming into Florence, he said he was alright on the

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.449
longer climbs, but when it came to the shorter climbs and the finish when they were going that bit harder,

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.189
he just didn't have the power to keep up.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.310
They did quite a good limit of losses as it were with Tom Danielson.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.459
It could have been a lot worse for the team on that day

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:39.720
but he'll be looking to the high mountains now to decide whether or not he's still got a chance at going for the podium.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.019
Dan has a better idea of what's in store this week for the riders than most

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:45.669
having been out to Italy to recce some of the stages.

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.860
Well the final 10km

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.900
average 8%

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.719
I'm on the steepest section now

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:56.099
which in the profile is 20%, but

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:57.779
according to me

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.139
it'a a bit more than that. Anyway,

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.830
it's hard

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.870
and I'm struggling to talk,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.699
so I'll catch up with you later.

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.590
Finally, we'll leave you with our tweet of the week, from journalist Daniel Friebe:

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.620
"A rider whose identity I won't reveal to me recently said:

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.800
'Nibali is meant to be the best descender in the world?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.080
He's rubbish.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.819
Rubbish.' "

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:21.580
Food for thought. What do you think?

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.689
Let us know.

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:27.630
See you next time.
