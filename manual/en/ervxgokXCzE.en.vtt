00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.240
Lenses are one of the most important aspects
of a video camera. Besides being the point

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.990
at which light enters your camera, they can
make an image clearer, help the audience to

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.020
focus on an area that you desire, and can
add further stabilization to your shot. With

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.670
knowledge of the types of lenses your camera
should have as well as the proper filters

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:34.059
to use for every situation, you can assure
that your shot starts off on the right foot

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.080
Your lens in your camera is much like a lens
in an eye. They both bend light so that they

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.750
can focus either short or long distances,
and depending on the quality of the lens,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.232
can make an image crisp and clear. As such,
it is important to make sure that you use

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:50.140
every part well in order to make a great looking
image.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:59.000
One of the most common types of lenses in
cameras is the fixed lens. A fixed lens is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.530
one that is built into the body of a camcorder
and cannot be removed or replaced. These lenses

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.220
can often be found in prosumer camcorders.
They typically have high quality lenses, are

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.880
more affordable, and have a smaller camera
body which makes it both quick and highly

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.860
mobile. However, even though they do a great
job of being able to focus on objects that

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.800
are both near and far, they still don't have
all of the features that interchangeable lenses

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.161
provide. Interchangeable lens cameras, which
allow you to take one lens off and replace

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.670
it quickly with another, can give you the
ability to achieve a more shallow depth of

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.530
field, a longer zoom length, and let in more
light. Because of this, interchangeable lens

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.030
cameras like HDSLRs and professional camcorders
are a great choice for getting a wide variety

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.989
of shots with a single camera body.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:51.310
In order to capture shots of objects that
are far away, a telephoto lens is needed.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.210
Telephoto lenses allow someone to be further
away from the action while still being able

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.560
to capture close-up shots. They usually are
measured in millimeters or by how many times

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.280
further they can see than the human eye. A
great telephoto lens is usually anywhere from

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.420
200 to 800 mm or 10 â€“ 20X. These kinds of
lenses are used for live events and weddings

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.670
as they allow a cameraperson to stay out of
a shot while still being able to see the emotion

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.710
on the subject's face.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.970
On the other hand, macro lenses are lenses
that can focus on objects that are very close

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.140
to the camera. These lenses achieve close
focus due to the shape and position of the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.170
glass in the lens. They are commonly used
for close up plant and wildlife video as well

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.232
as product shots as they allow a unique perspective
to objects which humans typically can't see.

00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:43.030
Lenses that can move between a wide and narrow
range are known as zoom lenses. Since zoom

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.450
lenses are very versatile, they are the most
common type of lens found on both camcorders

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.750
and HDSLRs. They don't require a constant
changing of lenses or camcorders - and allow

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.950
the extra dimension of revealing objects during
a shot by zooming in or out. The only real

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.160
drawback of zoom lenses is their tendency
to lose light as the lens is zoomed into an

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.220
object. This is due to the way the glass bends
the light as it closes into an object. Because

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.310
of this, it is often a good idea to use a
camera with interchangeable lenses if you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:20.040
have the time to replace lenses and space
to store them while shooting.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.990
To make images look even better, or to just
give your video an artistic look and feel,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.340
it can be helpful to use filters for your
lenses. Filters can perform a bevy of different

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:37.100
duties like protecting your lens, compensating
for lighting, and setting moods.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.550
By far, the most common type of lens filter
is the UV filter. The UV filter, which filters

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.490
out harmful UV rays from hitting your camera's
sensor, are most commonly used as simple lens

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.520
protectors for camcorders. They protect from
dust, scratches, and cracks in the glass of

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.819
a lens. Since they are less expensive to than
the entire lens element itself, it is one

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:05.480
of the most economical filters to have for
your camera.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.700
Another function of lens filters is to compensate
for less than ideal lighting conditions. Some

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.470
filters are used to correct the color temperature
of a scene. Other filters, like the polarizing

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.979
filter, are used to get rid of heavy reflections
on window and water surfaces. Another filter,

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.030
the gradient filter can add color and interest
to clear blue skies. They do this by using

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.419
a piece of glass that goes from dark to clear
over the surface of the lens which also helps

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:38.060
limit the contrast between the sky and the
landscape in a shot.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.460
Lastly, there are filters which are used in
order to set a mood in a scene. These types

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.051
of filters usually include the star filter,
which adds light streaks to bright areas of

00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:55.190
an image, diffusion filters, which soften
an image, and a multi-filter, which is usually

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.350
a combination of these effects. That being
said, effect filters should be used sparingly

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:10.660
as they can be both distracting and done just
as well or better in a post-production application.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.650
The first step in a crisp and clear image
always starts with a good lens. That's why

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.580
it's so important to know the types of lenses
you should use as well as the kinds of filters

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.760
that can make them even better. With this
knowledge you will be able to improve the

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.150
work flow of your production and capture shots
that look sharp and draw the attention of

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.660
your viewers.
