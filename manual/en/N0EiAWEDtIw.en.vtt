00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.600
Hi, I'm Alli and this is my big

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.700
brother and business partner

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.000
Michael.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.800
When we started Drybar over

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.800
five years ago we never

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.100
imagined that three years later

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.000
we have almost 30 locations and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.100
over fifteen hundred people

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.800
working with us.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200
We're incredibly grateful and

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.400
proud.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.500
If you're not familiar with

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Drybar, our philosophy is

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.100
simple. Focus on one thing and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100
be the best at it.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.400
For us, that's blowouts. Our

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.000
tagline actually says it best -

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.900
no cuts, no color,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.600
just blowouts.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.400
Alli has been a stylist for

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.100
more than 15 years now and came

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.300
up with the idea because ever

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.300
since she's been a little girl

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.600
she always wanted her crazy

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.500
curly hair blown out.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.600
There was never a great place

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.800
to go.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.500
So I started a little mobile

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.000
blow-dry business in L.A. and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.100
quickly had more clients than I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.600
had time.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.000
So Michael lent me the money to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.300
open our first location and it

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.600
took off beyond our wildest

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.400
dreams. We were obsessed with

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.800
where you were today.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.800
No cuts, no color, just

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.700
blowouts.It

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.900
is the newest sensation, Alli.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.833
Everybody's talking about it.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.900
Hey, Allison. What's up,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.100
the Drybar. You're on air with

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.600
Ryan Seacreast. Hi,You're

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.400
Brilliant.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
The concept is pretty genius.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.300
No cuts. No color.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.000
Just blowouts.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
Only for $35. I want the Cosmo.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.700
So who's got a Manhattan?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.300
You guys have been slammed.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.233
We've been pretty much booked

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
solid since we opened. We love

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300
this concept. I

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.500
like it.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.600
I love it too. Actually, yes

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.700
you're right, I love it too.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800
Today we're completely humbled

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.200
to have over half a million

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.300
loyal clients across the

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.700
country.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.100
Alli began developing the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.200
product line purely out of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.700
necessity.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.300
We're using a mishmash of

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.500
products in the shops and I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.800
tried everything out there and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.800
there just wasn't a line that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.700
was perfect for us.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.800
So we partnered with some of

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.100
the best labs in the country

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.100
and spent over two years

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.300
developing an entire line

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.600
crafted specifically for the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.200
perfect blowout.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.000
First and foremost we created

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the products and tools to be

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.300
used in our shops by our

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.600
stylists for the thousands of

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.800
blowouts we do each and every

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.900
day. But,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.800
since the products turned out

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.200
so great we decided to share

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.900
them with the rest of the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.100
world.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.700
We are incredibly thrilled and

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.900
honored to be launching our

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.700
line exclusively in Sephora!

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.600
OK. Since I know absolutely

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.500
nothing about styling hair,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.600
I'm going to turn this over to

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.500
Alli take you through our key

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.200
products and tools.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.500
All right, let's go.
