I'm a Junior Team Captain! You may be asking
yourself, why is a little kid telling me about All Pro Dad?

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.320
It's because kids know how dads can be better. Us kids need you! 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.859
Ya you, I'm talking to you. Today, I'm going
to tell you about a simple program called

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.099
All Pro Dad's Day. Now I will talk to my
good friend Tony Dungy.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.020
Coach, tell us why dads should be an All Pro
Dad.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.500
In 1997, I was the coach of the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. I was having a fun year on the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.280
football field, but several of our coaches
used to t      alk walks after practice and discuss

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.480
what was going on, not necessarily with the
team, but with our families. One of the things

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.480
we came up with was we could tips, little
pointers, reminders of how we could be better.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.440
It's amazing to see how it's developed
from that one thought process in 1997

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.180
the idea that men have to work hard to be good dads and you want to put that same energy

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.380
of being an All Pro Dad into your most important
job, which is being a father.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.580
Way to fire them up, coach! How can dads meet
other All Pro Dads and form a team for us

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.740
kids?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.390
I think the biggest impact the most important
offshoot we've had from the time that we

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.140
started All Pro Dad and iMOM has been
the iMOM mornings and the All Pro Dad's

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.140
Day breakfasts. What this is is once a month,
parents going to their schools, or going to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.479
a restaurant, going somewhere and having breakfast
with their kids, and just having that experience

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.690
of being together and it's been fantastic.
These have branched out all over the country,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.960
and I get letters and cards from people just
telling how special that that has been.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.700
Thanks coach, but let me put this in kid's
terms. Once a month we wake our dads up super early,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.940
 like it's the middle of the night,
then we drive to the school lunchroom! 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.099
Dad even lets me drive...just kidding. Am I? Just
kidding, I'm teasing. Then we have breakfast

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.209
together and we talk about school, friends,
and making good choices. 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.249
The point is, we are talking! I can't help it cuz I'm just
a fast talker. Then all the dads turn to the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.140
other dads and tell each why they're proud
of us kids. It's probably my favorite moment 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.420
besides the food, of course! Eat breakfast with your
kids, dads. Then the team captain shows us

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.060
a video and it's normally funny or something
that's really, really important. 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.900
Then we read these question papers that have funny
looking people on them, and we talk about life at home.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.360
 It's really sentimental, some
dads can't handle it just kidding. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.460
After that, Dad walks us to class and says goodbye
and goes back to boring grown-up world. 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.540
Coach Dungy, what kind of awesomeness
have we seen from these breakfasts?

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.279
We have been fortunate to team up with the
PTA because PTA's have really understood

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:27.239
how beneficial it is when you get moms and
dads on the school campuses, being involved

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.249
in the school, being there. So they have teamed
up with us because it really has been important.

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:38.659
It's exciting to see the more involvement
that we have from parents, the more that they

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.279
are there with their kids, the better the
schools seem to run, the better their kids

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.189
do in school.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:50.281
Thanks coach. So if a Super Bowl winning head
coach says it, you should believe it! 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.859
Coach, how can someone sign up for this program?

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.709
People ask me all the time: how can I get
involved in an All Pro Dad's Day breakfast?
