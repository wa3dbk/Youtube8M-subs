00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.540
This delightfully entertaining slice of Americana
that grossed almost seven-hundred million

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.290
dollars in 1994 would be the first of three
collaborations between director Robert Zemeckis

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.440
and Tom Hanks.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.180
An adaptation of the 1986 Winston Groom novel,
"Gump" would win six Oscars at the 67th Academy

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.570
Awards: including best picture, director,
editing, effects, and actor -- Hanks's second

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.910
in a row following "Philadelphia" the year
prior.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.410
Presented entirely in flashback from the film's
title character, this romantic drama comedy

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.050
film is the story of a unremarkable man leading
an unbelievably remarkable life: personally

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.551
witnessing and/or influencing many of the
defining moments of the latter half of the

00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:42.570
20th century.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.340
Showing off his best southern accent, Hanks
portrays a dimwitted everyman from the fictional

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.780
town of Greenbow, Alabama with an incredible
amount of talent, emotion, and care: truly

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.440
morphing into the character by the end of
the 141-minute picture.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.649
Despite being just 10 years Hanks' senior,
veteran actress Sally Field plays Gump's mom;

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.010
who does her best to encourage her son, and
raise him right, even if she does remark on

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.290
his below-average intelligence, "stupid is
as stupid does".

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.420
Switching between the past and present, the
narrative is composed of various vignettes:

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.749
Gump as a child, his time serving in Vietnam
alongside his Army pal Mykelti Williamson

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:17.770
as Bubba, the accidental success of his shrimping
boat business with a legless Gary Sinise,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.470
to his involvement in the anti-war counterculture
movement of the 1960's.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.350
All the while though, Gump longs for his childhood
sweetheart, played admirably with conflict

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:58.679
and purpose by Robin Wright.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.939
Although it's easy to recognize Hanks' groundbreaking
performance in the lead role, for their contribution,

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.130
the support cast is not to be understated:
Sinise is especially is astonishing as an

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.400
angry war vet - delivering lines with such
intense frustration the movie almost becomes

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.980
uncomfortable to watch.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.920
Expertly utilizing CGI, rotoscoping and chroma-keying,
the magicians at Industrial Light And Magic

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.019
adeptly incorporate the bumbling protagonist
into several key moments of American history.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.510
It's the subtle effectiveness of these visuals
that really sell the believability of the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.510
story.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.930
Although the ever-changing plot makes it easy
to lose sight of the larger picture, the pace

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.349
is never slow, and constantly entertains:
even on multiple viewings.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.370
Fantastically setting the mood of the period,
the amazing soundtrack features some of the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.500
most iconic and memorable rock songs from
the 60's and 70's - include The Doors, Lynyrd

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.780
Skynrd, Jackson Browne, Creedence, Bob Seger,
Jimi Hendrix and more -- all supported by

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.269
the wonderfully poignant and playful score
by Alan Silvestri.

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.250
I'd argue "Shawshank Redemption" was more
deserving of the little gold statue that year,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.610
but there's rarely a moment of this film that
isn't flawless; even if the individual sequences

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.930
are greater than the sum of their parts.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.989
Sharing messages of hope, love, and determination,
one important lesson rang true: "life is like

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.469
a book of chocolates: you never know what
you're gonna get".

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.049
Luckily for us though, we got an endlessly
quotable adventure that taught audiences everywhere,

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.299
you're never too disadvantaged to change the
world.

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.489
"Forrest Gump", "Absolutely magical.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.750
Heartwarmingly fantastic characters."

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.379
Those are my thoughts on this iconic movie,
so now lets take a look at your reviews from

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.200
the YouTube comments.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:43.000
For the first time in season 4, here's the
rate-o-matic to rank "Forrest Gump" -- a double

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.040
TEN.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.170
Incredible acting, touching story, and wonderful
direction and visuals: we both agreed that

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.400
this film was Amazing.
