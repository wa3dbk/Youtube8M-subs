00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.410
This video demonstrates RxSorbo Classic Shock
Absorbing Insoles.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.400
The Classic is 100% Sorbothane速, the world's
best shock absorbing material.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.459
It absorbs 94.7% of impacts.

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.220
NASA uses it to provide shock absorption for
instruments and cameras during rocket launches.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.010
Wilson uses it in its professional line of
baseball gloves.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.420
Sorbothane is viscoelastic.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.330
It absorbs shock both vertically and horizontally
behaving a lot like human flesh.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.800
Viscoelasticity can best be explained by looking
at a balloon filled with water.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.400
Sorbothane instantly recovers to its original
shape so its ready for the next impact.Sorbothane

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.780
is extremely durable.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.420
It won't quickly breakdown and compress like
the EVA used in most other shock absorbing

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.420
insoles.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.960
It's very efficient.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.989
It only takes a thin layer to absorb shock.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.840
It's very flexible.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.299
Molded grooves provide ventilation and enhance
impact absorption and add even more flexibility.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.520
The heel section is thicker.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.810
This gives you more impact absorption protection
where it's needed most.It also allows the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.740
insole to cradle your foot.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.880
This helps keep in place.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.580
The upper surface is covered with Cambrelle速.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.880
The dual fiber design adapts to the motion
of your foot and your footwear helping to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.490
keep it in place.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.529
MIcroscopic air pockets help to keep feet
cooler and to provide still more cushioning.

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:35.820
It's antimicrobial.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.539
Cambrelle速 wicks away moisture.

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.889
It absorbs 3 and one half times its weight
in moisture to keep your feet dryer.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.750
The Classic Insoles are so thin they'll fit
in any type of footwear.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.139
In most instances you won't even have to remove
the existing insole.

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.099
I'm going to show you how to put them in your
shoes.

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:58.719
Make sure you loosen the laces so you have
as much room as possible to work.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.429
You install them with the Cambrelle速 liner
side up.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.639
Fold them lengthwise.

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:09.369
Then place them in the shoe.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.450
Make sure that the top of the insole is against
the front of the shoe.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.490
And here's a tip.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.670
Hold that shoe upside down.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.820
It makes it a lot easier to get that insole
against the front.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:31.769
Then reach in and smooth it out.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.849

against foot pain, back pain and impact related

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.430
injuries.

injuries and foot conditions.
