00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Right dolly ...

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.700
... and action!

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.840
Very honoured to be here in Sandane Norway.  

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.440
Where we found 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.780
the most dangerous looking airstrip in the world.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.080
This script

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.220
was really quite brilliant 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.220
and that's why I really bit on it hard

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.020
and wanted to do it very much.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.780
A real adventure story is told

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.900
without a single word of dialogue 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960
or without any intended narration.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.000
The light that best features the headlight

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.400
is dark. 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.800
But it's a car launch of the new, 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.040
newly designed, redesigned Mondeo line.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.000
And that, to feature that you need light,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.060
you've got to see the car. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.640
So it is trying to find that little window

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.780
where there's enough darkness to feature the lights

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.780
and enough light to feature the car.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.180
So we rehearse in the daylight

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.240
and then when the light starts to get right

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640
we go up and shoot it for real.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.680
When we get up there we have
two hours to get everything.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.600
We have to be on our game,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.520
because you have to shoot, what for
most commercials would be a full days work,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.420
you have to do it in two hours.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.840
My general philosophy is that
there is no substitute for real

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.080
and CG can approach real,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.220
but it never achieves real.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.120
We've gone to great pains to do it in-camera.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.560
We are doing the plane landing right over the car

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.940
as an actual stunt.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.540
And I think the audience will appreciate
the fact that we really did it. 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.920
This is innovative advertising.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.200
I really appreciate it, 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.360
and I really appreciate the
chance to be the guy to direct it.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.200
I think if more car Ads

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
had this kind of invention and imagination

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.360
we would sell more cars and
we'd make better commercials.
