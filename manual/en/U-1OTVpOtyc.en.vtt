00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.850
He came to give his flesh. He came to
give his flesh for the life of the world.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.849
He came to to have flesh that could be
pierced by nails. He came to have flesh

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.859
that could be pierced with a sword and
lacerated on his back and a crown of

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.439
thorns pressed somewhere in the universe, namely on on the fleshy head of the Son

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.849
of God. And cheeks that could be
slapped around, and a beard that could be

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.880
pulled, and eyes that could be spit upon
so that the saliva would drip down.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.570
That’s why he came. That’s why he needed flesh so that he would have something

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.420
with which to die — something with which
to suffer. That’s the only way grace can

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.120
come to sinners. And he came full of
grace, and from his fullness we have all

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.559
received grace upon grace. And the reason we have received grace upon grace from

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.550
the fullness of the Incarnate Word is
that the incarnate Word came to have

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.950
flesh so that he could die for sinners.
Had he not died for sinners, we wouldn't

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.640
have grace. We would have only judgment
and therefore Christmas is massively and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.060
mainly preparation for Good Friday. Don’t
isolate this holiday. It’s all of a piece

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.310
with what he came to do. So the meaning
of Christmas in the Gospel of John is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.000
that there was an eternal God in more
than one person. We know three when we

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.869
take all the Bible into account: Father,,
Son, and Holy Spirit. The Son, the Word

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.630
takes on flesh, that he might have flesh
with which to die and in giving his

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.299
flesh for the world the world can have
life because now sins can be forgiven,

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.070
righteousness can be provided, a
substitute is there, and by faith in him —

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.340
that is by eating him, symbolically we
consume him, he becomes our treasure,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.060
our food, our life. His life is now in us. Our
sins are covered, and we have eternal joy

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.980
with him.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.980
