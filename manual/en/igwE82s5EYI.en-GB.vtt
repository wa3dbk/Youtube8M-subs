00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.020
WEEE!

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.520
THIS IS NO TIME FOR PLAY

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.480
LISTEN, ANIMALS ON THE TRAMPOLINE ARE MAKING FUNNY NOISES 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.920
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.600
NO, THEY DON'T MAKE THE SAME KIND OF NOISE

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.340
OR AS LOUD

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.340
THERE IT GOES AGAIN

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.020
BLUEBIRD

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.280
WHOOPS, CLUMSY ME

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.960
I SLIPPED

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.800
WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.400
IT'S DEFINITELY A GLUG GURGLE MONSTER

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.620
SOUNDS JUST LIKE ONE

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.720
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FOLLOW THE NOISE

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.320
AND FIND OUT EXACTLY WHERE IT'S COMING FROM

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.160
THIS WAY

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.700
DON'T BE SILLY, BLUEBIRD, IT'S COMING FROM OVER THERE

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.780
NO, DEFINITELY NOT THAT WAY

00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:13.089
LET'S GO AND SEE OAKLEY

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:15.089
HE SHOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.460
WAIT FOR ME

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:31.117
ITS THE LITTLE ACORNS MAKING THE NOISE

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.460
THE ACORNS AREN'T LOUD ENOUGH TO BE THE NOISE

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880
THEY DON'T MAKE THE GROUNDSHAKE EITHER

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.800
AND HOW IS OAKLEY MANAGING TO SLEEP THROUGH IT?

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.820
(GASP)

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700
WHAT? WHERE?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.600
OH, HELLO WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING ON MY HILL?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.680
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.280
A LOUD NOISE IS KEEPING US ALL AWAKE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM

00:02:00.602 --> 00:02:02.602
WE THOUGHT IT WAS A THUNDERSTORM 

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:04.602
OR A MONSTER

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.260
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD IT?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.940
NO, DESCRIBE IT TO ME

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.940
IT GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.780
BURBLE, BURBLE, BURBLE, BURBLE, BURBLE

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.800
NO, IT'S MORE LIKE THIS 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.340
GURGLY, GURLY

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.880
AND THIS....(SHAKING)

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.840
WOW, HOLLY
