Hi this is Willie D. of the Aggro Alliance
Trick Team on behalf of Expert Village. In

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.820
this segment, we're going to learn how to
ride backwards. This is the learning how to

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.749
ride backwards portion of the one layer roll
back. It's very important that you learn this

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.610
trick individually before attempting to get
into the one layer roll back. Now we're going

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.819
to get into by just, follow me. What you want
to do first, to learn how to ride backwards

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:37.960
is just sit on the bike normally, your feet
down on the ground, grip your handle bars

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.680
making sure that the bike itself is straight
up and down. Before you begin the backwards

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.760
motion, you don't want the bike leaning to
any sides like this. You want to start off

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.150
with the bike straight up and down. This will
give you the advantage as you start your motion

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:01.080
backwards. To start the motion backwards just
kick backwards like this. The goal here is

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.310
to keep your feet off the ground for as long
as you can. This might take you a while to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.960
get comfortable with. Learning the backwards
motion in the beginning does feel a little

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.170
uncomfortable and feel strange so just do
this over and over. Make a game out of it,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.790
trying to keep your feet off the ground for
as long as you can. Going a little faster

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.020
than normal is best because it helps you maintain
your balance. So when you get pretty comfortable

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.070
with the speed, go at a little faster rate,
this will help you keep your feet off the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.420
ground longer like such. When you're comfortable
keeping your feet off the ground, start trying

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.990
to place your feet on the pedals while you're
in the backwards motion, like this. Just like

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.150
that. Until you can ride a pretty straight
line for quite a distance or at least until

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.590
you're comfortable with it, then you've mastered
learning how to ride backwards. Now you're

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.959
ready to put the other pieces of the one layer
rollback together.
