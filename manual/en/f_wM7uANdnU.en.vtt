00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500
Today I teach yum cha green bean soup/ tong sui

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.500
around 200 grams green beans, take out the dirt and small stones, I found one stone

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
rinse until the beans are clean

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.000
remove floating beans, they are damaged and bad

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
after washing, put the beans in a large cooking pot because they may easily overboil

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I put in 1,700 ml water

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
cover with lid, leave it for 2 hours

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.500
2 hours later, turn to high heat, bring to boil

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
when it is boiling, turn to medium heat, cook until the shell falls off the beans

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
be careful, it may easily overboil

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500
when you see the shells of the beans beginning to fall off

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.500
according to your preferrence you can take the shells out

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I just leave it in the cooking pot and cook until the beans become soft

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the green beans are soft and swollen up

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
turn off the heat, leave it for an hour

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
an hour later, pour out the green beans to another pot

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.000
blend the green bean soup seperated in several batches

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.000
each time only blend it for 5 to 6 seconds, if you blend it too fine it will not taste so good

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
when you have blended the green bean soup put it back into the original cooking pot

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
add sugar according to your preferrence

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.500
I put 165 grams brown block sugar

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
break the sugar into small pieces so it will easier dissolve

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
cooking block sugar too long will give it a sour taste

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
1/5 tsp salt

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
remove the foam after blending the green bean soup, I did it already

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
turn to high heat, stir in one direction, caution it may easily stick to bottom

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
when it is boiling, put in the brown block sugar and the salt

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.000
continue stirring until the sugar is dissolved and the soup reboils

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
now the sugar is dissolved and the soup is boiling again, turn off the heat

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
remove the foam if there is any

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
cover with lid, leave for 30 mins

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
30 mins later 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.000
Thanks for watching see you again next time
