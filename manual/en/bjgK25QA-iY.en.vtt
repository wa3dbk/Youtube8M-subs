00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.890
On February 24th, we have a hydration ceremony
for the dancing Shiva.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.640
You know the hydration ceremony is called
the Abishekam in Sanskrit.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
It is a very important ritual.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.460
In order for any statue to come alive, we
need to hydrate it.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:46.930
Just like human beings, or even plants need
water to come alive or keep alive.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:55.170
Same principle works for a statue which is
also alive because every statue that is being

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:04.170
worshipped in a temple or in an ashram or
any place which is given life is called Pranapratishta;

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.010
you give prana to the statue so that the statue
is living.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:18.159
So this hydration ceremony called Abishekam
is very very powerful one; because, you are

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:26.320
making the statue to come alive by pouring
a lot of substances like milk, large amounts

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.439
of milk is poured on the statue in order to
make it to come alive and they also put other

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:43.469
milk products like yoghurt, ghee which is
clarified butter and orange juice also make

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.039
the statue to come alive.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:52.590
So it’s a science, it’s not a superstition
where you dump all these things on a statue.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.509
So once you have made this statue alive, then
you can put your prayers to the statue, which

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.539
is no longer a statue but a living God and
now I want to talk a little bit about this

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:13.010
particular dancing Shiva`s hydration.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.370
It takes place 6 times in a year.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:25.120
The time has been sacred for the energy of
Shiva to come into the earth plane, otherwise

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.830
there is no reason to perform the hydration
on this particular time.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.920
So time is of importance.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.909
Gods are forms of energy and they come here
only at a certain time.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:51.599
Ganesha comes on the fourth Moon, Muruga comes
on the sixth Moon, Goddesses come on the fifth

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.840
Moon and these are all very important timings.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.430
So this hydration time for Lord Nataraja is
only 6 times a year.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:11.209
The yogis and siddhas look forward to this
time so that they can take advantage of connecting

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.819
with Nataraj.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:23.599
Nataraj, the dancing Shiva is one, who is
in charge of creation, maintenance and also

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.799
dissolution.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.799
So he is the all powerful almighty in the
Indian tradition.

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:39.480
He is also the God of enlightenment, also
the God of light body and it is something

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.370
that is very close to my heart.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:51.270
Because, anybody who got a light body owes
a lot to Nataraja, who is dancing Shiva.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:04:00.659
So I am very happy to introduce this ceremony
to you and look forward to the ceremony that

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:07.260
comes only 6 times a year, which is once in
2 months.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:28.880
During that time you can make a direct link
with Nataraj.
