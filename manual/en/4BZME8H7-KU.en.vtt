00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.760
We humans tend to obsess over cleanliness.
We wear masks in public when we feel a cold

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.880
coming on, we cover ourselves daily in scented
soaps and antibacterial gel, and we’re crazy

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.480
about our hand sanitizer. But no matter how
much we steam, sterilize or scrub ourselves,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.040
we’re still outnumbered by our inner ecosystem.
Meet your “microbiome.”

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.570
The average adult human is made up of about
ten trillion cells, but each of us is carrying

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.450
ten times that number of bacteria--a hundred
trillion microbes--on our skin, hair, mouths,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.770
and inside of our intestines.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.719
You and I and everyone on Earth is mostly
microbe. But we’re not born that way. We

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.559
start out in a sterile womb, completely free
of bacteria, and we get our first dose of

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.910
bacteria before we’re even done being born.
As we pass through the vaginal cavity, we

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.140
ingest a tiny bit of this guy: It lives in
our intestines, where it’ll join about 600

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.019
other species that come along with our mother’s
breast milk. Their job? To break down sugars

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.660
in that milk that we couldn’t digest on
our own.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.640
As we are cuddled and kissed and eat and play
in the dirt, eventually over a thousand species

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.610
of bacteria will call our guts home. Early
on our little friends start fighting off bad

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.280
bacteria and help teach our immune system
the difference between good and bad. Mice

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.030
without a microbiome are much sicker as adults.
Children who take too many antibiotics, which

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.100
kill our good bacteria along with bad, can
be more likely to get asthma and intestinal

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.290
diseases later in life. These bacteria don’t
just protect us--they help feed us. Vitamins

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.450
like B3, B6, B12, and K are all produced by
our microbial friends and taken up by our

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.350
bodies. When babies switch from milk to mashed
carrots and pureed peas, plant-eating species

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.610
take over their intestines.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.430
Our microbiome goes way beyond our guts. Antonie
van Leeuwenhoek became the first person to

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.190
ever lay eyes on our little friends in 1683
when he scraped his teeth and placed them

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.450
under a microscope. Even after we brush our
teeth, hundreds of species live in our mouths

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.830
fighting disease and tooth decay. No two people
have exactly the same mouth bacteria, and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.390
you share your mix with everyone you kiss.
We used to think that sterile lungs were healthy.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.750
But there’s bacteria there, too, helping
prevent asthma and lung infections. We’ve

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.789
even found them in ears and arteries, and
manufacturing antibiotics in our noses. And

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.940
then! there’s our largest organ: the skin.
About a trillion bacteria live on our hair

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.590
follicles and epidermis. Some are playing
defense, making our skin slightly acidic or

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.490
producing chemicals to keep fungi from setting
up shop. Some skin bacteria prefer to live

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.220
in warm, dark places on our bodies munching
on our skin oils and sweat and releasing chemicals

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.120
that give us our particular . . . “aroma”

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.110
There’s a lot of weird microbiome science
that we don’t understand: Regardless of

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.220
your age, diet, gender, or where you’re
from, you probably have just one of three

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.540
intestinal ecosystems. Like blood types, we
all share only a handful of gut microbiome

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.540
types across all people. Have you heard of
bacterial mind control? The vagus nerve serves

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.870
as a sort of direct phone line from your gut
to your brain and mice that have certain friendly

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.700
bacteria in their intestines are calmer and
less anxious than those who don’t. Maybe

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.720
you really ARE what you eat. Here’s another
weird microbe mystery: If you looked at all

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.410
the species of bacteria on your right hand,
only about 1/5th of them would also live on

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.630
your left hand. Even if you do this! [rubs
hands together vigorously]

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.200
It’s like our bodies are a new planet that
we’ve just discovered. One team of scientists

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.360
found 1,458 brand new species in just 60 belly
buttons. All in all, we carry about 20,000

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.740
or so human genes and three million or so
bacterial genes. In a sense, we’re 1% human

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.050
and 99% bacterial. Sure, some bacteria are
bad, but most of them are just happy to call

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.850
us home, and happy to help us stay healthy.
If we don’t start treating our microbiome

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.580
like the friends they are, they might rise
up against us.
