00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.009
Where were you on the night of July 27th HMM?

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.790
HMMMMM turns out the very act of remembering
might make you forget.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.809
And that’s not a bad thing.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.130
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.020
Scientists have known for a while that humans
have terrible memories.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.620
Memories can change over time and we can even
remember things that never happened.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.230
We’ve talked about this a bunch on the show,
check out some links in the description for

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.430
those episodes.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.180
We know memory sucks, but science hasn’t
been sure why we forget things at all.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.840
Is it a passive thing that just happens?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.570
Well it turns out forgetting is a pretty active
process.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.840
Your brain does it on purpose and in a couple
of different ways.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.760
New research published in the journal Nature
Neuroscience found that by actively recalling

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.780
an event, related memories might be forgotten.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.700
The researchers asked participants to look
at images and to recall them several times.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.050
MRI scans reveled that as the participants
remembered the images, competing memories

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.200
initially fired up too, but then became suppressed.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.730
And that might be a good thing.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.890
That way, when I for example, talk about fine
China for a dinner party, you don’t immediately

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.590
think of the country.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.380
The researchers think maybe these new findings
could “be incredibly useful when trying

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.830
to overcome a negative memory from our past”.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.180
So forgetting might be a good thing, it actually
might make us remember other memories.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.610
But how does that happen?

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.110
What’s going on in the brain?

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.030
Another study published in the journal Cell,
found a specific protein that might be responsible

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.070
for forgetting.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.799
The so-called musashi protein helps build
connections between neurons called synapses,

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.630
where information is passed between them.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.550
The researchers genetically modified ringworms
to not produce this protein.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.920
Both regular and modified ringworms seem to
learn the same, but over time, the musashi-less

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.460
worms remembered better.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.900
The researchers think the protein aids in
forgetting by stopping the stabilization of

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.900
synaptic connections.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.509
Basically when you learn something new, new
connections are made between neurons.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.799
Some proteins make these connections strong
and more stable, but this musashi protein

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.830
actively disrupts this process, making the
ringworms, and maybe other animals, forgetful.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.659
The researchers think this might help the
nervous system retains its plasticity and

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.220
that if it didn’t you could develop serious
mental disorders.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.930
Another study published in the journal Neuron
found that right as we form a memory we are

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.360
also forgetting it.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.980
The study looked at brains in fruit flies
to see how it works.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.780
They found that dopamine helps form a memory
and helps us forget it.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.970
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that does a
lot of things in the brain, especially with

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.560
reward, pleasure and learning.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.130
The researchers found that as dopamine is
released in the brain it first acts on one

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.390
receptor called dDA1 which helps memories
form.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.750
After a memory solidifies, dopamine is still
being released but this time it acts on another

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.840
receptor called DAMB which starts to chip
away at the memory unless something significant

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.810
is attached to it, in the case of the flies,
that might be a sweet smell or an electric

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.810
shock.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.470
The process of solidifying a memory from a
short term to long term is called consolidation.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.739
The researchers think this mechanism might
be why savants have such extraordinary memories.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.680
Maybe it’s not that they have a better memory
but that they worse forgetting mechanisms.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.800
And that could be beneficial!

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.490
It might help us remember the more important
things and keep us from being overwhelmed

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.510
by the bad things and the not so important
things, like certain exes.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.440
Anyways, before we go on a trip down memory
lane, do you love DNews?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.480
We want to hear from you!

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.730
We’ve got a quick survey, it’ll take just
two minutes.

We wanna know what you think about our show!

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.530
It would really help us out, we want to make
the best show we possible can.
