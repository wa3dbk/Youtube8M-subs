00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.454
War doesn't decide who was right

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:06.517
but who is left

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.951
But still

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.933
we from the KGG

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.079
are accused 

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.046
of conducting genetic experiments

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:24.618
on the population

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:26.847
but trust me, that

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:30.068
is a LIE of the GOF

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:34.557
because the oppressors from the GOF

00:00:34.557 --> 00:00:35.975
try to find a reason

00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:37.547
to drive the militia off

00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:39.553
of it's 60 hectare of land

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:41.882
to take it for themselves

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:43.601
they fight against us

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:52.209
more than 1200 people

00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:55.641
stood here on the battlefield

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.570
I still smell

00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:02.526
the blood

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.134
the steel

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:08.064
and the petrol from the battlefield

00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:14.923
the fight is getting more violent

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:16.897
and increasingly stronger

00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:18.512
means are used

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:28.197
how long should this continue?

00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:34.670
have a good look

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:36.510
all this

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:38.736
won't stop

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:51.557
We're not defeated yet

00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:53.315
We're still HERE

00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:55.557
WE WON'T GIVE UP

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:05.933
Who are we?

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:09.050
KGG! KGG!

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.050
KGG!!
