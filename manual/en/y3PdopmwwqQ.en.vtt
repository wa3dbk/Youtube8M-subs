00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.629
We're doing this in celebration and recognition
of Title IX and its 40th anniversary.

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.030
It is an incredible day that we are celebrating
here in our country because it really shows

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.029
how far our country has come as a nation that's
always striving to become a more perfect union.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.349
I'm delighted that the younger women in this
room don't know a pre-Title IX world, because

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.800
it was very different and it really did restrict
the opportunity of way too many women and

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.800
girls.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.719
I'm proud to now lead the department that
actually, was the initial host of this wonderful

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:39.719
change.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.769
To see three million young girls playing high
school sports now, 10 times as much, six times

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.960
as many young women playing at the collegiate
level.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.750
It's just absolutely staggering the progress
we've made.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.559
Thanks so much for coming out and let's have
some fun.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.059
Let's play ball.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.230
[applause]

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.400
[cheering]

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.190
I played basketball in high school and some
in college and I remember in high school there

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.840
was only a boys' team.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.710
Now there are women's teams everywhere, including
professional teams and it's very much a part

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.540
of an exciting journey that is America.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.600
Well Title IX obviously has afforded me a
lot of opportunities to go to school, to get

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.600
to play sports.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.880
I grew up with two older brothers, playing
sports all the time, and so for people in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.900
my generation, for girls in my generation,
the idea of playing sports is just something

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.200
that's natural and Title IX's helped create
a lot of that.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.240
We are here to celebrate the successes of
this magnificent law, but the data and what

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.290
we're seeing in the field and the inequities
that are still too pervasive tell us we have

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.290
a long way to go.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.290
Some progress is not enough.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.050
I look at the younger kids and look at their
futures, it's just so bright for them and

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.800
the opportunities that they're going to have.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.170
So, it's definitely a special feeling.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.180
We're out there, you know, just having a good
time but it's getting a little competitive

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.180
also.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.180
[laughs]

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.870
It's pretty surreal to be out here with all
these folks.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.890
It looks like all the secretaries are playing
harder than anyone out there.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.750
It was fun, first of all, and it just underscored
on a generational level how much impact Title

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.750
IX has had.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.530
We had young kids like my eight-year old niece
who's out there, and in her mind there never

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.450
was a day when there wasn't Title IX.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.340
It's something she's always aspired.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.170
I was eight years old same age she is, when
Title IX was enacted in 1972.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.270
So, for me, it was an important fixture in
my growing up, but it was still something

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.500
relatively new.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.240
Our country needs our best and our brightest,
and when girls have the opportunity to play

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.660
sports, when women have equal access to educational
opportunities, to STEM opportunities, it means

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.790
we exponentially increase the country's brainpower.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.030
We're looking forward to the next 40 years
where we do it not only in athletics, but

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.260
we do it in math, science, and education,
and engineering.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.100
We let little girls and little boys everywhere
realize everything they could possibly hope

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.100
to do.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.580
So, it's great to come out, have some fun.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.070
Lots of different generations here playing
and that wasn't always the case, and so this

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.320
is a happy birthday party.
