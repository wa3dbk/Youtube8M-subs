Hi, my name is Windy St. George, and this
is how to play twenty questions. Twenty questions

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.530
is a simple parlor game that you can use to
pass the time. You don't need any props. One

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.970
person thinks of a, of an object or an item
that they're thinking of, and the other person

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.950
gets twenty questions to guess what it would
be. So, why don't you think of something,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.500
okay. Okay, you usually start off by asking
general questions that'll help you narrow

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.620
it down. Is it; you can only ask yes or no
questions, very important. Is it an animal?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:47.060
Yes. Okay, is it bigger than a breadbox? No.
Is it a carnivore? Yes. Does it say meow?

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:57.180
No. Is it kept as a pet normally? No. Okay,
is it ever kept as a pet? No. Is it found

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:06.430
in a circus? No. Is it found in a zoo? Yes.
We're supposed to be counting questions. You're

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.360
supposed to count until twenty, yeah. When
you play twenty questions there are typical

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.750
questions that you ask that'll help you narrow
down quickly what the item is. Usually, is

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.600
it an animal, a vegetable, or a mineral, or
an idea, and you have to get a yes or no for

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.210
each one of those. Once you narrow that down
you ask about its size. Usually is it bigger

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.420
than a breadbox, and so forth until you've
got a rough idea of the size. For animals

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.210
you should ask what does it eat? Is it a vegetarian
or a meat eater, if it flies or if it swims,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.700
and general questions like this; if it has
fur, if it's warm blooded or cold blooded

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.689
will help you narrow down until you can, hopefully,
guess what the object is before your twenty

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.150
questions are up. And that's how you play
twenty questions.
