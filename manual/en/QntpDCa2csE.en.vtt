00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:09.155
My name is Angela Mauricio. I work with
Dr. Mauricio. I am her lead registered nurse.

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:14.128
Today we are in Dr. Tess Dermatology Center
in La Jolla, California.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.313
We have had the Venus Freeze for over a year.

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:22.710
We were the first in Southern California
to have the treatment. Our patients love it.

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:28.793
It took over our practice for basically
the whole year after we brought it in.

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:35.018
We started off with one machine. We got
a second unit and now we have a third unit.

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:37.832
So we have been doing them back-to-back.

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:43.820
We do face, neck, chest, and we do the
body treatments. Our patients love it.

00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:48.860
It's comfortable, it's fast,
it's easy, it's relaxing.

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:53.778
Many of the treatments that we do,
as you know, can sometimes be intimidating.

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.892
They can be scary, they can have downtime.

00:00:57.312 --> 00:01:01.836
But this treatment is comfortable and they
leave the office already looking better.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:07.421
They have a nice pink glow to the skin,
but they can continue their day like normal,

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:13.383
which is so important for a lot of these busy
women who come into these types of practices.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.133
One patient in particular, we had done
a full CO2 on her maybe 5 years ago.

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:29.217
I had done only six Venus Freeze treatments
on her and the difference was remarkable.

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.834
So this is someone who had done the 'big guns'
that dermatologist can do.

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:40.623
So we did a CO2, and all I did was this
treatment, Venus Freeze. No downtime.

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:43.793
I'm sure she was thinking, "Oh you know,
this is not going to do much for me."

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.848
But the results are just unbelievable.

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:53.278
the before and after photos they are even being
used right now by the company. They're so good.

00:01:53.603 --> 00:01:57.991
So the patient is pleased, all of our patients
are very happy with this treatment.

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:08.391
From a practitioner's standpoint, I have been in
this industry for about eight years now

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.186
and I've seen a lot of the changes from the
trends, from having downtime to no downtime.

00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:18.587
This particular treatment though I think has
it all. There's no downtime.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:23.377
You're going to get results and there is a lot
of patient comfort and patient satisfaction.

00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:26.668
But one thing that I love is the handpiece itself.

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:34.360
Look at how light this is. Very light, very easy
to use. I can do this treatment back-to-back.

00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:40.745
I remember there was a time where
I was doing this treatment eight hours a day.

00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:45.783
So it's such a great treatment, and patients
are really impressed too because you can really

00:02:46.202 --> 00:02:52.055
show them how really graceful you can be with
this. The patient can feel every move you make.

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:58.751
Every pressure point you're hitting is purposeful
that you are trying to lift up their cheeks,

00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:05.802
like your trying to sculpt their jaw line,
but this is very easy to use,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.330
easy to get results and very little fatigue
for the practitioner.
