00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.428
The goal of this particular piece was we wanted
to dive into the League of Legends universe

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:34.053
with a bigger more diverse cast.

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:38.875
I think it's just about fleshing things out,
like, who are these characters?

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.969
What is the world really like that they live
in?

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.770
Because when you play the game you get a very
small piece of a much broader story that we

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:46.715
want to tell.

00:00:54.751 --> 00:01:01.362
A cinematic of this depth leads to champion
discovery, it forces us to go deeper into

00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:03.748
understanding the characters that we're trying
to portray.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:09.719
For one, there's significantly more detail
in the art and the textures and the models

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:11.504
that we're putting forth.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:15.265
When we're up close and personal in someone's
face like how are they going to react to a

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:17.869
situation, we have to really understand their
personality.

00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:22.151
We had to kind of find a balance and look
for good moments where we could say something

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:25.415
about a character in the middle of what they
were doing.

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:35.920
One of my favorite moments is when Draven
steps in on Leona's sword, he kneels down

00:01:35.925 --> 00:01:37.435
and he's just like "sucks to be you."

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:41.437
You know, he doesn't have to say it, he just
has that look on his face.

00:01:44.618 --> 00:01:49.397
The big meme that Brad was really reinforcing
was just, Graves is not impressed.

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:56.047
Nothing impresses Graves, he's seen it all
and we try to reflect that in the acting choices

00:01:56.052 --> 00:01:58.562
that he makes throughout.

00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:02.775
And then when you do see him get a little
bit scared and you do see him get bested by

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:07.419
Nautilus when he barely gets his gun up in
time and it's sort of shattered by the anchor,

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:11.162
seeing a little bit of fear in Graves is also
kind of a cool moment.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.068
Every character has to feel different, has
to move different.

00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:21.601
In League of Legends, if somebody swings an axe
a certain way, Brad always describes this,

00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:25.104
if they swing an axe a certain way no other
character in the history of League can swing

00:02:25.108 --> 00:02:26.488
it in that same way.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.799
Because they all have their sort of animation
identity.

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:35.991
Then on the form side it's their silhouette,
you know, their proportions, their size, every

00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:41.186
single one of those things, all those little
ingredients equal the sum of making someone

00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:43.371
a unique individual.

00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:48.892
For Darius, you know, we went with the strong
jaw, the size of his eyes, the way his lips

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:55.257
are, even the wideness of his nose gives him
that hulking sort of alpha look.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:05.044
Ahri we wanted to sell that fox-like structure
to her and so there are these very minor things

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.870
done with her face and the way her eyes are
spaced, and her nose, and her lips.

00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:13.703
Of course there's the ears and the tail but
even in her movement in the piece we actually

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:19.167
went with a very slick, sleek, sort of evasive
movement style for her to bring out this fox

00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:19.952
side.

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:36.563
One of the great challenges we had with the
sound for the cinematic was creating something

00:03:36.697 --> 00:03:42.207
that a player could close their eyes watching
this cinematic and then instantly know that

00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:44.671
that's the character that they know and love
from the game.

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:47.384
From a sound perspective it always starts
with foley.

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:52.036
Foley is basically recording all of the stuff
that, sounds that a human being can actually

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.830
reproduce so it's doing a lot of armor, leather,
cloth movement, footsteps.

00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:02.795
Foley is very important for storytelling because
it's animation so there's no production track

00:04:02.798 --> 00:04:08.557
to start with so every movement of each one
of these characters has to be custom hand

00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:09.922
designed.

00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:18.438
Leona was really difficult just because we
had taken up kind of the big badass armor

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:23.920
space with Darius and so for Leona we actually
went and we looked for different kinds of

00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:28.665
really high pitched elements that almost had
a sunshine kind of feel to them.

00:04:43.543 --> 00:04:46.343
Musically, I definitely wanted it to feel
different.

00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:50.304
Every character needs kind of their own element
and their own character musically and that

00:04:50.307 --> 00:04:52.637
takes time to find, you know?

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.079
Because there's only so many instruments in
the world. 

00:04:57.935 --> 00:05:00.614
Nautilus was really difficult because,

00:05:00.616 --> 00:05:04.456
what does a huge dude that's a running submarine
sound like, right?

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:09.649
When you think about it it's a pretty straight
forward approach. Alright, he comes from underwater,

00:05:09.654 --> 00:05:11.354
let's go underwater.

00:05:50.647 --> 00:05:55.288
I think we want players to come away with
this feeling a stronger connection to the

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:57.091
characters that they play as.

00:05:57.093 --> 00:06:02.984
I play Jax a lot and seeing him in cinematic
form gives you a lot more of an attachment

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:03.618
to the character.

00:06:03.618 --> 00:06:05.459
You know I can say like, that's Jax.

00:06:05.461 --> 00:06:11.331
And I can go, because I play Darius a lot,
I can go yeah and I owned you by grabbing

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:13.366
you and tossing you.

00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:15.316
It's those conversations that can happen.

00:06:15.318 --> 00:06:19.478
It really is something made out of passion
and love so that our players, when they see

00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:22.711
it, they will enjoy it just as much as we
enjoy making it.

00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:27.274
Lets make more cool stuff for our players
so that we can see it too.
