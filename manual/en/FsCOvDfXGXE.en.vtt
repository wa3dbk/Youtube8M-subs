&gt;&gt; Alfred Bader first fell in love
with art and the idea of collecting art

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.410 position:61%
when he was doing his graduate studies.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.310 position:59%
He was studying chemistry, but he took
an art history course, and he began,

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.490 position:69%
almost immediately, to acquire works of art.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.900
So his love of art immediately
became of active acquisition.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.860 position:63%
In the 1960s, he first gave a work of
art to the Agnes Etherington Art Centre,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.260 position:58%
and his collection built dramatically
over the following decades,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.110 position:69%
as did his commitment to Queen's University.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.510
The focus of his research on the
School of Rembrandt became key,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.190 position:58%
and he continues to collect today and
to enlarge and deepen those holdings

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.410 position:58%
to our supreme pleasure and
advantage here at Queen's University.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.990 position:58%
&gt;&gt; The Bader Collection is the
largest collection of Dutch paintings

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.100
in any university museum in Canada,
possibly in any museum in Canada.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.260 position:56%
And we are the only museum in Canada
that has two Rembrandt paintings.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.300 position:69%
It's a remarkably focused collection with an
emphasis on Dutch art of the 17th century,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.810
but it also includes other
kinds of European art.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.270 position:63%
&gt;&gt; The collection has had a huge impact,
especially within class discussions.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.670 position:66%
We've had numerous assignments where we
have to do what's called a visual analysis

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.850
where you don't analyze, you just
strictly write down what you see.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.170 position:61%
And while you can do that from an image
in a textbook, you don't see as much

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.010
in as much detail than as
you do seeing it in person.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.590 position:75%
So I would remember coming to the art centre
for hours and hours and staring at one painting,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.690
going over every square inch,
and you can see a lot more detail

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.350 position:70%
and see what things may have been painted
over, that you can't tell from reproductions.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.980
It's a really intimate experience
having that here.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.300
&gt;&gt; A key responsibility of an art
teacher is to design curriculum.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.270 position:72%
The Bader Collection, through its finely-tuned
curation, is a wonderful launching pad,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.280 position:63%
because it helps students to look at art
as a way of conveying meaning and a way

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.920 position:63%
of anchoring an art unit, which involves
studio production and art history.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.560 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Healthcare students, like any professional,
occupational therapy students will be working

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.870
and communicating in a huge
range of environments,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.750 position:73%
and if the students are only seeing things from
their own perspective, and failing to recognize

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.370 position:73%
that there are a multiplicity of viewpoints out
there, it really will compromise their ability

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.560 position:63%
to communicate, advocate, and get things
to happen on behalf of the client.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.290
So the gallery's ideal for that,
because they're looking at art

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.280
and becoming really quickly aware
how we all notice different things.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.370 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Occupational therapy, in a sense, is both an
art and a science, and there are certain aspects

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.130 position:63%
of occupational therapy where you might
be using visual arts or performance arts

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.530 position:56%
to actually help people who are
having trouble expressing themselves

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.900 position:58%
and find a new medium for expression.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.570 position:64%
It was just kind of any inspiration and
really encouraging to know that that side

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.510
of learning was also available
to us on the Queen's campus.
