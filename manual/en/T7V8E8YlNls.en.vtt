00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.640
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to remove, inspect

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.000
and overhaul your vehicle's alternator. From
here I'm going to take and unscrew the bolt

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.279
from the retaining nut on the brush. Making
sure to keep the alignment, going to go ahead

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.010
and unscrew the second one. And like I said,
make sure to keep your alignment between the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:39.390
metal tab on the brush, the hole, and your
bolt. From here we're going to take and install

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.760
this on the voltage regulator, just like that.
We're going to take and reinstall our screws,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:01:09.600
and we're going to run them down hand tight,
there's one, and now let me get the second,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:25.541
run this one down hand tight as well. Alright,
now don't get excited and remove your toothpick

00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:30.030
yet, because it'll spring your brushes out
and possibly damage the wiring. But that is

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.300
the properly reassembled voltage regulator.
What we're going to do now is reinstall it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.659
onto our alternator. Got my alternator here.
You can see how there's a cut out in this

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.620
area. We're going to take and line that up
and drop our voltage regulator in place. We're

00:01:49.620 --> 00:02:21.790
going to take and remount our regulator to
the alternator housing. I'm going to take

00:02:21.790 --> 00:03:13.910
and run all these screws down hand tight,
and for the last one. Alright, go ahead and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.130
take my quarter inch ratchet, and run down
the mounting screws for the voltage regulator,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:31.340
not the brush retaining screws.
They don't need to be extremely tight, they're

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:46.800
very light duty components, and treat them
as such, right there. Alright, once you have

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.099
your four mounting screws screwed down and
torqued, go ahead and take and screw down

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:03.260
the brush retaining screws.
Now be careful not to over tighten these because

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.810
you will bind that nut up inside the plastic
housing and crack the housing. Once you have

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.760
your voltage regulator mounted, and your brush
retaining screws screwed down, you can take

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.969
and remove your toothpick, just like so. That
is the proper procedure for reloading your

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.610
voltage regulator, and installing it back
on the alternator.
