Hello, and welcome to our Origami
Circular Glider video!

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.699
So this circular structure is actually a pretty good glider and easy to make.

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.519
We start with a square of origami paper

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.329
color side down

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:20.329
and then make a valley fold as we're showing here, along one diagonal

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.330
make a nice

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.010
clean crease in the paper here

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.620
Next we're going to fold the bottom edge of the
triangle upwards

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.750
about one centimeter or so

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.750
just like this

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.790
All right, now each of the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.910
end pieces of the flap we just folded up

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.360
actually has a little pocket

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.380
what we're gonna do is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.850
insert one end, one pocket

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.400
into the other pocket, just like this. So
one of the pieces will be

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.710
slightly smaller than the other

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.150
and you just stick that piece in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.470
nice and tight like that

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.750
and once you have that, what you want to
do is go around the piece

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.500
with your fingers

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.480
and shape it so that it's nice and
circular

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.560
and the more circular you make this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.070
the better the airplane will fly.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.030
Take your time, just go around and shape it

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.820
just like that

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.540
That's all there is to it.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.110
Now you want to take the circular glider,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.440
hold it with your forefinger on top and thumb below,  hold it above

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.940
your head

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.389
and just let it fall to the floor

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.179
It will fall almost straight down, than level
off in a nice

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:15.019
long gliding flight.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:15.449
Enjoy!
