00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:05.940
Okay.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.110
Alligators, certainly, are one of my favorite
reptiles for a number of reasons.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.840
First of all, let's distinguish alligators
from crocodiles.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.190
They're all in the crocodilian family; alligators
are a subset of that, as are Gharials, Caimans

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.970
and true crocodiles, like the Nile crocodile.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.700
So, that's one differentiator.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.190
Alligators have a rounded snout on them, where
crocs are more pointed.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.289
And, really, alligators, I always say, have
kind of a smile to their face.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.180
Their teeth don't normally protrude like this
one does.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.860
He's a young alligator.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.820
Alligators rotate their teeth like sharks.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.670
So, we get two in our lifetime.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.160
Alligators, they just keep coming.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.300
So, they're constantly falling out at this
age and a new tooth is coming behind.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.269
Usually, crocodiles' teeth are sticking out
up and down and they got kind of a menacing

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.269
scowl to them.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.190
Where gators kind of smile before they eat
you, right?

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.660
Alligators are an American treasure.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.579
There's only two species of alligators on
the planet.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.100
Our American alligator, that you're familiar
with in Florida, gator country.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.290
And then there's a smaller species in China,
the Chinese alligator, which unfortunately

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.930
for it, is on the verge of extinction due
to predation and habitat loss.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.740
People in that area of the world eat alligators.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.810
So, there's very, very few of those left.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.770
The rest of the world has crocodiles, Caimans
and Gharials.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.040
But they're one of my favorite creatures because
they're nature's perfect predator.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.570
These animals were here 225 million years
ago.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.140
That's a big number.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.200
Dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago
and the first one was seen about 175 million

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200
years ago.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.280
So, what is it about the alligator and the
crocodile that kept it alive for so long?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.480
And, really, if you look at fossil records,
they're pretty much the same.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.500
They just got a lot bigger back then.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.380
Well, what makes them perfect predators, is
everything about their body shape and everything

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.810
about their face.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.300
They are solid muscle.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.180
Alligators got a huge tail that's full of
muscle that allows them to move very quickly

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.180
and stealthily through the water, which is
how they attack their prey.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940
They sneak up on it, right?

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.979
But if you look at the top of his head.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.890
His eyes protrude and his nostrils are at
the top.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.730
So, oftentimes, when he sneaks up on something
at the water's edge, you will just see the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.730
top of his head.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.830
You'll see his eyes and his nose.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.160
And mammals, unfortunately, for 225 million
years, haven't figured out what's in the water

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.130
and what's about to jump out and get them.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.650
They're often easy prey for an alligator who
is the ultimate in stealth.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.120
They have quick reflexes, they push off with
their arms and legs and their tail.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.990
They bolt out of the water with mouth agape.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.540
You can see the teeth sticking out.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.680
But what you can't feel, really, is the jaw
strength.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.480
This animal has 2,000 pounds per square-inch
of jaw strength.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.760
It can crush bone.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.940
A large alligator, once it latches on to its
prey, it has no chance of escaping.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.610
Small items, they eat quickly.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.420
Larger ones, they pull under the water and
drown and they eat it over the course of the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.990
next few days, weeks or months, depending
on what it is.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.130
In order for them to see properly in the water,
alligators have developed a double eyelid

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.130
system.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.130
They have an eyelid that closes their eyes
very efficiently to keep dirt out of it and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.160
when they sleep.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.160
But they also have a clear eyelid that's underneath
that one that goes from the back to the front

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.849
that allows them to go under the water and
see clearly.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.200
Much like you wear goggles in a chlorinated
pool.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.160
So, they'll have that eyelid closed.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.459
Their nostrils are like the hatches on a submarine.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.819
They close those down.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.740
They can go a good 45 minutes under the water
and then, there's the business end, right?

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.849
They sneak up on their prey, they come out
of the water with their mouths wide open,

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.569
look at the sharp teeth, there.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.569
Bam.

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.460
They come down on top of the prey, drag it
back into the water and they continue life

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.459
again, just like they've been doing for 225
million years.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.989
The alligator is an American treasure that
almost was hunted to extinction 40 years ago

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.150
because of this little piece of skin, right
here.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.160
It's really soft.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.120
And that made a wonderful pocketbook, belt,
cowboy boot, you name it.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.310
And we almost hunted every single one after
all those millions of years of being successful.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.590
Luckily, people stepped in and stopped it,
but in recent years, it started up again with

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.720
people in that area of the Southeast saying
they need to alligators for commerce.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.410
There are even television shows that are popping
up showing how they slaughter these alligators

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.190
ritualistically for profit.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.850
I don't really agree with that.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.919
I understand people have to make a living,
but I don't want to see it in film.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.310
So, we really have to respect animals like
this.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.850
Understand their role in nature.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.880
Understand they were here way before we were
and they'll probably be here when we're gone.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.710
The American alligator, certainly a U.S. treasure.
