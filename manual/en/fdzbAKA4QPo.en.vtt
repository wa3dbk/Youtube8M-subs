Heather Nauta: Hey guys, this is Heather from
healthyeatingstartshere.com. Okay, today we

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.540
are taking on a battle, a battle between chocolates
and carob. Now this carob is in a sunflower

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.439
seed butter jar but it is carob inside there.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:31.439
So a lot of people think of carob as a substitute
for chocolate which I think is very misleading

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.229
because if you look first at flavor, the flavor
of chocolate and carob are just totally different

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:44.289
and they are both excellent. I love them both
but for someone who has never had carob, it's

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.659
going to taste weird. It's not going to
taste like chocolate and if there is someone

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.510
who is telling you, oh, it's just great
healthy chocolate, I'll turn that, hey,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.039
you are not going to like it.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.889
I mean if you think about it in terms of just
being something good in a treat, then maybe,

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:03.209
well, if you have an open mind, but a lot
of people I think that's where the issue

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.749
comes in.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:10.749
Now in terms of healthiness, carob often gets
totted as the healthy choice as opposed to

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.119
caffeine -- as opposed to chocolate and I
am getting ahead of myself because the reason

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.340
is usually about the caffeine level.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.869
Chocolate, cocoa powder has some caffeine
in them and then they also another stimulant

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.759
called theobromine; some people have issues
with it, some people don't. If you are sensitive

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.070
to caffeine or theobromine and you'll notice
when you eat some chocolate, you might get

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.060
headaches, you might feel jittery, you might
get acne, then you might want to try some

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.249
carob because carob does not have any caffeine
or any theobromine; it doesn't have any

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.039
stimulants at all.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.679
So that's one benefit for carob and that's
usually why people talk about it as being

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.409
a healthy alternative. And there are some
other things to think about as well. So cocoa

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.039
and chocolate are very bitter naturally; they
don't have any natural sugars in them whereas

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.859
carob is naturally sweet, it has a lot of
sugars in it, just as it is, so you don't

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.830
need to add a lot to it.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.340
Now this is a case where you just really have
to look at the ingredients of what you are

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.049
buying because a lot of chocolate does have
a ton of added sugar but a lot of carob also

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.129
has a ton of added sugar even if it doesn't
necessarily need it.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.299
That's also about the type of sugar that's
been used in there. So if you found a chocolate

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.530
that was using unrefined sugar, that might
be better than a carob chip that's using

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.900
high fructose corn syrup and then when you
get too fat, it's the same thing. So chocolate

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.900
has more natural fat whereas carob has virtually
none and what you have to do is look at what

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.989
it is you are eating it in.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.209
So if you are eating a chocolate bar that's
pure dark chocolate and just made with cocoa

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.769
butter that might be better than a carob chip
made with hydrogenated palm oil.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.530
Okay, so that covers pretty much the downsides
of both of these things, but then if you look

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.930
at the upsides, cocoa and chocolate have been
studied to have lots of antioxidants, lots

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.930
of magnesium, and other minerals and carob
has a lot of calcium, iron and vitamins as

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.230
well as some antioxidants and some other minerals
and stuff like that.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.540
So there are benefits to them. Now I don't
eat them to get nutrients; I eat them because

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.840
I can make delicious treats with them but
it always helps when something that's yummy

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.629
also has some healthiness going on to it.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:42.629
Okay, so in the battle of chocolate versus
carob, who is going to win? I like them both.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.469
I think that's maybe a cheater answer but
honestly, they both have their own benefits,

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.079
they taste totally different so I like using
them in different things.

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.840
I do tend to go with carob a lot of the times
because I don't have to add much sugar to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.540
it whereas with cocoa, I do need to add quite
a bit of sweetness and I can do that with

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.569
bananas, I can do that with dates. You don't
have to use sugars specifically but you do

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.049
need to sweeten it up a little bit.

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.910
And I also like to steer clear of the bars
and stuff made with hydrogenated oils and

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.480
I find it really, really difficult to find
carob chips that are made with good unhydrogenated

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.130
oils because a lot of them melt like coconut
oil melts at 24 degree Celsius.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.510
So I actually make it at home, I have a video
for homemade chocolate that I often make with

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.810
carob and call it caroblit (ph). So that's
my verdict. I am going to post a few recipes

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.380
for you guys to try out, making some of your
own healthy treats with carob or chocolate

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.380
and I would love to hear from you as to which
one you prefer and why and what kinds of things

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.720
you'd like to make with them. So let me
know in the comments and I'll see you again

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.490
next time.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.310
Oh, and this week, I am going to post a recipe
for healthy brownies and I am probably going

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.710
to use a mix of cocoa and carob. I do like
to mix them because I -- I don't know, I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.670
like both of their flavors together sometimes.
So you can check that out later on this week.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.030
See you!

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.700
