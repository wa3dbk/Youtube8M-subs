Hey everybody my name is Matt and I am speaking
to you on behalf of Expert Village. Now we

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:11.090
know how to modify our character a bit and
go to control our lights and by now you are

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.020
probably going to be able to render your project.
Doing so is easy, all you have to do is come

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.570
up to render at the top and select render.
You can also hit, "Command R" on a Mac or

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.280
"Control R" on Windows. That is going to render
out your project. There is a lot different

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.300
settings you are probably going to want to
familiarize yourself with. If you come down

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.160
to "Render Settings", it is going to bring
up your "Render Settings Dialog". Make sure

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.690
you?re under the "Render Settings Tab". Below
that you will see a couple different tabs,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.300
on the left you will see the, "Firefly Tab",
this is the firefly rendering engine. You

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.330
can change the settings down here under "Auto
Settings from Draft to Final". That is going

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.970
to affect the quality of your final render.
If you can click "Manual Settings" you can

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.600
also go in and change the different settings,
under here, such as whether or not shadows

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.420
are cast, whether or not ray tracing is on.
All this is going to affect not only the quality

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.830
of your render but how long it takes to render
out your final project. Light and a lot of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.941
other different things will also affect how
long it takes to render out your final project,

00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:29.550
such as the amount of lights and type of hair
you have your character. But if you go over

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.340
here to Poser Four, this is an older rendering
engine that you can play around with if you

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:41.810
want. This was abandoned in Poser Four in
favor of the Firefly rendering engine. You

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.070
can also select sketch, which will make your
render look like a sketch. Then, you have

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.870
different settings here you can select. You
can come down and either select, "Save Settings"

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.380
or "Render Now" and that is going to render
out your project. If you want you after you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.700
have rendered it out, you can go up to file
and select, "Export" and if you click, "Image"

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.960
you can export your image onto your hard drive.
