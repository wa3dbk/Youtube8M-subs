Hi. I'm Dr. Adrian Preston and I'm a cardiologist at Cardiovascular Specialists of Central Maryland.

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:32.239
I specialize in non-invasive cardiology, women's
heart health, and nuclear cardiology. 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.910
There are differences sometimes in symptoms of heart
attacks or angina for women than men and unfortunately,

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:54.109
we do miss a lot of symptoms in women because
of it. The textbook symptom of the classic...the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.749
classic symptom of crushing chest pain that
radiates down your left arm or your jaw with

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:07.710
exercise, for men it's there, and for women
it may not be so apparent. Symptoms that I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.710
have seen in women include just shortness
of breath with exertion or even doing minimal

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.920
things, jaw pain or neck pain, and a lot of
women complain of acid reflux symptoms that

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:30.410
sound like textbook acid reflux, and it turns
out to be coronary artery disease. And also,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.330
fatigue...just a generalized fatigue that
you can't explain and it's new onset and its

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.860
never happened to you before, but all it is
is the fatigue and the lassitude...that could

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.640
be a symptom as well, and unfortunately a
lot of patients, especially diabetics, have

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.980
no symptoms, and that goes for both men and women.
