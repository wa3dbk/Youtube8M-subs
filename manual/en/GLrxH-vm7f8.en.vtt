00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:04.189
- Today we're learning all
about the building blocks

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:05.152
of comic books.

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:08.152
(heavy metal music)

00:00:10.388 --> 00:00:11.898
Welcome to Comic Misconceptions,

00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:13.558
the shows that take you into detail

00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:14.788
about the things you think
you know about comics.

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:16.532
I'm your host, Scott Niswander.

00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:18.703
For Christmas, I asked for a book called

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:21.025
The Lexicon of Comicana by Mort Walker.

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:22.372
It's actually a really quick read,

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:25.727
but man, is it super
interesting and very hilarious.

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:28.061
There are lots of parts that
had me laughing out loud

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.559
like a crazy person.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.461
Chapter five alone is a
really funny how-to section

00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:34.772
about how to do some of
the most basic things,

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:38.022
like how to hold a pen,
how to draw faces and ears

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:39.892
and feet, and for some reason,

00:00:39.892 --> 00:00:41.738
the one that had me
laughing out loud the most

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:43.955
was how to draw word balloons.

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:45.151
But we're gonna be
getting into chapter two

00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:46.974
which is all about symbols and shapes

00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:48.077
that you didn't know had names,

00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:51.095
but have been in comics and
are still pretty fundamental

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.523
in comic books today,

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:54.497
starting with last week's trivia challenge

00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:56.343
which was, "what is it
called when profanity

00:00:56.343 --> 00:00:59.095
"is replaced by symbols in comics?"

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:01.753
Derrick highfashion reed
went above and beyond

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:05.201
and wrote both grawlixes and profanitype,

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:06.920
which are both acceptable answers.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.882
I also would've accepted maledicta,

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:10.461
which is more of a general term for it

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.516
and of course, obscenicons,

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:15.244
which is kind of a more modern term.

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:16.846
So grawlixes, which is my preferred term,

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:18.576
have a long history in comic books,

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:22.756
dating back to the earliest
one that we can find in 1902,

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:24.497
but the term grawlix wasn't even coined

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:26.664
until 1964 by Mort Walker.

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.372
But if we look back then,
it kind of appears different

00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:31.835
than how we know today.

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:33.866
Back then, grawlixes
were kind of a sub-genre

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.583
of maledicta, which is
an all-encompassing term

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:39.985
for replacing profanity with symbols.

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:41.912
You have your jarns, which are spirals,

00:01:41.912 --> 00:01:44.954
quimps which are planets or
other astronomical symbols,

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:46.823
nittles which are stars, and grawlixes

00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:48.541
which are just scribbles.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.898
Over time, grawlixes just
become the more general term

00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:51.839
for all of that.

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:54.045
Also, not that I need to plug his channel,

00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:56.216
but Michael at Vsauce
did a really cool video

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.690
a couple months ago about bad words

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.476
and it mentions the Lexicon of Comicana

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:02.543
and grawlixes and all
that, so go check it out,

00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:03.727
link in the description.

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.202
But we're just getting started, though.

00:02:05.202 --> 00:02:07.884
Grawlixes are a form of dialog,
and where do we put dialog?

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:10.124
In word balloons, or fumetti,

00:02:10.124 --> 00:02:13.387
which I'm probably pronouncing
wrong because it's Italian.

00:02:13.387 --> 00:02:16.127
The first fumetti that we can find

00:02:16.127 --> 00:02:19.064
dates back all the way
to the 16th century.

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:20.318
And I'm sure you know of thought bubbles,

00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:22.617
but those are actually
called cumulus balloons,

00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:25.357
although now-a-days, most
comic book characters

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:27.946
just think in color
coordinated rectangles.

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:30.059
Emanata is kind of an
all-encompassing word

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.530
for non-verbal communication
from things and people.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.084
So if something is hot, it
might give off an indotherm.

00:02:36.084 --> 00:02:39.532
If it's really hot, like the
sun, it will display solrads.

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:43.097
A waftarom helps us see if
something is giving off an aroma,

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:45.419
and if you have something
brand spanking new,

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.416
show it off with a few neoflects.

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:49.529
Plewds are a way of showing
that a person is nervous

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.642
about something, they're
little drops of sweat

00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:53.337
that spray out of your face.

00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:55.252
If you want to show
that something is shiny,

00:02:55.252 --> 00:02:56.936
you can use a lucaflect.

00:02:56.936 --> 00:02:58.143
- Shiny.

00:02:58.143 --> 00:02:59.757
- Even simple lines have names

00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:01.046
depending on how you use them.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.194
Dites are diagonal lines
that show something is made

00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:06.166
of a reflective material
like a window or a mirror.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:08.081
Draw them vertically
and they're now vites,

00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.984
which indicate a shiny
surface, usually on the ground.

00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:13.399
Horizontally, and you guessed it, hites.

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:14.653
You've probably drawn these a lot

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.044
to show the speed that
something is traveling.

00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:18.298
And those little dust clouds that appear

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:19.807
when something takes off at a high speed,

00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:21.421
those are called briffits.

00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:22.698
These last two are really interesting.

00:03:22.698 --> 00:03:25.566
If you wanna draw something
traveling in a circular pattern,

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:28.744
like a punch or something,
you would us a swalloop,

00:03:28.744 --> 00:03:31.368
but swalloops are not complete circles.

00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:33.179
There is a little bit of space

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.199
indicating where they start and stop.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.254
That is called a whitope.

00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:39.994
Yes, even nothingness has a name.

00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:41.167
So I found these super fascinating,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:42.397
and I hope you guys did, too,

00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:44.406
and if I got anything
wrong or missed anything,

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:46.078
let me know in the comments below

00:03:46.078 --> 00:03:47.007
and while you're down there,

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:49.244
let me know if you can come
up with a name for something

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:50.312
that doesn't have a name,

00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:52.356
like you know when something
powerful hits something else

00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:55.235
and it kind of creates
a splash back of energy?

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.534
I want to call those
splams for some reason.

00:03:57.534 --> 00:03:59.821
Don't know why, but I do.

00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:01.586
So leave some interesting comments below

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:02.677
and we'll talk about it next time

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:04.175
and right now we're just gonna move on

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:06.758
to the weekly trivia challenge.

00:04:09.993 --> 00:04:12.406
For the next episode that
I hope to get out faster

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:14.577
will be another top five episode,

00:04:14.577 --> 00:04:17.166
because I've lost track
of what episode we're on

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:19.360
at this point and I think

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.729
that I just want to do
another one of those.

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.504
We're still working the
kinks out with everything,

00:04:24.504 --> 00:04:26.872
but we're gonna be talking about vehicles.

00:04:26.872 --> 00:04:29.310
There have been so many vehicles
in comic book, you guys,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.015
from the Batmobile, the
iconic Batmobile, of course,

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:35.638
the X-Men's Blackbird, I
loved that thing as a kid,

00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:36.505
it was my favorite.

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:38.363
But we're not gonna be talking
about the greats, oh no.

00:04:38.363 --> 00:04:40.511
We're gonna be talking
about the worst vehicles

00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:43.959
in comic books in my personal opinion,

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.666
starting with this
week's trivia challenge,

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:47.674
which is, "which vehicle
came into existence

00:04:47.674 --> 00:04:49.810
"when a superhero, struggling for rent,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.980
"signed an advertising
deal with Corona Motors?"

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.813
If you think you know the answer

00:04:53.813 --> 00:04:54.930
or just wanna leave your best guess,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.067
you can do so in the comments below.

00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:00.900
So get started on the
weekly trivia challenge.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.985
First thing's first, to everyone

00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:09.814
asking for a Deadpool
video, we're working on it.

00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:10.917
First and foremost, guys, I wanna thank

00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:13.016
each and every one of you for supporting

00:05:13.016 --> 00:05:15.608
the Nerdsync podcast Kickstarter
and making that a success.

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:19.823
We are currently still getting
a lot of our audio gear in,

00:05:19.823 --> 00:05:23.190
but we're excited to
do some more podcasts.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.653
We recorded one about the Winter Soldier,

00:05:24.653 --> 00:05:26.824
Spoilercast, that was really fun,

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:29.761
and also, recently we were invited to

00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:32.803
the Marble City First Annual Comicon.

00:05:32.803 --> 00:05:34.242
We got press passes and everything.

00:05:34.242 --> 00:05:36.100
I wasn't able to go, but Bryce was,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.746
and he got to talk to George
Perez, the George Perez.

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:41.731
Got him to sign my copy
of Infinity Gauntlet,

00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:43.867
I don't know if you can
see that, but I'm excited.

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:47.013
We also got a seven
minute interview with him,

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.869
which should be up soon,
as well as some footage

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:51.393
from the Con itself.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:52.937
Big things are happening guys

00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:55.874
and I love it, and it's all thanks to you.

00:05:55.874 --> 00:05:58.428
Also a big shout out
and thank you to Seymour

00:05:58.428 --> 00:06:00.646
who's helping be edit these videos,

00:06:00.646 --> 00:06:03.456
so thank you so much, it's a huge help.

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:05.534
And everyone, if you enjoyed
these last couple videos,

00:06:05.534 --> 00:06:09.382
give this video a thumbs
up to show your support.

00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:11.205
As always you guys, if you
liked what you saw today,

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:13.446
please subscribe to Nerdsync Productions,

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.849
right down there, and you
can also like us on Facebook,

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.100
follow us on Twitter, we're
on all social media stuff.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.748
Just search "Nerdsync" and you'll find us.

00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:22.594
But I do want to leave you with a quote

00:06:22.594 --> 00:06:26.820
from the end of the Lexicon
of Comicana by Mort Walker.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.794
And we'll see you right here next time

00:06:28.794 --> 00:06:30.930
for more things that you
thought you knew about comics.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.763
See ya.

00:06:32.985 --> 00:06:35.017
That of course, is Stan Lee,
but this cameo's kind of

00:06:35.017 --> 00:06:38.779
a-typical of his normal
cameos that he does.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:40.752
In fact, both the Fantastic Four movies,

00:06:40.752 --> 00:06:44.421
the cameos that he does are
kind of a little bit different.

00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:47.184
Usually he's just some
random guy in the background

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:48.438
as part of a throw away joke.

00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:50.319
In the first movie, he
actually played a character

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.490
from the comics, Willy Lumpkin,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.776
and in the second movie, as you saw,

00:06:55.776 --> 00:06:57.610
he is seen trying to get into the wedding

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.652
of Reed Richards and Sue Storm,
but being denied entrance.

00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:02.219
This actually comes
straight from Fantastic Four

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:04.158
annual number three from 1965

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:05.783
in which the same thing happens,

00:07:05.783 --> 00:07:07.850
but with Jack Kirby as well.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.568
They both get denied
entrance to the wedding,

00:07:09.568 --> 00:07:12.215
so they walk off and talk
about how they'll show them

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:14.340
when they start writing the next issue.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.940
One time in Fantastic
Four number 511 from 2004,

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.158
Mr. Fantastic kills The Thing.

00:07:19.158 --> 00:07:21.190
It's a long story, Thing was possessed.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.709
Wasn't that long, as it turns out.

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.588
So they end up having to
literally travel to heaven

00:07:26.588 --> 00:07:29.398
to get Ben's soul back, and
