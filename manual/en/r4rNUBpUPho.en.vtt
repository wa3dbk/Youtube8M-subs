00:00:02.276 --> 00:00:03.936
&gt;&gt; This is Mission
Control Houston.

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:07.536
The space station itself has
hundreds of experiments going

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:11.666
on on board at any one point in
time during these expeditions,

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.366
but did you know that
there's an experiment on board

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.606
that takes a look at a special
classification of water.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:17.956
Because water sometimes,

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:23.036
sometimes can be neither
a solid, liquid or a gas.

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:24.916
Here to explain this way better

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:26.796
than I can is Michael
Hicks who's

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:28.446
from NASA's Glenn
Research Center.

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:29.576
He is the principle investigator

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:31.226
for what's called the
super critical water

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:32.476
mixture experiment.

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:34.966
Mr. Hicks thank you very much
for joining us first of all.

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:38.246
Let's talk about what super
critical water actually is.

00:00:38.586 --> 00:00:40.086
&gt;&gt; Yeah, hi.

00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:44.776
Let me just first start
with maybe somewhat

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:46.976
of an unsatisfying answer,

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:52.696
but simple in that super
critical water is simply water

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:54.876
that's taken past
it's critical point

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:58.676
and for water the critical
point is 374 degrees Celsius

00:00:59.186 --> 00:01:06.536
or 705 degrees Fahrenheit, and
it's pressure is 218 atmosphere

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:11.386
which could be a little
over 3,000 psi absolute.

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:13.436
So that's super critical water

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:19.816
when it's taken past
its critical point.

00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:22.696
And probably to give you
a little more insight

00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:27.336
into the experiment itself might
be good if I created a visual,

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:33.556
if I could imagine taking a
pot of water and we put that --

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:38.426
we fill that pot of water with
maybe about a quarter full

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:44.196
and the -- and we put a
lid on it and we heated it

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:46.906
up the pressure would build up
and the pressure would not build

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.496
up as fast as the
temperature would.

00:01:48.496 --> 00:01:52.296
Eventually you would develop
a vapor, which would then turn

00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:55.676
to a gas once you past
the critical point,

00:01:55.676 --> 00:02:00.356
and then when you compress
that gas further it would go

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:02.006
into the super critical range.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:05.136
And we have the same thing on
the other side if we filled

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:10.016
up a pot with lets
say 50% water,

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:14.396
then you would increase the --

00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:17.186
if you heated it up it
would increase the pressure.

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:19.406
The pressure would build up.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:22.156
Eventually the pot
would fill with water

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:25.946
and because the pressure would
condense whatever vapor was

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.486
in there and you
would then cross

00:02:28.486 --> 00:02:30.136
over into the super
critical range.

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:33.576
But the problem we've had is
you really wouldn't be able

00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:35.646
to see exactly when you crossed

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:41.116
over to the super critical
regime because the pot

00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:46.326
and those instances with
the filled either completely

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:49.066
with vapor or completely
with liquid just

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:53.596
because of the nature
of where we started at.

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:56.626
But with our experiment
what we try to do is we try

00:02:56.626 --> 00:03:00.246
to maintain the vapor
in the presence

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:04.436
of liquid throughout the heat
up period so as we're heating

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:13.086
up the -- this pot of water
we actually have two phases,

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:15.296
a vapor phase and a
liquid phase all the way

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:17.686
up through the critical point
and in order to do that you have

00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:20.136
to fill this pot of water

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:25.356
with exactly the proper
amount of vapor and liquid.

00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:30.166
And so that's roughly about
1/3 liquid and 2/3 vapor,

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:33.816
and at that point you cross
right through the critical point

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:36.006
and you can actually visually
determine when you get

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:41.046
to the critical point by
looking at the disappearance

00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:44.556
of the separation between
the vapor and the liquid

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.176
which would be the meniscus.

00:03:46.746 --> 00:03:50.126
So that in essence is the
experiment that was performed

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:53.936
about five years ago by the
-- by our French colleagues

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:57.306
and what we are doing now

00:03:57.306 --> 00:04:01.136
with the super critical water
moisture experiment is we put a

00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:03.116
small pinch of salt
in this water.

00:04:03.406 --> 00:04:06.526
We're actually using
sodium sulfate and we put

00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:12.516
that in solution and
we then heat it up.

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:15.816
We then look at -- we then
cross the critical point

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:18.456
and we're looking at when
this critical point shifts.

00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:20.206
Because our critical point
will change a little bit

00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:23.226
because of the presence
of the salt in the water.

00:04:23.926 --> 00:04:27.086
So that in essence is -- in
a nutshell is the experiment

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:27.876
that we're performing.

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:32.746
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's talk about real
world applications for this.

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:35.426
The way I understand it is that
there's actually some cities

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:37.076
and small -- so some Navy ships

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:41.076
that are using this super
critical water to sort of,

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.296
you know, clean waste
and things like that.

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:45.576
Talk about, you know, real
world examples of how --

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:47.976
what [inaudible]
for people on earth.

00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:50.666
&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the
great advantages

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:55.026
of super critical water is
it becomes a terrific solvent

00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:58.676
for organic material,
organic waste.

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:03.496
This is because of the
change in material properties

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.626
or thermophsycial
properties when it goes

00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:07.116
into its super critical regime.

00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:14.056
And so there's a facility
that's in Orlando,

00:05:14.056 --> 00:05:16.446
Florida that was just put
online not too long ago.

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:19.186
The City of Orlando uses
super critical water oxidation

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:25.356
technology to basically
convert all their waste to --

00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:28.696
they essentially
burn their waste

00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:32.066
in a super critical
water reactor

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:36.676
and the byproducts are then
carbon dioxide and water.

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:41.156
So it's a relatively benign
product stream once they take

00:05:41.456 --> 00:05:48.886
this super critical water
waste stream and oxidize it.

00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:51.706
&gt;&gt; So what's next?

00:05:51.706 --> 00:05:54.056
I hear you guys have another
run of this experiment coming

00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:56.656
up I think in March maybe or
whenever it's going to be.

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:57.786
So what are the next steps?

00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:02.136
&gt;&gt; Well the next step would be
to basically repeat the test

00:06:02.136 --> 00:06:06.366
that we had already done in July
and that's coming up in March.

00:06:06.926 --> 00:06:12.606
And so March 3rd we're scheduled
for an 18-day test sequence

00:06:13.146 --> 00:06:15.376
and we'll have another
test sequence

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.146
after that probably in April.

00:06:17.566 --> 00:06:19.896
So starting in March
we'll become bust again

00:06:19.896 --> 00:06:20.946
with this experiment.

00:06:21.936 --> 00:06:22.326
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:23.976
Michael Hicks from NASA's
Glen Research Center.

00:06:23.976 --> 00:06:25.876
Thank you very much for joining
us on Space Station Live.

00:06:26.456 --> 00:06:26.926
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:28.086
Thank you for your interest.

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:28.736
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:06:28.736 --> 00:06:30.906
Again, that is the
super critical water

00:06:30.906 --> 00:06:31.916
mixturing experiment.

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:34.886
Of course you can read more
about that on NASA.gov/station.

00:06:34.886 --> 00:06:37.026
Just take a look at
research and technology there

00:06:37.026 --> 00:06:40.196
on the left-hand side and you
can look at pretty much anything

00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:41.756
that these expedition
crews are working on,

00:06:41.756 --> 00:06:45.076
on a day-to-day basis or
you can look at the science

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:46.166
in alphabetical order.
