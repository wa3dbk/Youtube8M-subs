00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.440
Before I even say a word about it, let’s
look at this on the most basic level.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.210
This is a video game based on a movie based
on a fictional video game.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.750
Now, I’m not a game designer, but it would
seem to me that a project like this is just

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.750
a no-brainer.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.960
I mean, there’s a really obvious game waiting
to be made here.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.660
And for the purpose of my own sanity, I’m
willing to ignore that it wasn’t made.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.070
It’s completely baffling, but whatever,
I can’t review a game that doesn’t exist.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.970
But after playing this one, I kind of wish
I could.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.140
This is Wreck-It Ralph for the Nintendo 3DS,
and you might say, “Oh, like the game in

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.140
that movie?”

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.940
And I’d say, “Well, kind of, but nowhere
near as theoretically cool.”

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.860
Rather than take the made-up video game from
the hit movie and turn into a real game with

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.360
a cool retro style...we get a real generic
platformer.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.380
Ugh.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.479
I want to wreck it!

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.910
Anyway, Wreck-It Ralph is a very simple platformer.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.190
You control both Wreck-It Ralph and Fix-It
Felix, two characters from the fictional game

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.640
Wreck-It Ralph, as they try to vanquish the
“bugs” that are destroying their arcade.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.720
This translates into gameplay that’s perfectly
fine for little kids, but way too boring for

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.390
anyone else.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.980
The details are so self-evident and cliched
that they probably don’t even warrant an

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.640
explanation, but nonetheless...Ralph is your
strong character, Felix is the nimble one.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.590
Ralph can break stuff, Felix can double jump
and wall climb.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.220
You can swap between them whenever you’d
like to get through the levels.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.390
Usually, there’s a sign that tells you when.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.140
There are basically two practical problems
with Wreck-It Ralph.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.030
I guess the simple gameplay would be fine
if the levels were fun to navigate, but they’re

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.030
not.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.340
They’re a collection of platforms and crates
with very little creativity—that’s the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.520
first problem.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.340
Secondly, there are only four worlds, each
with a handful of levels.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.510
So it’s both generic and short.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.930
Not a great combination.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:38.170
I get that a game like this is meant to be
more of an advertising ploy than a creative

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.710
video game, and that’s fine...but that doesn’t
make it any less disappointing.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.420
A game that actually did something with the
Wreck-It Ralph concept would’ve at least

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.819
been interesting and fun.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:03:01.840
Playable as it may be, this game is anything
but.
