00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.260
Hello all Blog del Runner followers.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.960
Today we are going to elaborate Pinole.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.260
Pinole is a ground corn flour,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.560
more specifically from purple or blue corn.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.340
Purple or blue corn has nutritional and antioxidant properties.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.980
superior to the rest of the corn varieties.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.520
This food is consumed by the Tarahumara Indians of the Copper Barracks,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.900
when they make their long ultra-marathon crossings,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.440
for its restorative and nutritional properties.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.560
The elaboration of Pinole is quite simple.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.080
To make Pinole, we start with purple corn cobs.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.820
Next we shell the cob of the purple corn with a rotation movement.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.300
We proceed to wash the grains of purple corn in water

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.200
para quitarle las impurezas que pueda tener.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.200
In my particular case I use acidic water for its disinfectant power.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.920
Once drained and dried the purple corn

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.560
sift it into this container to remove the chaff,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.300
which are these little fluffs left at the bottom of the tray.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.100
Once the purple corn grains have been cleaned, we have two alternatives:

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.020
or we can cook it and dry it and then toast it,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.400
or directly toast it.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.160
In this case, let's go straight to the toast.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.260
In this way we will alter the composition of the grains less.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.680
To toast the grain we can use a frying pan or an iron, as in this case.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.920
The grains must be distributed evenly over the surface.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.220
and keep the temperature at a medium level,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.040
making sure it's not too high so the grains don't burn.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.280
We'll know when they are if they start opening, jumping and creaking.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.180
Then we must lower the temperature again to prevent them from burning.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.800
We roasted for about 15 minutes at medium temperature.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.780
Once the right time has passed

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.400
and the corn is lightly toasted,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.880
we take it off the griddle.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.300
Once the corn is very cold and we check it by touching it,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.460
we can grind it in the grinder.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.360
Well, once the purple corn grain has been ground,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.900
we already have the right texture which is a fine powder

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.920
and then from this moment on you can either use it this way,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:33.700
or you can incorporate cinnamon to give it a different taste

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.360
and elsewhere, it also incorporates dry ground orange peel.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.620
We incorporated the cinnamon and mixed everything well.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.000
This food can be consumed either directly as a powder,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.740
in the form of corn pancakes,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.320
or incorporate it into an infusion, into a liquid such as warm water.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.540
When Pinole is taken in liquid form, dissolved in water, it is known by the name of Atole.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.840
We shake a little and then it takes on a characteristic reddish colour.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.880
Although this corn has quite sweet properties, because they have a high sugar content,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:37.080
if you want to sweeten it in the case of powder you can do it using Stevia powder,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.340
or, in the case of a solution such as an infusion or in water,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.040
you can use organic natural honey and sweeten it.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.820
I hope you liked the video.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.020
