00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.049
The Euler's Disc, you place it in the middle of a mirror and set it running, 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.820
it goes on for some time.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.760
This extraordinary toy I came across about 10 years ago in New York and I've never forgotten it

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.570
and I've often played with it.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.960
This much better version of it has a magnetic piece and you can vary the face of it

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.090
because this is not only a light show 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.340
and you get wonderful light effects from this diffraction,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.130
but also a sound show because it makes a most enjoyable sound.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.980
But the basic is a spinning coin which spins for a little time 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.220
and then falls down with a curious motion.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.100
This is just the same thing but much heavier. This is half an inch of steel 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.149
and three inches across, so its heavy,

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.059
its heavy to feel and it will spin for a very long time.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.059
This is a slightly concave mirror so it will keep it in the middle. 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:52.409
I'll set it spinning and see what happens...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
WOW!
