00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.468
Hey!

00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:53.546
Lieutenant dan,
what are you doing here?

00:00:53.614 --> 00:00:56.967
Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.

00:00:57.034 --> 00:00:59.986
Well,
you ain't got no legs,
lieutenant dan.

00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:01.488
Yes, I know that.

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:05.758
You wrote me a letter,
you idiot.

00:01:05.826 --> 00:01:08.428
Well, well.
Captain forrest gump.

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:11.114
I had to see this
for myself...

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.017
And...

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:18.388
I told you
if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain,

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:20.390
That I'd be
your first mate.

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:22.192
Well, here I am.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.043
I'm a man of my word.

00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:25.345
O.K.

00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:27.531
But don't you be thinking

00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:29.966
That I'm going
to be calling you "sir."

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:31.034
No, sir.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.111
It's my boat.
