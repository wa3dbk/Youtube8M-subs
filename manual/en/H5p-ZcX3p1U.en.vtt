00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:02.572
- Hey YouTube viewers this is Donnie Smith

00:00:02.572 --> 00:00:04.724
and welcome do this video
series that is designed

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:06.836
to help you pass the ASE exam.

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:09.531
Now this video series
is specifically for the

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:13.505
paint refinish and what
we're gonna do is we'll go

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:15.606
through the task and
give you the knowledge

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:16.530
to pass the test.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.333
What this is not, this is
not really your prep test

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:23.072
type book, you know, it's
not just test questions.

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:25.268
If you want that there is a link down

00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:27.472
in the description where
you can get more information

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:28.389
about that.

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:31.840
What this is this basically
goes through all the tasks

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.627
you will need to know to pass the test.

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.265
(tire screeching)

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.459
(explosion)

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:39.275
In this video we're gonna
cover feather edging.

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:41.475
Now feather edge is
the process of layering

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.162
each layer of coating.

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:46.519
All the way down to the
substrate up to the top surface.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.256
Maybe a paint or clear coat or
whatever the top surface is.

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.795
It's kinda like stairs compared to a ramp,

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:54.439
a ramp for wheelchair.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.641
If you look at the steps,
they're real steep,

00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.580
real noticeable, you
can visually see them.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.143
And you can think of that
like the layers of paint,

00:01:03.143 --> 00:01:05.135
the hard edges.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:08.387
And if you look at a ramp,
it's a smooth transition

00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:11.552
down from the bottom
level up to the top level.

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:13.950
It's real smooth, so that
a wheelchair can easily

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.806
roll up and down it.

00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:17.972
Now to be able to have
that ramp have that smooth

00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:21.068
transition, that's
gonna take a longer area

00:01:21.068 --> 00:01:22.438
than steps would.

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:24.402
So feather edging is the same process.

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.852
We need to take those
layers of paint, like steps,

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:29.920
and layer them out at
least a quarter of an inch

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.751
for each layer.

00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:34.638
So a small chip might start
out small but by the time

00:01:34.638 --> 00:01:37.092
you get this layered out properly,

00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:38.422
get it feather edged properly,

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:40.537
it's gonna be a bigger area.

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:42.961
So areas that you need
feather edging are places

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:44.279
where you did body work.

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:47.312
Where you sanded and block
sanded, have those scratches,

00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:50.209
those may need to be
feathered out so that you can

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.988
minimize those scratches
and that might require

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.596
some feather edging.

00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:56.996
If you have any rock
chips like we mentioned

00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:59.036
you need to be able to feather that out.

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.970
Make that transition from
the substrate to the top

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.130
of the clear coat without
it being noticeable.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.935
Other areas may include
key scratches or scratches

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:10.160
from the accident.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.190
That may go from the top
of clear coat surface

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.810
straight down to the metal

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.532
and that leaves a hard
edge that you can feel.

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:18.621
You need to feather that
out so that it's not

00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:19.912
as noticeable.

00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:21.810
The different layers that
you may have to feather out

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.765
may include your E-Coat,
your primer coats,

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:27.913
base coat and your clear coat.

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:30.161
And there's some other ones
like if it's a tri-coat

00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:32.669
and things like that
but however many layers

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.894
of coatings that has, those
need to be layered out

00:02:34.894 --> 00:02:38.029
and you need to have a
ring or an area at least

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.711
a quarter of an inch to help
provide that smooth transition.

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:43.953
Feather edging is done using a DA sander,

00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:45.614
a dual action sander,

00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:49.686
and 220 is generally the
most common sand paper grit

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:51.010
that is used.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.069
Now when DA sanding in the
last video we mentioned

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.214
using the interface pad for final sanding

00:02:56.214 --> 00:02:58.887
but remember that was because
it follows the contour

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.542
of the body lines and things

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:03.133
but we don't want that,
we don't want it to follow

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:05.191
the paint edge, the hard edge,

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:07.565
we want it to level across that.

00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:09.542
So if you use that pad on
there it's gonna follow

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:11.699
that contour, it's gonna
be very difficult to get

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.741
that feather edge smooth
and get those coatings out,

00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:17.359
the quarter of an inch like we want them.

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.326
So that's why you don't want
to use that interface pad,

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:21.727
use the DA pad that has a harder surface

00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:25.134
and it will cut across and
level those layers much better.

00:03:25.134 --> 00:03:27.645
Now, feather edging can
be done using a block,

00:03:27.645 --> 00:03:30.004
hand blocking it out with some 220,

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:32.034
however, that's going to
take a lot more effort

00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:33.940
and time to do that.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.633
So if you don't feather edge correctly

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:37.430
what this may cause is rings.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.410
It may not have been noticeable
until you got the car

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.929
painted and clear coated
and you pull it outside

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:45.001
and you see rings.

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.206
You look down the side
and you can see a ring

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.006
or it may even have multiple rings

00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:50.591
where you can actually
see the different levels

00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:51.988
of the different coatings.

00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:54.556
So the way to prevent
that is like we mentioned

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:56.891
sand each layer at least
a quarter of an inch

00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:58.996
and if you feather edge
I think it's a good idea

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:02.179
to go ahead and prime that
area and block sand it.

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.429
So proper feather edging,
priming, and blocking

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.836
the feather edge area, is
going to produce an area

00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:10.953
that you can't see, it's unnoticeable that

00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:12.772
the car has been painted and clear coated.

00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:16.687
Okay, now a couple of
ASE style test questions.

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:18.134
Now these are just examples

00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:21.306
but let's say technician
A says feather edging

00:04:21.306 --> 00:04:23.664
may be used to sand rock chips.

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:26.785
Technician B says that an
interface pad should always

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:29.202
be used while feather edging.

00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:32.831
So is it technician A, technician B,

00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:35.498
both A and B, or neither A or B?

00:04:37.602 --> 00:04:40.334
And the correct answer is technician A.

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:43.326
Remember rock chips,
feather edging is used

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:45.023
to sand rock chips.

00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:48.832
But technician B says an
interface pad should always

00:04:48.832 --> 00:04:51.216
be used while feather edging.

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:53.098
Remember we talked
about the interface pad,

00:04:53.098 --> 00:04:54.630
how it follows the contours,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.308
we don't want that, we
want to level the surface.

00:04:57.308 --> 00:05:01.215
So technician A would be the
only one correct on that.

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:03.780
Now one thing I would also
like to mention right here,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.422
this is not always true
but kind of a red flag

00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:10.555
to put up on this technician B,

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:12.976
he says technician B says interface pad

00:05:12.976 --> 00:05:14.809
should always be used.

00:05:16.518 --> 00:05:20.685
Now whenever they use always,
never, words like that,

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.897
you should always wear a
paint respirator when spraying

00:05:26.897 --> 00:05:29.358
and of course that's
true but it does need to

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:32.524
raise a flag to where
always, that's hard to say

00:05:32.524 --> 00:05:35.789
if you always have to do something.

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.201
So let that raise a
flag and question that.

00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:40.846
Okay, and one more.

00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:45.386
Technician A says 220 grit may
be used for feather edging.

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:48.494
Technician B says each
coating should be feathered

00:05:48.494 --> 00:05:50.904
at least a quarter of an inch.

00:05:50.904 --> 00:05:51.737
Who's correct?

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:53.436
Well both are correct.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.196
Remember said feather edging
220 is the most common grit.

00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:59.088
It may not be the only
grit there may be others

00:05:59.088 --> 00:06:00.493
out there that use something different

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.140
but it is one of the most common.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.516
And look for that word there
where it says technician A

00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:06.683
says 220 grit may be used.

00:06:08.092 --> 00:06:10.833
That's one of those
things that raises a flag.

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:13.474
Technician B says each
coating should be feathered

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.310
at least a quarter of an inch.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.877
And you know that's what's recommended

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:18.725
that the layers be feathered
a quarter of an inch.

00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:23.621
So that's gonna be both
technician A and technician B.

00:06:23.621 --> 00:06:25.573
It is my goal to keep these videos short

00:06:25.573 --> 00:06:27.535
so that's all we're going
to cover in this video.

00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:29.131
Just give you little chunks at a time,

00:06:29.131 --> 00:06:32.880
let you absorb that and then
you can watch the next video.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.105
Down below is a link to the
test prep books that I have.

00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:38.429
But also there is a link
that'll take you to all

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:40.286
these videos if your wanting to go through

00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:41.993
more than one video at a time

00:06:41.993 --> 00:06:44.768
and take you through the entire playlist.

00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:47.724
So be sure to check that out to go through

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:49.884
the ones I've already uploaded

00:06:49.884 --> 00:06:52.112
and as they become available they'll also

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:53.937
be put on this site as well.

00:06:53.937 --> 00:06:55.356
Thanks for watching this video.

00:06:55.356 --> 00:06:58.791
I hope this helps and good
luck with your ASE exam.
