00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.520
On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Laura Banford
and I am going to teach you how to make a

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.780
super sandwich. Now that I've showed you all
of the ingredients needed to make your super

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.949
roast beef sandwich, I just wanted to go over
some simple equipment that you will need in

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:23.840
order to do a good job in making your sandwich.
These are the utensils; first a chef's knife,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.550
a trusty chef's knife. This is a really good
one; I've had it for years. You would buy

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.110
this at a specialty store or on-line. This
is a serrated knife also known as a bread

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.309
knife. You need this to cut through things
that are soft like a loaf of bread or tomato.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:51.079
You can get these pretty much any where. This
is a spreader used to spread or put our spread

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.550
on the bread. This is a little spatula that
we are going to use to fold in our spreads,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.190
fold it together and get it all together.
This is a paring knife which we are going

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.110
to use to trim our onion and to slice our
mushrooms. This is a really good knife too

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.460
and I've had it for quite a long time. But
you can get a probably a ten dollar one or

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.900
twelve dollar one any where; this is much
better than that. This is just a spoon that

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.070
we are going to use to mix our things together.
Obviously you need a good cutting board. I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.340
use a wooden one. You can use plastic too.
They are a little easier to clean up but they

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.760
don't look as pretty. Now I am going to talk
about the two skillets that we are going to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:43.640
use. Basically in general, skillets come in
two forms; non-stick and everything else.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.940
This is a non-stick skillet. I am going to
use this to saute our bacon. It is all purpose.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.540
You would use it for eggs, omelets that kind
of things when you don't want anything to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.050
stick and you don't want to accumulate any
of the fun stick, all the good taste ingredients

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.740
on the bottom of a pan. If you want that,
you need more of an alclad. This looks like

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.380
it has been through a lot of wear and tear
and it has but it is a great great pan. It

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.350
is an alclad aluminum pan and it will allow
a lot of ingredients, a lot of bits to accumulate

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.880
on the bottom, it is also going to allow our
onions to caramelize. That is what you would

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.411
use this for. I would suggest getting a good
one. This is a heavy one. Like I said, I've

00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:32.440
had it for years. It's not going to warp or
bend. It is not going to affect the taste

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.730
of your food. It is a good investment. I would
say that this one would probably cost a hundred

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.410
dollars or more and I've had it forever. This
is just a simple baking sheet. In order for

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.660
easy clean-up, I usually cover my baking sheets
with a little bit of foil. This is where the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.800
super sandwich is going to go right before
it goes into the oven after I assemble it.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.440
So again, these are the simple pieces of equipment
you will need to make your super roast beef

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.040
sandwich. Next we are going to talk about
baking.
