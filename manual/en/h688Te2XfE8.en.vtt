00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.910
The Biologics Production Facility, at the
University of Nebraska Medical Center, provides

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.810
new state of the art ultra clean room laboratories
designed to meet good manufacturing practices

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.590
or GMP regulations.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.140
Operated jointly by UNMC and its hospital
partner, The Nebraska Medical Center, the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.160
facility produces blood and cell products
used in patient care.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.100
When it comes to research, the possibilities
are almost limitless.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.809
This really is a unique place.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.610
The nearest one like this is probably in Minneapolis
at the University of Minnesota.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.799
So many big cities and many large Universities
would have something similar.

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.540
The one thing that distinguishes us is our
ability to cooperate amongst the different

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.730
disciplines.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.150
We have one quality system and we have one
quality unit that controls the facility.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.250
We can work with various researchers, if they
are working with solid organs, livers and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.549
pancreas or if they are working with liquid
products such as bone marrow or peripheral

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.650
blood stem cells.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.760
All of these products need to be handled slightly
differently and we can manage them through

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.310
many different clean rooms and a cooperative
system without duplicating the quality unit

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.310
in particular.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.170
That quality unit applies to all projects
within the facility.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.390
It includes controlled access, personnel,
training, documentation, production and process

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.390
controls.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.320
All the equipment housed in the facility is
covered by a building-wide 24/7 equipment

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.840
monitoring system.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.880
The facility houses clean rooms capable of
class 100 thousand to class one hundred air

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880
quality.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.260
The GMP guidelines state that we have to have
materials in place from the lights, paint,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.560
flooring and that they are all cleanable and
prohibit contaminations.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.360
A class 10 thousand facility that we are in
right now, the floor is not linoleum or vinyl

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.360
based flooring.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.159
This is actually a resin-based, sealed directly
over concrete.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:31.349
There is no vinyl flooring as opposed to a
class 100 thousand that we have downstairs,

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.659
we have vinyl in that area.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.810
It transitions from the floor to the wall
in a continuous resin-based paint surface.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.440
You’ll notice that we have hard deck flat
ceilings in here instead of a drop tile or

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.469
gasketed ceiling like downstairs.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:55.599
Of course we have stainless steel diffusers
for all of our terminal HEPA filters.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:05.799
These types of HEPA filters are rated at 99.99
percent efficiency for particles of .03 microns

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.879
and greater.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.849
All the lights are all sealed and gasketed
so they are all cleanable surfaces.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.559
There is nothing that can get in from exterior
spaces, from the wall space to the ceiling

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.260
space, it is completely sealed.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.180
The only thing that is supplied to this room
is the air from the HEPA filtered air handlers

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.809
and then of course the exhaust.

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:33.120
We have a lot more capacity here than we are
currently using.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.540
We have six clean rooms and we have a separate
suite, this one single clean room is almost

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.989
a mini GMP facility all by itself that’s
completely isolated with its own equipment,

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.769
space, and its own air handler.

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.129
All the things you need in a laboratory are
completely separate.

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.409
We have a lot of abilities that we haven’t
even touched on using and we have a lot more

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.560
space than we are currently occupying.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.030
We are open to contracts and to assisting
researchers and their product development.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.590
Most of the time the research is done in a
basic lab so these people have figured out

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.180
how to do it in a test tube or a Petri dish
and it works.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.699
It doesn’t necessarily mean when you make
it one hundred times larger, put it in a bag

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:36.030
or use materials approved for human use that
you can really translate exactly the same

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.050
ratios, temperatures or conditions.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.930
So, there is that scale up phase that this
facility will have the expertise by having

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.400
a staff that works on many different kinds
of projects.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.389
We will be able to have that expertise to
be able to scale up a project and make it

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.520
ready for human use.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.740
That’s really what our goal is.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.080
The building, a stand-alone structure on the
medical center campus, was fitted top to bottom

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.360
with state of the art equipment, facilities
and staff.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.539
Everything here was designed to make the job
of research as efficient as possible.

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.949
It is equipped with two walk-in cold rooms.

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:19.710
One is designed for reagent storage and another
could potentially be used for organ processing,

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.050
requiring refrigerated temperatures.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.229
We have multi-stage clean up area that you
can transition as you finish processing.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:39.560
You would enter the first stage here and we
have a major clean up sink so you can do debalking

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.439
and gross decontamination washing of reusable
instrumentation.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:54.490
We also have plumbing and rough in for future
expansion if we need to do terminal sterilization.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.860
One of the facility’s most important features
is its eye to the future and adaptability

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.280
to research that has yet to be imagined.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:11.949
There are some other projects that are being
worked on that involve particles, novel drugs

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:21.280
and protein materials that we haven’t even
thought about how we could work with them.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.159
They are the kind of things that need some
manufacturing, clean air and quite a bit of

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:29.479
control to make sure they are done correctly.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.530
We have the ability to do most anything from
a manufacturing point of view.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:42.550
We can make nanoparticles , vaccines, anything
that requires a quality system and a clean

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.550
room.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:52.139
We have a large staff that is experienced
and anxious to do new things.

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:59.500
Whatever the product is you have in mind,
we call it a cellular therapy facility, but

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.639
the product doesn’t have to have cells in
it.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:09.110
It could be a drug, protein, or another molecule
or formulation that would be of therapeutic

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.110
value.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.569
It is our goal to make things that are useful
to patients directly.
