00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.120
My name is Adrian Brambila.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.660
On stage I go by El Tiro.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.490
I've never had any
lessons on dancing.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.110
I'm a self-taught dancer.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.650
And the style of dance
I do is called popping.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.130
My dream with dance is to help
inspire people of all ages

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.100
to truly go out
there and do what

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.650
they want to do
with their lives.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.470
I feel like there's so many
people in today's world

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.380
that are caught up
in-- whether it's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.030
money or materialism,
trying to look good,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.460
or just stuck at their
nine to five job.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.090
Or doing a couple
different shifts

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.340
where they are missing the most
essential part of life, which

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.460
is just living, and doing the
things that make you happy.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.320
And so dance for me, that's it.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.360
Dance is everything.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.860
Dance is my outlet to
channel all my energy.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.360
Whether I'm having a great
day and I want to celebrate,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.056
or if I'm having a
really bad day and I

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:01.215
need to let some steam off.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:04.370
Dance is kind of my outlet
that I channel all my energy

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.710
through.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.900
As a dancer, you know we live
life differently, I feel.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.200
It's almost as living
through an artist.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.577
Things have really special
meanings to a dancer

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.160
that it may not have
for other people.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.190
Like my shoes,
the jacket I wear.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.280
Depending on what
stage I'm at, I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.970
remember every single article of
clothing that I performed with.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.910
It kind of holds
a memory with me.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.900
I remember the
very first audition

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.770
I had to go on a world tour.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.440
And I made the audition.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.830
And that jacket has
traveled with me everywhere.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.920
And same with those shoes.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.874
Even though they're busted up
and broken, I still have then.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.290
And I'm always
going to keep them,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.740
because those are the shoes
I danced in, and I made it.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.835
What's super cool
about the dance style

00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:59.850
I do is that inspiration
comes from everything you do.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.800
Even the same day-to-day
tasks that you do.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.900
Like for example,
opening up a fridge.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.550
The way you grab your
arm and pull out.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.520
I mean I can easily
take that, and I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.710
can turn that into a
popping robot move.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.940
Or the way when you put your
change in a soda machine,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.250
and the way the claw
kind of unlocks itself,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.070
and the soda falls.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.510
All those different things.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.150
As a dancer, you're
always looking

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.760
for that type of inspiration
to add to your dance.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.790
And the style I do, popping,
is just beautiful for that.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.180
So that's why a day of living as
a dancer is always interesting.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.890
Because there may be just
regular tasks I do all the time

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.170
and then all of a sudden
a light bulb hits.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.280
And it's like whoa, what
if I made that into a move,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.370
and then I put it into my style.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.900
And then after practice, then
you have a signature style

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.440
and move that you created
from a regular task,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.470
like getting a cup of
coffee or something.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.270
One of the coolest
things about dance,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.220
giving the gift of dance,
is that it doesn't run out.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.410
You can give a
kid clothes, food,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.640
and they'll be used
in their full extent.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.020
But they're going to run out.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.860
But dance-- dance is forever.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.240
You teach the gift of dance,
and that person, that kid,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.390
now has an outlet to
channel their hardships in,

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.060
their positives in.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.840
Collaborate and exercises
both the mind and body,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.180
and is the most
amazing thing that I

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.990
get to see when I'm
teaching someone

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.640
who's never danced before.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.750
And they just light up.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.180
They're smiling and laughing.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.190
And it's those
kids in that moment

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.480
that I wish I could
multiply by 1,000.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.770
And the more kids that I get
to help inspire and teach,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.780
the more happy I
can be with my life.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.390
Music isn't something that
we just hear or listen to.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.390
It's something that we feel.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.269
So when I am dancing to a
song, and there's a song

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.310
and there's a part of it
that I just really love,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.280
sometimes words can't express
how that makes me feel.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.710
But through my dance,
I can show you.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.250
I can show you how I feel.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.890
I always feel really stoked
after I'm done dancing,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.230
because I feel like I am using
all the tools that I have.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.030
My body, my arms,
my legs, my mind.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.800
Dance is something
that exercises

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.210
your body and your heart and
your creativity and your brain.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.720
So it's kind of
like an all-in-one.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.990
A Zen kind of
activity, if you will.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.270
We only have one
life to really do

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.460
all the things
that make us happy.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.800
Our purpose, finding
out what that is.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.534
And there's so many
negative and peer pressures

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.700
around the world that are
constantly telling us this

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.030
is what you should do, this
is how you should live.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.870
And sometimes we forget
to just look at ourselves

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.530
and remember who we are.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.280
Because there is no one
else that's like me.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.306
There's no one else
that's like you.

00:05:16.306 --> 00:05:21.330
Especially as a dancer, it's all
about being unique, individual.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.210
In the hip hop
era of dance, it's

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.340
like you've got to
be true to yourself.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.880
You have to have
an original style.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.730
You have to have an
original life too.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.920
You've just got to find the
things that make you happy.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.572
Do them exponentially,
as many times as you can.

00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:37.280
And express yourself
through the process.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.820
And that's living, that's life.
