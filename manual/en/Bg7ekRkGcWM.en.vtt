00:00:00.286 --> 00:00:01.704
-Hey, hey, fruit-ballers!

00:00:01.704 --> 00:00:03.870
I'm gonna do my
very first gameplay video ever!

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.989
You know what game
I'm gonna play?

00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:07.076
My new video game, Splatter Up!

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:09.362
It's available on
Google Play and iTunes now

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:11.669
so download it.
Ooh, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:12.917
[laughs]
I'm playing on an iPhone,

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:15.118
even though I hate Apples.
[laughs]

00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:17.032
All right, the game's super-easy.

00:00:17.032 --> 00:00:18.536
You just press the
"hold here" button,

00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:21.460
and when fruit get thrown
your way, YOU HIT 'EM!

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.027
[laughs]
Pineapple can fly, heh-heh.

00:00:25.027 --> 00:00:28.812
Whoa! Shocking!
[chuckles] Oh.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.268
-(Orange in game)
Oh! Medic!

00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:32.650
-[laughs]:
Yeah, medic.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.820
Oh! That wasn't "berry" nice.
[laughs]

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.731
Oh, I hope he didn't
land on his keys.

00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:42.898
[laughs]
-(Strawberry) Blackberry?

00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:45.959
-(Orange in game)
Bit-boom-bam! It's a grand slam!

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:50.288
-Hey, that rhymed!
Pan, slam, jam, man.

00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:53.168
Oh-ho! This guy's
a regular Barry Bonds.

00:00:53.168 --> 00:00:55.208
Get it? Barry?
[laughs] Uh-oh.

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.707
Knife!
[laughs]

00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:59.701
-(Orange in game)
Whoa! Split-hitter!

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.538
-[laughs]
Aw, let's try some ZOOM.

00:01:02.538 --> 00:01:04.929
Now, ZOOM is a power-up
that gives you more power.

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:07.284
Let's do it. Here we go.

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:10.143
Oh no, Apple. Yeah!

00:01:10.143 --> 00:01:11.534
That's what the apple gets.

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:15.563
What does the apple say?
He says, "Aah!

00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:17.207
I'm flying,
and now I'm gonna land."

00:01:17.207 --> 00:01:22.457
Oh! It's shocking!
[laughs]

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.991
Whoa, he 'sploded!
-(Orange in game) Wow!

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.456
-Yeah right, wow.
That was crazy.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:29.667
Okay. Oh, Barry.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:32.621
Huh. That was crazy.
That was crazy.

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:34.788
I'm still getting over that
blow-- that was crazy.

00:01:34.788 --> 00:01:37.698
Whoa, Knife! It was
really "knife" to meet ya.

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:39.420
-(Orange in game)
Whoa, "slice" to meet you.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.871
-[laughs] Slice to meet you,
knife to meet ya.

00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:43.447
[laughs]
Oh.

00:01:43.447 --> 00:01:47.891
Uh-oh. I hope you like your
pineapple blended. [laughs]

00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:51.114
-(Orange in game) Ugh,
this game is all over the place.

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:53.534
-[laughs] I like this
Orange guy; he's pretty funny.

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:56.891
Oh no, not another apple.
[laughs] Gross.

00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:59.454
Oh... hit him as far as you can.

00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:02.278
Oh! Flame on!
[laughs]

00:02:02.278 --> 00:02:04.407
Oh, and a knife too
for good measure.

00:02:04.407 --> 00:02:06.823
-(Orange in game) With a slice
like that, you must be a golfer.

00:02:06.823 --> 00:02:09.372
-[laughs]
This Orange guy's funny.

00:02:09.372 --> 00:02:11.043
All right, let's try some ZIP.

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:13.039
Now, ZIP is
another power-up, okay?

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.963
Here we go.
-(Orange in game) Ready?

00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:16.787
-Here we go.
Oh no, another apple!

00:02:16.787 --> 00:02:18.212
Oh, whooo!

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:20.094
Uh-oh, oh!

00:02:20.094 --> 00:02:23.289
Well, I'm not a "fan" of apples.
[laughs]

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.712
Oh, "ice" to meet you.
Oh, "knife" to meet ya.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.294
[laughs]

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:29.707
-(Orange in game)
Now that's a doubleheader.

00:02:29.707 --> 00:02:32.211
-Exactly.
Just sliced his butt off.

00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.293
Uh-oh. Barry!

00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:37.745
Barry's in the house.
Now Barry's in the air.

00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:40.724
[laughs]
And he's not coming down.

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:42.226
Apparently, but that's okay.

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:45.656
Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Bruised your butt. [giggles]

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:46.873
-(berry)
"Berry" nice.

00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:48.210
-"Berry" nice.
[laughs]

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.792
All right, let's do it.

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:52.904
Oh, Cantaloupe, why?

00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:55.538
You ruined the game.
All right, guys.

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:57.294
-(Cantaloupe)
Big melon-baller.

00:02:57.294 --> 00:02:58.674
-Oh, big melon-baller,
that's right.

00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:00.911
-(Orange in game) Looks like
you're the "bunt" of the joke.

00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.371
-[laughs]
Bunt of the joke.

00:03:02.371 --> 00:03:04.922
All right, guys.
5858 is my high score.

00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:07.007
Download the game today and
see if you can beat it, okay?

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.043
And also, let me know what
game you want me to play next.

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:11.038

00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:12.642
[laughs]
