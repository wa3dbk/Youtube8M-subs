00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.100
Over 10 million people have already either jailbroken
their iPod Touch, their iPhone or iPad

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.549
and the reason more haven't is because they either
don't know about it or they have misconceptions

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.000
about what it is. If only somebody would dispel
these misconceptions.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.500
So is jailbreaking illegal? Absolutely not.
I know you hear the word 'Jail' and 'Break',

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.200
and you automatically think illegal. But congress
actually met and decided that it's perfectly legal.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.600
Think of a car. You buy a car from
a dealership and you get home just to find

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.039
that the dealership locked the hood of your
car and says that you can't improve your

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.320
car that you bought the way that you want.
If you want to improve it, you have to improve

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.390
it their way. That's basically what Apple
does. They give you your device and say, 'you

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.940
can improve your device using our app store
and that's it. You can't improve it the way

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.740
you want it.' Jailbreaking just allows you
to improve it how you want to. So is jailbreaking

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.300
illegal? Absolutely not. All it allows you
to do is improve your device how you want it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.100
Will jailbreaking change the way my device works?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.530
No. You will still be able to use Apple's
App Store. You'll have your contacts, music,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.310
apps, everything else will be exactly the
same. Let's imagine you have an iPhone straight

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.250
from the Apple Store. If you were to jailbreak
that iPhone, the only difference you would

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.840
see is a new app store called Cydia. This
new app store allows you to install applications

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.000
that add functionality and improve your device
the way that Apple's App Store can't.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.980
Is jailbreaking free? Yes. Jailbreaking your
iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad is free and always

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.690
will be free. To better understand Cydia,
the app store that's installed when you jailbreak,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.210
let's think about the normal app store. You
have both paid apps and you have free apps.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.220
Cydia works the same way. You have paid and
free apps. The great thing about Cydia is

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.829
they give you a free trial for most of the
paid apps. This allows you to try out the

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.000
apps before you buy them.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.800
Is jailbreaking permanent? Not at all.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.650
If you don't like it or don't want it anymore,
you can simply restore it by clicking the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.849
restore button in iTunes. This will remove
the jailbreak and return your device to factory

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.269
settings. If you need help restoring your
device, go ahead and check out our video on

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.200
our FAQ section of our website.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.659
Does jailbreaking void your warranty? Okay,

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.680
so if you're going to bring a jailbroken device
into the Apple Store, Apple could void your

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.269
warranty. But thankfully, there's a very easy
way to avoid this. Simply restore your device

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.859
in iTunes and choose 'Set up as a new device'.
If you do this before going into the Apple Store,

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:58.489
there would be no way for them to ever know
you jailbroke your device.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.689
So it may seem like we're trying to hide something;
but the fact is Apple just wants to limit

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.489
the functionality of your device. And since
they can't say it's illegal, they're simply

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.340
threatened to void your warranty. To be honest,
they rarely void your warranty. They usually

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.450
just restore it for you in the Apple store
anyways. So more of the story - you need to

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.900
take your device into the Apple Store to get
it repaired, simply restore it beforehand.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.159
Now that you know the truth, it's up to you
to decide if you want to jailbreak. If you're
