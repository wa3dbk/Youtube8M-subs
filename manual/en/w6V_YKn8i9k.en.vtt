00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.579
Is there an END to history?
Whereas most generally think of

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:24.399
history as a record of past events, Philosopher
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel considered it

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:31.259
to be a rational process moving towards completion.
Make no mistake- by “end of history,”

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.000
Hegel wasn’t prophesizing the end of the
world. But to discover what he did mean,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.240
we must first ask ourselves 
“what is history?”

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.179
According to Hegel, “History,” is the
progression of reason brought

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.760
about largely by confrontation and conflict.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.940
For example, if a group of rebels seige a castle,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.000
we have two opposing forces- the establishment
and the challenger. Through this conflict,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.200
the opposing ideologies will collide and 
produce a new establishment.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.500
Like the one before it, this idea will eventually invite upheaval and the “dialectical process” yielding

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.060
heightened rationality, will continue.
But such changes don’t occur randomly.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.760
To Hegel, history is pushed forward
by freedom- mankind’s essential nature.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.460
As history progresses, we become
more self-conscious, therefore more rational,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.940
and therefore, more free. For example, as
a warrior gains more experience points,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.930
he is granted more skills.
The more skills he gains, the more

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.330
choices he has has in combat, and thus, he
is free-er. As the ages pass, we have become more free.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.240
During the age of the Orient,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.420
only the ruler was free. In Ancient Greece, 
some were free. And in Hegel’s time

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.300
following the French Revolution, it was thought 
that all should be free. So if freedom is the end

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.760
goal of history, will there ever be a perfected
state that invites no more change- An END

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.200
to the dialectic? In his book
The Phenomenology of Spirit,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.040
Hegel devised the concept of “World
Spirit,” or the manifestation of reason

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.249
exhibited through a society’s culture- 
including its philosophy, religion, and art.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.920
The ULTIMATE freedom 
will occur when the World Spirit,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.420
or collective consciousness of a culture, 
becomes entirely rational.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.560
Only then can a unified society be

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.450
established in which its laws and institutions
will invite no more change- because they are

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.670
in perfect harmony with their culture. And
thus, the dialectical process of history will end.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.779
Hegel’s philosophy of history

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:11.620
inspired some of the most important thinkers
of the nineteenth century- including one young

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.060
poet who would one day become one of the 
world’s most influential figures.
