00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Some of our fans could have already noticed those strange measuring devices

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.500
surrounding the field when playing Friendly or League Cup games.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.000
These devices are part of the I-QRS system, which is helping the professional staff

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.000
to gain such information that is not precisely perceptible to the eye.

00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:28.301
Before talking about what the I-QRS system exactly is,

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:32.102
we went through the strength and conditioning exercises.

00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:38.203
First of all, there are very good circumstances enabling us to have an ideal preparation for the season.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:48.104
We are continuously doing ball exercises; most of the conditioning exercises are done with balls.

00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:56.105
Implicitly, there are conditioning exercises in workout facilities, so we are continuing what we have already started in Hungary,

00:00:56.006 --> 00:01:03.106
but here we have more of the more specialized exercises, and the most of them are done with balls.

00:01:04.207 --> 00:01:09.007
We have a special sport telemetric system developed by I-QRS LTD that helps us to measure the players all the time

00:01:09.108 --> 00:01:14.908
Today's game is going to be measured as well,

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.409
so we are going to get an impression about where we stand in the process of the preparation of the players.  Measuring them in real games is the best way to check this.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.410
After the game, we are going to analyze it, and we will make the necessary changes in the cases of individual players, if needed.

00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:33.311
In theory we already know, what the I-QRS system is, but how is it working in practice?

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:39.312
Before the game against Dinamo Kijev we followed Peter Bali while setting up the system.

00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:49.113
These are the so called reference points; they are going to calibrate the football field

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:58.414
so that the distance measurements and animation can be really precise.

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:03.015
Interesting fact to mention is that the devices are powered environmentally friendly by solar cells.

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:09.416
Although they seem to cry out for a hard hit by the ball, they are also breakage resisting, so nothing could seriously go wrong.

00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:15.017
In addition, the system is a Hungarian developed one, so malfunctioning parts can be changed easily.

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:21.918
There are 8 reference points altogether we set up at certain points of the field.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.419
They are going to calibrate the sizes of the field and the distances.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.220
The data transferred through these reference points cover almost everything regarding the players.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:42.121
Besides cardiovascular data the system measures the motor functions, roughly meaning information about how much, in which direction and in what pace each player runs.

00:02:42.222 --> 00:02:53.222
I am going to distribute a device that is recording and transmitting the data and is worn on the chest of the players. This is similar to how the Polar system works.

00:02:53.323 --> 00:03:03.223
The system is counting the number of sprints, scale of the jumps, and the average and maximum speed as well. All in all, everything is recorded that can happen to a player on the field.

00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:12.024
I have to be honest: just as Peter Bali, the strength and conditioning trainer is hard upon his players, I try to push the envelope with him as well.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:18.725
I cannot miss the chance to mention in the interview that most likely the players do not like his exhausting exercises.

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:22.926
I had a similar one with regard this system: how much do the players like this kind of control?

00:03:23.027 --> 00:03:31.027
It's hard to shuffle about why things happened this or that way, or why haven't I run so much or so fast.

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:41.028
The professional added that those who try to avoid control surely do not like this system, because it provides objective, unquestionable facts.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.629
After the tactical meeting every player puts on a chest belt.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.030
Peter Bali puts the devices in order, and the players can chose their own by the number on their shirt.

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:58.131
The reference points receive the data from these devices, and they transmit them to the laptop.

00:04:18.032 --> 00:04:26.932
This is the sensor of the whole system detecting the 8 reference points. This connects to the computer through this cable

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:32.033
gathering all the data coming from the players.

00:04:32.134 --> 00:04:45.034
If the players have some kind of heart problems, like dysrhythmia or something else, and if you know the attributes of the ECG waves,

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:49.635
you are able to notice when there is a problem.

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:53.236
During the game, Peter Bali is continuously in contact with Ricardo Moniz,

00:04:53.337 --> 00:04:58.437
thus he can inform him, if a player is "walking on his knees",

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:03.338
meaning that he arrived to a level of exhaustion that is influencing his performance negatively.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:08.739
Based on the previous measurements each player has his individual intensity zones.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.940
The reason for this is coming from the obvious fact that every person reacts differently to strain.

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:22.041
It can be easily deduced from the rainbow scale appearing on the screen, that the red is the highest, and the green is the lowest intensity grade.

00:05:22.142 --> 00:05:30.042
The line running in this scale provides just enough information for Peter Bali for signaling towards the head coach if somebody is totally exhausted.

00:05:30.143 --> 00:05:37.043
The system also measures the pulse, so the potential anxiousness could be seen on the screen- the thought conceived in me.

00:05:37.144 --> 00:05:43.944
When I asked this from our strength and conditioning coach, it became clear that one needs a different approach when talking about a sportsman or a fan,

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:48.145
who is becoming more similar to a pumped up ball.

00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:53.946
If we would go into details, we could surely see it, but not on this graph, but on the individual ones,

00:05:53.947 --> 00:06:06.647
but I think that they are professional enough that we could not see such huge difference - If I would be there, than it would more significant

00:06:06.648 --> 00:06:09.048
If there is, there will be, or there would be.

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.149
All this was only the preparation; the real work comes only later.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:22.950
Peter Bali's task from the end of the game is to gather the incoming data from the 90 minutes, evaluate them based on the different reports and provide them to Ricardo Moniz.

00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:31.051
My job is to make the information accessible to the head coach.

00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:39.952
Just because we have these reference points and computer system, we are not going to be automatically members of the Champions League.

00:06:39.853 --> 00:06:43.053
They don't even give us the gold medal in the Hungarian Football League.

00:06:42.954 --> 00:06:49.354
But this system gives a tool to the professional staff, that helps us get one step closer to the level,

00:06:49.255 --> 00:06:55.055
where our current opponents, Dinamo Kijev, Basel, or Steaua Bukarest stand.
