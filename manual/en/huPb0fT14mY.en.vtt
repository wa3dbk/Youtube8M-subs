00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.500
&gt;&gt; Kiruna: Here I am at the Liberty Festival. 
I decided to start my blog entry for today,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.200
actually, in front of that great symbol of disability, the disabled toilet.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.100
Now, the thing I love about the Liberty Festival,is that it is an absolute celebration of disability.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.500
And who deserves a better quality of throne, than the disabled person?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.100
So, step inside and let's just check how hot this baby is.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.100
Come in.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.100
There are flowers.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.100
This isn't any portaloo, 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.100
this is the water closet for the brilliant 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.100
crippled individuals that are celebrating at the Liberty Festival.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.100
Let's bring on the festival.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.100
The Liberty art festival, which is held at Trafalgar Square every year, 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.100
seems to confuse some of the local tourists, 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.100
who are wondering why the statues and National Gallery have got

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.100
a lot of disabled individuals standing in front of it and creating different works of art.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.100
But the festival's got absolutely everything going on... 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.100
from music...
[music]

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.100
and they have dancing...

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.100
[music and screaming]

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:27.100
I think we are seeing the history of dance through time.
[Can-Can Music]

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.100
The famous Can-Can originated in France. 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.100
And exquisitely executed by these women here today at the Liberty Festival.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.100
One of the by-standers has taken a tumble. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.100
It was the excitement.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100
Right, here I am with Liz Carr, the famous Comedienne.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.100
So Liz, what does Liberty Festival mean to you?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.100
&gt;&gt; Liz: It means it's another year, when the Mayor actually supports disabled people. 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.100
Which is a miracle because they are taking all our money away.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.100
So we kind of like, I think it is a celebr... 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.100
I think we do have to come and show there is a need for this. 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.100
It's our Gay Pride. 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.100
Liberty is the best we are going to get for a while.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.800
So, I think disabled people should get down here, 
32
00:02:14,900 --&gt; 00:01:17,100
do whatever, enjoy whatever, be critical of it, 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.100
be creative but just come down here to show

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.900
actually, we are a huge minority and it's our day.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.100
You know there are problems with it, it aint perfect, but while we've got it. I think we should celebrate it.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.500
&gt;&gt; Kiruna: Here I am with Sophie, who was just performing as part of the Rhinestone Rollers. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.600
One thing that I have noticed is that there's a bit of incongruency between 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.100
the - how should I put this - the tourists, 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.500
who've stumbled across Liberty and those that have come for Liberty.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.700
How do you find that, kind of?

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.100
&gt;&gt; Sophie: I find it all blurs quite nicely, actually.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.200
I think it's quite good that people stumble across it and don't know what on earth is going on,  

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.100
because they get into it but they've not expectations.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.100
&gt;&gt; Kiruna: The festival even covers independent living alternatives.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.100
[To woman] Hi, I'm Kiruna I am just making a little blog for myself on the internet. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.800
Do you want to tell me just a few lines about what you guys do?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.100
&gt;&gt; Woman: Ok, 'Independent Living Alternatives' has been running for 20 years and we 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.100
were set up to provide a comprehensive range of personal assistant services from a user controlled perspective. Boom-Boom.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.100
&gt;&gt; Kiruna: Great! So that's really about the user, 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.100
so the person receiving the services being in control of how they receive the service.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.100
And how have you found the general tourists, the ones who have no idea what's going on.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.100
&gt;&gt; Woman: Um, because we are the first thing as people come in, a lot of people come in and go 'what is this? Why am I here?'
We get a lot of tourists. [giggles]

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.100
&gt;&gt; Kiruna: Cool, Cool.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.100
&gt;&gt; Woman: And we get a lot people who tell us,'how good it is that we do nice things for the disabled in the uk'.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.100
I had my favourite today, who was a Sunday School teacher, 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.800
who wanted to teach her children how they needed to be better and look after us poor cripples.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.100
She didn't quite say it like that but -
&gt;&gt; Kiruna: but that was the gist. 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.100
No, there was another actually a littler earlier on, 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.100
that saw a photograph of somebody with Down Syndrome and said, 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.100
"OOOOh, I always love them, they're always smiling, they're never unhappy."
&gt;&gt; Woman: [giggles]

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.100
&gt;&gt; Kiruna: Well, if we've got something to teach the Normate, 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.100
about what it's like to live the world being crippled, bent and broken, 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.700
then, you know, fingers crossed they actually learn something from us; If not, just how NOT to patronise us.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.100
So that's it for me at the Liberty Festival. 
A day of celebrating disability and disability activism. 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.100
I think the highlight for me, had to be meeting a guy with CP, who took the time to put into his text-speech machine, 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.100
"oooh a hobbit".

00:04:32,110 --&gt; 00:03:35,100
So great day was had by all. 
Have a good one and come back next year.
