Hey, I'm Matt Wuerffel, one of the game designers here at ArenaNet

00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:15.916
and I'm here to talk to you about the Account Wardrobe feature,

00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:17.601
which goes live on April 15.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.963
So for Account Wardrobe, we looked at all the gear you can get in the game

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:26.947
-the weapons and armor - and we knew that it was a little bit difficult to look around

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:29.541
and see "How do I control my look in the game?

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:33.018
What pieces of armor do I want to get, what weapons do I want to get,

00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:35.373
how do I want to customize my look and feel?"

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:39.877
We took all those things and we said, we need to make this really easy for people to use,

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:42.375
we want you to be able to customize your look at any time,

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:48.381
and we want all the work you're doing across your account to be accessed by all the characters on your account.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.253
So when you log in on April 15,

00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:53.973
you'll see all the items you have on your character and you'll notice there are some changes.

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:57.746
As you collect items and weapons in the game, you're unlocking the skins.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.881
You can go into your Hero panel and you'll see a few changes.

00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:03.883
Equipment is there; it's the tab that it's always been.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.986
There's also a tab for Wardrobe, and when you click on Wardrobe, you'll see our new transmutation system.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.403
It lets you go in and see all of the skins that you've collected across the game on every character.

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:19.759
You can assign those skins to different weapons, you can assign them to your armor that you have equipped

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:24.740
and you can preview your look right there and then you can click "apply" once. Bam, you're done.

00:01:25.688 --> 00:01:29.968
Every piece of armor and weapon that you collect across the game unlocks a skin,

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.576
which you can go and use in the wardrobe in your Hero panel to change your look.

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:38.143
We also made some changes to the dye system. All the dies are now account bound,

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:42.050
so all the dies you've collected on each of your characters are available for use.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.935
You can go into the Hero panel and below the Wardrobe tab you'll see a button that says "dyes."

00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:50.605
You can click on that and you can go and preview all of the dyes.

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:56.246
The changes that you make in both the Wardrobe panel and the dye panel can be applied at the same time,

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.513
so you can change your look, change the color scheme, click "apply" and you're done.

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:04.005
One of the other changes we've made is to the account vault.

00:02:04.414 --> 00:02:06.466
When you go to the account vault, you'll see a new tab.

00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:10.326
It's called the Account Wardrobe. It looks like two doors to a wardrobe.

00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:15.128
When you click on it, you'll see all of the skins in the game - all the weapon skins, all the armor skins.

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:18.461
You can sort, filter, and search to your heart's content.

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:21.564
I know it's changed the way I play, even in the dev environment.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:25.609
I go in there and spend a lot of time clicking, seeing what different looks I can have,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.981
and I've found a lot of things that I didn't know were in the game.

00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:31.594
