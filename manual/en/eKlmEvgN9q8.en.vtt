00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.460
Alright, well here's my motorized bike project.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.340
It was a 12 speed originally.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.670
Picked it up at the Salvation Army Store for
about 10 bucks, as it came.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.789
And there's the little 66cc, little 2 stroke
engine.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.679
Got it off eBay.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.789
And I made a few modifications.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.300
One, I dropped down to a smaller, I believe,
if I remember right, that was a 36 tooth front

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.220
chain ring.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.370
And I had to replace the rear cassette and
I ended up having to replace the whole rear

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.240
wheel assembly and everything.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.030
Because that original chain tensioner that
comes with this kit is an absolute piece of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.030
crap.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.300
So I got this whole new wheel.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:59.720
And I also got the hub and sprocket assembly.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.110
I think it was from Pirate Cycles.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.720
And it's the 40 tooth sprocket.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.180
And there's my own home made chain tensioner.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.289
If you've got a welder, these are pretty easy
to make.

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.639
There's really nothing to it.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.759
Just a pivot point down there at the bottom
with a brass bushing.

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.289
I got that idler sprocket, I think it was
Tractor Supply Company.

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.890
Made a little arm.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.979
Got a little spring, and works great.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.479
Keeps the chain nice and tight.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.789
And I did upgrade to the #40 chain.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.109
I got rid of that one that came with.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.740
That one actually broke on me.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.279
So, couple of other little upgrades I made
were the NGK spark plug.

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:52.060
And also this MSD plug in the garage so I
swapped that in.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.009
Upgraded some of the hardware here on the
side covers.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.280
Not all of it, but a lot of it.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.850
Here at the intake and the exhaust.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.600
Got rid of the studs and just got allen head
bolts.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.170
And you can see it does have a boost bottle.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.810
That's another little home made boost bottle.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:19.960
I believe that one, the total volume of the
little bottle plus the tube, I believe was

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.080
60cc.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.310
So it's just under the displacement of the
engine, which was 66cc's.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.460
You can see I made little, I had to get in
there and make some solid mounts.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:42.280
The little running it around the frame of
the bike, it just allowed too much flex.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.230
And the engine would always dive over.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.530
And so that would throw the chain line out
of whack, and then my chain would bind up,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.850
or my chain would jump off, so I just made
some solid mounts.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.340
You can see, there's the rear one, there's
the front one.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.060
And that was about it.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:27.620
And I'll get this thing fired up and let you
hear it running.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.520
Still haven't been able to get it to idle
correctly.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.470
So, anyway I've been working on that.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.150
Tell you the truth, I think I'm going to swap
this out and put a 4 stroke engine in this.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.310
A little 3 horsepower.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.240
Now that I've got all this, this whole setup
back here.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.870
This hub adapter and sprocket.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.440
And I'll just get like a 3 horsepower, 4 stroke
engine with a centrifugal clutch.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.569
Throw that on there, and see how that goes.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.190
But, all in all, it's pretty alright.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:10.300
The biggest improvement in performance comes
from swapping out to one of these NGK plugs.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.060
Everything else that I did, the new wire,
the boost bottle, it kinda helped.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.889
But the most noticeable, sort of seat of the
pants, improvement in power came from this

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.380
plug.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.720
Much easier to start, ran a lot cleaner, ran
a lot smoother.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.830
So if you've got one of these engines, I highly
recommend putting in one of these NGK plugs.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:47.620
Also got the little o-ring here between the
intake tube and the carburetor.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.870
So that's it, pretty fun little project.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.910
But I'm probably going to improve on it a
little bit more.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.510
And I'll keep filming.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.090
Thanks for watching!
