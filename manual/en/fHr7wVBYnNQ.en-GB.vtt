00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.080
Once up on a time, There was a boy named Jack.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.480
He lived with his mother in a small cottage.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.160
Jack and his mother were very poor,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.720
and the most valuable possession was their cow.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.500
One morning, Jack's mother called him and said,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.600
Jack take the cow to the market,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900
and get a good price for her.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.300
So we can buy food.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.300
All right mother

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.940
So Jack stepped out to the market along with the cow.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.520
On his way to the market,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.380
Jack met an old man.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.520
I know you are going to sell this cow.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.080
Give it to me and take these magic Beans.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.340
Jack was thrilled,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.180
he quickly gave the cow to the old man,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.020
and took the beans and ran home.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.100
Jack showed the beans to his mother

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.520
Mother , See what I brought ..

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.920
How could you hand over a cow for five old beans?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.080
What will we live on now?

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.400
We shall starve to death, You stupid boy!

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.580
And then she threw the beans out of the window.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.880
That night the beans stalk reached  right into the clouds.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.400
When Jack woke the next morning,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.180
There was a huge towering beans stalk, right out side the window,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.560
where his mother had thrown the beans.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.420
Let me see what's up there!!!

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.040
Far beyond the clouds, there was a magnificent castle.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.840
The beans stalk let Jack right to the door of the castle

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.360
Jack become curious and walked in..

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.540
Inside there were many rooms,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.560
Walking slowly,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.260
Jack came into a large room,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.940
filled with sacks and barrels of gold coins.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.260
And in corner there was a giant, snoring in deep sleep.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.020
Jack picked up as many  gold coins as he could,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.220
and ran to the door.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.800
Climbing down the beans stalk, Jack reached back home.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.540
Mother, Look what I have bought for you, we will never be poor again.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.780
Mother was thrilled to see the gold coins.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.040
Jack then told her about the palace and the gaint.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.300
Jack and his mother used the gold to buy food

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.540
But the day came when the money ran out.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.300
And Jack decided to climb the Beanstalk again.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.700
Once again he went to the gaints palace.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.080
This time, Jack found that the gaint had a hen with him

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.140
Every time he said, "Lay"

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.280
The hen laid an egg, of Solid Gold.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.840
Jack  wanted to take the hen home, he waited until the giant fell asleep.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.840
As soon as the giant was snoring,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.820
Jack picked up the hen, but the hen started crowing loudly.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.180
Jack reached down the room towards the Beanstalk ,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.980
with a giants footsteps thundering behind him.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.200
Wait!  You thief, How dare you take away  my precious hen.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.520
Jack started to climb down the Beanstalk, the giant followed,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.780
At last, he reached the ground and seizing an axe,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.720
he chopped the Beanstalk with all his might.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.960
The giant came tumbling down, and laid dead at their feet.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.780
Jack showed the hen to his mother.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.720
Mother! this hen lays Golden Eggs.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.060
Jack, you were clever to exchange the cow for the magic beans.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.360
From that day on,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.520
Jack and his mother lived happily for a long long time.
