The Law Of Diminishing Returns &amp; Men's Style
- Focus On Large Gains NOT Small Fashion Details

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.750
Hi!

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.950
Today, I'm going to be talking about understanding
the law of diminishing returns when it applies

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.950
to men's style.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.030

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.210
And I'm also going to link you to my free
47-page e-book.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.230
It's awesome.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.240
Make sure to grab it.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.020
Okay, so why am I talking about economic principles
in men's style?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.340
I see this a lot and let me start off with
an example so you can understand the point

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.210
I'm trying to make.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.610
I think I was studying for the SATs or ACTs
-- actually, I took both when I was in high

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.570
school, but I remember there were two components
to the SAT.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.850
There was the verbal and there was the math.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.239
I did really well on the math, the first test.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.540
I did some practice exam and I didnâ€™t do
too great on the verbal.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.199
What I saw when I was in a group of people
is that a lot of people thought that the math,

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.790
I did really well on, but I can get an extra
ten points there if I put in this many hours,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.460
but I decided to focus on the verbal because
the way I looked at it, my score was low enough

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.159
that it would be easier for me to get a larger
return for focusing on the verbal than it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.290
would be the math.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.479
I mean, as you get closer to perfection -- the
law of diminishing returns tells us that the

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.799
closer you get to perfection, the harder it
is to get each and every little gain.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.060
The same is true in men's style.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.930
By the way, I scored pretty well.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.150
When it comes to men's style, it's the same
thing.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.630
Oftentimes, guys get focused on these little
things and they keep focusing in on one particular

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.820
aspect, and they totally miss the boat when
it comes to other things.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.180
And so, as you're making changes in your wardrobe,
ensure that you're looking around and look

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.600
for your weakest link and focus your efforts
there.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.680
If your clothing doesnâ€™t fit properly, instead
of going out and trying to add more color

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.430
or trying to add a wider variety or new styles,
take the clothing that you have to a tailor

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.430
and get it adjusted.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.010
You're going to get a much higher return for
the investment than if you keep focusing in

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.660
on these little areas that the amount of return
keeps going down.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.370
One of the reasons, again, that I bring this
up is I get a lot of men who seem to be really

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.280
fixated on these small things.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.170
They'll be emailing me, asking, "What's better,
pink or lavender?"

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.640
"What's better, two or three-button suits?"
when really what we're talking about here

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.000
is that stuff that probably lasts 10%, and
I want you to go back and focus on the 90%

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
fundamentals.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.599
I'm going to link you to some of my basic
articles, but if you haven't perfected the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.230
fundamentals, if you haven't gotten those
right -- fit, fabric, style -- then you focusing

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.599
on that little bit of 10% is kind of like
those kids, those people that are focusing

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.150
on that, trying to up their score by a couple
of points here when they're totally missing

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.650
the boat and it would be for the amount of
effort they put in here, they could easily

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.110
knock up their score 50 points or 100 points
over here and do really well.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.110
Okay.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.580
This has been Antonio Centeno with Real Men
Real Style.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.580
I'll see you in the comments.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.581
Bye-bye.
