Joe: Hey, it's Joe Crump again. The reason
I'm doing these videos is so that you can

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.370
decide whether or not it makes sense to get
involved with my Mentor Program or to come

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.750
to my Two Day Buying Event.
Joe: If you want information about those things,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.430
I'm not going to cover that in these videos,
e.g. what it's about and what's included and

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.180
all of that stuff. Just go to the website.
I've got it all laid out there. It's a long

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.860
letter that explains the whole process. Go
to zerodowninvesting.com. Spell it out -- z

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.590
e r o downinvesting.com and you can find all
of the information about the Mentor Program,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.079
about the buying events, etc.
Joe: I've combined them into one program now.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.660
I used to sell them separately (and they cost
a lot more money that way) -- I combined them

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.710
so that people could get the full effect of
what we're teaching and to make sure that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.020
the people that are in my program are successful.
Joe: The next question that I've got here

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.469
is,
Question: "You talk about building a business

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.710
and building wealth. What is the difference?"
Joe: Well, when you're building a business,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.170
you can certainly build wealth by building
a business, but with the business that we're

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.760
creating, we want to create cash flow; we
want money coming in all the time and we're

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.479
putting out an effort to make that money come
in on a regular basis. It doesn't have to

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.250
be a huge amount of effort, but you do have
to put out an effort to make that happen.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.500
Joe: Building wealth, on the other hand on
long term investments is where you buy a property

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.740
and it can passively increase in value. You
get benefits from the depreciation. You get

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.090
benefits from having tenants in that property
or lease option tenants and you can make money

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.120
long term -- its passive income -- you can
have somebody else manage your business, and

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.590
it's great.
Joe: But you have to have the properties to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.590
start with. I can teach you how to do that
through this business building program where

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.070
you can put these deals together, but that
takes some of your effort to make it happen.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.229
Joe: It doesn't take any effort once you own
the properties and you have a good management

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.410
in place and they can take care of that business
for you. You have to worry about your cash

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.410
flow and make sure that that's working properly
for you, but that's a whole different subject

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:23.940
which I'll get into on another video series.
Good luck with it.
