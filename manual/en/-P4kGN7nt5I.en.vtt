Hi, I'm Allen and welcome to expert village.
Today, I'm going to show you how to build

00:00:05.381 --> 00:00:10.950
your very own personal computer. The other
component is your DVD drive right here. Most

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.660
of the systems now run with DVD or DVD recordable
drives, best option. If you want to go really

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.099
really over the top you can go like blue ray
or HDTV, a little bit expensive, but depending

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.199
on your applications or what you're running
you can always do that. Definitely a good

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.779
option to have. Now a lot of these DVD recorders
are probably all made by the same company

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.520
in Taiwan or China so it really doesn't matter.
This one is a Ben Q. I don't know where I

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.300
got it; I think probably New Egg or one of
those places, probably only like $20 or something.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.710
I don't think there's a real necessity on
a Sony DVD drive just because it has Sony's

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.900
name on it. They all do the same thing. They
all come with the OEM software and they all

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.070
seem to be pretty nice. Now, when you purchase
the DVD recordable drive make sure it sports

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.600
a lot of the formats, -r, r, RW, all those
ones. The new ones are like the double layer

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.670
drive so if you get something like that you
have options for all your various media and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.729
also make sure that it has a pretty decent
buffer size probably 8 megabytes and up. That

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.810
way it just stops errors from occurring and
things like that. The buffer is when it's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.330
copying software and things like that. It
builds a buffer and refers to that. It's pretty

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.240
much a memory module within the DVD itself.
For the most part nowadays you don't need

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.350
any video decoders or anything like that.
The software that comes with it, even the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.469
OEM drives most likely will have the DVD player
or windows media should play DVD's and things

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:52.100
like that. Go on New Egg or PriceWatch, look
at different recorders. This one's a 16X;

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.100
you can go higher than that. Just a word of
the wise, if you're burning a lot of videos,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.520
I wouldn't burn above 4X if you have control
over it. Keep it stable. Data, burn as high

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.729
as you want. These ones are great. They sport
DVD recorders and CD recordable media. It's

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.330
definitely a plus so check it out.
