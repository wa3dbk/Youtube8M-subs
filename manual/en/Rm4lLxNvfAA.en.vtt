00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.629
What it do playa? This week on
Thug Notes we diggin deep with Notes from

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:18.629
Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky.
This book’s nameless narrator say

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.230
he one sick mothafu**a. But he ain’t got
the clap or anything like dat. The only thing

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.550
wrong with this fool is he decked out with
too much consciousness.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.680
And cuz o dat, this fool miserable
and lonely as hell. After philosophozing about

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.870
man, freedom, rationality and other real talk,
our 40 year old recluse start reminiscing

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.440
bout some sh** that went down when he was
in his 20s.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.020
Back in the day, the Underground
Man decided to drop in on some old school

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.640
homie named Zvertov who bout to throw a bangin
party. Thing is, ol Undie ain’t tight with

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.430
any of Zvertov’s crew no mo.
In fact, when they see him lurkin

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.090
round the party sippin too much sizzurp and
actin a fool, they start thinkin “What’s

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.500
this fool smokin?” They even try to shake
him before bringing their sausage fest to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.600
the local poon palace. But the narrator steps
to these haters and tails em there anyway.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.100
When he arrives, he peeps some rank
lookin ho named Liza, takes her to a room,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.350
and shows her his Russian Czar, know what
I’m sayin?

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.100
After doin the nasty, he try to
convince Liza not to be turn tricks no mo

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.240
by gettin all up in her head and messin with
her heart.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.030
Later, when the Underground Man
kickin back at his spot, Liza rolls in all

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.909
unannounced. She wanna talk real with him,
but all he wanna do is get uppity and preach

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.890
to her. But eventually, dis fool can’t keep
his sh** together and starts weepin.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.580
After tappin dat ass on mo time, he
decide he gonna toss her a couple dolla billz

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.690
to prove that all dat real talk was bullsh**
and that she ain’t nothin but a dirty skank.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.150
But Liza shows this fool who really got class
and tosses that paper before she leave.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.869
Realizing he actin a serious fool,
he runs after Liza to beg forgiveness. But

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.869
she loooong gone.
This book right hur is widely

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.659
considered the world’s first existentialist
novel. Years before Nietzche was jiving his

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:13.069
angsty sh**, Dostoevsky was keepin it OG with
the creation of the Underground Man.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.530
Ever since the Under-G hit the
scene in 1864, righteous playas been using

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.840
the term “Underground” to spit in the
face of the establishment and give all traditional

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.740
forms of thought a big “fu** you!”
Cuz the Underground Man don’t think

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.660
like the rest of society. Errybody else is
just fumble fu**in their way through life

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.380
and never askin the big questions. But for
our boy, dat sh**’s the dank. And if that’s

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.760
the way you wanna roll, you gotta open your
eyes so wide to the world around you that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.599
it hurts.
If you can do that, you playing a whole other

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.420
game, B. Dat pain you feel when you beefin
with reality

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.040
and get yo sh** wrecked creates consciousness.
Like our boy say “suffering is the sole

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.330
origin of consciousness.” (234)
But barkin with the big dawgs comes

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.620
at a cost: hyperconsciounsness.
When you can see every angle to a

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.530
question, you can get so overwhelmed that
you don’t know whether to go left or right.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.879
So instead of choosing a direction, our man
doesn’t do a damn thing.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.879
It ain’t that 
this fool lazy. He
ain’t even that. Hyperconsciousness has

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.290
made this cat straight up NOTHING. Our boy
calls dis “conscious inertia.”

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.069
The real joke up in here is that conciousness
only comes from the

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.160
suffering you experience when tryin to connect
with other peeps. But when the big C comes

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.069
creepin through your town, connecting with
others becomed damn near impossible. There’s

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.310
the rub, blood.
And if that seems like a whack

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.180
paradox to you, it’s all good cuz the Underground
Man is a livin breathin paradox. Our unreliable

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.160
narrator say he love to be isolated, yet he
jonesin for human contact. He envies yo erryday

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.010
playa, but he also proud not to be one. He
suffers, yet he finds pleasure in it. All

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.010
this mess makin him so outta touch with society
that lies and dreams are all he got:

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So escape this life, dive in to a
good book, and hit me up next week, homies.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.170
Peace.
