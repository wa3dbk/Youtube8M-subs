00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:03.190
Andy, Dani and Elidio,
we'll play "Quick Change"!

00:00:05.923 --> 00:00:08.024
In "Quick Change", they
will improvise a scene,

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:10.575
and every time I say 'change',
they'll change the last thing

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:12.432
they have said or done.

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:15.023
For "Quick Change" I'm
gonna need a profession.

00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:17.482
You guys on the front, can you
give me a profession, please?

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:22.142
Student pass forger.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:29.211
The 'profession' for "Quick
Change" is 'student pass forger'.

00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:31.961
Every time I say 'change'
they'll change, go!

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.998
I brought everything you asked, here...

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:40.993
My picture and...
I'd like to, I don't know...

00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:44.772
- I need to put a course in here, right?
- So, I was thinking about that...

00:00:44.772 --> 00:00:46.673
- I need a course to...
- Change!

00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:50.119
- I need an university here, right?
- Change!

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.051
I need an educational
institution, you know?

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:58.537
I'd like for you to use a public
university, so it looks like I studied...

00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:01.894
- You wanna use USP, is that it?
- Use USP!

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.511
Which course? The course is
important, it says a lot about you.

00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:08.441
- Put library science! Nobody
will suspect... - Change!

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:12.403
- Nobody would think 'wow, what'...
- Change!

00:01:12.403 --> 00:01:15.574
People will notice, it's an ice breaker:
'Library science, really'?

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:19.254
And I'll say: 'Really, like...
Working in a library'...

00:01:19.254 --> 00:01:22.046
Man, I'm serious,
I need a course in here!

00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:27.008
Well... Put...

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:29.048
Agricultural engineer.

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:35.881
- But you don't look like an agricultural engineer.
- What do I look like? I was thinking about this...

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:37.413
Man, you look like a...

00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:44.635
- What does he do, my daughter? - He
 provides student passes, he can get you one.

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:48.776
- But I'm 48 years old...
- The important thing is to pay less!

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:52.699
I want to meet this boy!

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.694
He's the real thing, come here, mom!

00:01:56.461 --> 00:02:00.152
- So...
- Here's your pass...

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:02.811
Somebody's here!
Somebody's here!

00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:06.212
- He lives right in front of us?
- Yes!

00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:09.033
- Calm down!
- Somebody's here!

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.733
- I have a cover, this is a locksmith
shop, nobody suspects... - Change!

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:15.135
- I have a cover, this is a pool store...
- Change!

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:20.377
- I have a cover, this is a
helicopter retail chain... - Change!

00:02:20.377 --> 00:02:24.260
- This is where I sell drugs, take it easy!
- Change!

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.061
This is where I sell
human beings, calm down...

00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:31.713
- I'll stay here like I'm for sale...
- Yes, easy...

00:02:31.713 --> 00:02:35.075
My daughter, I don't
have the whole day...

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:37.896
I'm sorry I was having lunch,
that's why I didn't open.

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:39.717
- It's me. This is my mom.
- Nice to meet you.

00:02:39.717 --> 00:02:42.728
Are you interested in buying
a human being? Come on in!

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:47.499
She's cool, you can tell her!

00:02:47.638 --> 00:02:51.328
- Hello. - Are you interested in
paying half the price in the movies?

00:02:51.328 --> 00:02:54.309
And in theatre plays!

00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:56.633
- I want to go to the movies for free!
- Change!

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:58.630
- I want to pay less at the movies.
- Change!

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.252
I want to be in a movie!

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:06.403
They say the pass gives
you an opportunity...

00:03:06.403 --> 00:03:09.003
- Do you make professional registries too?
- I do!

00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:11.904
But the student's half discount
gives you half a part in the movie,

00:03:11.904 --> 00:03:13.406
I have everything here for you.

00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:17.626
What movie do you wanna join?

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:21.030

- Change!

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.321
- Some kid's movie!
- Change!

00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.101
- Elderly movie!
- Change!

00:03:25.101 --> 00:03:28.322
- Horror!
- I know this old guy!

00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:33.914
He passes by the school all
the time in a police car!

00:03:35.044 --> 00:03:36.255
Change the siren!

00:03:48.173 --> 00:03:50.073
He's a policeman!

00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:52.784
- That's right!
- Change the weapon!

00:03:53.293 --> 00:03:55.104
- You got that right!
- Change!

00:03:56.644 --> 00:03:58.075
You betcha!

00:03:58.075 --> 00:04:02.016
My God, scissors!
He's got sharp tipped scissors!

00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:04.252
Mom, can I use sharp tipped scissors?

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:08.642
- No, you can't!
- Nobody moves! My cover was blown!

00:04:08.642 --> 00:04:10.312
I didn't want it to blow!

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:15.425
Okay! I'm in the middle of an
investigation on this fake pass gang!

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:20.694
- I'm just a neighbor!
- A neighbor who wanted to pay half...

00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:22.303
- Change!
- You don't...

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.764
- A neighbor who wanted to enjoy
student's benefits! - Change!

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:28.723
- A neighbor...
- I have scissors too!

00:04:28.723 --> 00:04:34.877
- Oh, no! - Careful with these
scissors, my hair is protected here!

00:04:35.457 --> 00:04:39.387
- If anybody moves, I'll cut my
mother's hair! - Easy, boy!

00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:42.489
- Easy...
- I'm a girl!

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:45.890
Girl?
Check out your pass, Mister João!

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.242
Who studies administration at Uninove!

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:53.252
No! No, not Uninove!

00:04:56.253 --> 00:05:00.085
"Quick Change"!

00:05:01.647 --> 00:05:04.968
There's some Uninove students leaving...
Take it easy, we're joking!
