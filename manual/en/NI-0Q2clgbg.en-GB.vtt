00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.060
Krishna played many tricks and like all small boys, he is naughty.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.940
Yasodha found it very difficult to handle the complaints that poured it.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.280
Yasodha!

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.420
Krishna stole butter in my house.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.960
Look Madha!

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.460
I am so short.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.560
The butter pot is kept so high.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.440
How could I reach it?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.840
Krishna...

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.960
You are becoming naughtier day by day.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.260
I will have to punish you.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.920
So she brought a piece of rope,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.120
and placing Krishna by the side of the mortar tried to tie him to it.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.040
Ahh...

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.720
Aaaahhh...

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.040
But she found that the rope was a little short.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.880
So she got another piece and joined both the ropes.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.920
Maa...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.600
Still, the rope was not long enough.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.360
She found that the rope was short by two inches to make a knot.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.400
When Krishna saw his mother  perspiring and tired...

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.560
he allowed himself to be tied her out of compassion for her.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.660
Leaving Krishna tied up,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.440
she went inside to resume her household.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.280
Mmm...

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.100
Krishna crawled slowly,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.740
and he found that the mortar too was coming behind him.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.000
Aah... Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... Mmm...

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.340
Mmm... Mmm...Huh... Huh...

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.920
Mmm... Mmm...Mmm...

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.920
Huh... Mmm... Mmm...

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.700
Huh... Mmm... Mmm...Huh...

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.620
Mmm... Mmm...Huh...

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.500
Slowly he came out of the house,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.520
and saw a couple of trees together.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.120
There was only a little gap in  between them.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.920
He hit upon a plan to free himself from the mortar.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.400
He thought to himself:

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.300
If I have squeeze myself through the trees to the other side,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.940
the mortar will not pass through the gap.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.140
I shall use all my strength to pull the mortar.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.760
The rope will then snap and I can free myself.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.040
Aahh... Aahh...

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.820
Huh... Aahh...

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.560
Aahh... Aahh... Mmm....

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.780
Mmmmm...

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.240
Mmmm... Argh...

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.740
Aahh... Aahh...

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.360
He pulled the mortar

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.480
but the rope did not snap, as he expected.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.460
Again he tried with all his strength,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.500
but instead of rope snapping...

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.120
two trees fell to the ground with a great crash.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.340
A miracle followed.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.660
Two celestial beings came out from those trees.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.160
We are the sons of Lord Kubera.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.900
Naradha had cursed us to become trees for our misdeeds.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.860
He also said that the touch of Krishna would deliver us from the curse.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.200
Saying so, the celestial beings bowed to Krishna and left.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.340
Hearing the loud noise, Yasodha rushed to the spot.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.180
She was amazed to see the two trees,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.820
and Krishna playing happily by their branches.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.400
She couldn't understand how little Krishna uproot to such big trees,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.040
which were there for so many years.
