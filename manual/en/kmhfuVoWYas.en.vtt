00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.600
Harley Davidson made new model Street 750

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.200
special for the city

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.760
It is lightweight, perfect for novice bikers

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.220
The cheapest in the HD line

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.440
I've tested it and can say this bike is rather cool

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.800
It's smooth, with long gears, allows to briskly maneuver in traffic

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.300
750cc,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.800
no ABS

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.400
with drive belt,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.440
V-twin

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.000
How do you think this bike Street 750...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.340
is hot?

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.540
Or hat?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
Can it run fast, maneuver, make wheelies, drift

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.880
or jump on the hillock and go away on the rear wheel?

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.940
I think it's impossible

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400
but although let's try

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.080
Actually Harley Davidson is a cool thing

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.220
I like it

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.360
Nice to ride 110mh in the aisle between the cars

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.380
Even the moto police could not leave me

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.820
Usually we leave the police, but this time police could not leave me
