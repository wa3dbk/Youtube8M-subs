00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.389
Hello, Namaste, salaam Walaikum, sat sri akal

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.389
Welcome back to another session with your vahchef at vahrehvah.com

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.270
today I'm going to show you one of the
most simplest of all the flavored rice

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.400
guessed it right

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.990
Jeera rice so to make this Jeera rice
lot of the times what we do in the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.119
restaurant as we take white rice

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.279
we just make a tadka and add the white
rice on top of it and mix it and give it

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.630
that way

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.100
the rice is not really flavorful but
i'm going to show you one simplest way

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.590
how to make this Jeera rice

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.910
so all you do is to prepare this Jeera rice
add some oil

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.149
even better if you can use butter and
then add cumin seeds that is jeera see

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.760
when you see that Jeerar splutter add some
green chillies very little mint and some

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
coriander leaves

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.540
and add water

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.220
ok how much water to add C for one cup of
rice add two cups of water

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.030
this is how we do when you are making a
small quantity of rice

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.930
but if you're making large quantity of
rice the proportion of water to rise

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.960
always reduces for more instructions

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.900
you can check my video on how to cook
rice at Vahrehvah.com and then add some

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.900
salt

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.009
now when this water comes to a boil I
have soaked this rice for almost 40 minutes

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.060
now have drained this all the water from
this rice and i'm going to add to this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.509
and in this preparation mint is optional
if you like the mint flavor add to it

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.950
otherwise if you just want Jeera flavour just add Jeera and then you will get a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.849
beautiful Jeera rice till now I've cooked
it on high flame but if you see that

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:08.069
water is all absorbed by the rice if
you're making any meat preparations

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.829
you can also add some fried onion if
you want otherwise you can just leave it

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:21.269
like that and then just to top it off
with little bit of color

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.480
on top and let it cook for another 5
minutes

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.959
In a very very slow flame and then you
will get a nice fluffy jeera pulao so

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.879
friends my Jeera Rice is ready

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.359
look at this jeera rice and it is so fluffy
and nice and a very nice flavor of jeera

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:46.799
haha hmm i made my grandma's chicken
curry

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.049
so I'm going to add some of the chicken
curry Jeera rice is wonderful because it goes

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.329
extremely well with any preparations

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.549

rolls or any preparation Jeera rice is

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.549
