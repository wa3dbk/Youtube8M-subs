00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:05.066
Yet another part of dem 3D Lands.

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:15.066
This music very well describes this last week.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:21.066
Just...so much stuff to do.

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.066
And the worst part is that it's not even done yet.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:53.066
You can actually clear this stage without any of 
the green panels, but... Fuck if I'm trying that.

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:45.033
And another level like this...

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:56.033
And this time, it's with Cosmic Mareoh.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:09.066
So I guess I should talk about Super Mario 3D 
World...

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:15.033
Um, well...

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:19.033
The trailer looked promising. If they aren't 
rushing the game (which, considering the 
amount of powerups, is possible)...

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:24.066
...then it will be good.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:31.033
And, um, yeah.

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:36.033
Also, fracking Nintendo stole my "fake flagpole" 
idea. What butts.

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:41.033
I will file necessary complaints nowhere.
