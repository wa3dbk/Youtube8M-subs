00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.040
America’s Next Top Model is an internationally known reality show that takes aspiring models

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.760
and gives them a chance to compete for a contract.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.600
It’s been on the air for over a decade and was started by Tyra Banks --

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.900
but this year, we’re seeing something, or someone, different.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.200
(upbeat music)

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.200
This isn’t just any cat walk -- this is the start of Cycle 22 for America’s Next Top Model.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.600
(cheers)

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.160
You might recognize one man: Nyle Dimarco.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.740
He's the first Deaf model to ever compete on ANTM.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.320
Phyllis: “Always, of course I’m his biggest fan!”

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.140
Nyle is not allowed to contact anyone outside of the competition until more decisions are made.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.900
So we sat down with his biggest fan and longest friend.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Phyllis: “Of course I’m thrilled for his career, I really want it to take off.”

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.380
Phyllis mentioned that he stood out for three reasons:

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.220
Phyllis: "Everyone’s always fascinated with his eyes -- Nyle does have good eyes.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.860
Also his body, he really does have to work at it though, and he puts a lot of work into it -- so there’s the proof.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.140
The third thing, of course, like he mentioned is that Deaf culture's really ingrained in him."

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.520
In Nyle’s audition tape, he said ASL would
be a major benefit in the competition.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.500
Nyle: “As you can see, my language requires facial expression and body language. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.100
So the modeling photos will guarantee to tell a story.”

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.380
We also sat down with his twin brother, Nico, to get a closer look at what’s been happening.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.200
Nico: “Of course! I think this is so cool. It’s
amazing that he can show what Deaf people can do

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.920
and that -- really we don’t have a glass ceiling whatsoever.”

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.500
Nico says that this hasn’t been Nyle’s life long passion -- 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.980
but that once he realized he could do it,  it’s taken him far.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.600
Nico: “People kept bugging him about keeping up with modeling and doing it more, 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.400
but he didn’t care too much about it and always just shrugged it off. 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.060
After trying it a bit, it got to the point where he realized he was actually good at it."

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.460
There is no guarantee that Nyle will make it to a certain point. 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.540
However, cycle 22 is expected to air around August. 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.260
For now, just getting into the competition has been inspiration.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.180
Phyllis: “Deaf people tend to have the opportunity because there's a Deaf role. 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.500
It’s not usually just because they're people who -- who they're looking for in general.”
