00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:11.420
I am Shawna Coronado and I am coming to you
from the Ashtown Castles walled kitchen garden

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.179
in Dublin, Ireland.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.082
It is so cool.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.329
This is the most fantastic kitchen garden
I have ever seen.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.039
Really, it is.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.500
And beyond having the traditional, kitchen
morsels like herbs, spices, and vegetables,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.399
it also has quite an incredible and beautiful
flowering aspect.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.739
And so behind me you can see poppies, which
of course you can use for poppy seeds and

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.769
other kitchen, kitchen part of it.

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.370
And all of the garden connect directly to
the Bloom 2010 event in Ireland which I am

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.370
attending and speaking at.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.789
So, I am going to walk you around and give
you a little tour and show you some of the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:03.289
magnificent plants that are here at the Ashtown
Castle Garden.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:13.530
So a kitchen garden is a general term for
all sorts of things that you might use to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.530
cook with.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.890
For instance, behind me are potatoes and they
are lovely and perfect shape potatoes.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.760
I want my potatoes to look like this.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.520
And it is also herbs and any kind of green
leaf vegetable like lettuce.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:50.860
All of these things, totally wonderful for
the garden and for cooking for your family.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:00.230
Now apparently, broccoli and other cruciferous
vegetables are simply mauled by the birds

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.230
here.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.420
So the reason that the netting is over this
entire section is because the birds really

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.500
attack it.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.970
But beneath the netting is one very healthy,
healthy plant.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.810
So it might be a good idea for you.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.330
What pest is really bothering you?

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.330
Is it birds?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.200
Well, a net is not a bad idea.
And obviously, it is what works here so that

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:33.540
they can get more food produce and donate
to the local people.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:51.040
Here you see geraniums, day lilies, hosta,
lamb’s ear, all kinds of beautiful plants

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.800
growing in with the kitchen garden.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.350
And what is so cool about that is you can
really mix plants.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.510
So you have a perennial bed out front.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.510
Guess what?

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.931
You could be feeding your family with your
perennial bed – mix in a few vegetables.

00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:08.630
It is the smart thing to do.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.840
And at the end of the season, you are going
to have some good food for that family and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.819
you will have saved yourself a lot of money.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.500
So, it is a very sustainable idea.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.010
Mix in vegetables with your traditional perennial
– it will work.
