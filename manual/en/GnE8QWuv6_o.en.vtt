00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.950
Hi, I'm Eugenie. Do you eat rainbows? 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.440
Today I'm making rainbow sushi rice cake. 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.280
It's totally healthy and very yummy. 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.490
If you make savory cakes, try this.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.280
For this recipe you will need: 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.990
cooked short-grain rice, 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.190
rice vinegar, 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.990
optional sesame seeds, 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.190
mayonnaise, 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.490
canned tuna, 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.270
salt, sugar, onion, 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.200
pepper, red bell pepper, carrot, 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.200
boiled eggs, broccoli, and red cabbage.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.910
First, in a mixing bowl I’m adding 6 ounces of drained canned tuna, 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.010
1 tablespoon of finely chopped onion,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.030
 and 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise. 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.910
And mix to combine. 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.610
This is for rice cake filling. 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.240
And season with pepper.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.030
You can use crab or salmon salad. 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.160
If you are vegetarian, how about guacamole? 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.360
In 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar, 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.940
add 1 tablespoon of sugar 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.740
and 1 teaspoon of salt. 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.460
And stir to combine. 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.360
And pour it into the cooked short-grain rice and fold to mix. 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.650
Be careful not to break rice. I cooked 2 cups of rice today. 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.860
And if you want, now mixing in toasted sesame seeds would be great. 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.160
Then equally divide the rice in 5.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.250
And add one vegetable in each bowl: 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.660
3 tablespoons of finely chopped red bell pepper, 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.360
3 tablespoons of finely chopped carrots, 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.280
crumbles of 3 boiled egg yolks, 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.570
3 tablespoons of finely chopped broccoli, 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.660
and 3 tablespoons of finely chopped red cabbage. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.660
I used blanched broccoli, carrot, and red cabbage for better taste, digestion, and color.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.070
And mix well. 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.790
For vegetarians, how about yellow bell pepper or yellow pickled radish for yellow rice? 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.360
Any other ideas? Leave a comment below.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.080
Then for a rainbow cup, make a rainbow in a glass. 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.370
First, violet. 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.990
And I will add tuna salad between layers. 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.280
Then green, 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.620
yellow, 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.810
press down a little with a spoon to make it firm.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.010
orange, 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.510
and red.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.120
And for sushi rice cake, make another rainbow in a cup lined with plastic wrap. 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.610
This time I started with red. 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.610
And repeat the process. 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.110
Voila, Healthy rainbow cup. 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.410
And rainbow sushi rice cake. 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.320
Aren’t they beautiful? 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.410
The colors of this dish is  so inviting.  

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.410
Bon appetit.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.530
I love it.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.740
Also it’s healthy. 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.750
The main flavor is tuna salad filling. 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.000
So make sure to use your favorite delicious filling. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
