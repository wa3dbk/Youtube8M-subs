00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.500
How often do you use a cell phone?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.370
How about your children?

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.960
Although many dismiss the link between cell
phone use and cancer, research has shown that

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.740
consumers who use mobile devices without headsets
face an increased likelihood of developing

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.680
certain types of brain or salivary gland tumors.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
Specifically, heavy cell phone use without
a head set has been shown to put individuals

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.460
at an increased risk for

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.940
Glioma (a malignant form of brain cancer)

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.190
Acoustic neuroma (a tumor of the nerve that
runs from the ear to the brain)

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.769
Meningioma (a tumor that grows on the layer
of tissue that covers the brain and the spine)

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.229
Tumors of the salivary glands

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:51.299
Cell Phone Radiation Lawsuits:

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.040
As a result of these injuries, plaintiffs
have filed a growing number of cell phone

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.010
radiation lawsuits against cell phone manufacturers.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.799
These cases, pending in the Superior Court
of Washington, D.C., allege that tumors and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.080
brain cancers resulted from cell phone radiation
exposure.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.710
The cell phone radiation lawsuits allege that
cell phone manufacturers failed to warn and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.110
protect users from dangerous and hazardous
radio frequency emissions, putting consumers

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.790
at an increased risk for developing brain
cancer and other non-cancerous tumors.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.790
Timeline of Cell Phone Radiation Studies:

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.580
These lawsuits rely on cell phone research
stemming back from 2002, when a Swedish study

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.660
led by Dr. Lennart Hardell showed an 80 percent
greater risk of developing brain tumors in

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.650
long-term first-generation cell phone users
than those who did not use cell phones.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.070
In 2004, the Karolinska Institute of Sweden
found that 10 or more years of cell phone

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.340
use increased the risk of acoustic neuroma
on the side of the head where the phone was

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.990
most often held.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.470
In 2005 the British Medical Journal published
a study of Swedish rural residents, finding

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.210
that those who used a cell phone for over
three years were more likely to develop brain

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.210
tumors.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.750
In 2008: an expansive Interphone study found
that the highest frequency group of cell phone

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.660
users was twice as likely to develop glioma.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.330
In 2011: The World Health Organization reclassified
cell phone radiation as “possibly carcinogenic,”

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.150
placing cell phones in the same category as
lead and chloroform.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.140
Not all scientists agree and there is some
controversy in the medical community over

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.310
this issue.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.690
For example, in July 2011, the first study
on cellphone use and risk of brain tumors

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.720
in children and adolescents conducted by researchers
at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.280
concluded that there was no link between cell
phone use and cancer in children.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.610
That study, however, has recently come under
significant fire by others in the medical

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.990
community.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.700
In April 2012, scientist from the Environmental
Health Trust issued a letter stating the study

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.090
was flawed, calling it “sloppy” and noting
that the study data actually shows that children

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.880
who used cell phones had a 115 percent increased
risk of brain tumors over those who did not.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880
Conclusion:

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.530
If you have been a long time cell phone user
and developed glioma, acoustic neuroma, meningioma,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.260
or a tumor of the salivary gland, you may
have a legal claim against the manufacturers

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.840
of your cell phone.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.630
The lawyers at Bernstein Liebhard LLP are
heavily involved in these cases and would
