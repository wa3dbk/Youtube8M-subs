00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.600
Hi, everyone!

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
Welcome to another video of Nyonya Cooking!

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.400
In this video,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.700
I'm going to show you how to prepare

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.400
one of the most requested dish

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.800
in the history of Nyonya Cooking

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.400
In fact, this is the most requested recipe

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.800
and It's 'rendang'

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.900
There's beef 'rendang' or chicken 'rendang'

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800
and Today, I'm preparing chicken 'rendang'

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.200
I've cooked this many times

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000
for my friends of different nationalities

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.300
They all love it

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.000
Therefore, it is a very good dish to start with

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.500
to introduce your friends of different nationalities

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.400
to malaysian cuisine

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.900
If you suppose that this is just another chicken curry recipe,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.000
you are totally wrong

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.800
It tastes nothing like curry,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
not at all

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.400
It's really delicious

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.400
The combination of ingredients

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.800
will tantalize your taste buds

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200
with the flavours ....aahh...

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.400
It's delicious

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.400
I know you can't wait

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.200
to find out what the ingredients are

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.200
Let's check it out

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.000
The recipe I'm sharing with you today

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.200
needs about 450 grams of chicken

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.600
The heart to 'rendang' is chillies

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000
It might looks scary

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.800
Do not worry

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.500
It won't be that spicy

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.400
The seeds of the chillies had been removed

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.400
Do the same to lessen the spiciness

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.200
The ingredients that need to be blended

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.200
are lemongrass,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.400
galangal... it looks like ginger,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.600
ginger, shallots and some garlic

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.000
To add to the fragrance of the 'rendang',

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.800
some kaffir lime leaves,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.400
Very fragrant indeed

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.400
some coconut milk and 'kerisik'

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.400
'Kerisik' is basically toasted shredded coconut

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
Same method I've used in the 'butter prawns' video

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.400
You may click here to find out how it's done

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.500
Smells really good too

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.400
It will not taste like butter prawns

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.400
even though I'm using the same ingredient

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.600
It's different

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800
Lastly, some salt to taste

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.800
Start by blending the ingredients

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.800
I'm doing it in batches due to the small blender

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.000
Blend the chillies after cutting them into smaller pieces

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Add in the shallots and garlic

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000
Cut off the stem of the galangal before blending it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.800
Blend all the ingredients together until fine

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.600
The blended ingredients are ready

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.600
We are going to fry it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.800
Heat up 3 to 4 tablespoonful of oil in a pan

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.200
Pour in the blended ingredients

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.400
Cook until it 'pecah minyak', as known in the Malay language

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
or turns into a darker shade of red

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.600
then, it's ready

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.600
It had changed to a darker shade of red now

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.400
and you can smell the fragrance

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.200
Add the 'kerisik' into the pan

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.800
When it is evenly mixed,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.000
add in the chicken

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
followed by the coconut milk

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.400
This had been cooking for about 30 minutes

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.000
The gravy is drying up

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.000
Taste it from time to time

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.200
Adjust the taste according to your preference

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.600
Allow it to simmer at low heat for another 10 minutes

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.200
It should be ready then

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.000
The 'rendang' is ready now

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.600
The paste had thickened considerably

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.800
Switched off the stove

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.400
Then, cut the kaffir lime leaves into thin strips

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.000
Add them to the 'rendang'

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.200
This will add some fragrance to the 'rendang'

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.200
Adding the kaffir lime leaves

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.200
enhances the fragrance of the 'rendang'

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.400
Use it if you can get hold of it

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.000
If not, the 'rendang' would seem to be slightly lacking

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:52.000
Dish it out

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.400
This kitchen of mine smells heavenly

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.600
Now, let's put the rendang to the test

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.700
So, let's try

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.000
One piece of 'rendang'....

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.200
Just so good

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.400
It is so difficult to taste good 'rendang' in Germany

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.400
This plate of 'rendang'

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.600
will wow all your visitors and your family

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.400

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.200
