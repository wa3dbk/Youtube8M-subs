00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.800
Hello I am very glad to see you again 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.140
and thank you so much for all the 
wonderful comments I have been getting.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.959
I'd like to read the ten top countries for
this channel, for this week, which are:

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.620
The United States, the United Kingdom, 
Germany, Mexico,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:24.660
India, Brazil, Vietnam, 
Saudi Arabia, Canada, and Russia!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:35.310
Thank you. Dank. Gracias. धन्यवाद. Obrigado.
Cảm ơn. شكرا. Merci. спасибо!

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.579
Thank you to all of you, and all the rest!

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.129
Today I am going to draw an angel for you.

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.269
I start by sketching the shape of the skull
and then I draw some features.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.399
I am not going to make this tutorial
as academic as other times,

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.009
this is going to be more like a free drawing.
I am going to pretend nobody is watching,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.780
and I'll draw the way I would
normally do it in my studio.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.600
It is worth mentioning that I haven't
drawn since two days ago,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.909
and that I didn't warm up before starting.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.609
No pianist would ever dream of 
arriving and delivering a concert

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.500
without priorly warming up 
with scales and all of that.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.829
Neither a tennis player would ever 
think of arriving to a court

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.539
and playing a game without warming up

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:34.539
and before fine tuning the 
service and his strokes.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.490
How on earth, can an artist arrive and start
drawing and video recording the drawing

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.149
to publish it to half the world

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.460
without priorly warming up and fine tuning
with enough sketches?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.200
I was cold, rusty and felt so stiff.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.200
The result is that I 
committed several mistakes

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.469
and I had to erase and redo 
that face about three times.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.409
It took me a little while 
to start loosening up

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.289
and for things to start coming right.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.300
So, the moral of the story is...

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.930
Draw every day, and before doing 
a significant drawing,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.930
warm up with enough sketches.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.330
OK. A lot of people ask me how to draw hands.
First, I outline a flat shape.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
Make sure it is of the right 
size and proportion,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.470
before getting into the details 
like makingthe fingers.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.770
I often make a line where the knuckles go.
That is, where the fingers are going to fold.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.160
So, I sketch the outline...

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.860
and in this particular case, I didn't
actually draw the knuckle line...

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.060
But I did visualise it 
before drawing the fingers.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.070
Then, if the hand looks correct,
I give it more and more detail.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.000
Finally, I start shading.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.290
For this, I use a 2B lead, 
and a 6B for the very darks.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.000
For sketching, and for the 
light shadows I am using an H.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.700
I shade little by little to render the volumes.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.000
This is almost like sculpting the shapes.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.820
I smudge the graphite with 
a soft synthetic brush.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.030
I make my way by shading and giving more detail.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.020
I am shading in different directions 
for a more uniform result.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.120
I delineate some specific parts 
that I want to stand out.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.290
As I go, I continue correcting whatever needed.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.560
Especially the mishaps from 
starting with a cold hand,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.290
and with a rusty eye.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:12.290
But by now I am totally loosened up
and I am enjoying it more and more.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.000
If she is going to be an angel... 
She needs wings!

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I first sketch the outline 
and then some feathers in rows.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.370
To break up monotony I am going 
to make a missing feather.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:23.370
And I give it a fairly even background
which I then smudge with a brush.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:32.290
And with a kneaded eraser I pull some lights. 
This gives nice volumes.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.950
I use the graphite powder 
from when I sharpen the leads

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.250
to charge the brush... And so, 
darken the background.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.270
I go over the figure as well 
to integrate it.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.590
And over the wings to give them a tone.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.010
This allows me to give light
accents to some feathers.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.010
I then smudge and integrate them with a brush.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:29.300
And then I re-establish the lights
on the face and the body.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.370
I refine some details.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:41.370
Remember to use a clean paper so you don't
get your hand and the drawing dirty.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.010
OK, I would love to know
what do you think about it?

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.830
