00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.490
&gt;&gt;&gt;Dr. Margileth: When tamoxifen was first
developed in the early 80s it replaced removal

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.200
of the ovaries as a hormone manipulation for
the treatment of breast cancer.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.830
The initial trials looked at two years of
tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen and two years

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.970
was better than none.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.770
The next trial was a trial of five years versus
two years and five years turned out to be

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.650
a better length of treatment than two years.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.159
The next trial I did was a trial of ten years
versus five years and interestingly ten years

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.380
did not turn out to be better than five years.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.339
So the standard approach at this point in
time would be to limit tamoxifen use after

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.409
primary surgery for breast cancer to five
years.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.470
If the patient has a particularly bad breast
cancer and is post menopausal, one can then

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.880
ask the question whether further treatment
with an aromatase inhibitor is appropriate,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.259
but in general five years of tamoxifen would
be the time period of giving that drug.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.259
*****

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.420
Hi, I am Dr. Jay Harness and I want to share
with you an important information that I believe

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.899
that every newly diagnosed patient with breast
cancer needs to know.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.359
Susan Denver: “I am a breast cancer survivor.”

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.039
Katherine Stockton: “I am a breast cancer
survivor.”

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.380
Coree: “I am a breast cancer survivor…”

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710
Susan Denver: “…and I want every woman
to know…”

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.100
Katherine Stockton: “…about personalized
breast cancer treatment…”

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.649
Susan Denver: “…and the Genomic Test.”

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.880
Coree: “A test that helps guide a woman
and her doctor…”

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.700
Katherine Stockton: “…to the best treatment
options for her.”

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.259
Susan Denver: “Pass it on!”
