Hi! I am Michael Webb on behalf of ExpertVillage.com.
Right now I want to take a second just to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.930
show you a couple of basic bases that you
are going to find. A lot of times in origami

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.250
you will start with a standard base and work
from there out. There is a lot of bases that

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.820
you are going to find, I am going to cover
two, which are the kite base and the preliminary

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.980
base. We will go ahead and start with a kite
base. In order to do this you are going to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:45.360
make a valley fold along the center and make
a good crease for a reference line. Open it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.670
back up and you are going to take each edge
here and bring it along until it meets your

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.129
center baseline, which you have just made
with your crease. You are going to do that

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:09.909
for both sides.
And that is the kite base, which obviously

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.200
is named because it looks similar to a kite,
and is one of the most common bases that you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.530
will find in origami. Another one is what
is called the preliminary base, which involves

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.500
a little bit of some finesse. What you want
to do is take your paper and youâ€™ll fold

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:41.479
it four times along all edges and all points,
some good creases in there. Now just fold

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:56.210
it diagonally as well.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.969
Now this part can be a bit of a trick, but
what you want to do is grab here right along

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.380
these two crease lines that you have just
made and you are just going to bring this

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:19.450
in until it makes sort of a pyramid shape
and you will fold it down. This is preliminary

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.709
base.
