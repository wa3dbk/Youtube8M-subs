00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.180
Here is an assignment ...

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.379
From six in the morning to eleven-thirty at
night, senior Harmonie Westbrook has a lot

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.389
on her plate.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.120
Document.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.849
Okay.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.309
We're document.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.570
Every week, Harmonie balances school with
wrestling and boxing practices and meets,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.680
and her part-time
job at the family paintball business.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.349
Harmonie gives her all, regardless of what
she does. You know what I mean? I admire that

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.810
about her.
Don't tell her that. [CHUCKLE]

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.529
You spell Harmonie, and that's how you spell
awesome.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.379
But the stress of staying on top of things
is no laughing matter. According to a University

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.809
of Toronto
study, forty percent of teenagers who participate

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.940
in school sports suffer from high levels of
stress and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.650
feelings of depression. And Harmonie knows
what it's like to have a breaking point.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.430
It was a three-hour practice during winter
break, and we had a double practice. And I

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.729
left during practice,
and I came home crying to my mom, saying that

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.670
I hate wrestling, and I don't want to do it
again. I just

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.680
felt so exhausted, because the day before
that, we had a tournament at the paintball

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.870
field, so I didn't get
no sleep, and I just felt so overwhelmed and

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.290
stressed out, and everything.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:19.030
I mean, I seen her dehydrated, I seen her
so thin. I was saying, Harmonie, quit. And

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.080
I could just see her
mentally, physically, and her body was just

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.550
deteriorating.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.320
And it wasn't just last year.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.470
I always was so exhausted. And I want to do
good in everything I do, so it's not like

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.050
I'm just going to
mediocre it.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.310
I'm dying.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.360
Every individual athlete, or even student
managers, I think students, they do a multiplicity

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.520
of things to
manage stress in their life.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.770
For student athletes in particular, one way
to solve stress is to ...

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.550
De-stress, deflate at the end of the day,
decompress. I think it's very important that

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.090
people who live a
fast-paced live, they have to make time for

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.299
themselves somewhere, yeah?

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.830
I think for about two days, I stayed home
to just sleep, because I was drained and I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.729
felt like I couldn't
move out of bed.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.810
[CHUCKLE]

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.410
All the time, I get stressed out because of
my schedule. But I always just sleep it off.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.840
They should really try to talk to someone
about it. Talk to their parents, to their

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.530
teacher, counselor, and
get some perspective on it.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.220
If somebody's well-organized, and they know
what's coming, that's going to relieve stress,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.980
too, yeah?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.010
I feel like, you know, high school is almost
over, so everything's going to pay off. I

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.190
want to be
independent. I don't want to be depending

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.300
on anybody else but myself.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.470
Balancing it all as an adult won't be easy,
but it's one goal this student is determined

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.400
to meet to achieve
complete harmony.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.560
So then, what do I do after that?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.340

School, for HIKI NÅŒ.
