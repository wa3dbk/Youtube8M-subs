Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.250
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the agitator screw kit on your washer.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.640
It’s a pretty easy job; all we’re going
to need is a flat blade screwdriver, and a

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.450
7/16ths socket with an extension.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.990
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.699
Now the first step in this repair will be
to remove the cover from the agitator.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:24.070
It’s just a friction fit so you may be able
to grasp it with your fingers but if not take

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.740
a flat blade screwdriver and there is an opening
there you will find to slide the blade into;

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.030
just gently pry up on it because we don’t
want to score the plastic and create a sharp

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.070
edge.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.560
Remove that cover.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:58.120
And we’ll see the head of that 7/16ths bolt.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:14.470
Take our extension, grasp the agitator with
one hand, loosen that bolt, and remove the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.500
old bolt.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:31.240
The new one comes with some thread locker
already on the threads and a rubber gasket;

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:49.250
make sure we don’t get anything cross threaded;
it should turn easily at first.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.930
Tighten it until the rubber gasket starts
to compress.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:05.609
We’ll replace our cover, snap it into place,
and our repair is complete.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.259
That’s just how easy it is to replace the
agitator screw kit on your washer.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.620
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
