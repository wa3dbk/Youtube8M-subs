00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.820
 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.850
hi I'm Kelsey mays for cars.com other
automakers have been riding this 3-row

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.320
crossover SUV bandwagon for quite some
time now and Nissan finally got on board

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.090
with the redesign pathfinder which drops
its predecessors truck-based

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.070
underpinnings for a more car-based
crossover platform now the pathfinder

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.000
does lose some of its hardcore off road
and towing capabilities it trades them

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.790
for more suburban soccer parent duties
will tell you how does all that the nose

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.989
up here on the pathfinder is very
identifiably nissan it recalls other

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.120
nissan SUV is like the xterra the the
large Armada SUV much more memorable

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.180
than the tail which is kind of boldness
and forgettable

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.980
he sounds familiar three and a half
liter v6 replaces last year's 4-liter v6

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.620
or an even larger v8 the smaller v6 as
well as the platform changes help save a

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.150
lot of weight between around 275 to
around 500 pounds depending on

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.960
comparable v6 trims that helps gas
mileage in a big way

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.049
epa numbers are up to 20 city 26 highway
now with front-wheel drive really good

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.920
compared to the class in epa combined
ratings about 122 miles per gallon

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.450
better than most of them unfortunately
you pay for that a little bit in the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.840
Pathfinders new continuously variable
automatic transmission

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.040
it dumps you in the lower revs as soon
as possible not particularly responsive

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.780
and the new low-rolling-resistance tires
again another fuel saver don't have a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.119
ton of grip plenty of room up front to
stretch out with your knees driver's

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.570
seat has good range of adjustments and
there's padded materials where they

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.649
count up here along the doors where your
arms and your elbows fault now

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.030
nissan has been known for making
gigantic glove compartment before and I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.369
think the pathfinder takes it to a new
level

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.500
this is the size of it let's show you
what you can fit inside a bottle of

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.500
water a laptop

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.149
more water even more water

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.840
the owners manual

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.410
and my shoe that's a lot of room

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.790
the second row reclines actually quite a
bit

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.780
it also slides backward and forward
about five and a half inches pretty

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.440
generous

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.489
unfortunately it's it's a little bit low
to the floor so adults might find their

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.660
legs uncomfortably elevated and anyone
who kind of puts their arms and elbows

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.560
up here is going to wish that Nissan
didn't cheap out on the rear door

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.849
materials now nissan does have a feature
called latch and glide in the pathfinder

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.370
similar to the latch and glide system in
the infiniti JX infinity is Nissan's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.360
luxury division

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.829
here's how it works you basically have a
child seat installed right here and you

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.349
still have third row access because the
child seat stays right here as you push

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.349
the seat forward obviously you wouldn't
want to do that with a kid in the seat

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.920
it gives you a little bit of a narrow
passageway to the third row

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.140
um not as big as if you'd actually
collapsed the second row forward which

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.690
it does right here if you don't have a
child in the second row seat gives you a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.220
bigger passageway that way

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.430
obviously you're really not going to
want to have a kid in the seat right now

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.060
behind the third row is about 16 cubic
feet of space which is pretty

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.760
competitive you fold the rear seats down

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.510
third row seats down you're looking at
about 80 cubic feet that's kind of at

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.510
the low end of this segment here for
maximum volume that's about what the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.880
ford explorer has the honda pilot has
about 87 cubic feet the toyota

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.120
highlander the outgoing Highlanders
about 95 cubic feet and that traverse

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.940
that's got more than a hundred and
fifteen cubic feet

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.569
so in terms of overall utility the
pathfinder is something of a mixed bag

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.489
but it has decent ride quality good gas
mileage and a number of upscale options

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.970
things like heated and cooled front
seats power tilt telescoping steering

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.010
column and a glass roof panel over the
second and third rows so far this year

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.970
it's selling nearly as well as the chevy
traverse so it's definitely gained

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.880
popularity for nissan and given its
strength

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.880
we think this is a car that should be on
any family shopping list

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.250
ok

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.900
yeah
