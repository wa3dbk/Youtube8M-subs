Cruise is set to 94 km/h which corresponds to 90 km/h on DriftBox.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:27.680
Cruise control can set the speed at intervals of 2 km/h.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.920
We're going to sixth gear manual transmission.

Air-conditioning is set to 22 degrees and the fan operates in first gear.

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:55.795
I have already drove 5.7 mile and average fuel consumption is 4 l/100km.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.680
After driving 11 km average fuel consumption is 4 l / 100km.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.360
This time the cruise control system is set to 144 km / h. In sixth gear the engine speed is 2500 rpm.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.240
After 11 kilometers trip average fuel consumption is 7.1 liters / 100km.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.520
Now let's test average fuel consumption on a cold engine

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.240
After the first kilometer, average fuel consumption is 12.2 l / 100km.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.320
After two kilometers average fuel consumption is 9.8 l / 100km.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.800
After three kilometers average fuel consumption is 8.3 l / 100km.
