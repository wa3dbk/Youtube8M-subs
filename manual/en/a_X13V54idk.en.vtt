00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.300
House training your puppy
requires more than a stack of

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.430
old newspapers.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.240
It calls for patience,
commitment, and above all,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.380
consistency.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.780
Hi, I'm Kathy Santo for
Iams with Howdini.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.330
And today we're going
to talk about how to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.940
house train your puppy.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.040
A trusting and consistent
relationship is fundamental to

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.760
successful house training.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.820
The more consistent you
are, the faster

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.460
your puppy will learn.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.700
House training a puppy can
take several weeks and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.760
sometimes longer with
smaller breeds.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.040
The first step to house training
your puppy is to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.530
establish a routine.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.170
Puppies did best on a regular
schedule, because it teaches

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.890
them that there are times
to eat, times to play,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.570
and times to potty.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.530
As a general rule, a puppy can
control his bladder about an

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.210
hour for every month of age.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.480
So if your puppy is only three
months old, he can probably

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.850
only hold it for about three
hours, if not less.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.870
Make sure to take him right out
after he wakes up, during

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.700
and after play time, and after
eating or drinking, because

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.200
these are times he's most
likely to have to go.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.040
If you work and are unable to
take your puppy outside as

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.640
often as needed, you could hire
a dog walker to give your

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.660
puppy his necessary breaks.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.510
I recommend picking a specific
bathroom spot outside and

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.170
always taking him there first
when he's on a leash.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.500
While your puppy is going, say
something like "go potty" so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.240
that you can eventually
use that phrase to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.540
remind him what to do.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.760
You should take him out for a
walk or play time after he's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.080
gone potty, or he might
just learn to hold

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.500
it to keep you outside.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.220
Reward your puppy every time
he goes potty outdoors with

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.670
praise or a treat, but make
sure to do so immediately

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.190
before he goes back
into the house.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.240
Rewarding correct behavior
is the best way

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.510
to teach your puppy.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.260
Be careful not to reward your
puppy until he's completely

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.300
finished, or he may forget to
finish up outside and then

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.900
have an accident inside.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.410
And remember, what goes into a
puppy on a schedule comes out

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.630
of a puppy on a schedule.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.330
So always take your puppy
out after feeding.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.770
Try picking up your puppy's
water dish about two and a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.680
half hours before bedtime, so he
won't have as much water to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.170
try and hold overnight.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.660
If you keep a consistent
schedule, your puppy could be

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.950
house trained by the time he's
five to six months old.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.440
But don't be discouraged if it
takes your puppy longer or has

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.680
an occasional accident.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.170
Many factors, including breed
of dog, consistency, and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.060
temperament, can contribute to
a longer training period.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.655
If you feel that there's little
to no progress, consult

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:21.730
with your veterinarian to be
sure that a medical issue,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.170
such as a bladder infection,
isn't the culprit.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.740
Supervision in the beginning
is critical.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.100
Exercise pens are extremely
helpful while house training.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.500
Keeping your puppy in a small
space within eyesight will

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.700
allow you to notice and react
when they start showing the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.470
signs of needing to eliminate.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.340
Those signs can be barking,
scratching at the door,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.160
squatting, sniffing,
or circling.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.540
If you're unable to monitor your
puppy, you can confine

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.770
him to an area small enough
so that he won't want to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.090
eliminate there.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.520
A space just large enough for
him to lay down with a couple

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.600
extra inches is just fine.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.520
Many people choose to combine
with a crate which can be very

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.770
helpful for house training
your young dog.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.610

Howdini, and I hope that

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.950
you've found this helpful as you
welcome your new addition

to your family.
