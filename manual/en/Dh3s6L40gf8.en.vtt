Hi, my name

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.218
is Lorna Li,

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:18.030
and I'm the host of

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.154
Entrepreneurs for a Change -

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:23.532
a web show featuring evolutionary entrepreneurs who are

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:28.531
 changing the world through business. 

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:35.220
Today I'm going to share with you how I set up call-forwarding to 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.785
forward calls from anywhere in the world to my local cellphone. If you're location-independent and traveling around the world with no fixed

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:44.725
address, then how do friends, family, clients, and business institutions stay

00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:48.223
in touch with you without skyrocketing your phone bill?

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:55.037
The two tools that are the foundation of my low-cost communication system are

00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:59.476
Google Voice and Skype.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:07.416
Here are three indispensable ways that Skype rocks my world: 

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:13.293
Number 1; I signed up for Premium Service through Skype that allows

00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:18.543
me to have a dedicated phone number with the area code of my choice. The reason why this rocks is because

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:26.481
any time I try to apply my Skype credits to call a phone, using Skype, on the

00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:34.359
caller ID of the person's cellphone, you will see a series of unrecognizable

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:40.234
numbers that is associated with your Skype profile trying to call a mobile

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:44.923
phone. More often than not, since people do not recognize that number, they

00:01:44.923 --> 00:01:50.926
will allow your call to go to voicemail. Since I have a dedicated Internet

00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:57.863
phone number through Skype, with a 415 area code, whenever I call my friends,

00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:04.052
or someone in the 415 area code, they will see the caller ID come up as a

00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:08.927
local call, and they will tend to answer that call more frequently than let

00:02:08.927 --> 00:02:15.616
it go to voicemail. This also allows my family and friends to be able to save

00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:20.181
that number to their address book as well, so that when that number comes

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:24.055
through, they can see that it's me calling from Skype. This also allows my

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:30.059
friends to make calls directly to my Skype number as well, and if I happen to

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.371
be online as well, the call will come through directly to me.

00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:41.372
Number 2; I use Skype to forward phone calls from anywhere

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:47.686
in the world to my local cellphone.

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:53.812
Only a few select people actually have my Skype telephone number, so I happen to use my Google Voice number as my

00:02:53.812 --> 00:03:04.251
official number for anything business-related; credit cards, banking, insurance - my Google Voice number

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:09.440
is my official number. If I get a phone call that's related to one of these

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.253
services or institutions, it pretty much almost always goes to voicemail.

00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:18.879
That voicemail message is transcribed into text, by Google Voice, and sent to

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:25.569
me, via email, along with the audio recording. This ensures that only the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.571
people who are really important to me can reach me directly by calling my

00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:36.947
Skype number which will then forward to me as a Skype call if I happen to be

00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:41.133
in front of my computer online, or forwarded directly to my cellphone.

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:47.384
The third way Skype totally rocks my world is that I use the Skype

00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:53.198
 mobile app to make phone calls to anywhere in the world directly

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:58.136
from my cellphone if there happens to be an Internet connection.

00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:03.014
Or I can make that phone call if there isn't an Internet connection, directly through the data service plan

00:04:03.014 --> 00:04:05.639
from my cellphone carrier.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.079
So if you happen to dream of living a location-independent lifestyle, or if

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.017
you're currently planning on going away on long-term travel but really need

00:04:14.017 --> 00:04:19.581
to stay in touch with people; friends and family, and clients and business

00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:25.708
contacts, then you should definitely consider becoming a power user of Skype.

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:29.018
