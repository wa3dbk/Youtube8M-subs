Hi, I'm Karina Fraley for Expert Village and
we are finishing up our headband here. Alright,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.750
so the elastic is in, it's sewn, it's nice
and flat so it's not going to twist on us.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.480
Okay, so now what you're going to do is take
each side and tuck it under using your thumb

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.349
and your index finger, so that's tucked under
and this edge is tucked under. This is going

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:30.699
to create a nice clean seam. So once you do
that, then you're going to put one, you're

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:39.780
going to feed one end into the other one.
Go ahead and straighten it out like that.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.120
Now we're going to go ahead and sew it and
we're going to be done with our headband.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:56.140
So go ahead and put it under like that. Put
your foot down. This is kind of a thick layer

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.320
because it's a couple layers of elastic, and
then a couple layers of fabric so go slow

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.860
with your machine. You don't want your needle
to break. If you're using any sort of a pile

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.200
or any thicker fabric, you may want to go
ahead and use a thicker needle, but this is

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.899
fine for now. So go ahead and start and do
a couple of back stitches to create the knot

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.670
and then just go right along the seam, we
want it to be nice and clean and catch both

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.740
ends. When you get to the end, you're going
to want to go ahead and do a back stitch to

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:38.500
create your knot and then we're going to cut
it. Go ahead and take your loose threads and

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.829
cut them, all up like that. Again this is
a quick and fun little project, this is great

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.890
if you have a little girl or if you like to
wear headbands yourself, you can match them

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.030
to outfits, you can get creative, you can
make them for different holidays. It really

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.110
is a fun little project and there you go as
you can see here is the headband and it's

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.770
going to make any little girl very happy.
