00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:01.634
The President:
I've reached out

00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:06.106
to President Hollande
of France and hope

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.408
to have the opportunity
to talk to him today.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:11.444
But I thought it was
appropriate for me to express

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.848
my deepest sympathies
to the people of Paris

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.384
and the people of
France for the terrible

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:22.222
terrorist attack that
took place earlier today.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:28.762
I think that all of us
recognize that France

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:33.333
is one of our oldest allies,
our strongest allies.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:40.140
They have been with us at
every moment when we've --

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.210
from 9/11 on, in dealing
with some of the terrorist

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.614
organizations around the
world that threaten us.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:52.719
For us to see the kind of
cowardly evil attacks that

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.558
took place today I think
reinforces once again

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.927
why it's so important for
us to stand in solidarity

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:04.864
with them, just as they
stand in solidarity with us.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:11.504
The fact that this was
an attack on journalists,

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.674
attack on our free press,
also underscores the degree

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:18.244
to which these terrorists
fear freedom --

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.448
of speech and freedom
of the press.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.684
But the one thing that
I'm very confident about

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:28.254
is that the values that we
share with the French people,

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.725
a belief -- a universal
belief in the freedom

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:39.799
of expression, is something
that can't be silenced

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.536
because of the senseless
violence of the few.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.773
And so our counterterrorism
cooperation

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:50.076
with France is excellent.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:52.278
We will provide them
with every bit

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:56.683
of assistance that we
can going forward.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.084
I think it's going to
be important for

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:02.188
us to make sure that we
recognize these kinds

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:08.228
of attacks can happen
anywhere in the world.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.096
And one of the things
I'll be discussing with

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.831
Secretary Kerry today
is to make sure that

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.467
we remain vigilant
not just with respect

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.936
to Americans
living in Paris,

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:22.208
but Americans living in
Europe and in the Middle East

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.910
and other parts of the
world, and making sure

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.347
that we stay vigilant in
trying to protect them --

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.816
and to hunt down and
bring the perpetrators

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.784
of this specific act to
justice, and to roll

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:36.456
up the networks that
help to advance these

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:38.191
kinds of plots.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:41.060
In the end, though, the
most important thing

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.297
I want to say is that our
thoughts and prayers are

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:47.400
with the families of
those who've been lost

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.836
in France, and with
the people of Paris

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.939
and the people of France.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:59.812
What that beautiful city
represents -- the culture

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:08.788
and the civilization that
is so central to our

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:12.258
imaginations -- that's
going to endure.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:16.162
And those who carry out
senseless attacks against

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:20.900
innocent civilians, ultimately
they'll be forgotten.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.703
And we will stand with
the people of France

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.506
through this very,
very difficult time.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.907
Thank you very
much, everybody.
