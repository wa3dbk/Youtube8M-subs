Joe: I apologize in advance if my next sentence
results in any loss of sleep for all you urban-dwelling

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.019
city slickers out there, but I want to provide
you with a fair warning. Okay, here goes – Big

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.009
cities are making spiders bigger. &nbsp;No no&nbsp;
no, don’t go, please,&nbsp; the science behind

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.650
it is actually really interesting. Just stick
with me…

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.829
&nbsp;
So, a lady by the name of Elizabeth Lowe from

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.689
the University of Sydney had her curiosity
spot stimulated when she noticed that Golden

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.140
Orb weaver spiders appeared larger in big
Australian cities.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.840
&nbsp;
So, she gathered up 222 of the really fascinating,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.670
heebie-jeebie inducing, but harmless Orb Weavers,
some from the wild and some from around city

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.589
parks, and measured their size relative to
their environment. The correlation she discovered

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.629
was the more concrete surrounding the spider,
and the further away from bushland and leaf

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.719
litter, the larger the spider.&nbsp; Which explains
why that guy that we call “The Spider”

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.230
has been virtually unbeatable at the downtown
basketball court… it’s not just because

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.230
he played in junior college, it’s because
he’s a giant frickin’ spider. No no no…come

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.210
back…come back. I’m sorry, it was a stupid
joke. I won’t do it again.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.440
&nbsp;
Okay, so urbanization probably contributes

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.230
to these super-shredder spiders in a number
of ways.&nbsp; First of all, according to Lowe,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.250
"It's probably because of the&nbsp;urban heat-island
effect&nbsp;and prey availability. Most invertebrates

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.040
will grow to larger sizes if they are warmer.
They are very sensitive to temperatures."

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.650
&nbsp;
But heat is a double edge sword with a tipping

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.110
point.&nbsp; Global warming might result in bigger
spiders, but if it gets too hot, it’s sphchch.&nbsp;

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.890
Other contributing factors are lights shining
at light that attract prey as well the fact

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.450
the insects tend to thrive in small urban
parks, so food is easy to come by so energy

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.120
is redirected into growth. &nbsp;Out in the bush,
the Orb spiders weighed an average of 0.5

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.540
grams, but in the concrete jungle, that average
skyrocketed up to 1.5 grams. That’s a significant

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.630
increase, right? And she suspects this hulking
out routine is also happening to other spiders,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.600
not just in Australia, but all over the world.
So no one is safe.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.270
&nbsp;
And here’s an unexpected secondary finding

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.170
Lowe discovered, spiders also seem to increase
in size in wealthier areas… and they don’t

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.729
know why, but you know the saying, mo money,
mo big ass spiders.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.880
&nbsp;
Urbanization is usually detrimental to our

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.500
animal friends as it eradicates vegetation
and resources and generally molests the hell

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.670
out of the environment, but some animals are
urbanization opportunists, including pigeons,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.130
raccoons, rats, hipsters, and now spiders.
&nbsp;

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.320
So, tell me in the comments how you guys feel
after hearing about these findings. I tell

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.520
you one thing, if definitely explains why
Toby McGuire had such a big head after playing

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.280
spider man in three movies, am I right? Ahhh
no, no no no… don’t go…come on… please…

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.819
really, that was the line…no wait, I’m
sorry, I’m sorry… look, we do the news

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.819
with a comedy spin, but…ah come on…OKAY,
just let me say one more thing before you

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.450
go…Like and subscribe…ahahahahah. SOURCEFED.
