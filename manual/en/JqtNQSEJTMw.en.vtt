00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.169
Before you ask, Alt+0198.

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.230
Now that we’ve got our typographical issues
out of the way, it’s time for more indie

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.300
bullet hell action.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.300
There is, after all, a grand tradition of
indie shooters of this nature.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.040
Those of you familiar with this linage probably
recognize this reference, then.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.830
Those of you familiar with other, more contemporary
side-scrolling shooters will probably enjoy

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.890
this Otomedius reference.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.110
And then there’s a bit of Strong Bad-ism,
just for the absolute hell of it.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.100
Æternum brings a quality gameplay experience
to the table, and does it in a highly-referential,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.290
tongue-in-cheek style.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.880
That isn’t above a bit of doubletalk.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.739
Or the constantly applied trope that anyone
you interact with, no matter how benign or

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.410
friendly, will swiftly challenge you to the
death and begin to bloom flowers of bright,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.360
technicolor danger.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.660
The core of the gameplay is a well-built horizontal
shooter full of dynamic boss battles and,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.179
for whatever reason, cups full of cats and
corgis piloting spaceships.

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.679
You’ve only got three buttons to worry about,
a shoot button, a shield button, and a “focus”

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.899
trigger that tightens your firing pattern
and slows your movement speed.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.460
This focus trigger also reveals your heart
(read: hitbox), and makes it easier to rack

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.899
up bonuses by being grazed by oncoming fire.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.920
By shooting down enemy craft, you can collect
demonic energy - because if there’s a cute

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.790
girl in a bullet hell shooter, she’s probably
a demon or some other magical being - which

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.039
gradually increases your firepower, or can
be spent to conjure shields to offer a temporary

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.619
respite from the madness coming at you.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.399
You don’t get screen-clearing bombs like
you might in other games; instead, you have

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.450
to hunt for your friend Macy Guffin the hard
way, with only a small patch of safety on

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.450
occasion.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.280
And sometimes, you might not even have that.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.920
You’ve probably noted that I’m not actually
firing back at this giant flying squid.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.849
If you’d prefer to practice your bullet-slaloming,
there’s a pacifist mode alongside four difficulties

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.849
of the main game.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.300
Without any semblance of offense, though,
you’ll have to simply wait out each of the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.599
bosses as they go through their various flavors
of bullet choreography.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.290
You don’t need a huge budget to create a
decent shooter; the most important factors

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.510
seem to be attention to detail, accuracy of
controls, and a knowledge and respect of the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.849
genre... of course, the willingness and ability
to just throw a couple wrenches at the entire

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.959
process itself is more than welcome as well.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.969
Sure, it seems to be just another retro-styled,
pixel-art-heavy SHMUP with a faux-8-bit soundtrack,

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.300
and that might not be your thing.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.739
But it’s certainly my thing.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.799
Or it will be, after I lose a couple more
sleepless evenings to it.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.800
I spent a dollar, and all I got was this insomnia.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.319
Lovely.
