[MUSIC]

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:15.180
(sound of footsteps)

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.380
Maybe it's the power trying to come back on?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.080
(thunder, crashing)

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.160
(rooster crowing)

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.980
Not as scary, but scientifically speaking,
it makes sense.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.649
The Jurassic Park movies are built around
a dream: Using science, humans could one day

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.690
walk among the giant reptiles that used to
rule the Earth.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.270
(roar)

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.270
Spoiler alert: We already do. Thanks to science,
we know our planet is home to 10,000 or so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.519
species of living dinosaurs. We just call
them birds.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:03.890
(roar)

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.550
How do we know this is true? Let’s leave
the nest, and bring birds’ place on the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.290
tree of life into view.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.970
Everything on Earth with this sort of four-limbed,
belly in the front, spine in the back,head

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.720
on top arrangement is a tetrapod. Last year
we did a whole series on why tetrapod bodies

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.270
are shaped this way, so check that out here
or down in the description.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.810
Now, starting with a common ancestor of all
tetrapods, amphibians branched off first,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.860
then us mammals, followed by turtles, lizards
and snakes, and then the group we call archosaurs,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.800
which contains crocodilians, pterosaurs, and
finally dinosaurs. Birds are in here.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.820
Zoom in on the dinosaurs and we start to see
some familiar faces from John Hammond’s

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.530
island. There’s a lot there, but the important
part is that the birds we know today didn’t

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.890
branch off until way up here.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.990
I don’t know about you, but when I look
at a cassowary, I don’t need any convincing

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.810
that birds are dinosaurs, but let’s assemble
the evidence anyway.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.140
When most of us think of dinosaurs, we think
of bones. By comparing the skeletons of things

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.900
that are very dinosaur-ish to things that
are very bird-ish to the sort of dino-bird-ish

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.410
things in between, well, you’re about to
look at chickens in a very different way.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.570
The most famous dinobird is our friend Archaeopteryx.
Its fossils give us a look at the transition

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.910
between scaly-reptiles and birdy-birds, because
they share features from both.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.780
Like birds, its forelimbs were enlarged like
wings, its pubic bone pointed toward its tail,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.240
along with one of its toes, and it had fused
clavicles. That’s right, just like your

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.370
Thanksgiving turkey, dinos from T. rex to
Archaeopteryx had wishbones.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.140
Now in the reptile column, these dinobirds
had long tails, ribs around their belly, claws

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.420
on their fingers, and teeth. I’m so glad
birds don’t have teeth anymore. Nightmare

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.490
fuel.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.550
Dinosaurs became pretty front-heavy as their
forelimbs got bigger, and later as they lost

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.620
their tails, so in order to not topple over
they adopted a sort of crouching posture.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.870
We see it in birds from sparrows to ostriches
today.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.140
In one of the most hilarious experiments ever
recorded, scientists attached prosthetic tails

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.100
to chickens and sure enough, with the added
weight in back, they adopted a more dino-like

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.810
walk.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.160
We think that how birds move their wings during
flight even matches how Velociraptors and

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.069
their relatives would snap their forelimbs
out to grab prey, but don’t worry, despite

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.540
what the movies say, they were only about
knee-high.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.780
Oh, and those clever girls should have been
covered in feathers!

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.630
Scientists have unearthed dozens of fossils
showing evidence of feathered dinosaurs, but

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.690
for some reason Jurassic Park and other dino
movies have a strict no-plumage policy.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.290
Feather forms ranged from simple quills with
just a few branches, like what we see in baby

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.690
birds, to full-fledged fabulous feathers.
Some fossil feathers even tell us what color

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.849
they might have been, awww, so fluffy!!

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.700
We’re not quite sure when birds took to
the air, but extinct dinosaurs were were too

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.470
heavy to have used feathers for flight. They
probably served other colorful purposes instead.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.840
(crash)

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.560
Birds today are tetrachromats, meaning they
have four color receptors compared to our

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.970
three. Many of them can see down in the ultraviolet
range, meaning they see colored plumage, like

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.940
these beautiful painted buntings, in ways
that we can’t even imagine.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.870
Today, birds use that exotic plumage and their
ultra-vision to put on some pretty amazing

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.190
mating rituals.
Extinct dinosaurs definitely had feathers,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.820
and they probably shared this tetrachromacy,
so what’s to say that we wouldn’t find

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.600
similar shows at Jurassic Park?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.560
In a previous video, I talked about how the
T. rex roar in Jurassic park was made from

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.780
a mixture of a baby elephant, a tiger, and
an alligator, but what did dinosaurs really

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.750
sound like? Birds today create their symphonies
using an organ called a syrinx, and their

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.410
brains have evolved specially to create and
decode those complex songs.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.630
Unfortunately, dinosaurs lacked both of these
adaptations. So while we couldn’t teach

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.650
a dinosaur to talk like a parrot, it’s likely
that they made some interesting noises.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.070
The large hollow crest of Parasaurolophus
could have been used as a sort of resonator.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.770
Scientists from Sandia Labs reconstructed
what that might have sounded like.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.940
(horn playing)

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.340
Why did birds survive as the rest of their
reptilian cousins drifted off into the great

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.169
fossil pit in the sky? Why don’t we have
T. rex-sized parrots?

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.110
Well, after the meteor strike in the Yucatan,
plants became more scarce, and without enough

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.870
food, big-bodied herbivores went extinct along
with the large carnivores that ate them. But

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.430
smaller meat-eating dinosaurs, the same lineages
that led to birds, were able to survive with

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.380
smaller bodies and on less food.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.260
"Life… uh, finds a way"

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.020
From fossil to feathers, it’s clear that
birds make their nest in the tree of life

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.740
right next to creatures that haven’t walked
the Earth for 65 million years. They aren’t

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.320
relatives of dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.140
Stay curious.
