00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.300
Ordering Rational Numbers

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.260
When ordering rational numbers that aren't in the same form,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.300
start by converting them all to the same form.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.240
Let's practice with this set of numbers here.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.580
We're going to order this set of numbers from
least to greatest.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.800
I'm going to start by converting all of these
numbers into decimals.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.060
One fourth.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.280
To convert a fraction to a decimal, we divide
our numerator by our denominator.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.180
1 divided by 4

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.700
is 0.25.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.180
29%.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.920
To convert a percent to a decimal,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.320
divide by one hundred, or simply move the decimal two places to the left.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.560
That is 0.29.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.400
Our next number is already in decimal form,
so I'll just bring it down.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.940
-0.8.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.820
The square root of 16 is 4, since 4 times
4 is 16.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.940
-2 cubed means the opposite of 2 times 2 times
2.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.580
2 times itself 3 times.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.700
2 times 2 is 4.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.980
4 times 2 is 8.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.980
The opposite of 8 is -8.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.860
Finally, we have the absolute value of -5.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.300
Absolute value is the distance from zero.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.540
-5 is five places from zero.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.020
The absolute value of -5 is 5.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.400
Now that they're all in the same form, we
can order them from least to greatest.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.600
We're going to start with our negative numbers,
since those are smaller than our positive numbers.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.860
Remember that the larger the negative, the
smaller the number is.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.460
-8 is a much bigger number, or- it's a bigger negative,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.820
therefore it's a smaller number. -8 would be our smallest number.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.220
Starting with -8,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.380
after -8 would be our next
negative number, -0.8.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.920
Then, we move to our positive numbers.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.760
Looking at our positive numbers, we're going
to start by looking at our whole numbers

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.620
(our whole number values).

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.440
Zero is our smallest whole number value, which
means one of these numbers will come next.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.540
If you look at the 10ths place, the 10ths
place is also the same.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.750
Then, we've got to go one place further and look at the hundredths place to see which number would be next.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.440
This 0.25, the 5 is smaller than the 9, so
0.25 would be our next biggest number

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.000
followed by 0.29.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.160
Then, we have our other two whole numbers,
4 and 5.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.980
4 would be next followed by 5.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.260
The last thing we need to do is to put these
numbers back in their original form.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.680
-8 wasn't the number we were given.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.500
That number was -2 cubed.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.600
We're going to rewrite it as -2 cubed

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.580
followed
by -0.8, which is the original form.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.140
Then, we had 0.25, which was originally 1/4.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.240
After that, we had 0.29, which was originally
29%.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.140
Following that, we had 4,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.940
and four was originally
the square root of 16.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.920
Finally, we have 5,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.960
and 5 was originally the
absolute value of -5.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.980
Now we've ordered our numbers from least to
greatest.
