Welcome to How To Cook That. I am Ann Reardon.
Today we are going to make some chocolate

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.150
peanut butter indulgence cupcakes.
Firstly we will make our chocolate ganache

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.559
frosting because that needs time to firm up.
To make your ganache all you need to do is

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.099
place your chocolate in a bowl, heat your
cream until it boils and then pour the cream

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.599
over the chocolate.
For all the recipe quantities that you need

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.890
for this ganache and also for the chocolate
cake just click on the link in the description

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.890

Once your cream has sat on your chocolate

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.810
for a couple of minutes it will haev started
to melt the chocolate. And you can just start

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.150
to stir that. At first it looks like it's
not going to combine but just keep stirring

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.900
and then you'll get a nice smooth chocolatey
mixture.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.980
I like to add a spoonful of butter into that
when I'm using it on cupcakes and just again

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.300
stir that in until it's melted.
And then put that to one side. If you are

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.190
using it the next day you can just leave it
on the bench top to set up, but if you are

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790
needing it quicker than that then just put
it in the fridge to firm up.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.430
Leave the ganache in the fridge to firm.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.870
To make you cupcakes you need to melt your
chocolate and your butter in a saucepan over

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.619
low heat or you can do that in the microwave
just until they're melted. Then pour that

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.909
into a bowl and add your sugar. Now just feel
your mixture with your finger if it is hot

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.009
allow it to cool and if it is only just warm
that's fine. You can add all the eggs at once

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.859
and mix it in.
Sift your flour, cocoa powder and baking powder

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.780
into the mixture and using a whisk mix well
until you have a smooth chocolatey batter.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.450
To make it easier to pour into your cupcake
wrappers cleanly I like to put it into a jug.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.549
And then pour it in and use a spoon to catch
the drips as you move to the next cupcake

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.569
wrapper and fill that one as well.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.630
Place them in the oven until a knife inserted
into the middle comes out clean then allow

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.409
to cool completely.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.009
Using a serrated knife cut out a small indent
in the centre of each cupcake.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.119
And then take a spoonful of peanut butter
and put it into each hole.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.389
Put your ganache in a ziplock bag, cut the
corner off it and pipe a swirl of ganache

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.139
on top.

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:07.649
If your ganache has been in the fridge it
may be too firm just leave it at room temperature

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.780
just to soften up.
Make sure you sprinkle some crushed peanuts

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.720
on top to identify them for people with allergies.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.880
And they you can bite into the smooth chocolate
ganache and get a hit of peanut butter followed

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.570
by the beautiful moist chocolate cake.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.110
