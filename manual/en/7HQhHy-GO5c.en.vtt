00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.100
Hello, everyone!

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.400
Welcome to Nyonya Cooking!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.000
Today, I'm presenting another 'nyonya' dish

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.800
which is called 'ayam pongteh'

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is a speciality of the 'nyonya peranakan'

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.800
which is usually found in Malacca, my birth place

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.400
So, let me show you how to prepare this dish

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.800
I'll start with the ingredients

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.400
which you are familiar with

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.800
250 grams of chicken, a potato,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.200
5 cloves of garlic, 3 shallots

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.800
If you do not have shallots,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you may use 1 big onion

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.600
These are fried bean curds,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.200
which had been cut into halves

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.800
1 stick of cinnamon, star anise

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.400
and the special ingredient, palm sugar

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.000
It comes in a cylindrical block like this

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.000
It's also called 'gula melaka'

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.000
I've shredded it finely over here

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.400
You'll need about 2 tablespoonsful of 'gula melaka'

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.200
To make the sauce,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.400
you'll need thick soya sauce, light soya sauce,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.200
'taucu' or also known as fermented bean paste

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.800
and 200 ml of water

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.200
I found this garlic crusher in Ikea

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.500
All you need to do is put in a clove of garlic

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.000
and press the level down

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.800
The garlic would be finely crushed

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.700
This saves time and it's very simple to use

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.000
After crushing the garlic,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000
mince the shallots finely

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.000
or crush them using the garlic crusher

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.200
Then, cut the potatoes into bite pieces

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.000
Heat up a pan with a bit of oil

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.400
Add in the onions and garlic

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.800
Saute till fragrant

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.000
Then, add in 2 tablespoonsful of 'taucu',

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.400
1 tablespoonful of soya sauce

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.200
and 1 tablespoonful of dark soya sauce

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.400
Stir quickly and evenly

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.400
Then, add the chicken pieces

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.200
Mix evenly before adding the water

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.000
Then, cook at high heat

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200
When it starts to boil,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.400
add in the potatoes

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.200
and the rest of the ingredients

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600
To prevent the dish from sticking to the pan,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.000
stir the dish from time to time

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800
After 30 minutes, the gravy should thickened

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200
and you may dish it out

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.460
However, I cooked mine for about an hour

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.400
as I like the potatoes to be softer

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.000
It's up to your preference

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.000
This dish is usually cooked with pork

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.000
and is known as 'babi pongteh'

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200
However, I prefer the chicken version of it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.600
It is best served with steaming white rice

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.600
So, tell me your opinion

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.200
after trying this recipe

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.000
As always, 'Happy Cooking!'
