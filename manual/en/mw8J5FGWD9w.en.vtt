00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.780
today

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.809
we will  explain the rules that most casinos
follow to set their hands in Pai Gow 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.990
But before we get to the strategy there's
one important thing

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.130
you need to know.  Never

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.449
bet the bonus. That's because the house
edge on the bonus

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.619
is huge compared to the main bet 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.130
the rest of Pai Gow strategy has to do with how you set your hand

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.780
if your hand is completely unconnected

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.440
play your highest card in your five card
hand and your second and third highest

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.969
cards

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.379
as your two card hand. If you only have one pair

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.500
Play the pair in your high hand and your
two other highest cards

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.530
in your low hand. Most of the tricky spots in Pai Gow

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.239
are deciding whether to split two pairs.
First

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.789
think of all the pair's as divided into
three categories: Deuces through sixes are low

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.260
seven through tens are medium

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.640
and Jacks through aces are high

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.290
based on those groups you should always
split up two pair 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.530
in the following spots.  if you have a
pair of aces

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.110
If you have two high pairs

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.040
if you have one high pair

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.780
and one medium pair.  Unless you have an ace in your hand you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.080
should also split two pair if you have two medium pair

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.970
or if you have one high pair

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.970
and one low pair and finally unless you
have an ace or a king 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.410
you should always split two pairs if you
have one medium pair and one low pair

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.410
or too low pairs

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.329
you should always play three of a kind
in your high hand

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.310
unless you have three aces then play a pair of aces in your high hand and ace

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.530
high in your low hand. When you have a
full house

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.640
always play the pair in your two card hand and three of a kind in your high hand

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.330
unless you also have a second pair in
which case play the higher of

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.989
the two pairs in your low hand. Always play
straights and flushes

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.130
in your high hand, unless you also have two pair then split them

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.349
according to the rules we covered before.
Always split quads into two pairs

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.099
if you have four jacks or above. If you have four of a kind sixes or lower

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.580
keep them together

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.870
if you have four of a kind seven through tens

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.870
only keep them together if you also have
an ace.If you have five aces using the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.470
Joker

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.840
always split them, unless you also have a pair of kings

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.830
in which case play all five aces in your high hand

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.830
