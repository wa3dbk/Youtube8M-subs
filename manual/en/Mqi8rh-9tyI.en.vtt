00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.950
Tips for samba dancing.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.780
We are going to talk about three.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.240
One is posture, how to have a nice posture
while doing your samba steps.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.460
First of all, you want to make sure that your
knees are soft.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.050
That's going to take the pressure off your
lower back, and that's going to keep your

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.910
hips nice and neutral.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.599
Also, that soft knee is going to give you
the bouncing movement, and that's the number

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.059
two.

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.260
Having that soft knee is going to give you
the bouncing movement that we do use with

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.489
the basic samba steps, the basic footwork.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:46.530
Posture, it is important to have your chest
nice and open, so really lift it up.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.521
Connect it with the abdominals.

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:55.750
Roll the shoulders all the way back and down
so you have a nice, nice, nice long neck and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.569
you have a nice, wide chest keeping it all
the way down.

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.550
The third tip that we are going to talk about
is breathing, how to breathe during your basic

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.630
samba step.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.680
You do not want to go all of the sudden out
of breath, and can't breathe and can no longer

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680
dance.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.690
So, just make sure you're breathing in and
out through the whole time, right.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.050
Remember to never hold your breath, because
if you do then you're just going to have to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.470
let it go out your mouth.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.830
You want to have nice and easy small breaths
in and out the whole time.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.460
One of the most complete breaths is the diaphragm
breath.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.330
It's all the way in here into your belly.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.350
So if you fill with air and exhale and get
the air out that's going to give you the nice

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.110
support that you need to keep up with your
intricate samba steps without running out

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.110
of breath.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.750
So, three tips.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.400
Posture is shoulders back and down, nice and
long neck, hips nice and neutral, and knees

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.540
soft.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.900
Two: small, soft knees bouncing as you do
your samba step.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.699
Three: breathe through the whole time.
