00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.540
hello YouTube. Mikeycal here. And this is
video number nine in my series on

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.710
utilizing blender

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.030
as a video editor. Now, in the previous
video, I showed you how to use your

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.090
Timeline to quickly navigate

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.730
around your video project. And today I
wanna talk about

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.800
the bottom most part of the timeline
window,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.840
which is our playback controls.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.920
Now, we can go down here and take a look
at them and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.300
I think most if you probably figured out
how they work

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.469
in general. You have the forward playback -
which is this button right here.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.190
And we have the backward playback - which
is this button right here.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.700
And then you have these

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.020
2 buttons that will take you to the
beginning

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.180
of frame range, and the ending

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.500
of our frame range. And these little
buttons

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.340
that are in between, that you would think
are fast forward, are

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.620
actually not fast forward buttons but
instead they're used for our keyframing

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.340
which is something that we haven't got
around to talking about yet, but we will

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.250
talk about that.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.939
So, just remember that you have your forward
playback,  backward playback,

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.340
and you could jump back and forth
between the beginning and the ending

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.049
of your frame ranges. Now, the things I
need to explain to you guys that I've

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:16.830
noticed

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.950
thats many people have had an issue with
is, some people don't understand

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.979
that when they're seeing the frame rate,
up in this corner,

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.220
they don't understand that that doesn't
represent the final frame rate

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.390
that they will get in the final rendered
video. Now, let me actually demonstrate

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.430
that to you by hitting the play button
down here.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.280
And we're going to look up here and we can see there are
frame rate is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.829
fluctuating. Now, you can see that this
video is actually supposed to be 24

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.299
frames per second, but look

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.439
its going down to twenty. It's going up

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.180
up and over 24 frames per second.
Why is it doing that?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.390
Well, we don't have the luxury of being
able to render every frame perfectly

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.240
in real time. When we hit the render
button, or the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.490
animation button here to render our
final video,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.819
the computer can take its time
rendering the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.620
scene perfectly and synchronizing
it perfectly to the audio.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.970
But when we're watching this in real time, in
the preview window,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.040
it's just trying to give us an example
of how it's gonna look as fast as it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.170
possibly can. But

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.620
obviously does not have the capability
to render everything perfectly.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.160
So what it's doing is it's dropping the
frames

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.349
of the preview and making sure

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.590
that we stay synchronized with audio.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.319
So that we can do our edit without any
issues. So,

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.670
we don't really need to be able to see
the full frame rate of the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.530
video in order to see how to edit things.
So that's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.560
all I really wanna tell you guys about
the frame rate in the preview window.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.599
Just don't let that

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.269
confuse you. It has nothing to do with
the final frame rate. The final frame

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.060
rate, when you hit the animation button,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.930
will be a static 24 frames per second, in
this case, or whatever you have in this

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.860
frame rate drop down box.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.340
So I think that clarifies that... The other
thing I wanna show you guys is

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.050
there are two ways that, when you're
playing your preview back,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.250
you can improve the frame rate or you can
cause it to jump up.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.420
And you can notice... You might have noticed
right now that

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.340
my frame rate is actually really low.
It's been playing for awhile and the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.950
computer is really falling behind in
trying to keep up

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.000
and and create each frame. So it's
dropping down to a very low number so it can

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.090
still stay synchronized audio.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.900
But there's two things we can do, and
they both revolve around this button.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.269
Down here we have refresh
sequencer button.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.099
And, let me pause the video quickly,
whenever I click this refresh sequencer

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.670
button,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.010
it tells blender: stop whatever you're
doing.If you're

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.739
prerendering, some frames up ahead, stop.

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.330
I want you to start from the frame that
my green line is at.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.569
And let's view that by actually hovering
over and hitting home

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.959
So, I want you to start at this frame, and I
want you to start prerendering from

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.099
there right now.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.530
Because I'm getting ready to actually start playing this. So, here we go. Lets click the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.930
Refresh sequencer button.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.269
And now let's hit play again. And watch as
the frame rate jumps back up

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.490
to what we want to be.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.610
As you remember it was much lower the
longer we played.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.810
So that's one way that you can do it. Now
there's another thing you can actually

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.699
do

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.790
Let's pause it again. Now you'll notice if
you right click

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.310
on your video strip, and you go over to
the Properties window.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.130
There's an option over here called MPEG Preseek.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.100
Now  it's set to 0 by default here. I notice
with some videos, it seems to be set to 25

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.300
but, for this one, it's set to 0. But I turn it
all the way up to the max - which is 50.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.979
And it appears that, whenever you do this,
and then you go and click Refresh

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.419
sequencer,

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.620
that it improves the quality I love to
play back significantly. So

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.720
I turn this 50, and then I hit refresh
sequencer.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.289
And then I hit play. And it's staying towards
the 24

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.240
much more than it was - it's not fluctuating as
much.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.180
So that's that's the other way that you
can actually greatly improve the preview

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.610
playback.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.080
Now, I think that pretty much clarifies

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.840
the most important things about the
playback. And I'll see you guys

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.530
in the next video.
