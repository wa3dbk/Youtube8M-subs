00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.650
Time and tradition. It’s part of what Kansas
bird hunting is all about. Paul Bryan, Pratt

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.400
County farmer and longtime hunter, opens his
home to family and friends for the annual

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.420
pheasant opener. And it’s easy to see how
hunting benefits from this annual homecoming.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.430
“The opening day of pheasant season has
always been kind of a tradition in our family.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:37.310
We have friends coming in from Texas, and
some of them have been coming in, this will

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.420
be 43 years, this year, that we’ve been
hunting together.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.150
“I’m hunting on our family farm. My grandparents
came here in 1887, and this is where I live.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:58.190
It’s been in our family all of those years.
We have about 1400 acres here in Pratt County.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.830
“Ever since I can remember as a child, I
couldn’t hardly wait to go hunting the next

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.120
day. My first hunt was when I was seven years
old. My dad took me along.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.510
“This will be like 61 years I’ve been
going hunting, tomorrow, and I haven’t missed

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.350
only one year when I was gone in the service,
I missed opening season one year.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.360
“We’ve been trying to bring our children
up this way too, so they pass it on, you know.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.310
My son, I started him when he was about seven
years old, going hunting.”

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.540
(Shane) “I got my first shotgun, it was
a Christmas present, but he gave it to me

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.150
a little early, just so I could have it in
time for pheasant season. I remember that

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.040
pretty well.
“I’m away now. I grew up here hunting,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.729
but I live in the city. But I always enjoy
this time of year, getting to come back, getting

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.610
my time away. Even though I get to shoot,
it’s still part of the fun coming home,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.720
seeing all of my friends. I brought one of
my friends home with me this year. He’s

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.149
never been hunting before. I think he’s
going to enjoy it, and be something he does

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.310
for the rest of his life, I bet.”
(Dillon)“A few weeks ago I actually came

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.340
down to Pratt County and got my hunter safety
so I could go hunting with Shane and his family…

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.299
I’m really excited to get out there and
go hunting for my first time. They talk about

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.810
it so much, and there’s this excitement
in the air about it. It seems like, this is

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.779
something their family really enjoys, and
I’d really like to start something like

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:41.409
that. Be able to have a tradition to come
back and do year after year. I’m really

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.219
excited and happy that I get to be here this
week.”

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:52.980
(Paul)“We’ve had good years and bad years,
and some years we’ve had very good luck.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.620
Most always we get our limit a lot of the
time, and sometimes it’s not quite that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.099
good. But we walk a lot of miles in a day’s
time, and it seems like that really pays off,

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.060
and kind of keeping track where the birds
are helps a lot.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.310
“It’s always a great time to get back.
Just the fellowship of getting back together,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:29.090
and hunting is probably secondary to that,
meeting good friends. But we all enjoy hunting,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.680
and we try to keep it up and pass it on to
our next generation.”

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.489
So how did this year’s opener go?
(Shane)“We killed about 21 birds yesterday.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.699
It was a fun day. Dillon got to shoot a few,
and we had a good experience and a good time

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.939
hunting, so, we’re looking forward to it
today again. We’ll see what we can do.”

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.530
(Dillon)“It’s the second day of the season,
and we’ve been walking fields all day yesterday

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.949
and today. I got a chance to fire at some
birds and drop a few. Shane’s got the dogs

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.159
out here, and he’s kind of teaching me some
things, and I’m learning the ropes. And

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:09.129
I hope to keep on hunting, and maybe I’ll
come back next year if he invites me again.”

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:15.739
Grow your own tradition. Get involved in Kansas
bird hunting. Quail and pheasant seasons last

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:24.600
until January 31, 2011. Birds, and the good
times of shared experiences, are waiting.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.140
I’m Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife and Parks.
