00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.060
Bonjour mes Gourmands,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.819
I lo-oh-ove dumplings! In general, they're
a very simple dish, you stuff filling into

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.160
some wrappers and then you either cook it
in plain water or you fry it! Yet, it's also

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.910
so versatile, you can make so many variations
simply by changing the ingredients and it

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.590
will have a whole different taste to it! Today
I'm showing you dumplings with the most basic

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.560
ingredients and in two styles: 水饺 shui
jiao, which are boilt in water - and 锅贴

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.150
guo tie, fragrant pan-fried pot stickers.
Now it does take a little bit of time to make

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.360
them if you're making them only by yourself,
but please believe me when I say it's well

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.770
worth the effort!
So let's see how they're done!

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.840
150g Minced meat (pork preferred)
4 Shiitake Mushrooms, finely minced/diced

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.380
1 bunch of spring onion
1 tbs of Shaoxing Rice Wine/ substitute Dry

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.739
Sherry
1 tsp of ginger

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.219
1/4 tsp pepper (I like to use fresh ground
black pepper)

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.829
2 pinches of salt
1,5- 2 tbs oyster sauce

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.829
If you're not buying the dumpling wrappers
(which is also called 饺子皮 Jiaozi Pi)

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.510
you'll need:

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.510
200g+4 Tbs of plain all purpose Flour
150 ml Water

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.530
Before you start cooking make sure to soak
the Shiitake Mushrooms in boiled water for

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.729
at least 15 Minutes.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.409
Start off by washing and cutting the spring
onion into fine rings.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.409
Then peel and mince the ginger

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.030
Take your shiitake mushrooms out of the water
and get rid of the hard stems, then cut them

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.240
into thin stripes and mince them.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.240
Add all the ingredients for the filling and
the marinade, mix thoroughly and set aside

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.590
for later use.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.919
Now we're going to prepare the dough.
If you're short on time you can also get the

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:41.069
wrappers at your local Asian supermarket,
look for dumpling wrappers or ask for 饺子皮

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.809
jiaozi pi.
I believe you should do as much as you can

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:49.260
from scratch so you can be sure that no artificial
additives were used to create your food.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.519
Aaanyways, make a hole in the middle of the
flour add a little bit of water. Mix it with

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.219
the flour and start kneading.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.389
The amount of water depends on heat and humidity
in your kitchen, so pour the water in little

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.219
by little and see how the dough develops.
If you added too little water, just add a

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.969
little bit more, if you added to much, balance
it out with a bit more flour, you can't really

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:18.969
ruin the dough.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:41.549
Fold the sides into the middle of the dough
and use the palm of your hand to apply pressure

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.329
and knead the dough. This will probably take
15 to twenty minutes until you get a smooth

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.339
surface.

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:52.799
Pull out an appropriate amount of dough, dust
your working surface and your rolling pin

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.699
and start rolling out your dough. Since the
dough is quite tough, you have to put a bit

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.889
of effort into rolling it out. If it doesn't
stretch out, resort to brute force add add

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:09.889
all of your weight onto the rolling pin. You're
aiming for a dough that is about 2 mm thick.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.699
Once rolled out, take a mug to stence out
perfectly round circles. There you have your

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.359
dumpling wrappers. Repeat the process until
you're out of dough. Remember to cover up

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.949
the wrappers with cling foil, otherwise they'll
dry up and it will be hard to fold the dumplings

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.430
later on.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.840
Now put the filling into the middle of the
dumpling wrappers. The best dumplings have

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.009
a thin skin and a lot of filling, so the more
you can stuff them, the better they are (supposedly).

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:45.610
I'm putting about 1,5 tsp of filling into
one dumpling.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.699
Now there are several folding methods for
dumplings, as some believe with different

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.340
folding techniques the dumplings will absorb
variating amounts of the dipping sauce. But

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.430
honestly, I'd just pick whatever I like the
best.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.340
The first way goes like this:

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.060
Fold your circle into half, hold the dumpling
by pinching it together in the middle with

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.259
your right hand's thumb and index finger.

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.979
Find the middle of the left and right side
and plug each into the middle, until you can

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.930
sort of see an X or a flower shape.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.400
Seal the open ends and fold two of them together
like so.press once again to seal everything

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.530
tightly! done!

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.159
15. With the second one you'll just want to
make 6 pleads, I think watching me how I do

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:35.159
it is better than I could ever describe it.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.240
For 水饺 shui jiao you want to boil them
in hot water over high heat, just add the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.150
dumplings to the water once it's simmering.
Cook for about 5 Minutes or until the meat

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.590
is done, then take them out and serve them.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.569
To make Pot stickers, you want to first fry
the bottoms of your freshly made dumplings

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:12.229
with about 2-3 tbs of flavorless oil (for
instance groundnut oil or sunflower oil),

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.060
until they're halfway golden brown. Add a
bit of water to help them cook, but don't

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.659
add too much. Beware of the spritzing oil!
About 1/3 of their height should be enough,

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.900
but that also depends on the size of your
skillet. Cover the skillet to retain the high

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.379
heat and move the pot stickers occasionally
to prevent them from sticking to the pan.

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.509
Once the water has evaporated, continue to
fry them until they're they golden brown.

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:42.840
then serve them upside down to show off their
beautiful color and crispiness!

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.370
Some like their dumplings and pot stickers
with soy sauce, some prefer pure vinegar and

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.129
I love mine with a bit of soy sauce, a hint
of vinegar and a bit chili oil!

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.560
While 水饺 shui jiao always make a great
meal and are especially popular on Chinese

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.900
new Year, Pot stickers are my preferred alternative,they
make great finger food on parties, even though

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.080
they're not as healthy.
We love making 饺子 Jiaozi in large groups,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.770
so everyone can help to finish them faster.
When I'm making them for myself I still make

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.999
a larger badge, put every 5 of them into one
freezer bag and freeze them. Reheating is

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:23.340
easy, just pop them into the microwave or
steam them in the skillet with some water,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.270
then fry it with a teeny tiny bit of oil,
so you get the crispy bottom again!

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.180
Hope you will enjoy this dish, definitely
take a pic of it and show it to me via Instagram

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.340
or twitter once you've made it! Thank you
so much for watching, I hope to see you next

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.590
Friday on my new video again! Bye!
