Scary Facts About DayZ

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
DayZ is a multiplayer open world survival horror video game in development by Bohemia Interactive and the stand-alone version of the award-winning mod of the same name.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
DayZ began development in 2012 when the mod's creator, Dean Hall, joined Bohemia Interactive to work on it. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The development has been focused on altering the engine to suit the game's needs, developing a working client-server architecture, and introducing new features like diseases and a better inventory system.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The alpha release sold over 172,500 copies in the first 24 hours, totaling over $5 million USD in sales, and has since reached over 200,000 sales.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
During peak sales over 200 copies were being purchased per minute and after one week of sales over 400,000 copies had been sold.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
One of the developmental focuses was making the world feel more realistic by increasing the number of enterable buildings.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The game will be running on a branch of the Take On Helicopters engine (part of the Real Virtuality engine).

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hundreds of public domain books are in the world for players to read including titles such as War of the Worlds and Moby-Dick.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
A range of diseases are also a threat to the player, requiring them to have access to medicine if needed,[6] with diseases including cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis, caught from sources such as dirty water and rotten food.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Planned features include being able to build bases in the world in which players can keep their items safe, with the possibility of security systems and programmable computers having been considered.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Another planned feature is player run radio stations.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Dayz includes a new whisper channel, that will allow players to communicate over a very short distance without players nearby hearing.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
When players clear an area of zombies within the game, such as around a town, further zombies will not respawn within that area, though others may wander back in, providing a safer area for some time.
