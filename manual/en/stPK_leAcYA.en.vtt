welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.199
I'm going to show you Gulkand ka halwa what is this gulkand, gulkand means when

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.970
the rose petals are cooked in sugar syrup
and it is very much widely used in Palm

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.120
but today my dear friends I'm going to
take this recipe and i'm going to add

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
beetroot to this today I'm going to make gulab chakundar gulkand ka halwa

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.350
it is one of the of the awesome preparation I'm going to show you how to cook it and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.160
then later how to eat it, for this
preparation first ghee in a pan in which

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.620
add cashew nuts in this so be liberal in
adding nuts because i love adding nuts in all

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.079
my halwas and then add almonds and
pistachio in this and slightly let them

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.049
color once they get slight color add
raisins and slowly mix them do not

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.460
discolour the raisins because once they
get little burnt they'll give a very

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.510
bitter taste

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.909
now you can add this grated beetroot in this and cook it for a minute and now

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.189
you add rose petals these are desi rose petals which we use in lot of

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.509

how to make haleem in which i used the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.790

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.640
let it simmer for 4 - 5 minutes, after 4 - 5
minutes add sugar and mix it so now

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.970
slowly the moisture will come out so put
the lid on and cook it on a very slow

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.460
flame after cooking it for another three
minutes see this is getting nicely mixed

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.590

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.630
khoya into this, add some khoya and mix it even though you add good amount of khoya

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.950
