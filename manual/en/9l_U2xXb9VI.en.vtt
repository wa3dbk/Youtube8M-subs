00:00:11.537 --> 00:00:15.749
This here's James. Now, do me a favor.
Why don't you show him around?

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.419
Tell him the TV rules.
Show him the games and stuff. Okay?

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.339
How much you gonna pay me?
How much? I'd be doin' your job.

00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.258
Five thousand dollars,
my man. That enough?
Five thousand?

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:26.011
I'll wire a check
to your account as usual.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.472
Five thousand dollars!
Five thousand dollars!
Five thousand dollars.

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:32.850
I'll give him the deluxe
mental hospital tour.
My man!

00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.563
Kid around, makes 'em
feel good. We're pals.
I love you.

00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:40.275
You're the prisoners.
No, you're the guards.
Now You got it.

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:43.988
Okay, it's all in good fun.
Here's some games here.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.575
And there's-
Get out! Get out!

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:51.662
He was in My chair.

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:55.458
Games. Games.
Here's some games.

00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:57.877
Games that wanna get out.

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.630
See? More games.

00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:04.300
Games. They vegetize you.
See? Aah.

00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:07.888
If you play the games,
you're voluntarily
taking a tranquilizer.

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.517
I guess they gave you
some chemical restraints. Drugs!

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:15.062
What'd they give you? Thorazine?
Haldol? How much? How much?

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:17.231
Learn your drugs.
Know your dosages. It's elementary.

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:20.943
I need to make a telephone call.
a telephone call?

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:25.364
That's communication with the outside
world. Doctor's discretion. No.

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:28.034
If all of these nuts
could just make phone calls,

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:30.913
it could spread insanity
oozing through telephone cables,

00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:34.792
oozing to the ears of all these poor,
sane people, infecting them.

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.628
Wackos everywhere.
A plague of madness.

00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:42.508
In fact, very few, Jim- Jim, very few
of us here are actually mentally ill.

00:01:42.508 --> 00:01:44.843
I'm not saying
you're not mentally ill.

00:01:44.927 --> 00:01:48.639
For all I know,
you're... crazy as a loon.
But that's not why you're here.

00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:52.477
That's not why you're here!
That's not why you're here!

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:55.563
You're here
because of the system.

00:01:56.606 --> 00:01:58.566
There's the television.
