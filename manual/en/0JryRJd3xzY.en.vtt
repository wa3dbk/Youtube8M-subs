Hello friends I'm Jeesaa Gupta, a beauty practitioner.
Now I'm talking about dry skin. Dry skin is

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.880
very, very much wrinkle prone because the
oil glands in dry skin are less active and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.070
hardly secretes the natural oils to keep the
skin moist. So the skin keeps on losing its

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:34.239
natural oil and moisture and becomes very,
very dry. This dryness causes early sign of

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:42.920
wrinkle and aging. So, how to take care? The
people having dry skin should be careful from

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.620
the very beginning so that the aging process
should be slowed down. Otherwise, even if

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.839
at the age of thirty, it will look like forty
which is not totally desirable to any woman.

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:06.000
Here, I'm showing you a homemade pack for
the dry skin. Plus you should use everyday

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.060
a good cream which contains honey because
honey is a natural skin softener and moisturizer

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:28.790
and it helps to avoid dryness of the skin.
Mix honey and water or honey and curd to avoid

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.850
wrinkle. So apply it and let it be there or
wait for another ten to fifteen minutes. After

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:45.600
that, you scrub it off with moist fingertips,
just with gentle strokes. You scrub it off.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.920
Wash your face with fresh water and just a
minute you should experience the suppleness

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:02.170
and smoothness of your face. This will give
you a wrinkle free appearance. I hope these

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.909
tips and techniques of prevention of wrinkle
will help you a lot. Thank you.
