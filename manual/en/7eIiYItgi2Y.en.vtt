00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.820
Selling some or all of your precious metals
holdings can seem a daunting endeavor at first.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.130
Gainesville Coins makes the process simple
and straightforward.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.890
Additionally, since Gainesville Coins is one
of the largest global dealers in precious

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.950
metals we're able to offer among the best
prices for gold, silver and other precious

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.340
metal bullion.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.500
The process for selling gold and silver to
Gainesville Coins involves two steps.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.120
Sending your precious metal to Gainesville
coins; locking in a sales price.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.610
Sending your precious metal to Gainesville
Coins.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.430
Contact the Gainesville Coins traders for
the premiums to be offered on the items you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.080
wish to sell.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.000
You'll be given a confirmation code that represents
the price in relation to spot Gainesville

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.820
Coins will buy your gold and silver.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.710

Securly package and mail your precious metals
to Gainesville Coins.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.830
When your package arrives, Gainesville Coins
will inventory the contents of your package.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.780
This process could take until the next business
day to complete, depending on the time the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.690
package arrives and the volume of packages
to be inventoried.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.500
Locking in a sale price.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.850
Once your package has been inventoried, a
Gainesville Coins Trader will contact you

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.560
to lock in the final sale price.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.510
The confirmation code will determine the premium,
if any, to be applied to the final sale price.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.900
You have two business days to lock in a price.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.580
After two business days you would be required
to have your item shipped back to you at your

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.400
expense or have them put into Gainesville
Coins Storage.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.430
Once the sale price has been agreed to Gainesville
Coins will immediately send an email with

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.979
the final sale price and method of payment.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.900
You can choose to have a business check mailed
to you or have the funds left on account for

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.670
a future purchase.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.569
Gainesville Coins can bankwire the funds or
send a check overnight, but these will require

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.650
an additional fee.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.980

will be sent or applied to your account.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.049
