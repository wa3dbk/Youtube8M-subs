Hey I’m Dave and on this installment of
Summit Racing Quick Flicks we are going to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:18.510
show you how to install a tonneau cover on
a 05 Chevy Silverado.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
Ok for this installation we are going to be
using a TruXedo TruXport tonneau cover which

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.509
is a soft roll up style tonneau cover and
what’s nice about those is you get quick

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.660
easy access to the entire truck bed it features
a Velcro style closure and also has a no drill

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.050
installation which is going to make things
really easy for us today.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.670
Ok so we have all of our pieces parts laid
out on the back of the truck we have our two

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.610
rails, the tonneau cover itself with the front
rail already attached and also the bulkhead

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.610
seal already on there, our six clamps which
we use to attach the cover to the side of

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.100
the pick-up truck bed, our corner seals for
our rails to keep the weather out and this

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.000
is all going to go on simply with a half inch
wrench.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.260
Ok so we went ahead and put the corner seals
on the bed rail so now we are going to move

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.049
the tonneau cover into place, once we have
this into place we will be able to put the

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.340
rails on the side of the truck bed and use
the clamps to secure it.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.569
Ok so with our cover laid into place it’s
time to go ahead and get our side rails and

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.079
kind of installed to where they are going
to be on the truck bed itself and what we

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:35.789
have to do is take this corner piece here
and slide it into the head rail and it’s

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.570
just a matter of lining it up and sliding
it in and you’re done.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.179
Ok so we have both rails set into place on
the actual truck bed and we have centered

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.039
everything up right where we want it and now
it’s time to go ahead and attach the rails

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.280
and you do that with the six clamps provided
by TruXedo three on each side obviously and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.689
they need to be evenly spaced just go ahead
and install right up under the rail, finger

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.390
tighten it into place and we will go back
and tighten everything with our half inch

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.670
wrench to tighten it down we will be good
to go.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.050
So have gotten our rails attached our tonneau
unrolled and the last little bit we had to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.320
do was attach this little piece of weather
seal here which we have already done so now

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:38.250
it’s time to close her up close up our truck
and go out 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:03:28.480
and have some fun.
