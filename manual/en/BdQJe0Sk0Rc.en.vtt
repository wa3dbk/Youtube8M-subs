00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
- ...Ong
- Get away from me!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey, Rocko!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I guess this means we put our differences on ice!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Get it? Huh? ”Put our differences on ice”?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'd like to put you on ice!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Look how we get along together.
I think it's great the way we blend.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You've tried to be as tough as leather but now I see that's just pretend.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We'll find our way through stormy weather,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
just you and me right to the end.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Hey, buddy, looks like we're two birds of a feather

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and, gee, it looks like I got me a friend.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now you go!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Take it, Rocko!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Hey, Rocko, what do you call a flower before it opens?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What do you call a flower before it opens?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
A bud!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I love it when you call me bud!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
- Look how we get along together.
- You are incredibly annoying.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
- I think it's great the way we blend.
- You're like a bone stuck in my throat.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
- You've tried to be as tough as leather.
- This isn't something I'm enjoying.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
- But now I see that's just pretend.
- I shoulda left you on that boat!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We'll find our way through stormy weather.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You want a friend? Go find a snail!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
- Just you and me right to the end.
- Or better yet, killer whale!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Hey buddy, looks like we're two birds of a feather.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Don't call me buddy!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
- And, gee, it looks like I got me a friend.
- Uh uh! Not me!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now you try!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Take it, Rocko!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Hey, Rocko, I caught you a herring. Where should I put it?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I caught you a herring. Where should I put it?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
- Put it there.
- Put it there? All right!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Oh, stop it!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
- When you're a rebel you're a rebel.
- You really like me, just admit it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
- You don't go finding friends to like!
- Alright, I'm gonna hold my breath!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
- Why don't you pack your blasted pebble.
- Quit it! Admit it!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And take yourself a healthy hike!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You know, you're gonna cause my death!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
- They don't have penguins up in Juneau.
- It's getting dark...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
- Why don't you go and start a trend!
- Goodbye, Rocko!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Oh, knock it off!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Hey! Hey, you're all blue!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Breathe, you bird brain!
Hubie!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
- Say it!
- Alright then!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I kinda... Sorta...
Maybe... You know...

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
- You mean you like me?
- A little.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
- You mean it?
- Don't push it!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:14.000
(Looks like I got me a friend)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
- We really showed him!
- ”We showed him”? ”We”?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.533
Oh, come on!
You're a terrible fighter!
