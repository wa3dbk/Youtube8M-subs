(♪♪♪)

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:14.233
Winsor &amp; Newton has a variety
of alkyd mediums called Liquin,

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.167
which are made by treating
a naturally derived oil,

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:19.133
like linseed oil,
with alcohol and acid.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.700
That's where
the name comes from,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.433
first part of alcohol,
last part of acid,

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:23.700
and you get alkyd.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.000
And what alkyds do is they
speed the drying rate

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.100
of conventional oils
by about 50%,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.133
so what that means
for you as a painter,

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.300
as an artist, is that
pigments, paints, oil paints,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.000
will dry about 2-12 days
depending upon the pigment,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.867
so you can split that
drying time in half

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:41.533
to about 1-6 days,
and that's touch dry.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.067
You'd still want to wait
6-12 months

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:44.600
to varnish a painting.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.067
Now Liquin Original,
called Liquin Original

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:52.267
because of the fact that it was
the first one.

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:54.967
Pour that out,
you can see that's quite fluid,

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:57.733
I'm going to take a little bit
of that off to the side here,

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.133
and take some
oil colour in here.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.900
The proportion of medium here,
you want to do about

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.333
one to two Liquin to paint,
to colour.

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.933
I'm going to mix that up.

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.733
Take this off to the side.

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:14.300
You can see already how
fluid and glossy it makes it.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.533
The colour is just so rich,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.633
so I can take this
stiff consistency

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.700
of oil paint,
which you see over here,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.100
which is quite short, right,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.600
and I can really
get the consistency

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.967
to make that move
and flow across the surface

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:28.000
really really nice.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.800
Liquin Fine Detail,
as the name suggests,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.433
is a very very fluid medium.

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.200
Much more so.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.600
Right?

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.667
The reason we have
something like that

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.100
also going to dry
to a gloss finish

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.267
is because it will
level your brush marks,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.733
so when you want to
get into fine detail

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:43.400
and you don't want to
leave brush marks behind,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.267
Liquin Fine Detail is a really
great choice for that,

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:47.633
and then Liquin Light Gel--

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.767
I'm actually going to grab
a palette knife for this

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:51.533
because Liquin Light Gel,
as the name would suggest,

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.200
is a gel medium,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.167
so you need to sort of
get some of that out

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:56.133
with a palette knife.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.033
You can see
how gel-like that is.

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:00.133
It's what
we call thixotropic.

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.333
Now thixotropic is just a big
fancy word for the fact that

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.267
it comes out in
a gel-like consistency,

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:08.033
but as I manipulated it with
a palette knife or with a brush,

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:09.867
it starts to
become more fluid,

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.733
but it won't become as fluid
as these two mediums

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:13.567
right over here,

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.833
as the original
and the fine detail.

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:19.367
Great for glazing because,
as I paint on my canvas

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:20.533
on a vertical surface,

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.500
it won't drip down
the surface.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.533
And then we've got
Liquin Impasto.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.333
Liquin Impaso has
a really stiff consistency

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:27.933
which is why it comes in a tube,

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:33.267
and it will retain texture
and retain brush strokes.

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.200
There will be very very crisp
brush strokes

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.033
that it will retain,

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:37.800
so it's going to keep those
high peeks,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.133
and it'll become brushable,

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.233
or stay brushable
for several hours.

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:44.300
And Liquin Oleopasto,
also in a tube,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.833
looks a little bit
similar at first,

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.567
if I spread some of this out,
or squeeze it out,

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.133
you can see it looks
very much the same.

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.500
However, the difference is
with this it's going to dry

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.067
to a semi-matte finish,

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:56.200
different than the other
Liquin mediums,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.733
and it's going to
dry more quickly,

00:02:57.733 --> 00:02:59.467
thicken very rapidly,

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:01.167
and the brush strokes
you're going to have with that

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:03.233
are going to level out,
so that's a big difference.

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.967
With the Impasto,
very very crisp brush strokes,

00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:08.700
with these, softer,
more levelled out brush strokes,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.933
and remember as I said,
you can add a proportion,

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:14.167
a ratio, about one to two
Liquin to oil colour,

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.033
and you can change
the consistency

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:17.200
which is the key thing
with the medium

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.567
to get it to be
ultra flowing,

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:21.500
level out brush strokes,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.567
and also leave
really nice textures.

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:29.400
