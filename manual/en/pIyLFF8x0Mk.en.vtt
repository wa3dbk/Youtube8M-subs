00:00:05.018 --> 00:00:11.285
Here is an access panel. It's very discrete, but we can see it when we pay attention.

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:15.182
This access panel is the good news of that version of the device:

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.103
it's the access panel for the battery.

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:26.544
There is a small safety latch that you just need to push to access the integrated Li-Po battery.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:36.461
Once the shell is removed, we can simply extract the battery from the device.

00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:43.102
So now, unlike the first version of the device with an unremovable battery,

00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:45.581
which had repelled many people,

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.935
the battery is accessible.

00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:52.539
It's a 31-Wh, 2900-mA, 10.95-V battery,

00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:57.980
which should be enough to enable a quite good autonomy.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.923
It's a Li-Po battery, not a Li-Ion battery,

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:07.806
so it's more powerful and thiner at the same time.

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.317
That battery is indeed very very thin.

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:16.004
So here, there difference with the 1008HA is that we'll be able to buy a battery

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:25.320
without having to go to the after-sales service or to open the device,

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:30.857
which is not acceptable for everybody.

00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:37.836
Here we've got a battery that we'll be able to find in shops

00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.033
and that we'll be able to change once it's used.

00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:49.679
It's really simple, the system is well built.

00:01:55.444 --> 00:02:05.690
One last thing: here we've got an access panel we can access with this small screw,

00:02:06.747 --> 00:02:12.601
which is hidden under the VGA connector access hatch.

00:02:33.014 --> 00:02:38.657
Under this well hidden small access hatch, we can access the main memory.

00:02:41.168 --> 00:02:48.672
We've got a DDR2 memory module. It's the only element we can access;

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.354
the hard drive is hidden, the Wifi module is hidden,

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:57.101
we can't access them without opening all the screws.

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.671
And it may not be very easy to open such a device.

00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:03.253
Anyway, we can access the main memory.

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:25.244
To set back this small cover may seem to be a bit difficult, because we're afraid to ruin the device.

00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:31.588
But don't hesitate to close it firmly.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.709
And there we go, we just have to screw it now.

00:03:55.852 --> 00:04:01.868
Once again, it was a good idea to put this access hatch and that hidden screw

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.827
in order not to spoil the sobriety of the surface.
