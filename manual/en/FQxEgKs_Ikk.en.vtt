00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.030
Hello and welcome to my Mists of Pandaria
Destruction Warlock Skill Breakdown.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.200
In this video I'm going to try to explain
the changes and rotation differences between

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.570
the current Destruction skillset and the one
implemented in the Mists beta.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.050
In the background will be my Warlock going
through the rotation described later in the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.050
video.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.590
I haven't spent too much time in front of
the target dummies, so, like the last video,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.860
the rotation is sloppy could use some work.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.410
Up on the screen are the tooltips of your
major spells, taken directly from the beta

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.410
client.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.370
These will be up for only a few more seconds,
so feel free to pause the video to read them.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.770
We'll start out with the new resource mechanics
that you have as a Destuction Warlock.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.490
The first is Chaotic Energy.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.950
This increases your mana regen by 625%, and
is affected by haste.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.470
This basically changes your mana bar into
an energy bar, as your spells take a large

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.360
chunk of mana to cast, but going from no mana
to max takes less than ten seconds.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.740
This changes our playstyle a bit, as you no
longer have to cast Life Tap to regain mana.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.909
The next is called Burning Embers.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.660
This gives us a new resource of the same name
that is generated by casting Incinerate or

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.380
having your Immolate crit.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.720
An important bit to remember is that each
cast or crit does NOT generate a Burning Ember-

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.680
it only generates about 1/8th of a full Ember,
so it takes a few casts or crits to get one.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.000
Burning Embers are spent by casting Chaos
Bolt or casting a new spell, Ember Tap, which

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.390
I'll be detailing in a minute.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.979
Now on to our standard spells and passive
effects.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.729
Backdraft is still the same effect is has
been for the last two expansions: every cast

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.310
of Conflagrate gives you three charges that
reduce the cast time of Incinerate by 30%.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.060
Chaos Bolt, however, has changed quite a bit
from it's original form.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.240
It no longer has a cooldown, but now costs
Burning Embers to cast and takes about twice

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.870
as long to cast.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.740
To make up for this drawback, Chaos bolt now
always crits, and the damage is increased

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.560
by your crit chance.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.090
There's also a passive effect you learn at
level 86 that consumes 3 Backdraft charges

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.900
to give it the 30% haste buff.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.920
This effect seems bugged in the beta, as I
haven't hit 86 or gone to a trainer to learn

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.579
the spell, but it still consumed 3 charges
and seemed to cast faster.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.239
Dark Soul, the new Demon Soul, is your standard
2 minute DPS cooldown.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.189
It's losing its per demon effect to give a
flat 30% crit chance.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.700
Shadowburn has also slightly changed as well,
given that Destro locks no longer have access

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700
to Soul Shards.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.770
It is now only castable when the target is
under 20%, and returns 15% mana after 5 seconds

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.319
no matter if the target dies or not.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.749
If your target DOES die within 5 seconds and
yield experience or honor, you instantly generate

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.250
an entire Burning Ember.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.999
Immolate is your only DoT and hasn't changed
other than it has a chance to generate Burning

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.400
Embers on a critical strike.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.219
Incinerate also hasn't changed much, but it
no longer gets a damage bonus if the target

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.499
is Immolated.

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:16.219
This spell also generates Embers, and the
effect doubles on a crit.

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.969
After years of begging, Conflagrate no longer
requires Immolate to be on a target to cast.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:28.219
Also, the glyph is pretty much mandatory,
as it gives your Conflagrate spell two charges.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.650
This does NOT mean that you get twice the
charges in the same amount of time, merely

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.370
that it stores one and starts on the second's
cooldown if you mess up.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.409
Fel Flame is the same as it is now- an instant
cast DoT refresh that deals damage.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.700
Havoc, however, has changed into a small AoE
DPS cooldown.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.280
It has a 1 and a half minute CD, and basically
causes the next 3 direct damage spells cast

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.810
on another enemy to be duplicated on the target
you cast Havoc on.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.030
Finally, Ember Tap replaces Life Tap, as you
no longer need the mana regen because of your

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.700
Chaotic Energy passive.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.489
This spell spends a Burning Ember to heal
yourself for a percentage of your max health.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.819
Now for the rotation I've come up with.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.970
The same disclaimers from my last video still
apply- I haven't mathcrafted this out, I've

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.170
merely stood in front of a target dummy until
I find a rotation that feels good and seems

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.940
to deal good damage.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.910
Start with firing off a Curse of the Elements,
followed by a quick double cast of Conflagrate.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.340
Put up Immolate, and then spam Incinerate
until you have TWO Burning Embers.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.870
Remember to cast Conflagrate on CD, and keep
refreshing Immolate either by hard casting

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.340
the spell or casting two Fel Flames.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.680
I've found that while using Fel Flame to refresh
gives you more damage, you also use a lot

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.120
more mana, and will eventually have to switch
back to hard casting Immolate for a few rotations.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.000
Now once you've generated two Burning Embers,
cast Chaos Bolt once, then go back to spamming

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.400
Incinerate.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.450
Once the boss hits 20% health, throw in Shadowburns
on cooldown as well.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.030
Now, a few of you may be wondering why I kept
that extra Burning Ember sitting unused.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.900
The reason is that Ember Tap is a great emergency
button for when the healer drops the ball.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.850
The DPS loss from that extra ember isn't noticable
over the course of the fight, and remember-

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.720
a Dead DPS does no DPS.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.160
Overall, the Destro rotation is definitely
simpler than Affliction, but brings the large

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.870
crits and direct damage that people have come
to expect.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.780
The animation for storing up your burning
embers is amazing, and honestly, who doesn't

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.470
like the idea of throwing fire at someone
so hard that you catch yourself ablaze?

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.550
