00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.120
My experience with Kitchen Magic
was a wonderful one.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.830
My designer was both dependable and easy to get in touch with.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.160
She was extremely patient

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.210
with all thedecisions I was making and all the changes in decisions I was making

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.960
and I feel like she gave me really good
advice about things that I didn't

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.350
even know to ask about,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.530
and gave me excellent suggestions to make this project exactly what I wanted it to be.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.089
What I love about being a Kitchen Magic designer is that we do everything a 100% custom

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.760
which gives me a lot of freedom. I'm able to utilize every inch of space

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.909
that's available as well as give the customer

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.909
a unique design that's individual to
them each time.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.159
I really believe that because we're
custom a set us apart.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.510
My favorite part about my new kitchen is a toss-up between

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.260
either my workstation desk area
which is a really nice functional area

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.659
that our family uses very frequently

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.610
and probably couldn't live without. And my kitchen island which

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.430
is a wonderful area in our kitchen both
for entertaining purposes

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.600
and also just the day-to-day cooking and sort of family gathering around

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.400
to color and hang out with the kids.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.130
My favorite part about this kitchen project are the warm colors the customer chose from the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.039
rich espresso cabinets to the movement and the granite and stone countertops. It really gives

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.289
the kitchen a warm and luxurious feel.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.060
I would use Kitchen Magic again in a
heartbeat, and I have recommended them

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.200
to several friends

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.649
because they made this process that was a bit overwhelming to begin with

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.759
smooth and fluid and they were able to get me at the end of the day

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.090
the exact kitchen that I needed and
wanted.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.499
They were able to give me ideas after things I didn't even know I needed until I needed them.

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:59.649
 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.049
And I just felt like my designer was an
absolute pleasure to work with.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.300
I usually recommend for homeowners to keep the design colors and textures as timeless as possible

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.860
that way they can bring in trendy items

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.400
and wall coverings like paint or tile and things that they could replace easily as the trends change.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.600
I was also so impressed by the high quality of the cabinetry itself...

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.790
...the durability. Especially having two
young kids.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.900
And really my favorite part was the slow close feature

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.640
which is just so beautiful and a nice addition.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.159
What I would like to add for anyone watching this video is simple

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.370
It is if you can dream it Kitchen Magic can do it.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.620
