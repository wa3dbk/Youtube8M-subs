00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.569
Hi everyone. OK, Samsung have dropped an update for the Galaxy S4 and

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.379
this one's a bit of a doozie!

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:16.640
Basically

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.289
they've added some features, they've

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.100
cleaned up the interface a little bit

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.290
and as you can see up at the top here in the notification tray here there's now a kind of  translucent

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.589
area

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.759
this transparency and it looks kind of fetching or 
gives a bit of a depth of field

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:30.720
effect.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.970
But also

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.110
the interface is incredibly quick

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.429
things have

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.189
tightened up quite a bit of a lot of the interface lag seems to have disappeared

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.600
completely which is really nice to see.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.470
We'll have to wait and see how that works
out over time but it's promising at the moment.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.140
Now also of interest is they seem to be getting a bit more control over the memory

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.250
usage as well.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.239
Obviously background tasks will kick back in now and start filling up memory again

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.589
but it's good to see that

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.309
overall they are making a few improvements here on how much memory the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.080
device is using.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.080
Now one of the other really interesting features whoops, let me come into settings,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.750
is if we come into More on the Application Manager

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.560
we now have let me just pick something suitable... let's go with that one...

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.090
we now have a move to SD card option available
in here.  Now I'm having a few problems getting it

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.520
working but it is promising that we do have that there. What I've found is some apps can

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.909
be moved to the SD, others can't but in some cases I'm finding that I

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.909
can't actually move them to the SD card at all, let me just see if I can find one that I

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:34.820
had earlier on.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.150
So this one will

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.070
supposedly move to the SD card, there we go, it's actually done it this time, fantastic, although

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.110
I'm not completely sure why it's only some applications that do seem to be able to move to the SD

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.310
others not so much

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.310
but the option is there we can now free up a little bit of space on our internal

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.640
storage although it should be noted that
it doesn't appear from other people on

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.520
forums that have been testing this

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.610
that it moves all of the game data across,  some of it goes across some of it doesn't.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.369
Specifically it tends to be the smaller apps that will move all of their data

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.870
but if it's got a separate large download

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.149
things like Grand Theft Auto

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.749
you're not going to find the game data actually carried across.

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.999
Check out a video I've made for Folder Mount if you want to be able to move all of your data across

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.329
onto your SD.

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.009
Also of interest is the icon on the About Device has changed, whether that's

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.209
because this is a German build or whether that's

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.529
going to be permanent, not completely
sure

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:32.540
but certainly there is a lot of really really interesting stuff going on here.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.879
The whole fact that the smartphone has

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.529
reduced the lag considerably with this update,

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.459
the general look and feel everything is starting to feel so much better and

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.229
tighter for the Galaxy S4. Who knows, Samsung might be able to fix this thing with software.

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:52.459
Now, the next thing I want to take a look at is the reported HDR video

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.669
functionality.

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.409
Now we'll just have a quick look what setting options we have in here for video

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.689
not seeing anything particular

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.689
in there.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.099
Let's switch the video on and see if we get any new options.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.229
It's decided that I'm in night mode.

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.279
There, you see I'm not really seeing any additional
options there, certainly no HDR video but let's

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.799
stop that and have another look

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:24.799
in settings. Maybe we've missed something.

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.649
I don't see anything specifically there. Perhaps this HDR video is something that is on

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:44.789
by default, let's try a Â£5 note shall we?

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.739
See what we get.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.980
I think it's pretty difficult to tell at this point but

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.220
you know we'll play around with the HDR video and see whether that is actually a true

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.330
feature or whether it's just some

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.790
rumoured thing at this point

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.849
but to me at least

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.309
unless it's somewhere hiding away in here,

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.730
I don't see anything in particular.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.059
Let's pop it on HDR mode rich tone

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:12.739
and see whether that does anything for video as well.

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.670
I can't really see. I mean, if there is anything going
on there it's certainly not giving me

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.889
any indication on the screen unfortunately.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.699
But if you're interested in this update and you can't wait for Samsung to push it locally to your

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.439
regions you can

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.809
go and download this update off XDA Developers, there's a forum thread, I will

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:34.689
pop it in the description. All you need to do is download the update, use Odin,

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.070
which is a flashing tool

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.910
pop your device into download mode flash the update.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.370
Because it's an official update from Samsung it

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.919
won't void your warranty it won't increase any of the counters that Samsung have put on there to

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.680
indicate whether you've rooted your phone, voided your warranty or anything like that,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.610
so it's perfectly safe to install. Just bear in mind though you will get

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.899
German applications as this is a German build

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.460
but by and large that's not

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.820
too bad a problem

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.340
or too much of a problem.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.330
Like I say, Samsung have done a cracking job at getting this update out and it

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.720
certainly feels like the S4 is starting to find

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.089
its feet a little bit

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.529
No longer quite such a frustrating mess that it was before.
