00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.700
The move that we're going to learn today looks
just like this:

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.340
There you have it.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.869
I know, it's one more addition to the Change
Grip Around the Head, a little new finish

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:17.869
to the sequence we've been learning.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.690
But this is getting a little more fun and
goes into actually building the drink.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:30.590
Let's do that one more time so you can see
it in slow motion.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.789
Then we can go right into a pour into the
drink.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.609
I'm going to switch to my FlairCo practice
bottle

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.460
and a dry tin.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.079
We're already comfortable with the Change
Grip Around the Head

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.629
We're comfortable holding this tin in our
hand

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.579
This is going to be a slight variation with
the tin

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.409
Instead of just grabbing it and opening up
our palm

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.980
We're going to be grabbing it by the very
top

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.549
I put my thumb on one end and either my middle
finger - which is what I'm comfortable with

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.690
- although I know some people use their forefinger.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.690
Use whatever works for you.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.040
What we want to be able to do is have it nice
and loose

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.510
so we can "hinge" it over the top, like so.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.690
Whether we start with that and either do the
Change Grip Around the Head and then hinge

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.550
the tin
Or I think it's a little more fluid, a little

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.080
more cool, if we can do them both together.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.010
Sometimes if you've got your tins setup upside
down on your rail, this just might be how

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.110
you start, and that's fine too.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.280
I like to take the tin like this.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.940
I think it add a nice extra element to it,
a little more flourish, a little more flash.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.950
A little more flair, if you will.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.240
Now, put the pour spout into the tin.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.610
I know in the past I've emphasized making
sure your pour spout is up to make sure you're

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.610
not spilling.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.610
Here, we are actually going to put it down
because we are

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.610
going to start pouring.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.540
Put it down into the tin.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.100
Then the key to getting comfortable with this
part - the part that people struggle with,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.280
the roll down.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.010
You don't want the bottle to slide all the
way into the tin and get stuck in there.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.010
You don't want it to fall over the back of
your shoulder.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.361
It's really a matter of getting 2 fingers
on the tin

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.500
so we're comfortable with this.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.720
After we've done the hinge I really latch
on with that other finger.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.090
The other 2 fingers - my pinky and my ring
finger -

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.701
are what grab onto the bottle.

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:12.100
I say grab on - it's really more of a loose
guide for it.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.720
There just there to - not grip - but more
to provide a nice little guidance as it rolls

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720
down my arm.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.930
Let's go through that again one more time.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.880
We do the Change Grip
hinging the tin

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.910
Put our fingers in the right place
see what I am doing with these 2 fingers here

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.730
Then we roll down the arm
Remember to step into it a little bit

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.470
Once we get to here, the new difference now
is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.530
instead of popping up, grabbing that bottle
What we are going to do is pull our hand away.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.010
I like to let the momentum of the weight of
the bottle

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.069
cause it to let you "scoop"
this nice circular motion

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.591
scoop it into the pour.

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:56.560
From there you can get a little flashy
and add some nice dimension by lifting up

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.050
the bottle
and getting a nice long pour.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.550
Then twist your wrist, letting your fingers
hinge,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.920
then going into the pour
or even pouring with both the tin and bottle.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.990
I've also seen some people get the bottle
to the end of there wrist,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.150
then pull their wrist away and just spin like
this.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.820
If that works for you, great.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.099
You're doing better than I am.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.370
When I do that, I end up spraying and spilling
everywhere.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.400
But that's my luck.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.660
I've seen other people do it and that's what
works best for them.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.520
The "scoop" for them is a little more confusing.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520
Do whatever works for you.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.650
Let's do it 1 more time with a "live" bottle
so you can see the full flair move.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.370
The Change Grip Around the Head, the Arm Roll
Down into the Tin

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.480
a nice little flourish
and then we can pour that into the drink.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.480
That is today's move.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.480
Good luck.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.482
Practice, practice!
