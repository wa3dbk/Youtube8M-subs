00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.130
When tomatoes are in season, of course we
all love to make tomato sauce.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.300
But roasting tomatoes is another way to enjoy
the abundant harvest.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.140
So today we're going to roast tomatoes with
garlic, lemon thyme, and parsley.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The roasting process intensifies the tomatoes'
flavor and deepens it.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.710
They turn out quite sublime.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.269
Let's make a batch.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:35.710
Peel the garlic and then cut the cloves in
half lengthwise.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.880
For the parsley, take a few sprigs and line
them up to where the first leaves begin.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.270
Then tear the stalks off.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.020
Hold your parsley in a tight bundle and then
slice it.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.980
And then finely chop it.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.240
For the thyme, simply slide the leaves off
the stalks.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.470
I use lemon thyme for this recipe because
it has such a marvelous aroma, but also because

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.480
it is easily accessible to me, as I grow it
in my garden.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.900
But if you have trouble finding it, you can
use regular thyme.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.810
After peeling and seeding your tomatoes, place
them in a non-stick roasting pan.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.060
And by the way, there is a link in the ingredients
section of this recipe showing you how to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.810
prep your tomatoes.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:02:01.979
Add the garlic, the parsley, the thyme, the
salt, the pepper, the vinegar, and the olive

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.009
oil.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.739
Now toss that well with your hands and then
distribute the tomatoes evenly so that they

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.840
are in a single layer.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.680
I like to also distribute the garlic evenly
throughout the pan.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.830
Here they are!

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.720
By the way, make sure you serve the roasted
garlic with the tomatoes -- it's absolutely

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.920
delicious.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.670
You can use the roasted tomatoes in salads,
as a side vegetable with fish or chicken,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.269
on top of pizzas, tossed with pasta -- you
can even make dip or coulis with them.

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:48.740
They're not just delicious; they're incredibly
versatile.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.880
Bon apetit!
