00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:10.264
The reason I chose Venus Concept, was first
and foremost the technology behind the device.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.583
So the most important thing is the efficacy
that any of these devices have for my patients.

00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:21.044
There are a lot of different devices on the
market and they all have different claims.

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:26.169
So I spent a lot of time researching the company,
what's behind it and knowing that number one

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:31.117
that it's effective. Another thing that all
patients want is something that is

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:37.170
as pain free as possible, particularly when
you look at radio frequency devices,

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:42.363
I think we all know that radio frequency
devices are effective and that's been proven.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:50.399
The big sticking point has been, no. 1
consistency and no. 2 is it painless?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.331
Most people have heard how painful these
devices are so when I heard that there was

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:02.131
a new radio frequency device that was painless
and that could heat the tissue very quickly,

00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:03.255
I was certainly interested.

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:08.029
A little bit more due diligence and you realize
some of the technology that is behind it,

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:15.733
using the magnetic pulses, and some other
things that are better on the physician's side

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.214
that really made me interested
in this Venus Concept.

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:29.168
How Venus Freeze compares to other
technologies really is the completeness

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:31.525
in which you can achieve results
with this device.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.455
I have many other devices that are specifically
for specific parts of the body.

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:40.666
So I have devices that are really good
for the head and neck up,

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.467
some are for the lower body
and some are for the abdomen.

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:47.962
This is a device that you can use all over
the body so it's really good

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:52.688
particularly for practitioners
that don't have a lot of devices.

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:56.028
So if you want to pick one device and you
want to treat multiple areas of the body,

00:01:56.905 --> 00:02:02.740
this is a good way to go. I think, just speaking
to other practitioners, physicians, nurses,

00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:08.652
then it's very easy to use. One of the things
that my staff really enjoys about it,

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:13.192
is that it is comfortable. Some of the early
devices, that really were treating cellulite

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.198
were really uncomfortable, and so you dealt
with a lot of staff fatigue using the device.

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:24.152
So that really is not a problem at all
with the Venus Freeze.

00:02:24.617 --> 00:02:29.654
The other thing is that if a patient wants their
neck treated, if they want their cheeks treated,

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:34.758
they want their abdomen, their thighs,
you can do that all with this one device.

00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:43.883
The one thing that's clear and consistent with
the Venus Freeze is that it's very comfortable.

00:02:44.273 --> 00:02:48.896
In fact even relaxing, many of the patients
fall asleep during the procedure.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.808
It is almost more like a spa treatment than
actually a radio frequency treatment.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.254
Particularly when you contrast it to some
of the other radio frequency devices

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:04.495
that are currently on the market, which were
a much different experience I'll say.

00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.601
They really enjoy having the treatment.
Which means that it's easy for them

00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:12.625
in terms of compliance and coming back
and having more treatments.
