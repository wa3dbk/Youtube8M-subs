00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.500
Now we are going to proceed with introducing
you to the design that we are going to be

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.290
putting on my client's skin and how we are
going to get that design onto the skin. This

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.339
is the design that we are going to use. It's
a small simple design which I highly recommend.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:27.589
Any entry level tattoo artist to keep it as
simple as possible when you start. Maybe black

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:36.110
out line and one maybe two colors. Doing a
good quality tattoo even if it is not really

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.490
detailed is extremely important. Everybody
talks about good tattoo work but everybody

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:48.080
will talk about bad tattoo works so I want
everybody to keep that in mind. What we are

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:56.650
going to use to transfer this image on to
the skin is what is called transfer paper.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.700
This can only be acquired from tattoo supply
shops such as World Wide Tattoo. This is where

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.330
I get this. It is really inexpensive. It is
like $7.00 for 25 sheets. For a hundred sheets

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.710
it is under $20, so you are cool there. This
is the package by the way. This is what the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:28.650
paper actually looks like. It has tracing
paper on the top, a sheet of rice paper in

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.900
the middle that is to be removed and then
you've got the carbon. This is not carbon

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.050
paper. Do not use carbon paper. It is a waste
of time. You get frustrated and whoever you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.530
are tattooing is going to get frustrated and
you are just going to waste your time. You

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.760
have to get this from a tattoo supply shop.
That is the only place you can get it at least

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.090
what I've found. Here is our tattoo design
and in order to transfer it, what you are

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.830
going to do is turn the tracing paper side
up and this can be done in many ways but this

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.399
is the best way that I've found. You are going
to insert this underneath the paper, your

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:17.450
drawing and you must keep the rice paper or
whatever kind of insert is there, to keep

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.040
the hexograph material from getting all over
the place and keep in mind that it does get

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.531
all over the place. So we've got the design
now we are going to lay the tracing paper

00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:37.750
over like this. Now you can take this, you
don't have to but if you are working on a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:46.790
solid surface, I would highly advise it. Now
you are just going to trace the item and when

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:57.940
you trace it, you are going to want to trace
it using the same type of application of motion

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.143
as you are going to do when you tattoo. That
is a good habit. Here, so you are going to

00:03:03.143 --> 00:03:11.810
rest your hand down. Slowly you are going
to do one stroke each line. As you can see

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:25.959
coming down, finishing it here, come up, down
and stop. Come around, down, stop. Each line

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.530
and this is the same as tattooing, you are
going to want to start it, do a sweeping motion

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:47.350
and finish it. Don't stop midway. We are going
to go here, here, around like this. As you

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.739
can see the design starts to come through.
Now this is just the beginning process of

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.040
this so that you are able to get it on to
the tracing paper.
