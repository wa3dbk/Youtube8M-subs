00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.779
After a hurricane has formed, the National
Weather Service will issue a Hurricane Watch

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.779
if hurricane conditions are possible in your
area within forty-eight hours.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.420
This is a good time to restock any emergency
supplies, and review your emergency plan.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.760
Gather important documents â€“ like the deed
to your home and insurance policies â€“ and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.100
pack up your pets, medicines, and other essential
items and be prepared to evacuate if the orders

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.890
are given.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.280
A Hurricane Warning is issued when hurricane
conditions are expected within thirty-six

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.720
hours. If a warning is issued, take immediate
action. Secure your home, close storm shutters,

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.620
and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.940
Ensure a supply of water for sanitary purposes,
such as cleaning, and flushing toilets. Fill

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.509
the bathtub and other larger containers with
water.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.100
Stay indoors during the hurricane, and away
from windows and glass doors. Keep curtains

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.760
and blinds closed. Close all interior doors.
Secure and brace external doors.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.020
If you live near the coast, remember that
storm surge is the deadliest part of a hurricane,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.410
so do not go outside.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.220
Do not be fooled if there is a lull. It could
be the eye of the storm. Winds will pick up

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.780
again.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.160
Continue to listen to your weather radio for
information or instructions from your local officials. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.380
Check your phone for mobile alerts.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.320
Safety is job number one. Get Weather Ready.
