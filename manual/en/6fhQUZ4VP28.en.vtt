00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.270
Hello, this is Sami with special needs apps
for kids (now BridgingApps.org).

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.570
In order to register
your iPad you're going to need a computer

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.570
that has iTunes.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.620
You're going to
need your iPad and cable, and you're going

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.360
to need your Apple ID password.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.749
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to undo the multifunction

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.579
cable, and that's pretty easy.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:28.279
I'm going to plug one end into the iPad,
and you can see right there.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.779
Notice this cable there's going to be a
little cable symbol.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.329
It's going be a little cable icon here on
one side

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.280
and that's how you know it's up.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.190
Let me plug that in, so I plugged it in
there.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:53.210
The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to find the USB connector on

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.559
the computer.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.039
So I'm going to plug that in.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:06.170
The last thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to turn on the computer.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.229
You can see, once I've turned on
the computer, that the iPad has done something,

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.160
and the computers actually
launched up iTunes.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.969
That's the first thing that's happened.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.320
Now one of of
the things I've already done with this machine

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.880
is I've already log into
iTunes, and I have an iTunes account.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.200
So you're going to need an iTunes
account, you're going to need and iPod, you're

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.369
going to need a computer and
you going to need a power cable.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.110
The first thing you going to do, it actually
sees the iPad here, and that's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.719
what I'm doing here.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.840
You want to register the iPad and then set
up the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.409
iTunes account store.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.200
So I'm going to go ahead and register.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.899
I'm going to
accept the licensee agreement, click okay

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.649
and hit continue.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.969
Then, once
doing right now is it's pulling up the account

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:02.580
so, I had already logged
into the iTunes account previously with this

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.789
computer.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.200
If you didn't, it
would ask you to create an account and I'll

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.850
do that for a later video.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.780
But
what we have here is the login, I'm going

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.730
to turn the video off while I log
in.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.720
So I have typed in a login, and now I'm going
to log in.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.870
That's my Apple
ID, my password , and I'm going to hit continue.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.690
It's going to pull up
some statistics I'm going to confirm my address.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.800
I don't want news , I'm
going to turn that off.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.360
Then you can choose to give them questions
about

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.360
the registration.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.230
I've already gone through all of this I'm
just going to

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.100
leave that as is.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.440
I'm going to hit submit.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.670
I'm going to name this iPad,
Arbor school iPad five.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.990
It says automatically sync songs to iPad.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.230
We're
going to turn that off because I don't have

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.260
songs here.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.870
Then add new photos, I'm going to turn that
off.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.973
Automatically sync apps,
I'm going to leave that turned.

00:03:08.973 --> 00:03:11.480
Automatically sync songs I've turned off.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.060
For you if you want to add some songs for
your kids that's on here, you can

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.060
do that.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.370
I turned it off I only add some of the songs
for my kids, and

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.890
then I turn off the photos and I only had
some of the photos.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.440
So you can
put a folder on here that says photos for

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.600
iPad and just think that instead
of all of them.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.790
Then automatically sync apps I definitely
want to do that.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.790
So then I want to click done.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.310
What it's doing right now, up here is finishing
the syncing process you can

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.930
see on the iPad itself.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.980
It says syncing in progress.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.930
This may take a
little bit to do.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.700
This is it basically, then it starts to give
me some

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.700
messages.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.320
The app wheels was not installed on the iPad
Arbor school file

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:08.080
because you are not authorized for it on this
computer.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.980
So, I think that's it.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.010
It says "iPad sync complete, OK to disconnect".

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.579
So
that is registering your iPad, so, your iPod

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.090
is now registered and I can
prove that so that when I un-hook this, so

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.639
I want to power this on.

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.191
All I
have to do is just hit this button and unlock.

00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:38.919
Now, because this is
registered, it's now booting up with the Apple

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:39.919
screen.

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.070
Then it gives me
some messages I can clear through.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.070
All right.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.229
Thank you.
