00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.480
Most people who live in Perry County probably never has been down in a cave.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.919
They live on an unique environment.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.019
There is a lot different things going on underneath their very feet.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.170
It has got the most caves within the state 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.060
and the three longest caves are found here in Perry County.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.070
The caves here were formed over millions
of years

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.730
born and fed by water that flows from the surface. 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.310
And in the streams that flow through these caves

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.130
people exploring them made a fascinating find -

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.070
a fish never before recorded.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.250
The Grotto Sculpin were first discovered in the early 1990s, when cavers 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.800
that were caving in this area, first brought those sculpin to the attention of

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.310
researchers. It's the only know location

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.880
 for these sculpin. 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.410
Caves are very unique environments. When you go underground and there's the lack 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.700
of light, 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.530
it's a completely different world.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.960
The Grotto Sculpin are unique because they are in the transition phase.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.490
They are actually evolving and adapting to the cave environment. 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.760
And that makes a very unique. It's an
interesting way to study them

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.520
to look at what is going on and to actually get some detail 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.610
in terms of the progress and what happens over time.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.990
The starting point for the Grotto Sculpin 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.890
from a biological perspective, 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.650
is the Banded Sculpin.  

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.650
They reside on the surface nearby.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.440
The Banded Sculpin live on the bottom of streams.  

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.380
They get their name from the banding on the side of the fish. And 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.960
they often have large eyes situated on the top of the head for seeing their 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.759
prey.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.049
Typical Banded Sculpin have dark pigmentation that allows them 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.580
to blend in well into the substrate to
avoid

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.270
getting eaten by other species.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.330
Some of these fish 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.980
moved to caves.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.140
Over time, through generations, the sculpin that migrated there 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.370
started to change to meet the challenges of the underground world they now call 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.359
home.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.460
They differ from a typical surface Banded Sculpin. 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.389
They have reduced pigmentation,

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.189
reduction in eye size, 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.650
and enlarged lateral line pores, which allows them to sense their environment 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.509
without having use of their own eyes.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:33.829
As they 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.339
adapt to that cave environment we expect that over time we'll see more and 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:38.630
more individuals

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.419
that have smaller eyes that lack pigmentation -- that show those unique cave adaptations.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.009
With the Grotto Sculpin, 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.499
these biologists have a rare opportunity
in these caves

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:54.679
to witness and record the process of biological change as it happens.  

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.389
But for all that transpires underground, 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:02.549
it is still the surface that may hold the key to the future of this beautiful and complex 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.180
environment.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.290
I think one of the most important aspects of cave protection, particularly in a place 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.959
like Perry County, is just that people are aware 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.419
of the cave systems, aware that runoff from the 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.839
surface directly impacts the caves.

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.739
So as you go about your life here on the surface, 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.680
remember that the beauty and wonder of Missouri 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.739
is more than skin deep.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.849
There is a fascinating world,

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.989
one of incredible sights and unique life

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.249
that lies beneath us.
