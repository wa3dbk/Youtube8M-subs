Style Transformation Story - Young Los Angles
Man Improves Appearance Inexpensively - Style

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:02.969
Tips

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:03.969
Hi!

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:04.969
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:09.040
Today, I'm going to be reading you a letter
I received from a young, sharp-dressed man

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.040
in Los Angeles.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.850

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.419
This is a letter that came in.

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.079
I get quite a few letters and a lot of people
telling me about their experience and their

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.750
journey, but I really like this one for two
reasons.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.260
Number one, he doesn’t have a whole lot
of money and he talks about how he was able

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.240
to rebuild his wardrobe without spending much
money at all, and the other part is the influence

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.330
it had on his family.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.460
I'll talk a little bit about those right after
the letter.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.910
"Hello, Antonio!

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.890
I'm a 26-year-old man living in Los Angeles.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.579
Not too long ago, I was wearing jeans, shirts,
rubber shoes, and I didn’t really put too

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.160
much emphasis on my style.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.739
I dressed shabbily and I never noticed.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.710
Trucker hats were a staple of my wardrobe
because I found it easier to rush out the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.330
door and cover my hair than to style it.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.390
One day, my girlfriend told me she wanted
to get out of our relationship.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.750
She mentioned that my dress was one of the
factors in her decision.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.290
I realized that my father had been right.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.360
Be a man and dress nice."

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.140
"I always had the clothes in my drawers and
closets, so why not figure out how to put

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.960
everything together and get my sizes right?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.290
I dug into your website, watched your videos,
read your articles.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.970
I even picked up a copy of 'Dressing the Man'
by Alan Flusser and tore into it late in the

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.479
night, which has surprised everyone because
I hardly ever read.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.130
I didn’t even have to pay for it.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.380
My local library had it, so I've been studying
for the last few weeks.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.770
Thank you for the review; it is a great book."

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.560
"Now, I haven't got much financially, so at
first, I really didn’t know about how to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.830
go getting a wardrobe together, but in one
of your videos, you mentioned thrift stores.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.770
And so, although I had always gone to these
with my parents as a youngster, but suddenly

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.830
stopped going, I decided to jump in and to
see what was out there.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.709
To my surprise, I now have a wonderful suit,
no alterations necessary, a few Brooks Brothers

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.540
shirts, and I recently came into possession
of a Thomas Pink shirt.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.540
Quality over quantity is something you've
now imprinted in my mind.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.440
I've been hemming my jeans and trousers, a
skill I picked up from my mother, and making

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.209
sure all of my clothes fit me properly."

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.550
"My mom is excited to see how I'm dressing
now.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.680
Every time I come by the house, my father
keeps digging through his own wardrobe to

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.040
see if there's anything that I can fit and
that I can use.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.460
He also gave me some great shoes.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.450
The short time I've been dressing properly
has made a huge impact on how others view

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.570
me, both in my personal life and my work.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.530
You're right when you say that dressing nice
does boost self-esteem.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.560
I went to a wedding a few days ago and everyone
was complimenting me on my attire.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.150
I walked into the reception and everyone looked
at me, and the night included numerous questions

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.940
as to how I created this wardrobe.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.160
All I told them to do was check out your website."

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.580
"I've even inspired my best friend to go shopping
with me and find his own wardrobe, and my

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.239
father is now also looking through his closet
to wear his very best.

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.489
I thank you for starting me on this journey
and I know it will last a lifetime.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.690
Juan."

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.090
All right.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.030
I really like that story, again, for two reasons.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.980
One is you heard Juan doesn’t have a whole
lot of money, but yet he was able to take

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.980
the skills.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.980
He built an education.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.450
He went to his local library and found some
of the books I've suggested.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.910
He went through my website, checked out all
these videos that's all for free.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.790
First, he invested in himself.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.239
Then he went out to thrift stores once he
kind of had a plan of action and he found

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.239
items.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.239
He knew what to look for.

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.810
He found a suit that didn’t even need alterations.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.170
He was able to identify quality shirts and
he started piecing his wardrobe together.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.569
And really quick, it sounds like he didn’t
go to a seamstress or a tailor.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.670
He actually started sewing some of his own
clothing, which a lot of people think it's

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.470
almost impossible, but it's really not that
difficult.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.630
So if you're out there and you don't have
a whole lot of money, that is always an option.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.740
Just buy something cheap and practice on it.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.680
The other thing I think that Juan is really
learning is that every journey of a thousand

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.690
miles begins with a single step.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.020
And so, he is building up his self-confidence
at home.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.220
It's helping him with his relationships with
others.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.970
And when you can do this, when you start to
feel this self-confidence, all of a sudden,

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.440
you walk differently.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.250
It affects so many other parts of your life.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.380
Now, I'm really excited for Juan because I
think this is a great skill to have in an

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.610
early point.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.530
Look how it's already affecting his father,
how it's affecting his friends.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.800
And I can tell you that this man is going
to soon probably have a new girlfriend or

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.500
have other people in his life.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.410
He's on a great path and I'm excited to see
that.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.720
So if you haven't already, make sure to go
check out Real Men Real Style, that blog.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.800
I've got tons of information over there, podcasts.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.410
I've got some e-books in addition to the current
e-book I give away for free.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.510
I've got a premium e-book.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.540
The great part about that, it comes with a
14-hour audio.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.290
I've got a group on LinkedIn, which is for
professionals and we talk about business dress.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.560
I've also got a Facebook page and we're going
to be putting out a really cool Google Plus

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.270
page here soon with a lot of unique information
that's not even here on YouTube.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.460
Wherever you're at, again, begin your journey
and I wish you the best of luck in dressing

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.460
sharp.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.460
I'll see you in the next video.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.461
Bye-bye.
