00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.560
This video explains how to set up your printer to use ePrint services.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.210
ePrint is a free service that allows you to print documents and photos from any mobile

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.930
or network connected device to your HP ePrint-enabled printer.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.270
Before you can use ePrint, you must perform a product update from the printer's control

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.990
panel to ensure that your printer has the most up-to-date functionality.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.190
Before you can begin the update process, your printer must be connected to the Internet

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.380
though a wired or wireless network connection. Because connecting your printer to a network

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.270
is unique for each system configuration, we will not provide those instructions here.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.270
To begin the update process, touch the Setup Menu icon, which looks like a wrench.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.600
Touch Preferences.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.059
Touch the down arrow to access more menu options.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.969
Touch Product Updates to manually update the printer.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.920
Touch Yes to apply the update if one is available.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.289
The printer will download the update, and then install it. The printer might restart

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.170
after the update has finished installing.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.289
If you have not previously updated the printer, you might need to download additional updates.

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.450
Repeat the previous steps to check for and install any additional updates. You should

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.520
check for updates every week to make sure that you are getting the most out of your

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.130
HP printer.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.389
When the message, “Your printer has the most current updates installed.” is displayed

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:20.450
on the control panel, touch OK.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.509
The next step is to enable web services. Web services must be enabled on your HP printer

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.920
in order to use the service.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.009
Touch the Web Services Settings icon in the upper left of the control panel.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.069
Touch Enable Web Services.

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.149
Touch Yes to accept the terms of use.

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.659
An information page will print out.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.409
The information page contains the printer code you will use to register your printer

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.179
at the HP ePrintCenter.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.299
The next step is to register at the HP ePrintCenter. When you register at the HP ePrintCenter,

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.889
you can customize your ePrint settings, view and manage

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:01.189
your ePrint print jobs, and add new print apps to your printer.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.139
From your computer open the web browser of your choice, such as Internet Explorer.

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:13.139
Type www.hpeprintcenter.com and press Enter on your keyboard.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.969
In the upper right corner of the web page, click the Sign In button.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.560
A Sign In to ePrintCenter page opens.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.670
Click Create an account from the right side of the page.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.920
The Create an HP Web Services account page opens.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.189
Enter your information in the text fields provided.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.120
In the Screen Name field, use a name of your choice. This name is a unique identifier for

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.569
you on the HP ePrintCenter web page. If a name is already registered by another user,

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.500
you will be asked to choose a different screen name.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.370
Make sure to use a password that you can easily remember.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.750
After entering all information and you have agreed with the terms of the site, click Create

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.469
Account.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.579
The Add a Printer to your Account page opens.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.489
Using the information page you previously printed out, type your printer code in the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.810
‘Enter Printer Code' text box, and click OK.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.400
A screen confirming that your printer has been added to HP's ePrintCenter will appear.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.749
Click Next.

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.840
At this point you can enter a custom email address for your printer. You will first need

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.340
to clear the text box before entering your custom email address.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.909
You will use this email address when you send print jobs to your printer using ePrint.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.829
Once you have entered a custom email address, click the Check button to see if the email

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.609
address you entered is available for you to use.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.129
If the email address is currently in use by another ePrint user, you will be asked to

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.489
enter a different email address.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.159
Once you have checked an email address that is available, click Save to add this email

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.310
address to your account.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.859
The HP ePrint Settings page opens.

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.829
Using the menu on the HP ePrint Settings page, you can customize your ePrint options, including

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.279
printer options and adjusting who can send print jobs

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:03.249
to your printer. Once you have adjusted your desired settings, click Save.

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:07.420
After clicking Save, you will return to the HP ePrint Center where you can now manage

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.459
your ePrint settings, print jobs, and print apps.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.870
Your printer is now set up to use ePrint services.
