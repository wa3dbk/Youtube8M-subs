Hello my friends and welcome 
to another Tuesday of tutorial!

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.450
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and today we will
draw an eye with color pencils and pastel.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.240
We start with a guideline slightly tilted.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.040
Remember that the part of the eye that is toward
the center of the face is a little bit lower.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.040
Then we sketch the shape.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.920
We draw a circle for the iris. Normally the
lower part is visible and the upper part is

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.670
partially covered. We do the pupil with a
reflection, and then we erase the lines that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.370
we don't need anymore.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.160
We can start giving color and texture to the
iris, and at the same time with the other

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.000
hands we can sketch what goes around the eye.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.290
I really don't want the left 
hand to help me with the eye.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.370
I said no!

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.120
[ahhhhhhh] Oh, no, the last thing I need is
a tribe of angry fingers!

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.770
Hey! Don't erase it!

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.190
You draw the the paper around the eye, rather.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.769
I give some tones of brown, blue, and ochre to the
iris, while the tribe is shading and smudging.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.900
Although they don't like that.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.600
[Uhhhhhhh]

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.500
Hey those eyes were not part of the plan!

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.070
We smudge to soften.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.370
In this drawing I am using a combination 
of color pencils and pastel pencils.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.419
Color pencils are great for the detail, 
however they don't smudge hardly at all. 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:35.499
Therefore, when I want smudging, 
I use the pastel pencils.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.499
The complete list of materials for this drawing
is in the information below the video.

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.529
We continue working the colors and shading.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.419
I said no!

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.439
Let's tone the background with pencil.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.079
We smudge it with a brush so we can 
pull lights with the kneaded eraser.

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:34.770
The lights are hardly visible, so we 
need to darken a little bit more.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.980
That's better.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.580
We may also pull some reflections, 
which give life.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.930
I don't like the upper eyelid so blue, 
so I put some skin color on it.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.330
And with a black pencil, let's do the lashes.

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.819
If you would like to help me, please share
this video on Facebook, Twitter, etcetera.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.389
Thank you!

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:22.389
We draw some capillary in red, some final
reflections which we smudge, and its ready!

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.190
[Ahhhhh!]

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.610
Please let me know what 
do you think about it.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.850
