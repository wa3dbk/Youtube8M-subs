00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.520
Here’s the bottom of a milk carton.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.840
We’re going to make a top with it.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.680
Mothers and children can have fun making things together.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.740
Avoiding the areas where the paper is doubled and hard, fold the bottom crosswise. Fold the bottom, but not where it is doubled and thick.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.540
Fold twice.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.940
It will be a little pointed, like this.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.440
Here’s a strip of paper from a milk carton. Fold in half. Then fold the ends slightly outward to make a base.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.120
Tape it to the thick part of the bottom.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.060
Then color or draw a favorite picture.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:38.900
Let’s make the corners red

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.120
and add some blue.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.100
Now hold it by this tip
To make it spin. Hold it here to make it spin.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.360
If you hold it by the flat part, 
it won’t spin fast

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.260
So, hold it on the sides like this. .=&gt; Hold it on the sides and then spin.
That will make it faster.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.220
