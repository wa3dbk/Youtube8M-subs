Hello! My name is Grady Johnson and I'm a
professional painter. And today I'm representing

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.559
expertvillage.com. Now I want to talk a little
bit about cutting in an interior wall. Now,

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.980
whenever you're rolling you need to cut in
all of these edges first. Now this includes

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.840
the baseboards and the sides of the door jambs.
Cut in every edge that you're going to roll

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.720
up to. That way every thing's gonna cover.
Don't try to do that with a roller. It leaves

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.660
a texture that gets on wood that doesn't look
good. It's going to make it look like an alligator

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.829
hide. So you want to be sure and cut every
thing in really, really well. So get yourself

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.430
a full brush and pat that into your brush.
Cut yourself in a nice square line. Don't

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.680
get any up on the ceiling and you just run
your line. Now, the trick to this is to run

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.190
a line just below the edge first and you get
a nice big bead. Then, run your line up there

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.020
from that line. There we go. Then, just even
that on out. Now, if you miss it up don't

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.670
worry about it. You can always fix it later
and bring that on down a full brush width.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.160
You want to bring the corner down as well
and even that on out. Now you're going to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.880
take and even out all those little marks you
made. When you went on, you made marks. So

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:28.430
we're going to take those off and that's called
lapping off the paint. You can see, we worked

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.930
the paint off to the ends of the brush and
then lay your brush out. Even that on out.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.000
Now, remember you can see that these hairs
are just below the line that we cut. Once

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.060
you got that line cut, don't get back up in
there. You won't have a mistake and then just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.860
even it off. Now see, I made a mark when I
went on like that. So I'm going to take and

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.720
lap that off and even on out. Then, I'm just
going to continue to cut my line on down in

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.610
this manner. So I want to get the sides of
the door jamb and just go ahead and lap that

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:09.259
up on there. You want to be sure and lap,
make sure that laps out so it doesn't lap

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.440
up on you and we're bring up the rest of the
jamb. But this is basically every thing that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.810
I need to remember. This is how we cut in
the interior walls of our house.
