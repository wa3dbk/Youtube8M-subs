00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.030
In this video we test the normal light and
low light performance of the DPRO-92311 indoor

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.420
dome CCTV camera.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:16.340
The DPRO-92311 supports 650 TV lines of resolution
and has a fixed 3.6mm lens which provides

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.690
a 90-degree field of view.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.720
Let's get started.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.470
I start with all the lights on in the office
and I'm about 20 feet away there when I start

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.430
and I approach the camera and I stop at about
6 or 7 feet away.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.500
You could see the camera has great color performance.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.039
It looks great with all the lights on.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.699
I turn the lights off now and we'll give the
camera a second to switch over to night mode,

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.219
which will be black and white.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.339
There it goes right there.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.179
All the lights are off in the room right now.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.339
I have a few computer monitors on and the
door cracked about halfway open to let some

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.539
ambient light in from the hallway.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.300
You can see, although the picture is a little
grainy, you can see me quite clearly, so this

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.890
camera does work pretty well in low light.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.299
I'm going to turn the lights back on and we'll
give it a second to switch back to daytime

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.280
color mode.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.009
There it goes, and we're back to color.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.300
This is the DPRO-92311 that was just tested.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.920
It's medium size when compared to other indoor
dome models, maybe a little on the small side

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
even.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.729
As far as the video quality, I'm really impressed
with the daytime performance that it provided,

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.909
and I have to say that I was also quite pleased
with the low light performance as well.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.369
Although the picture was a little bit grainy
in low light, I was able to make out objects

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.689
in the room quite well, and I was not expecting
that.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.859
I would recommend this camera mostly for surveillance
installations where most or all of the recording

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.600
will be done with at least some of the lights
on in the room.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.649
Although the low light performance is good,
you can get excellent low light and even zero

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.979
low light performance from one of our dome
infrared cameras.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:11.640
