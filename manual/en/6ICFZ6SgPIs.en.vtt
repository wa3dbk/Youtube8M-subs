00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.250
Motorola W7 Active Edition.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.390
Aimed at markets in Asia and Latin America,
the Motorola W7 Active Edition is one of only

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.380
a small handful of GSM devices to be announced
by Motorola this year.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.250
However, there is no indication that the W7
will be sold in Europe or North America, which

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.570
demonstrates Motorola's continuing retreat
from these important markets.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.830
The Motorola W7's key selling feature is the
built-in accelerometer.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.290
This allows users to use hand gestures, flicks
and taps to control the handset's functions.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.250
Motorola gives an example of setting the favourite
application as the media player, two shakes

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.300
of the phone will start the player and flicking
the handset left or right will jump between

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.469
tracks.

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.960
Other applications use gesture control too,
and the accelerometer also works with the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.239
W7's Personal Trainer application, and it
can be used in gaming too.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.620
These gesture controls do make the W7 a little
bit cool, although at its heart this is a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:18.140
fairly simple but useful 3G device with a
2.2" 240 x 320 pixel display, 2 megapixel

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.969
main camera, video calling camera, microSD
expandable memory, stereo Bluetooth, a multimedia

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.060
player and FM radio.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.500
There's no 3.5G support on the W7, but it
does come in three different WCDMA / UMTS

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.789
variants to suit local markets.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.770
The design of the Motorola W7 is the sort
of thing that will polarise opinions.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.609
We actually rather like it - there's a nod
to classic Motorola designs of the past combined

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.859
with something fresh.

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:56.310
Motorola say that there are two colours available,
Licorice (in other words: black and silver)

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.119
and colour scheme called "Alpine White" which
is a combination of white, black and yellow.

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.619
The Motorola W7 is designed to provide entertainment
on the go, and the music player can support

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.929
most major playback formats.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.470
It works with an optional stereo Bluetooth
headset, which will stop wires snagging while

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.630
exercising.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.170
Talktime on 3G is about 3.5 hours, with up
to 12 days standby time.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.150
If you use the Motorola W7 on GSM only then
you can get a useful 8 hours talktime out

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.180
of the device.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.390
Although initially we were a bit disappointed
in the technical specifications of the W7,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.390
the gesture control does seem to be worth
a look, and it certainly makes an interesting

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.890
alternative to all those touchscreen phones
that we have been seeing lately.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.172
Motorola say that the W7 should be available
during the second quarter of 2009, or in other

00:02:49.172 --> 00:02:51.800
words.. sometime in the next 7 weeks or so.
