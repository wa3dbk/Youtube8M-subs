00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:07.027
Don’t come home drunk. 
It’s no good to your body.

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:08.977
Ok.

00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:14.468
What is it?

00:00:14.468 --> 00:00:17.668
Huh? My cell phone.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:24.811
Where is it?

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:29.983
You don’t need a perfume, Mom.

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:32.953
Don’t need?  I’m a woman.

00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:39.960
Look, people will find you indecent 
when you put this on.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.296
You think I’m a fool?

00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:46.033
Pearls before swine. 
You think perfume suits you?

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:49.924
What? Why not?

00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:51.271
I can just wear it if I want.

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:52.673
But you have nowhere to go with it.

00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:54.074
I’ll wear it at home.

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:57.210
Oh, come on…

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.881
I know what is good. And I remember what people said on TV.

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:04.985
They said old women need to wear perfume to smell good.

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:12.192
Without this, you smell good enough. Scent of soap!

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:18.165
Who’s the wretch this time? 
Are you itchy to cheat on your wife again?

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:21.001
It’s not what you think. I was going to 
give it to a chef in my hotel.

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.638
She could give me nice food for it.

00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:31.828
If you cheat again, you’ll be really sorry 
in front of your daughter-in-law.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.048
I am not as young as before.

00:01:35.048 --> 00:01:38.094
Feed me well if you want to preach me, ok?

00:01:38.904 --> 00:01:41.688
How dare you steal my stuff…

00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:43.023
I didn’t steal.

00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:45.726
Then what?

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:49.963
If this disappears, I’ll call you to account.

00:01:49.963 --> 00:01:54.201
Why me? Heja can take it as well.

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:57.124
She won’t do that!

00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:58.931
How are you so sure? How?

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:02.486
Just go. I’m sick of you.

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:37.878
Did I snore severely?

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:40.080
No.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.094
Are you going to take shower?

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:44.952
Of course I am, as usual.

00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:46.887
Your neck should be okay…

00:02:46.887 --> 00:02:49.856
Don’t worry. It’s not severe.

00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:51.091
Well, honey…

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:51.825
Yeah?

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:55.114
Honey…Prop your neck like this.

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:57.130
Why?

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.124
Just because…

00:03:03.403 --> 00:03:05.939
Don’t be shy. Do I smell alcohol?

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.076
No. You smell good.

00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:14.081
Kiss me back, please.

00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:21.588
You are the same as on our first date.

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:54.297
What, what is this?

00:04:04.398 --> 00:04:06.066
Honey!

00:04:13.024 --> 00:04:16.310
What happened to my hair? 
Who did this to me?

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.978
Not me.

00:04:17.978 --> 00:04:19.780
It’s me.

00:04:21.914 --> 00:04:23.216
Why?

00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:24.952
To rejuvenate you.

00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:26.954
How could you 
not even ask of my opinion?

00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:30.224
I did, several times. 
And every time you said no.

00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:32.960
Then why? You are so rude!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.462
You can dye my hair while I’m sleeping.

00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:38.832
You can try different colors on me, 
like black, red or gold...

00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:40.634
Shut up!

00:04:45.904 --> 00:04:47.708
What did you do?

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.076
I told her to stop.

00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:50.114
By words only?

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:54.348
Should I have spanked her? I said DON’T,

00:04:54.348 --> 00:05:03.056
but I woke up in the morning 
to find your hair dyed. I was shocked too.

00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:07.561
She couldn’t do this all by herself, 
could she?

00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:10.297
Goodsoon, show us how you did it.

00:05:10.297 --> 00:05:14.101
Honey, lie down. 
Actually I was curious about it...

00:05:15.435 --> 00:05:17.471
You want me to show you, Dad?

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.609
Didn’t you give me a sleeping drug?

00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:23.911
No…

00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:27.541
You were dead drunk last night, 
totally unconscious.

00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:29.283
My arms ache.

00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:30.717
Keep them up!

00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:36.857
Dad, you should shampoo.

00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:37.871
Huh?

00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:47.935
Who said you can lower your arms? 
Keep them up.

00:05:47.935 --> 00:05:48.835
Ok!

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.046
What happened to your face? 
Did you have a fight?

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:03.894
Two thugs demanded for money. 
We exchanged some blows.

00:06:22.002 --> 00:06:23.002
How’s Dad?

00:06:23.014 --> 00:06:26.740
No idea. I couldn’t face him.

00:06:31.014 --> 00:06:34.084
We can live in peace without you.

00:06:34.615 --> 00:06:37.084
Ask him to kick me out.

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:39.044
We have a vacant apartment, don’t we?

00:06:54.924 --> 00:06:56.503
Dad!

00:06:58.894 --> 00:07:01.241
Who are you?

00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:03.343
Don’t overact.

00:07:03.343 --> 00:07:04.444
We’re not.

00:07:04.444 --> 00:07:06.079
Dad, hold on.

00:07:06.094 --> 00:07:07.147
Take that away.

00:07:07.147 --> 00:07:11.518
I want to show you to my friends.

00:07:11.518 --> 00:07:16.064
Dad, please smile.

00:07:24.598 --> 00:07:27.601
Now you two look good together.

00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:29.503
How about before?

00:07:29.503 --> 00:07:34.341
Frankly speaking, since you suffered a lot when you were young,

00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.977
you looked much older than her, 
like by 15 years.

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:38.278
Who cares?

00:07:38.278 --> 00:07:41.448
You didn’t care. 
But didn’t she care either?

00:07:44.418 --> 00:07:47.754
Honey, you look like a new groom.

00:07:47.754 --> 00:07:49.957
I’m no new groom without you.

00:07:52.726 --> 00:07:58.198
Come home early tonight. 
I’ll be mad if you get drunk.

00:07:58.198 --> 00:07:59.533
Ok.

00:08:01.768 --> 00:08:04.638
I’ll show it to my classmates.

00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:06.974
Then take a picture properly in the couch.

00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:08.944
Can we?
