00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.900
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: I wanted to say how sweet that
you are

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.400
this is the sweetest man in the whole world

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.440
his energy is just wonderful and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.209
that's all I can say

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.000
you are enough to sell me any bottle of shampoo

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: I'm here basically as your consultation

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Yes

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.300
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: I am not going to sell you anything

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.419
we're basically going to like give you

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.529
the spokes in a wheel

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.460
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.360
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: I want to volumize your hair double what
it is

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.309
the thickness is really gorgeous and the condition
is great

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:31.040
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: This is going to be the before

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.050
and then you are going to see the after later

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.989
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Yeah so let's get all the before

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.079
what I'd like to do is like

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.739
give you the dates to trim the ends once a
season

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.989
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:41.800
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: So I'm going to do that

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.269
so the next shaping you're going to do

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.200
is going to be

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.500
for the spring equinox

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.100
I'll give you that date

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.929
and then you basically you can cut your own
hair

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.300
do you cut your own hair

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: No

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.219
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Yeah so when it's wet

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.400
all you have to do is bring it down

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.890
and then just take it

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.000
hold it and just snip the ends

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
because you don't need to cut much off

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you want to seal the ends so they don't break

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then that's about 18 to 20 acupuncture
treatments

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.200
every time you cut it during the equinox

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.400
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Then the equinox solstice for you

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.500
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: You're going to use the scalp massager

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
for blood and air into the scalp

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.500
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: This is like 100 percent rubber

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.300
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay perfect beautiful

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.000
so you just

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Yeah just place it there exactly

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.500
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Awesome this is like

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: You have beautiful hair

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.500
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Thank you

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.100
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: You just really want to like

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.000
really bring it up to the next level

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.800
with Morrocco Method

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.300
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: This is beautiful

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Then we're going to alternate the
five shampoos

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.460
so we have fire air earth water ether

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.000
and some of them you're really going to like
a lot more

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.300
than the others

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.000
but I would say rotate them

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.300
because Dan's basically stuck with the Pine
Shale

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.500
I'm stuck with the Chi Shampoo that's my favorite

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.990
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: I think I am going to need the
Sea and the Chi the most

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.340
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Yeah but we still alternate

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.730
that's what I got ready for you

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.300
the Sea and the Chi

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.920
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.700
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: But you can alternate the others

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.320
the same thing with the five conditioners

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.000
they're like spokes in a wheel

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and we're going to get you to brush

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Brush?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Really nice more natural boar bristle
brush

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and we have special directions how to bend
over

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and brush because a lot of the sebaceous gland
oils

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
are in the nape because our skin is so thick
back here

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and it's really thin in the hair line

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so you want to take the excess oil out

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.900
brush it down to the ends

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.000
so your natural oils are the best in the world

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
you brush them back and forth

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.500
and get it to really make your hair lubricated

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.800
you get moisturized

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.500
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: And what is your general hair regime
now

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: I usually wash about once a week

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I yeah I usually just put in like any
type of like

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
coconut oil or oil and I just let my hair
be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
free

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.300
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Good we're going to get you some
the elixir oils

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.900
I think the god and goddess series for you
would be perfect

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Then you can alternate this four
oils

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Oh I like goddesses

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
&gt;&gt;Anthony: Yep goddess energy

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and a little god to go with it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.900
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: We have the reconditioner

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the rejuvenator

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the restorer &gt;&gt;KRISTINA: How do I use these

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: The revitalizer

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: How do I use these

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: yeah so like

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
there's a whole set of instructions

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that I'm going to basically send you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.500
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Really simple

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.060
but you are going to have them as moisturizers

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.529
so for oils it'll be another

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.409
different level of moisturizer

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.000
besides from what you are doing already

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.500
Dan just started the series

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.900
and he's already growing a lot of new hair

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.000
he's pretty excited about it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Awesome

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.180
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: And then we're going to get you
the Zen Detox

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.029
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay I heard that is like a mask
right

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.450
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: It's a hair mask

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.159
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Yeah it's a hair mask

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.730
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Yeah

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.749
so like when you ladies do facials

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:48.889
and facial masks

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.419
this one is like millions of years of

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.000
decomposed volcanic clays from Italy

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.120
and the animals taught us how to use it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.000
so you basically mix it up like a cream

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
leave it over like 24 hours to hydrate

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.300
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Then put it in the scalp and hair

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:06.689
you can do your whole

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.000
I do my whole bust when I do it

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
from here all the way up

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.219
10-15 minutes

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.000
first time wash out wait a month

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.700
you can leave it in for 15 20 30 minutes

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.800
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Does it dry it out

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: No

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
you leave it more than an hour it will start
drying it out

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
yes but if it does

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
&gt;&gt;KRISTINA: Okay

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: The oils are here to rescue you
