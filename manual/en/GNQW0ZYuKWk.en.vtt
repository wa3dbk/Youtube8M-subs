Hey, it's Mike from SWISCO.com

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.680
And today, I'm going to show you how to install 40-058 Lever Handle with Deadbolt Set!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:24.480
The tools I'll be using in this exercise are a philips head screwdriver, tape measure, file, and two pliers.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.480
As you can see, the door we're working with today has a loose outside lever, some mismatched parts, and some pretty bad signs of wear and tear.

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:40.502
We're going to replace this existing hardware with the Swisco 40-058 Lever Handle with Deadbolt Set

00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:45.160
To get started, we're going to first replace the bottom portion of the lockset.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:50.911
This requires the removal of the inside handle, along with the outside lever.

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:59.314
After the bottom portion of the lockset is removed, we're going to remove the top portion, the deadbolt.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.400
If you notice the existing holes in your door are too tight for your new hardware, you can use a file to clean out the holes and make the installation a bit easier.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:23.840
Before we install the outside handle, we must set the spring inside by turning your handle toward the door's hinge, and then inserting your spindle.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.494
When selecting your spindle, be sure to choose the correct one for your door's thickness.
