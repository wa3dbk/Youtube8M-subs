 Gaming at 60fps

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.379
 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.190
Much has been made of the difference
between 1080p and under.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.650
Should we always be 1080p? Well,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.699
you know, I think it's becoming less of an issue. Realistically

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.230
the most important thing we need is smooth stable frame rates.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.769
And so with YouTube launching its new
60 frames-per-second support for its

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.029
web-based videos

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.779
what better time to check out some
really slick footage

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.100
than right about now. Here we have a
collection of our Gaming at 60fps

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.700
60 frames-per-second footage
gathered up over the last couple of years

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.700
and well, displayed to you in a montage!

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.319
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.650
 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.650
 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.620
