How To Deal With Being Overdressed - Dressing
Sharp For The Occasion - Men's Style Tips

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.480
Video

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.480
Hi!

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.480
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.480
Today, I've got a reader's question.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.309
He's asking me, "I often go to events and
I'm overdressed.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.509
Can you help me understand how to dress for
the occasion?"

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.639

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
It's not free, but it does support my business
here in Wisconsin.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.360
Okay.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.430
This is a question that came in.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.210
"Hi, Antonio!

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.800
I have a problem making good combinations
for particular occasions.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.190
Sometimes I get overdressed or underdressed
for an event.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.809
Right now, I'm having a problem making the
best combination for my graduation ceremony,

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.500
which is coming up in a few weeks.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.010
I've got a charcoal grey suit and I was wanting
to wear a black tie with a white shirt, but

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.010
sometimes it looks like a party wear dress
and not a graduation dress.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.010
What should I do?

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.100
I need help.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.910
Sincerely, Natesh."

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:22.230
All right, Natesh, my advice to you is -- and
one thing about graduations is don't mistake

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.300
-- graduations are not about you as the graduate.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.270
Oftentimes, we think it's about us.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.710
It's actually about your family and everybody,
your teachers, everybody that supported and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.710
has invested in you as a young person to make
the jump.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.140
And so, really you're not dressing for yourself.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.280
You are dressing for your family.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.450
We used to laugh about this, but I remember
it was a 6th Grade or a 7th Grade graduation

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.500
and some of the kids would go across.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.430
The families would go nuts and I'm just laughing
in the back just thinking, "Man, this must

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.170
be the first one for this family."

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.959
But seriously guys, now that I have children,
I realize how much work and effort it is raising

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.689
kids.

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.609
They don't notice it.

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:20.400
For them, it's, "Yeah, whatever," but I think
of all the graduation events that I was very

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.680
lucky to be able to make and how proud my
mom was that I was able to go across that

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.129
stage and get my bachelor, my masters, and
other places I've graduated from.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.260
Again, remember, you are dressing -- so there's
nothing wrong with what you said wearing a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.260
charcoal grey suit.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.969
I don't care where you're at in the world.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.480
This is going to look good, but there are
four things you should be paying attention

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.340
to and can help you feel more at ease so that
you don't feel overdressed or underdressed

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.930
at any occasion.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.870
Number one, you should ask.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.920
Simply ask, "Is there a dress code?"

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.239
That is the easiest way.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.069
I wish more events would make this so you
don't even have to think about it.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.129
They should have a dress code.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.980
If they don't, then you need to, number two,
research.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.409
Find out what people wore last year and the
year before.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.390
You can look at photos and quickly see how
people dressed.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.319
Just ask people around if there is a dress
code.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.769
What are they going to be wearing?

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.109
That way, you get a good feel.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.989
Number three, dress in something that can
be flexible, so perhaps instead of wearing

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.060
a suit, if you find that most people are going
to be just wearing a shirt and a pair of nice

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.579
slacks, perhaps you can just don a sports
jacket and have a tie handy.

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.810
That way, if you notice a number of people
are actually wearing suits, you can simply

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.749
put on your blazer jacket, wear a tie with
it, pocket square, you'll look and be just

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.049
fine even though other people are a little
bit more dressed up than you.

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.859
The other part is being overdressed oftentimes
is a state of mind.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:00.159
I am always overdressed not just because I'm
a custom clothier, but because I live in rural

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.159
Wisconsin.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.219
And unless I'm wearing Carhartt's and a t-shirt
and work boots, I am overdressed.

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:11.849
So when I simply walk out of my house wearing
a dress shirt with a pair of dark, raw denim

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.769
with western boots and a nice belt, I am overdressed.

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.660
I roll up my sleeves; it doesnâ€™t help.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.500
I'm going to be overdressed.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.570
Think about it.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.600
It is more of a state of mind.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.660
Be comfortable.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.500
Be comfortable around others and people are
going to forget about the clothing, but also

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.660
remember this particular event, this graduation,
you want to dress nicer than normal because

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.290
there are going to be a lot of pictures and
a lot of happy people just excited to see

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.030
you make this jump.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.030
That's my advice.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.560
Take it for what it's worth.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.250
Guys, if you've got a question about men's
style, you know where to go, mensstyleqa.com.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.460
Go check out my new website.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.980
I'd love to hear from you on it.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.440
And if you want to leave a comment, I'd love
hearing those as well, but just remember if

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.630
you have a style question, I don't really
track them in the comments anymore.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.060
I try to get back to people, but it's really
hard.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.310
YouTube just makes it difficult.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.590
All right, guys, I will see you in the next
video.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.710
Bye-bye.
