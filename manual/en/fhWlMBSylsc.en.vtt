00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.259
So with the TM-2 coming out, you might also
have read many things from music fair reports

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.860
on the TM-2 talking about layering drum sounds.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.450
But why should you layer drum sounds?

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.450
It's very simple.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:22.949
In today's music, on the radio, CDs or whatever,
any music you buy today, all kicks and snares

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.740
or at least ninety nine percent of them are
layered sounds.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.720
For instance, if you look at pictures from
studio recordings, you never see one single

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.340
bass drum microphone used for the kick sound.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.050
No, it's a couple of mics in different positions
in front of that kick.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.109
You might even have a small speaker placed
just in front of the resonant head of a kick

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.760
and it all makes one big kick sound in the
studio production.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.699
In electronic music those kicks sounds you've
been raving on, they actually consist of maybe

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.539
five or six different layers.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.350
One layer for the top end for the attack,
and even a layer like a sine wave for the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.769
bottom end.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.540
So, that's why today on the live stage you
should be able to reproduce and do the same.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.160
Now let me explain to you very simply what
layering is all about.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.340
Now, let me switch off the TM-2 and this is
the drum sound I will be using from the TD-30.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.689
This is the kick sound.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.820
The snare sound and i'm actually layering
a tambourine on top of my hi-hat sound.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:38.430
So that already is a layer because you are
combining two different sounds on top of another.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.689
OK, now, let's switch on the TM-2 and do the
same thing.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.619
This is the kick only coming from the TM-2.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.360
It's like a fat kick which enhances the attack
and more ambient sound coming from the TD-30.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.039
So this is the TM-2 only.

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.190
And now combined with the TD-30 kick.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.960
Again the TD-30 by itself.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.500
Now with the TM-2 underneath.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.840
So it's got a little bit more bottom.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.980
Same for the snare.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.989
This is the snare sound only from TD-30.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.590
And this is the one with the TM-2 included.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.090
And this is a nice thing, just by connecting
the TM-2 I can actually trigger different

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.200
sounds for the head and the rim.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.250
Which also will translate in more natural
triggering because it actually follows your

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.010
ghost notes in your playing.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.290
Ok, just to be very clear, let's first play
a beat with the kick sound and snare sound

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.270
only coming from the TD-30.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.379
So there's no TM-2.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:03.080
One, Two, three, four.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.950
now let me integrate the sounds I will be
triggering in TM-2 on top or underneath the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.360
kick and the snare of the TD-30.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.390
It will become something like this.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:29.980
One, two, three, four.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.879
Without!

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.780
With!

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.689
Without!

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.409
Again for the bass players, I will play it
very slow.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.830
This is like, without.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.960
ok, and now with triggering.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.540
It goes something like this.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:34.520
With the music it sounds something like this.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.260
And this is only an example with electronic
drums.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.650
Imagine the possibilities of layering sounds
with your acoustic drums like it's been done

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.880
in the studio for many, many years.
