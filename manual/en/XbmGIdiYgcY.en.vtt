00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.910
Welcome to The Daily.
It's Friday, July 15th.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.090
With Greg Lalas, I'm Jason Saghini.
A big day up in Toronto yesterday.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.360
Toronto making some moves.
Bringing in Canadian international Terry Dunfield.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.260
And Ryan Johnson from the San Jose Earthquakes.
Johnson part of a big trade that sent three

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.490
players in the other direction.
Well Jason.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.700
Aaron Winter looking to make those changes
he's been talking about.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.510
In terms of improving Toronto FC.
Start with Terry Dunfield.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.929
The Canadian International coming in from
the Vancouver Whitecaps.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.590
Gives them another option in the center and
in the mid field.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.080
He'll probably line up alongside Torsten Frings,
the German ex-international coming over.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.780
As a DP who as signed a couple of weeks ago.
Raises questions as to where Julian de Guzman

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.680
fits into this mid field, as well.
But I think Dunfield does give them another

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.520
option there.
It obviously showed in Vancouver that he could

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.649
be a leader in there.
He was captain for several of the games for

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.239
Vancouver.
And I also think he has a lot of energy going

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.609
forward and moving all throughout that mid
field.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.920
And going the other way to San Jose, Nana
Attakora, Alan Gordon and Jacob Peterson.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.050
Frank Yallop saying he thinks Gordon and Attakora
are guys who are going to come off the bench.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.940
Add some depth to the team.
But that Jacob Peterson finally gets them

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.270
the answer that they've been looking for at
right mid field.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.960
Well I think that Peterson gives them the
speed and the work rate that they need out

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.360
there.
Especially if they're going to get more service

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.690
into the box where Wondolowski can finish
a little bit more.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.840
I do think they're going to miss Ryan Johnson.
Because I really liked what Ryan Johnson did

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.471
for Jamaica in the Gold Cup.
I think he improves Toronto in the attack

00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:34.340
for sure.
I do wonder whether San Jose might have a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.110
move in the back of their minds somewhere
for another striker up top.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.060
Alright well San Jose taking on Columbus this
weekend.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.310
And remember for Columbus.
Jeff Cunningham looking to break the all time

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.710
record for goals in MLS.
So he's tied right now with Jaime Moreno after

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.750
he scored that goal against Vancouver.
Moving onto some other action from this weekend,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.870
Greg.
Seattle hosting Colorado.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.510
This is a big match up, of course.
Last time they played in Colorado.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.710
Brian Mullan broke Steve Zakuani's leg.
That will be the storyline that everyone is

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.990
going to follow, Jason.
However, there are some other great storylines

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.960
in this game.
Especially the attacks.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.129
Watch out for Conor Casey.
He is starting to feel it again.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.860
He's starting to score goals.
He's had a goal in each of his last two games.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.170
And Colorado have been very quietly beginning
to show their form.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.380
As they've gotten healthy again.
Omar Cummings also healthy again.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.720
That helps them a great deal.
On the other side.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.060
Fredy Montero showed what Fredy Montero can
do when he's really in the game.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.000
Against Portland, he was magnificent.
And his own teammates after the game said

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.780
we just told him that he just needed to have
a little bit more motivation.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.700
A little more energy.
And you can see what Fredy Montero's capable

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.590
of.
So I'm actually expecting a lot of fireworks

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.640
out there at CenturyLink.
Not about the Mullan thing.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.010
But actually about goals.
Alright, that game is 4 PM/ET on Fox Soccer

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.220
Channel so you can all check it out.
Other news from Seattle yesterday, though.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.040
Sigi Schmid signs an extension.
He will stay with the team through 2015.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.380
And remember the line that Sigi said.
If they don't win it this year.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.760
It might be time to blow this team up.
So now we have something to watch for.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.840
Well I don't think he's going to blow up this
team no matter what.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.730
Because they have continually improved each
year.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.240
Will they win it this year?
We'll see.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.470
But Sigi now has a couple more years.
He was actually on ExtraTime Radio yesterday

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.550
talking about his team.
And how he feels he has great depth all the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.220
way through.
He feels he can go 18, 19 deep without having

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.360
a drop in quality.
Alright, another game we want to get to before

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.100
the weekend.
FC Dallas is hosting DC United.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.721
DC coming off the upset on the road to New
York.

00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:34.930
Can they do it in Dallas, as well?
It's going to be a little more difficult.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.310
I think Dallas is actually harder to beat
at home than New York are right now certainly.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.550
Dallas it doesn't really matter who goes on
the field for them.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.741
They continue to get results.
Brek Shea continues to have an MVP quality

00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:47.599
season.
For DC, though.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.980
It's all about Dwayne De Rosario.
Since he's arrived, and we saw him in that

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.349
game against New York.
He has shown what he can do in the attack.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.900
And I give a lot of credit to Ben Olsen for
changing his formation.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.680
Changing his style, if you will, as a coach.
And how he wants to play.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.080
That has made De Rosario have some success.
Alright, one final game that we want to get

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.080
to in LA this weekend.
The World Football Challenge began on Wednesday.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.739
Gets going again this weekend.
The LA Galaxy taking on Real Madrid.

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.209
A rematch that they had last year where the
Galaxy actually went into halftime up 2-0.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.919
Yeah they did.
But they didn't get the win.

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.219
So ultimately this is also question of David
Beckham playing against Real Madrid again.

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.500
And you know what?
The LA Coliseum is going to be rocking on

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.219
this night.
I'm looking forward to this game a lot.

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.900
Because I actually think this is one of those
times when Landon Donovan is going to be on

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.430
the top of his game.
He loves big games.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.249
He loves the spotlight.
As soon as you put out Ronaldo and Benzema

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.360
for Real Madrid.
This is the kind of game where Landon Donovan

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.960
says.
Well, oh they're ok, but I'm pretty good too.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.029
And I'm going to go out there and show everybody.
Alright well you can watch that game 10 PM/ET

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:53.990
on ESPN2.
One more reminder.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.309
ExtraTime Radio yesterday.
We had Sigi Schmid.

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:01.039
We also had Nick LaBrocca from Chivas USA.
And robots, Greg.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.120
Robots should be on every episode of ExtraTime,
I think.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.919
Because they are World Cup Champions.
The U.S. Robotic Humanoid Team were the World

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.210
Cup Champions.
And we talked to the guy who was in charge

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.509
of the design of that.
And he explained exactly how they won this

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.099
one.
Yeah, very interesting stuff.

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.901
We want to remind everyone also.
One game that you have to check out this weekend.

00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:25.319
The Women's World Cup team in the Finals of
the FIFA World Cup from Germany.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.490
So that game is Sunday afternoon.
2:45 on ESPN.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.560
That's all we have for The Daily today.
Enjoy the action this weekend.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.810
