00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.470
Let's get some practice drawing cyclohexane
chairs.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.570
We have one drawn here and you can see right
away there are two distinct types of hydrogens

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.810
on the cyclohexane chair.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.760
The ones that are drawn in yellow are pointing
either straight up or straight down.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.100
Those are described as the axial positions,
or the axial hydrogens in this case.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.340
They're called that because if you imagine
and axis going through the center of the cyclohexane,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.480
they'd be parallel to that axis.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.960
When we go to draw this we'll note that the
chair is a zig-zag and the carbons that are

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.219
zig-zag up have an axial straight up, and
the carbons that are zig-zag down have an

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.219
axial straight down.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.420
So you can see that they're alternating carbons.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.559
The other six hydrogens, drawn in white, are
described as the equatorial hydrogens.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.359
These are ones that are either slightly down
or slightly up and they're described as equatorial

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.740
because they go around the equator of the
ring.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.549
So when we go to draw a cyclohexane chair,
we'll notice that this bond angle is, for

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.140
a tetrahedral carbon, is 109.5.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.780
The other thing that I want to point out is
that every bond drawn, with the exception

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.229
of the axial ones - which are straight up
or down, every bond is going to be parallel

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.850
to another bond that's already been drawn.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.479
For example, in the cyclohexane ring this
bond is parallel to this bond.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:48.350
We also have these two bonds being parallel
and then the other two sets of bonds are parallel.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.490
So if we notice that in this drawing, that's
going to help us draw a better cyclohexane

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.250
chair.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.430
You can also notice that we have the letter
"W" here, so this is a letter "W".

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.950
Back here, we have the letter "M".

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.550
Here's a "W".

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.610
Here's an "M".

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.830
So when we compare the positions of these
equatorial hydrogens and some of the carbon-carbon

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.190
bonds in the structure, then we can look for
some patterns that are going to help us draw

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.490
better cyclohexane chairs.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.050
Let's put this up here for reference so we
can keep an eye on it, and get to drawing

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.580
our own chair.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.690
A good way to start - there's several different
ways you can start - but one possibility is

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.130
start by drawing a little bit of a triangle
like this.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.820
Then we're going to draw two parallel lines.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.980
Notice they're ending slightly staggered to
one another.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.900
Then we're going to draw a second triangle.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.450
Remember that every new bond we're going to
form is going to be parallel to some other

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.520
bond.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.680
This bond is going in this direction so that's
where our next angle goes.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.370
Then this bond is going to be parallel to
this one.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.520
That's going to be our cyclohexane chair.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.971
Don't be afraid to erase something and make
some adjustments if you do something and it

00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:18.890
doesn't look quite right.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.190
Now we want to draw in our hydrogens and it's
easy to start with the axial hydrogens because

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.080
those are straight up or straight down.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:35.590
Here we have our three zig-zag ups, so they're
going to have hydrogens straight up.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.760
The other three carbons are zig-zags down
and those are going to have hydrogens straight

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.450
down.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:49.310
Remember that this representation, by convention,
has these carbons on the bottom here are the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.970
front carbons, so this carbon is behind and
so we want to break that line to show that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.370
it's behind this carbon-carbon bond.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.010
Those are our axial hydrogens.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.400
Now we go to draw the equatorial hydrogens
and we're going to do so.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.180
They're going to be pointing slightly up or
slightly down, and they're going to be parallel

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.480
to some other bond that's formed.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.910
If we start on the carbon on the far right
here, there's an axial that's straight up

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.790
and if we draw about 109.5 it will look something
like this.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.210
You can see that this bond is parallel to
this bond.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.010
Then we come down here.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.650
What you want to avoid is drawing the hydrogens
straight across at a 90 degree angle so this

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.450
one is going to be a little wider than 90.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.580
Keep in mind that every carbon is going to
have one hydrogen that's in the up position

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.400
and one that's in the down position.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.980
If we have an axial that's straight up, then
the equatorial is going to be slightly down.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.310
If we have an axial straight down, then the
equatorial is going to be slightly up.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.470
We can come to the other end and draw in those
two as well.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.980
This hydrogen is going to be pointing down
and this hydrogen is going to be pointing

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.980
up.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.440
I think these middle two carbons are usually
the trickiest.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.430
Those are ones that cause some problems, but
if you look for those "M"s and those "W"s

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.990
and keep in mind it has to be parallel to
some other bond.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:31.250
This bond is going to be parallel to this
bond so we're going to draw it here.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.460
Up on this back carbon, we're going to draw
it up in this direction so that it's parallel

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.670
to this bond.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.980
That looks like a pretty good chair.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:51.960
Now another possibility is to not start with
a zig-zag at the bottom and go up, but we

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.960
can start with a triangle like this and then
we're going to draw two parallel bonds going

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:08.080
up and then two going down (I'm not quite
as good at drawing these chairs in this direction!).

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.580
You can see that when you compare these two
chairs it's like you have a mirror image between

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.860
the two - they have a different starting shape.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.020
That chair is just as good to draw, but again
if you want to fill in the hydrogens, we'll

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:29.480
draw our six axial hydrogens - three straight
up and three straight down.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.590
This back carbon - that's going to be a broken
bond.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:43.060
Filling in our equatorial, we can start on
the right end goes slightly up for this one

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.860
and slightly down for the next one.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.889
Then jump to the other side - slightly down,
slightly up.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.520
You can see these equatorial hydrogens on
the ends here kind of pointed toward each

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.610
other.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.150
They're kind of pointing in toward each other.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.430
That's something else you can maybe be on
the lookout for.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.650
Those inside ones, we want to make it parallel
to an existing bond.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.200
This bond is parallel to this bond, and we
see that "M"shape.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:20.910
Up here, we're going to make a "W" and draw
this bond parallel to this bond and we have

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.710
that "W"shape going up.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.170
So there's a few different ways that we can
draw some chair conformations and the key

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:34.190
is to just get some practice so that when
we go to draw substituted cyclohexane chairs,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:41.720
once we put one or more substituent on the
ring, we can place it very nicely in the appropriate

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.180
position on each carbon.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.770
Maybe it's in the axial position, maybe it's
in the equatorial position...but knowing where

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:54.620
those positions are and their relative stereochemistry
is - what their relative shapes are and placements

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.210
are, then we can draw very nice chairs moving
forward.
