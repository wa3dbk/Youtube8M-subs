How to Make Irish Flag Shots

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Alright, welcome back 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to the Friday Night Drinking Club.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is your host, Jöhnny Dîablø -

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Drinks with Diablo !

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And 'cause it's coming up on St. Patrick's Day, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we're going to do the Irish Flag Shooter.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, I've never tried this before, 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so we're going to see if I 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
do an Epic Fail or a Massive Win,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so stay tuned.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You're going to need a few things for this: 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You're going to need creme de menthe, 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Grand Marnier, and Baileys.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And we're going to come back and 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
show you exactly how to do it. Hopefully

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Alright, so we put the creme de menthe in the bottom.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
[ pouring green creme de menthe ]

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Okay, that's one.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Baileys is next.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So you get a spoon, 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and I'm going to try and layer this.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Angle the spoon

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and you just kind of dribble it on the back.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[ meticulously pouring Baileys ]

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
There you go.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We've got a layer.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Oooh-kay.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Next, Grand Marnier.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
[ sighs ]

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
[ begins pouring final layer, Grand Marnier ]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
* Looks like we've got it ! *

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
There you have it, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the Irish Flag Shooter.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You've got green; you've got white; 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you've got orange. Just like an Irish flag.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I don't know if you can see that, but

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
there it is.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I tried one of these * that I botched * during the break,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And, uh, it's really strong

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
with the Marnier.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
When you drink this, the mint and the Marnier

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
come through. It's kind of a strong shooter.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Anyway,
