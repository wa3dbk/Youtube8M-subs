00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.800
We are now joined by Lieutenant Halls and Lieutenant Ewing from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
a subject dear to my heart cause it was my old regiment.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.700
We stand in front of the mainstay of the British Army, the Challenger 2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.600
What is the regiment up to at the moment?

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800
Currently the regiment is deployed in theatres.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.000
They have deployed Herrick 18 to Afghanistan.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
Their role there is dual, two-fold.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.550
They are providing the mounted close combat capability to Task Force Helmand on Warthogs,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.000
which is the British Army's main armoured vehicle out there at the moment.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.200
They have another squadron of dismounted infantry training the Afghan national police.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.000
This will be the regiment’s final tour before we amalgamate next year.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.300
We are obviously quite happy to be seeing Afghan to the finish.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.000
Now you did mention to me that you do occasionally play World of Tanks, which I am quite impressed with.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.300
Yeah, yeah, every now and then yeah, yeah.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
Occasionally, far into it.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500
I'm not maybe as good as I should be being a tank commander, but yeah I used to play quite a bit actually before I joined.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.250
One of the questions I always get asked, being an ex tanky, was:

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.300
Is the game anything like actually being a real tanky?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.500
Are there any comparisons you can make at all between playing World of Tanks and actually being a tank commander?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.400
I suppose broadly in terms of your use of the ground. I'd say it roughly has to be similar.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.600
Bear in mind our average engagements are from a 1000 metres plus.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.900
Anything under 800 metres is considered a close engagement for us.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.500
So engaging people, circling them 25 metres away just doesn't happen.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.300
But in terms of how you use the vehicle and its capability, I think are pretty well reflected.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.550
Hi, this is the Challenger 2 theatre entry standard main battle tank for the British Army.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.600
It's known as Megatron and it's our 80DU,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.450
our trials and development unit tank.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.650
This gets put through its paces and it gets analysed and assessed.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.800
We try and look at as many ways as possible to upgrade the system.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.450
It currently has a 120 mm gun mounted on the front which is also rifled.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.550
You then have your smoke discharges and your remote weapon station mounted on the top,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.100
which can be used in all sorts of environments and for any appropriate situation that you find yourselves in.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.250
The current armour on the sides and on the front is known as "Chobham-class armour”

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400
and it’s restricted classified information.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.000
The British Army holds quite dear to its heart in keeping that information secret.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.450
The only other nation that we share that with is the Americans and even then that's quite restricted itself.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.550
Inside you've got a CV12 power pack Rolls Royce engine, which can get it up to speeds of about 59 km/h.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.500
It can cross almost any type of terrain that you would like to take it over.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.000
As you can see underneath on the wheels, it's got a hydro gas suspension.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.450
The beauty of this is that the faster you go and the more bumps you hit, the smoother the ride is.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.000
So inevitably, the slower you go, the more impact you that you will feel and the closer the ride will come inside your seat.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.900
The turret itself is very fast-moving, full 360 degrees move.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.000
It’s only downside is that it cannot fire over the back decks and that is more for friendly fire reasons.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.600
You've got three crew members that will sit inside the main fighting compartment turret hatch there.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.800
That will be the commander,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.400
your gunner who sits in between his legs and on the opposite side of the gun you will have a loader.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.600
And then only in the front seat, in the main hull part of the engine at the front is the driver.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.700
His responsibility is to take you to the ground from point A to point B using the best grounding cover possible.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.700
That is the Challenger 2, in essence.
