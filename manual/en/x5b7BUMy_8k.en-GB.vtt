00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.970
This is a tutorial on the muscles of the neck
which lie on the anterior triangle. So the

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.809
anterior triangle of the neck is defined by
a few boundaries. So the anterior border of

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.160
the sternocleidomastoid, the midline and the
inferior border of the mandible. So this is

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.980
the anterior triangle we're looking at here.
There are several muscles which lie in this

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.980
triangle.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.400
You've got the suprahyoid muscles, which lie
above the hyoid bone and the infrahyoid muscles

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.700
which lie below the hyoid bone.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.950
So the infrahyoid muscles are known as strap
muscles presumably because they look like

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.850
a strap. I don't know, something like that.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.440
The suprahyoid muscles lie above the hyoid
bone. The hyoid bone is important because

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.600
it serves as a point of attachment for several
muscles. The muscles of the tongue attach

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.440
to the hyoid bone and it's important in swallowing.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.390
There are four suprahyoid muscles. You've
got the digastric, the stylohyoid, the mylohyoid

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.899
(this big, fan-shaped one) and superior to
this you've got the geniohyoid muscle, which

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.909
I'll show you in a moment.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.229
So the stylohyoid muscle is this muscle here,
which connects from the styloid process of

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:42.359
the skull to the lateral surface of the hyoid
bone (lateral of the body of the hyoid). The

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:49.850
name really gives away its origin and insertion,
which is quite useful. So it originates on

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:58.039
the styloid process and inserts onto the lateral
area of the body of the hyoid bone.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:04.189
So the hyoid bone lies at rest roughly at
the level of the base of the mandible and

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:12.590
lies just a little bit above the thyroid cartilage.
Several muscles attach here.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:23.319
This is the stylohyoid muscle. Obviously,
you've got these on both sides. The next muscle

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:31.290
is the digastric muscle. This is this muscle
which loops all the way here, attaches to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:41.750
the hyoid bone and also attaches on the inside
surface of the mandible. So it attaches in

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.980
the digastric fossa and also on the medial
surface of the mastoid process.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.140
The digastric muscle is called 'digastric'
because di- means two and --gastric means

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.379
bellies, so it's a two bellied muscle. You've
got the anterior belly and the posterior belly.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:11.400
So the posterior belly originates on the medial
surface of the mastoid process and inserts

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:22.189
via this tendon onto the hyoid bone and the
anterior belly originates on the digastric

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:30.180
fossa on the inside surface of the mandible
and inserts via the same tendon.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.120
This muscle has various actions depending
on which bone is fixed. So the hyoid bone

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.140
can move up and down. The mandible obviously
has several movements. It can protrude, retract,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.290
depress and elevate. So if the hyoid bone
is fixed in place, then the digastric muscle

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:59.810
will act to open the mouth. So it'll pull
the jaw, the mandible down opening the mouth.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.250
So you can imagine this action. The mastoid
process is obviously fixed. If the hyoid bone

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.430
is fixed in place, then the anterior belly
of the digastric muscle will pull the jaw

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.489
bone down and open the mouth.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.350
If the mandible is fixed however (and obviously,
the mastoid process is fixed), then the digastric

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.980
muscle, both bellies will cause the hyoid
bone to elevate. So it depends which bones

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:37.479
are fixed. It's quite an unusual muscle because
it has three attachments.

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.960
So the next muscle is the mylohyoid bone.
So I'm just going to rotate the model around

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.430
and we're going to look at it from underneath.
So you can see the digastric muscle. It lies

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:57.009
inferior to the mylohyoid, which is this fan-shaped
muscle here. This muscle forms the floor of

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:04.990
the mouth and this muscle can elevate the
hyoid bone. So it's attached on the inside

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.169
surface of the mandible and it originates
on the mylohyoid line on the mandible and

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.880
it inserts obviously onto the hyoid bone.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:25.840
These muscles, several muscles blend in the
midline and originate on the inside surface

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.020
of the mandible on the mylohyoid line. It
lies superior to the gastric muscle and it

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:41.630
supports and elevates the floor of the mouth
and it also elevates the hyoid bone. That's

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.349
the mylohyoid muscle.

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.050
So just superior to the mylohyoid muscle,
you've got the final muscle, the suprahyoid

00:05:50.050 --> 00:06:00.550
muscle, which is the geniohyoid. If I just
remove the mylohyoid, you can see there's

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:09.820
a muscle, a thin muscle, which runs from the
hyoid bone to the inside surface of the mandible

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.759
again.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:22.729
This muscle originates on the inferior mental
spine of the mandible. This is a little thing

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:29.139
that lies on the inside surface of the mandible.
And it inserts onto the hyoid bone.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:36.600
So again, the action of this muscle depends
on which bone is fixed. I'll just remove the

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:44.949
mylohyoid on this side just so we can have
a look. You can see this thin muscle. It lies

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:52.450
superior to the mylohyoid muscle medially.
So you can see this muscle above it. This

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.280
is the muscle of the tongue. This is the genioglossus
muscle, but ignore that for now. Just looking

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:06.810
at this, then you can see this thin muscle
running from the hyoid to the inside surface

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.569
of the mandible.

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:14.590
So it depends on which bone is fixed as to
what the action of this muscle is. If the

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:22.820
hyoid bone is fixed, then the geniohyoid will
open the jaw. It will pull it downwards and

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.349
inwards. Whereas if the mandible is fixed,
it will elevate the hyoid.

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:34.319
The word 'genio' refers in Greek or something
to 'chin'. So if you see the prefix genio-,

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:40.440
it refers to chin. So the genioglossus, this
tongue muscle here, attaches inside on the

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.620
chin on the inside surface of the mandible.
So the geniohyoid runs from the inside of

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.110
the mandible to the hyoid bone.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:59.271
So those are the four suprahyoid muscles in
the anterior triangle of the neck. You've

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:09.220
got the stylohyoid, the digastric, the fan-shaped
mylohyoid and you've got the geniohyoid.
