00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:05.839
What are you waiting for dooshbag?

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.240
That guy’s just standing there.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.840
Go kick his ass!

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.269
Hey youtubers it’s Charlie and since I’m
planning on doing a bunch of videos for Stick

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.150
of Truth I wanted to do an in depth preview
of the game and give you an idea of what all

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.539
those are going to look like.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.710
A lot of the stuff I’ll do will just depend
on what you guys want to see so make sure

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.710
to let me know what you want.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.890
I’m also giving away two twenty dollar digital
steam gift cards.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.020
For the gift card all you have to do is be
a subscriber and leave a comment on this video,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.039
I’ll select two people randomly and announce
winners next week.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.780
On to the fun stuff, this video will be a
straight up preview of the game with details

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.440
and background on the mechanics.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.220
The next video I do will be an early review
on launch day on March 7.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.149
It’s going to be on 360, PS3 and PC.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.170
I’ll be playing the PC version just because
it’s easier to do game capture.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.420
After that I’ll do a mixture of Let’s
Play videos with another review or two as

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.800
I plow through the game.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.980
I can also do walkthroughs if you guys want.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
In the past I haven’t done video game stuff
just because my real life job is full time

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.360
and I like to sleep.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.550
But if I were to ever pull all nighters it
would have to be for something that was either

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.510
really fun or really important.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.570
And I know Stick of Truth will at least be
a ton of fun.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.609
Important things to note: If you are a UK
gamer playing the console versions of this,

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:13.950
you will have a different version of the game.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.850
It got censored and about 7 cut scenes that
were 20 seconds long each were cut.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.810
On account of extreme awesomeness.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.299
So all you have to do if you want the uncensored
version is buy the PC version via Steam or

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.299
elsewhere.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.530
The game itself is the next best thing to
a real 50 plus hour long South Park episode.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.409
So I feel like even if you’re not a gamer
but you love South Park the game is worth

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.409
buying.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.380
Just look at the list of Xbox achievements.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.659
Obviously most if not all these will roll
over to other platforms.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.990
Join the KKK, Let Gingers Bite You 3 Times
Without Blocking, Fling a turd that you created

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.259
at an enemy in combat.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.770
The list gets even crazier.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.770
Shit Your Pants in battle three times.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.719
Geez that’s a lot of poop.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.489
The visual look and Mechanics are all really
good too.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:58.869
For Nintendo fans it looks a lot like Paper
Mario with every South Park reference you

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.069
could ever think of.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.270
The story does have a loose narrative and
the battles are done JRPG turn based style,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.729
but like most western RPG games the achievements
and missions are exploration-based so you

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.900
can complete a lot of the game out of order.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.019
If you’ve played Warcraft or any Raid-Based
MMO then you’ll have a lot easier time with

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.019
the battles.

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.670
There is a strategy element to defeating groups
as you have to make the call to target DPS

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.700
based classes like mages before you can deal
with melee NPCs.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.540
The actual playable classes are Thief, Warrior,
Mage and Jew.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.780
The death mechanics are really funny too.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.430
If you go to heaven you’re greeted by a
bunch of Mormons just like in the series and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.489
as you level up NPCs get more interesting.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.879
Like eventually you might find yourself fighting
a herd of Mongolians on horseback.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.579
Some of the attack bonuses and damage modifiers
you can get are pretty funny too like Protect

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.579
my Balls.

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.560
I’ve always been biased towards RPG games,
mostly JRPG games but I’m a big South Park

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.910
fan and I can’t think of a better way to
waste my life and have fun at the same time.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.500
If you’ve seen any of the breakdown or easter
egg videos I do, I might include some of that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530
stuff in a walkthrough video.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.109
Mostly I’m just looking forward to putting
myself inside a 50 hour plus South Park episode.

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.640
50 hours is kind of a benchmark for most RPG
games like Skyrim if you only play the main

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.959
storyline and mandatory quests.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.560
If you do all the side quests I’m sure you
could stretch Stick of Truth to 120 plus hours

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.620
for anyone that likes to achievement whore.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.560
I won’t start playing till launch day, but
my steam community profile is emergencyawesome.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.739
Be sure to let me know what kind of game videos
you want.

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.689
Including walkthroughs, let’s play and reviews.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.920
Right now click here to learn all about my
picks for my Top 5 Anime Villains and Click

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.719
here for my preview of Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.160
Thanks for watching, see you guys tonight.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.900
High Fives!
