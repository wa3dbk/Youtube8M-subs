00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:08.280
Most kids want stuff – toys, candy, electronics
– and of course they want their parents

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.280
to pay for it. They have the idea that daddy
and mommy just sort of “have money.”

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.570
If you ask most little kids where that money
comes from, they will say daddy works, or

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.890
mommy works, but they don't really get it.
They don't really think about the future,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.750
or deferring gratification, and they really
don't understand what it means in the long

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.620
run if their parents go into debt.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.760
Most voters want stuff – pensions, health
care, welfare – and of course they want

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.760
the “government” to pay for it. They have
the idea that politicians just sort of “have

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:52.550
money.”

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.470
If you ask most voters where that money comes
from, they will say – er – my taxes, but

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.009
they don't really get it. They don't really
think about the future, or deferring gratification,

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.790
and they really don't understand what it means
in the long run if their government goes into

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.200
debt.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.280
Parents often say that their kids should obey
them because they pay the bills, and in particular,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.060
own the house – “As long as you live under
my roof, you’ll live by my rules!” “If

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.590
you don't like it here, feel free to leave!”
Of course, it is very hard for children or teenagers

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.310
to leave home, so the threat is fairly empty,
but it seems to squelch debate anyway.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.350
Patriots often say that citizens should obey
the government because it provides services

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.100
– and in particular, because it runs the
country. “If you live in this country, you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.130
obey the rules.” “America – love it
or leave it.” Of course, it’s very hard

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.659
for people to leave a country – and go where
– to another tax cage? – so the threat

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.490
is fairly empty, but seems to squelch debate
anyway.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.750
In general, parents will take feedback from
their children, but kids don't get any kind

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.750
of binding vote. Parents also often bribe
children to comply, and punish them if they

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.739
disobey – neither of which is any kind of
rational argument.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.980
Governments will take feedback from their
citizens, but citizens don't get any kind

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.450
of binding vote. Governments also bribe citizens
to comply, and punish them if they disobey

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.950
– neither of which is any kind of rational
argument.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.370
Children who are spoiled with appeasement
and unrealistic expectations will throw temper

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.140
tantrums whenever their bribes are limited
in any way.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.860
Government dependents who are spoiled with
appeasement and unrealistic expectations will

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.060
throw temper tantrums whenever their bribes
are limited in any way.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.099
Patriotic propaganda explicitly references
the family, and uses parental metaphors all

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.709
the time…

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.709
The Founding Fathers, the Department Of Homeland
Security, the Fatherland in Germany, Mother

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:27.209
Russia, the Strict Father (Republican) and
the Caring Mother (Democrat), Uncle Sam and

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.489
Homerule. Soldiers are “brothers in arms.”
Stalin was “Father of the Country.” Mao

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.330
was the “Father of the Chinese Revolution.”

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.769
And what’s more American than “Mom and
apple pie”?

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.769
Just look at the parallels – “My country,
right or wrong,” and “Blood is thicker

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.680
than water.”

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.269
The arguments are almost identical…

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.720
If you receive government services, you owe
obedience to the government – just as if

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.519
you take food and shelter from your parents,
you owe obedience to your parents.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.650
Your parents own the house, so you have to
obey them, or leave.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.360
The government owns the country, and so you
have to obey it, or leave.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.129
These “arguments” make no sense, but we
all hear them a thousand times from our parents,

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.469
so when politicians repeat this crap, it's
almost impossible to resist, because it's

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.539
been so deeply ingrained in our brains.

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:43.300
This is why people take politics so personally,
because they're really talking about their

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.999
families.

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:51.789
Numerous studies show that political biases
tend to occur at the unconscious level, in

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.879
patterns formed during early childhood.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.520
Don't you see the pattern?

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.259
The government is an effect of the family.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.569
People try to change governments all the time,
from the top down, using politics and laws

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.680
and lobbying and voting, and it never really
works.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.479
If you want to change the government, change
the family.

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:26.479
If you want a more peaceful society, have
more peaceful families.

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:36.159
Very, very few people can view politics outside
the lens of their own family histories.

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:47.619
Children eventually grow up and understand
working, salaries, income and debt.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.169
Most voters never do.

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:00.169
Most voters view government finances the way
a five-year-old views his parents’ money.

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.539
And the reason for that is simple.

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:10.539
Government schooling starts around the age
of five.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.029
And that's when the indoctrination begins,
and the thinking – stops.
