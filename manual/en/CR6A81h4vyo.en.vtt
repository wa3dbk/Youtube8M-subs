00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:07.960
In this video Pescar Mehedintean fishing site shows you 2 ways of tying the knot for eyeless (paddle) hooks

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.700
First version, that we have presented in an earlier video, is realy simple to do...

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.700
Make a big loop

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.620
As you can see here

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:40.380
Hold together  the hook, the short end of the line and the loop, with your right hand..

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.580
and after that....

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700
...put your hand inside the loop...

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.040
..and start to snell the hook.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.220
Make the first turn, and after that rotate your palm inside the loop...

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.880
...so you can easily make the second turn

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.460
And from now on repeat the same move.Rotate the loop for about a quarter of a turn, and after that pass the loop over the hooks point.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.820
Rotate the loop for about a quarter of a turn, and after that pass the loop over the hooks point, and so on.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.800
At all time keep a bit of a tension in the line, to prevent  twisting. Don't let the line loose..

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.020
..because if you don't keep your hand, or a at least a finger, inside the loop it will twist randomly...

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.880
..and you will be forced to tie the knot again!

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.600
You need to make  between 7 to 9 turns.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.100
Rotate the loop for about a quarter of a turn, and after that pass the loop over the hooks point, and so on.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.740
It's a simple move, and in time you're going to make it automatically

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.360
whoops. While  I'm explaining to you how to do this knot, my line got loose...

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.620
After you have made all the turns, pull the short end of the line.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.600
While doing that, it's a good idea to hold the knot with your other hand

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.600
After pulling the short end of the line, change the hand that's holding the knot, and pull  the other end..

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.060
As you can see..

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.480
...the knot has been formed..

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.540
..but is not proper positioned and it's still loose.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.900
Move the knot along the hooks shank, till you reach the paddle..

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.700
and make sure  that the main  line it's positioned above the paddle

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.900
It's really simple! After that moist the line  and tighten the knot

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.760
When tightening the knot don't forget to pull the line alternatively from each end, using short jerks .

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.680
Never from both ends at the same time.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.120
Like that.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.480
After that trim the loose line

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.620
and this is  first version of the knot..

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.200
The second version..

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.640
..which i'll show to you in about two seconds..

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.620
The second version is similar, till a certain point, with the first version.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.020
We will be tying basicaly the same knot, but in a diferent manner..

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.940
..which is simpler and easier, especially for small hooks

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.880
We will start in the same way .. make a big loop from the line.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.380
Make sure that the end of the line and the main line don't overlap...

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.420
...when you'll start snelling the line

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.280
The main diference between first and second version is that in this version you must hold...

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.220
...the line closer  to the round part of the hook, and make a first turn...

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.940
The second turn will be made towards the hooks paddle.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.340
Observe.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.600
So now we'll be snelling turns towards hooks paddle..

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.320
It's easier this way.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.420
Same number of turns  7 to 9

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.800
At the end  pull the short end of the line

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.360
Hold the knot while doing that

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.160
Pull the other end

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.840
As you can see..

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.100
..our knot have been formed. We must now position the knot, like in the first version..

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.000
..trim the loose end. and this is it!

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.560
It's a beautiful knot.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.980
Very simple. I hope is all clear by now.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.480
And now let's make the knot in real-time!

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.400
I have a piece of braided line here... and an ordinary hook.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.520
this is the hook (it's a number 1 hook)

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.880
and now i'll tie the fist version of the knot. I'm making a big loop...

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.840
...holding  the hook by the paddle

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.460
and start to snell..

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.760
this is the speed wich i usually use..

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.220
I don;t know if you can see anything....

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.040
at the end pull the short end ,hold the knot, pull the other end...

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.440
position the knot...

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.480
pull the knot tight...

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.660
trim the loose end...

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:34.180
I'll use for that a nail clipper,and this is our knot in first version

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.540
and to show you the second version... i'll cut the braided line.. take another hook...

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.500
this is a carp hook

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.940
making the same starter loop...

00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:50.786
i hope is visible

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.340
adjust the short end ,hold the hooks paddle and start snelling

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.900
As you already know,make a first turn  near round part of the hook and the second towards the paddle..

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.100
and continue to the paddle. For me it;s a bit harder to tie this version of the knot, because i don't usually use it...

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.140
but i thought that is no harm in having two versions of the same knot, from which to choose..

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:28.160
after you finished snelling, hold one hand on the knot and tighten the line, first short end and after the other end

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.980
As you can see our knot have been formed

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:43.860
and by the way: this knot can be used to tie  eye hooks as well. There's absolutely no problem doing that

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.300
i'm taking some more line from the spool...

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.120
When tying eye hooks,you must pass the line through the eye of the hook...

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.220
from front to back...

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Don't forget to position the knot corectly

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.580
Tighten the knot by aplying short jerks, alternatively from each end

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.460
See what a solid knot this is....

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.640
after that trim the loose end

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.960
and this is it!

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.460
