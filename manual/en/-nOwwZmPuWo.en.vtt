00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.500
In this tutorial, I'm going to be making this
game that you see here. In further tutorials,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.240
I'm going to build on this game until it's
fairly decent. Have fun!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.950
[Installing TGF2]

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.210
Now first of all, download and install The
Games Factory 2 New Grounds Edition Setup...

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:31.149
file. I'll do this right now. 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.030
Once it's done, load up The Games Factory
2.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:44.990
[Making the game]

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:52.660
Now, let's make the game. Go up to File, click
New. Make this fullscreen. This shows all

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.240
of the levels in your game. Currently, you
only have one. And it's empty. Double click

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.040
on it. This is your level. It's empty. Let's
make some things. Right click on the screen,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.979
and choose 'Insert Object'. Choose 'Active'.
That's all we need at the moment. Now, this

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.299
one's going to be your character. So double-click
on it to get this screen up, and then just

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.180
draw it however you want. I'll be going into
this in more detail in another tutorial. Click

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.820
Okay when you're happy. That's your character.
Now we're going to make the enemy. Right-click

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.240
on the screen, Insert Object, Active. Double
click on it, and... make it red. Because,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.399
clearly, red things are evil. Now we're going
to make a bullet. To do that, right-click

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.700
on the screen, Insert Object, Active. Click
on the level to make it, double click on it.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.890
We're going to make this YELLOW because bullets
are YELLOW. There. Next, we're going to make

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.759
it so that your person can run around the
screen. To do this, select your person, and

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:11.660
in this properties thing, click the movement
tab. In the type, choose... 8 directions.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.690
Now, you can play the game whenever you want
by pressing F7. Or F8 for the entire game.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.110
But... F7 for now. Now, you can move your
character around the screen using the arrow

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.920
buttons. Next, let's make the enemy run around
the screen. To do this, select the enemy,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:39.480
go to the movement tab and choose... bouncing
ball movement. Play the game again, OH. Okay,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.020
we need to stop him from running off the side
of the screen. To do this, we need to make

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.510
our first bit of coding. And when I say 'coding',
I mean... this. Choose the Event Editor button

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.870
at the top of the screen and make a new condition.
To do this, right click, choose the enemy

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:06.340
character, positition, test position of active
2, and tick all of the arrows that indiciate

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.350
that it's leaving the frame area. Once you've
done that, click okay, go across to where

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:25.070
the enemy is in that event, right click, movement,
bounce. Let's play the game again. YES, we

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.350
have a very intelligent enemy. Next, let's
make it so that our character can fire bullets

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.810
at the enemy. To do this, make another event.
Right click on new condition, choose this

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.320
icon, the keyboard, upon pressing the key,
spacebar. There are other ways of doing it,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.920
but this way's simple enough. Go across to
where your character is, right click, launch

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.410
an object. Because he wants to shoot a bullet.
Choose a bullet. And that's fine. Let's play

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.240
the game again. You can now fire out bullets,
but it doesn't do anything when it hits the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.480
enemy. To make it so that it destroys the
enemy, we need to make a third event. Right-click

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:18.720
on 'New Condition', bullet, right click on
that, collisions, another object, enemy, destroy

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:31.150
the enemy. And the bullet. Let's try again.
Yeah! You now have your first game. Well done.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.500
Let's just add some more enemies into it so
that it's more fun. And delete the bullet,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.370
because it's no longer needed on this frame
since it's already spawned in the events.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.750
Ignore everything I just said. Press F7 to
play the game. Oh brilliant! Yeah!!! Now,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.840
should you want to, you can now save the game
by going up to FILE, SAVE AS... and by calling

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.960
it something. If you want to make it into
a format that can be uploaded to newgrounds,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.120
which is the only thing you can do with The
Games Factory 2 Newgrounds Edition, go up

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:16.090
to File, Build, Application. Save. You should
now find the file, wherever you saved it,

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.250
you can now upload that file to newgrounds,
and everyone will play your game. But don't

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.400
do it! It's REALLY bad at the moment. Wait
until the game's better. PLEASE. I hope this

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.070
helps, watch more tutorials to find out how
to make this game into a much better one.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.740
Have fun.
