Hi my name is Uchendah Alete, and on behalf
of Expert Village.com, in this clip we will

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:20.490
be going over how to steam spaghetti. So before
we steam our spaghetti, what we have to do

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:30.970
is boil it first. You fill your regular pot
up with water and then just bring the spaghetti

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:45.680
to a boil, and then we transfer it over to
the steam cooker. Once your spaghetti comes

00:00:45.680 --> 00:01:05.070
to a boil, all you have to do is just transfer
it over to the steam cooker nice and easy.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:25.260
No hassels. You are going to bring it over,
you add the lid and now you can steam the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:36.830
spaghetti. So all it really takes after that
is 5 minutes of steaming, and the spaghetti

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:45.030
should be done. All you got to do before you
take it out is put some water, and splash

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:56.241
the water all over the spaghetti just to moisten
it up, and then you stir it and your spaghetti

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.450
is done and ready to go.
