00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.380
Balfour Beatty Rail Track System is a manufacturer
of capital goods for the rail industry, primarily

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.400
for the UK and export markets.
We are a make to order business. The product

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.310
is safety critical, and so we have to have procedures
and processes in place that can assure that.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
We are approximately 65 million pound in
turnover and we employ around 600 people spread

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.569
over some 7 sites in the UK.

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.930
We were previously dealing with each of the
profit centers as separate trading entities.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.090
We now have a system that works across the
whole business. A lot of the transactions

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.600
that we were previously doing have just disappeared.
From the time we receive a customer order

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.450
to being able to have that on our system,
have the bill of materials loaded and have

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.610
all the purchase orders and internal requisitions
for parts we are going to make actually out into the 
shopfloor

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.610
out to customer is within 24 hours. We would have
taken weeks to do that previously.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.049
AX enables us to use the capacity planning
facility, not only to indicate free capacity

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.909
at one site, but we can do it on a multi site
basis.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.759
The engineers, when they put a bill of materials
together, they will generate a route through

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.759
the factory that the actual item will take. We pick that up in 
planning process to generate a capacity reservation.
It allows us to look where issues

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.709
may arise in relation to overloaded work
centres. It allows us to get a picture of

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.909
50 work centres, all the work that are
going through them over a period of time that

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.200
we specify - we can look two years out.
It helps the production manager out, in terms

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.479
of the kind of shifts and numbers of people
he needs to put on ceratin areas where the risks

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.959
of delivery failure are.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.709
It's helped in the production areas to plan
the work. The level of work that we do now

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.359
is the order of 3 times more products going through
the factory, which has been absorbed by a

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.499
similar number of people.

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.270
Within the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.359
factory environment we have a number of CNC
operating machines which require controlled

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.360
programmes to generate the product. With the
introduction of AX we can generate a route

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.360
and automatically identify the program that
needs to be loaded to the CNC machine automatically.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.540
The system also gives the operator a sequence
of operations that he needs to undertake in

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.300
accordance to a schedule.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.140
Prior to AX we were over-ordering and under-ordering
stock and actually having stock out situations.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.920
Without exception we don't have shortages
now at the point of build.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.540
By generating the bill of materials we identify
parts that either require manufacturing or

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.410
purchasing. AX enables us to identify those
purchase parts automatically.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.390
Within AX you plug in the restraints that
you want and the parameters you need and the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.370
system does the rest. So you don't need to
physically keep an eye on things.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.800
With a doubt it's benefited us with lower
stocks, and it's reduced our stock by 20 %

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.060
in comparison to where we were 
two years ago.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.210
From a customer perspective, they're now able
to get information from Balfour Beatty rail track much

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.960
more readily and accurately.
Balfour Beatty can confidently now look into

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.460
what materials they need to procure and what
capacity they need to reserve within the production

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.600
environment and accurately come up with a
date.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.540
So the customer have much more confidence.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.870
It enables sales to access live information
and to speak to the customer directly rather

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.070
than having to chase through production.
If a client, for example, asks we can instantaneously

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.600
determine when that component will be completed.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.600
Lead time and  service is much more important than price
 in a lot of cases, it gives us the ability to
respond much faster and that is an order winner.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.950
The improvement in the timeliness and the
quality of data is dramatic.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.100
With our previous system, we probably would
have been 7 days after the month's end still

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.650
trying to pull our accounts together.
Our period closed on Saturday, Monday at 8'o'clock

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.130
we had the top level figures just driven straight
out of the system in real time.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.130
It's improved VAT reporting, Bank Reconciliations, Statutary
responsibilities so that's a major benefit to

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.430
us.
The finance department is now 7 people, 2

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.430
less than we had 18 months ago. So we've saved
2 man years of costs.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.410
Columbus have very professional people, very
dedicated people. People who are prepared

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.440
to listen and find joint solutions.
We found from day one really that their professionalism

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.750
was very good. They're very easy to work with.
They knew the product very well. They were

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.910
able to help us to change our processes because
they got experience. We would not have been

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.500
able to do this without Columbus.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.880
We chose AX because it was suitable for our
type of business - Manufacturing. We chose

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.960
AX because we expected to be growing our business
and we wanted a system that would grow with

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.320
us. We wanted a system there was going to
be there in ten years time.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.060
It's clear from the increase in sales and
levels of profitability in the business that

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.639
we made the right choice. It's the right choice
for our business.
