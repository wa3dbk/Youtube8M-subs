We're at the Robert Blackburn
Printmaking Workshop,

00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:11.397
started in 1945 by Robert Blackburn.

00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:12.981
Lithography was invented
for the purpose of

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:14.918
reproducing sheet music.

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:16.755
Instead of writing it once by hand

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:18.789
over and over and over and over,

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.360
Senefelder developed lithography

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.692
for the purpose of writing

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:23.896
that orchestral arrangement one time,

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:26.263
so it could be reproduced,
so that it could be sold

00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:27.980
to multiple orchestras throughout cities

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.100
throughout all over Europe.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.603
That's was its original intention.

00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:32.170
When an artist gets
ahold of something that

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.895
allows you to work in a new way,

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.674
they will always take
those tools and materials

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:39.233
and use them for their
own artistic purposes.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.810
That was the case for engraving.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.782
It was the case for relief
printing or woodcut.

00:00:44.782 --> 00:00:47.355
It's also the case for
digital printmaking now.

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.892
Lithography is based on
a very simple principle

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:52.289
that grease and water resist one another

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.812
and so what you'll see
is a balance of the plate

00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:56.813
being dampened and then rolled over

00:00:56.813 --> 00:00:58.313
with a greasy based ink.

00:00:58.313 --> 00:00:59.931
It's the same as when
you're cleaning dishes.

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:01.699
If you've got a really greasy pan

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.230
and you fill it up with water,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.134
you start putting water in it,

00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:05.812
it starts to pull away from the grease.

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:07.505
The exact same thing is happening here

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:10.478
only it's very finely
controlled placed grease.

00:01:10.478 --> 00:01:13.065
One of the things that
makes lithography so unique

00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:15.379
is that it actually is
the most autographic

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:16.896
of like all the printmaking processes.

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:19.517
It captures the exact mark of the hand

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:21.417
that moves across that surface.

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:25.021
As a result, it gains the most clarity

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.260
from a drawer's perspective
from a direct point of view.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.695
All the other printmaking processes

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:33.145
translate that mark into other ways

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:35.314
versus it just being an absolute record

00:01:35.314 --> 00:01:37.397
of the movement of the hand in that way.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:41.462
So for drawers, lithography is a very

00:01:41.462 --> 00:01:44.176
freeing type of drawing process
because it can be layered.

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:47.276
You can draw in black
and print it in green

00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:49.151
or you can print it in blue or pink.

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:52.016
That level of freedom is
only present in printmaking

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:53.860
and that level of freedom with drawing,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.146
a direct drawing process, is
only available in lithography.
