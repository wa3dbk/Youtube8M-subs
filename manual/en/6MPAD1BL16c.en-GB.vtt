00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.340
I had just finished a masters degree at Aberdeen
University in project management and the job

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:28.400
I have taken in Aberdeen was in asset integrity
management. I knew that I had to up my game

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.900
and Robert Gordon University is the only university
locally that can give me an MSc in asset integrity

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.460
management, so I decided to go with Robert
Gordon. I was also aware of RGU's reputation

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.950
in the industry. I had no fear that I was
doing the right thing. I just had to be sure

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:58.140
that I could dedicate the time necessary because
I wanted to achieve a distinction in masters

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.360
degree for assets and integrity management
and dedicate time to get that level of recognition.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.510
From the personal point of view I had to make
sure that I could dedicate the time. I can

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.440
never get it right the home and work life
balance. I could never get it right, it was

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.760
usually work and home life suffered, so this
time around I had to make sure that there

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.929
is a balance and I would be better person
for it. I knew I could dedicate the time and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.250
I was determined to get the MSc and a determined
to be the best I could be because the distinction

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.830
was important to me as a person and the main
thing was making sure I could dedicate the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.610
time. For me it was pretty straightforward.
I was lucky I could do that. My family was

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:56.479
very supportive as well and I recognised that
when I came from a thesis. The best thing

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.100
about studying with RGU for me personally
was the level of dedication of the staff and

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.030
the lecturers who were always on hand to kind
of guide me. I recognised this is a masters

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.550
degree, it was down to me to go and do the
research and go do the digging and come back

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.060
with the answers to the questions, but if
I was stuck at all, I needed to be guided

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.610
in the right direction, lecturers were absolutely
spot on. I had a lot of fun on the journey

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.450
to the masters degree with the staff of RGU,
they were all available to me. The door was

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.000
always open and they weren't scared it throw
some jibes at me as I'd do to them, so I enjoyed

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.200
my journey here. They were great to work with
and the door was always open and in the best

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.970
possible manner. Nothing was difficult here.
Most of the modules was studied online and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.950
the evenings, weekends, we commended exams,
but if we were stuck we would phone in and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.120
get some time with a lecturer or professor
Jessie Andrews at that time who was a great

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.300
person to work with, great advert for RGU,
but even spending time here, people, young

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:16.230
guys like yourselves would easy get on with
more mature student like myself. A great future.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:26.220
For Laurie MacKay the horizon has really broaden.
I've joined a large oil and gas company in

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:36.350
Aberdeen. Their policy is to coach a mentor,
even mature people like myself and they've

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.920
been very, very supportive. The only person
that is holding Laurie MacKay now is Laurie

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.490
MacKay. I've got two masters degrees and while
I'm in assets integrity which is what the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:53.000
industry really focusing on at the moment
in terms of major accidents hazards and how

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.850
to manage corrosion. There are great opportunities
I can go into, I have meeting now. It taught

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:13.430
us regarding integrity technical matters.
I want to do more, I want to do more studies,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.370
I have an opportunity to actually work with
RGU as a lecturer in corrosion management,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.320
so for me the journey just continues with
RGU. It's been fantastic, really good.
