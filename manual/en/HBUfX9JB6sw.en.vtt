(Luke Tajima, Student
Veteran Association President:

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.876
the University has
shown enormous support

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:24.216
for us veterans throughout
the years

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:25.406
and this event is
the culmination

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:27.396
of that symbolic
gesture...Veterans face a lot

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:29.796
of challenges, with
their service

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.266
and after their service
when they come home.

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.346
And if they choose to
pursue an education,

00:00:35.046 --> 00:00:36.456
there's other challenges there.)

TO A BOWL-BOUND GOPHER
FOOTBALL TEAM.

For the first time since 2009,
Minnesota is bowl eligible,

00:01:13.756 --> 00:01:18.766
clinched with a 17-3 victory
over Illinois last Saturday,

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.536
in large part because of
Donnel Kirkwood's 152 yards

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:23.256
and two touchdowns.

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:26.956
This marks an amazing turnaround
under Head Coach Jerry Kill,

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:30.776
as last year, in Kill's
first season at the helm,

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:38.176
the Gophers finished with
a subpar record of 3-9.

00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:43.076
