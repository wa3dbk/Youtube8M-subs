Hi, I'm Bob Street with Houdini Home Repair
on behalf of Expert Village. In this clip,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.120
we will carry the beam up the ladder, clamp
and shoot the nails. It's bad when your help

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:29.970
don't show up, you've got to use a camera.
Are you ready? How you feeling? You've got

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:46.680
to come my way some. Are you good?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:59.559
According to my marks, I need to go your way.
Is that right? According to yours too? Oops,

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:09.400
right there according. Okay, me too. Put your
clamp on there. We've clamped that off, nailed

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.470
it, drilled some holes. Put the other one
on. Nail gun, we'll just tack this up here

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:33.410
so it is secure while we drill it. Tacking
this on here right now. Give it some support

00:01:33.410 --> 00:02:19.549
while we drill and there you go.
