00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:04.578
[Jeff Hillyer]  This is a what we 
 call Titan Number Three here at 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.253
Western Illinois University in the Botany Greenhouse 

00:00:08.457 --> 00:00:13.436
and it and three others that we have here all came from the 

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:17.115
University of Wisconsin up at Madison in two thousand and two 

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:18.585
we obtained them as seed  

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.058
and so we've been growing them on  

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.170
and were fortunate enough we had one bloom 

00:00:25.738 --> 00:00:28.111
in May that was Titan Number One

00:00:29.047 --> 00:00:31.353
Titan Number Two is lagging a little behind 

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:35.130
but Titan Number Three here decided to go head and produce 

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:38.273
inflorescence for us so hopefully in the next couple of days 

00:00:38.373 --> 00:00:39.342
it will open up.

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:42.351
In the time lapse you can see 

00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:46.208
Titan Number Two is in the front and then

00:00:46.462 --> 00:00:47.866
Titan Number Three is in the background 

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.876
and it's just over two or three days four days showing 

00:00:52.044 --> 00:00:55.888
the growth of both of them 

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.529
and you kind of see that Titan Three 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.804
grows more faster than Two 

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:04.712
so Two's the one closest 

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:06.517
and Three is in the back at the moment 

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:09.659
what's interesting about Titan Arum's

00:01:09.927 --> 00:01:12.669
or their also called Corpse Flowers 

00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:17.113
one thing is their not fairly common  

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:19.420
their indigenous to the rain forest 

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:21.927
of Sumatra which is in Indonesia 

00:01:22.294 --> 00:01:24.300
and there's just not a lot of them 

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:26.305
probably even in the wild 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.383
even in cultivated places like greenhouses 

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:31.654
there's very few of them.  

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.895
More and more now but still not that many

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.537
so it's kind of you know rare plant on that aspect 

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:40.340
and when it does open up and bloom fully 

00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:45.330
it emits an odor like rotting flesh or a corpse 

00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:48.600
and that's to attract pollinators to it.  

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:56.720
Another interesting factor about it

00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:59.540
it produces the largest inflorescence in the world 

00:01:59.698 --> 00:02:01.840
and the inflorescence is many flowers 

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.440
just not one single flower.
