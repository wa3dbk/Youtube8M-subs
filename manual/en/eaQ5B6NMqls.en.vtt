00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.750
Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen is the special
edition re-release of the original Dragon's

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.220
Dogma game developed and published by Capcom,
with loads of bonus content such as new items,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.370
enemies, areas and skills.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.930
The game also has various tweaks designed
to make life a little easier, such as an improved

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.390
menu system.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.210
For those who didn't play it when it first
came out, Dragon's Dogma takes place in a

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.640
medieval fantasy world over-ran with monsters
specifically from European and Greek mythology.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.519
You'll find everything from goblins to orcs
to cyclops to griffons to chimeras.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.400
There are also a few other monsters thrown
into the Dark Arisen expansion, such as Death.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.250
You will frequently encounter these boss level
monsters while just roaming around; they usually

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.750
are not pre-determined encounters but instead
random spawns, which makes exploration unnerving

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.180
at all times.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.340
In Dragon's Dogma you play as The Arisen,
a person chosen by a dragon to decide the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.340
fate of the world.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.421
At the start of the game the Dragon attacks
your village and rips out your heart when

00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.840
you try to fight it, and then names you as
the sole champion who may defeat it before

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.110
whisking off for the bulk of the game.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.350
Hordes of monsters infest the lands, which
you must fend off through the storyline quests

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.210
until the Dragon believes you are strong enough
to face it, at which point he will abduct

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.080
the NPC you have the highest affinity with,
which will become your love interest.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.310
The story sounds a'bit cliche but I assure
you, the developers have put a very unique

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.680
twist on the whole "save lover from the evil
dragon" story.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.500
This is a dark world and there are some sinister
forces at work screwing with humanity, which

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.460
you'll see some of after you beat the game
and start the "Post Game" experience that

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.870
allows you to continue questing even after
the end game credits roll.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.509
The gameplay is highly non-linear, and it's
possible to miss a lot of quests if you proceed

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.040
to the main storyline too quickly without
exploring or at least using a walkthrough

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.090
guide.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.090
Many quests tend to also have more than one
outcome, although every quest has only one

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.450
clear "good" result which can make things
difficult for the player, since there is only

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.511
ever one correct path that will result in
gaining something beneficial.

00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:27.511
As an example, a quest to gather evidence
for a guilty or innocent verdict against a

00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:28.511
wealthy merchant has only the innocent verdict
being of benefit to the player, and if the

00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:29.511
merchant is found guilty he will be removed
from the game with you losing access to his

00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:30.511
powerful items for sale.

00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:31.511
However, it's not obvious to the player that
you should help him prove his innocence because

00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:32.511
a prior quest showed the merchant is a'bit
of an asshole after evicting peasants from

00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:33.511
a house he just bought from the original landlord,
and it takes a lot more effort to secure the

00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:34.511
guilty verdict than the innocent one.

00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:35.511
Despite this narrow-mindedness in the quest
design, Dragon's Dogma is still a great deal

00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:36.511
of fun.

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:37.920
It is indisputably one of the best RPGs I've
played in some years.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.389
It has just the right balance of dialogue
and action, and there is enough character

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.939
customization to satisfy my min-max urges.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.709
Furthermore it has a level of challenge you
don't normally see in games these days; the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.159
difficulty is somewhere around Dark Souls
level, although you can cheat if you want

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.799
by hiring much higher level NPCs -- in this
game called Pawns -- to join your party.

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.730
And if you're connected to the internet, many
of these Pawns might actually be the Main

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.670
Pawn of another player who can join your game
with their skills, items and knowledge of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.980
how to complete quests or fight certain types
of monsters able to benefit your party.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.592
Concerning the class system -- in this game
referred to as Vocations -- there are all

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:20.049
kinds of cool combinations you can do; because
stat growth upon level up is tied to what

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.439
Vocation your character was at the time of
level up, it's necessary to train in numerous

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.840
Vocations to get the kind of character that
you want.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.680
Personally I maxed out Fighter, Strider and
Warrior for their Augment skills, and then

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.670
I spent about 30 levels in Assassin to crank
up my Attack and Stamina points before switching

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.870
to Mystic Knight at level 40 for the rest
of my character's career.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.439
This enabled my Mystic Knight to have some
solid attack and defense in addition to great

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.930
deal of Stamina points for spamming his Magic
attacks.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.019
It took a lot of effort but I'm very happy
with the character I built, and I think whoever

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.290
designed the Vocations did a hell of a job.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.370
In the Dark Arisen expansion, the Vocations
have gained new skills; each class now has

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.389
a third tier of skills to learn, and there
are also new universal class Augments which

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:06.980
can be unlocked by finding cursed artifacts
in the expansion dungeon, Bitterblack Island.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.560
Once you find one of these items, both you
and your Main Pawn NPC can learn the Special

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.620
Augment, adding another level of tactical
depth to the system.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.650
Furthermore you can also upgrade Dragonforged
items to new tiers of enhancement using the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.210
rarify option from an NPC on the second floor
of the island.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.310
Lastly, there are over 100 new pieces of equipment
to be found on the island, obtained by collecting

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.540
Cursed equipment and Purifying it from the
NPC at the top level of the island who serves

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.820
as the inn.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.680
The Dark Arisen expansions claims to offer
a 'third tier of skills' but that's not precisely

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.850
how it works -- some of the new items are
skill rings that, when equipped on characters

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.699
using certain skills, upgrades that skill
to a stronger form.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.310
As an example I found skill rings to upgrade
my Mystic Knight's shield skills, such as

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.710
allowing the Holy enchantment to last longer.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.810
The Post Game is fun and offers a lot of powerful
gear in the end-game dungeon, The Everfall

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.550
but I have one major complaint: the use of
random number generators for the chest loot.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.419
In The Everfall there is very low chance to
obtain powerful equipment, and it's possible

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.080
to farm the gear by saving the game in front
of a chest, and then killing yourself if you

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.290
don't get the item that you want so that you
can open the chest again.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.342
This process is incredibly tedious, and the
game developers obviously intended it to work

00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:18.740
this way, else they wouldn't give you an item
that can kill your character.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.129
I don't understand why they made it work this
way, though.

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.430
What enjoyment is there in spending hours
-- literally, hours -- human sacrificing my

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.449
character to the god of epic loot just trying
to get some super .001 % drop item out of

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:31.449
a chest?

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.060
Why can't the chests just have the awesome
gear at 100% drop rate, as a reward for clearing

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.760
the post game dungeon?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.759
The random number generator chests don't add
any additional challenge to the game; they

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.930
just require a degree of patience and a ridiculous
amount of free time.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.949
I mean, that hour I spent trying to get a
single piece of equipment to appear could

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:46.949
have been spent playing the actual game.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.370
At any result, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen
is a solid title and I encourage any hardcore

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.370
RPG gamer to pick it up.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.400
It's the most fun in a game I've had in a
long, long time.
