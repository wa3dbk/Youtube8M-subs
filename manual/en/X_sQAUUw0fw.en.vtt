My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.780
make the traditional French dish poule au
pot, or chicken in a pot. At this point we're

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.090
going to gather up our chicken and we're also
going to gather up our twine and we're also

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:26.649
going to gather up our margarine, as well
as our smashed up garlic. But what we're going

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.869
to do is we're going to stuff our chicken
with it. So, I've gone ahead and made sure

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.739
that the chicken was rinsed out really well
on the inside. I ran cold water through it

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.760
for about five minutes. I've gone ahead and
got all the giblet's out of the inside as

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.809
well. I went ahead and trimmed out any of
the fat that was right here to keep the opening

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.820
here. Now this chicken does still have the
neck on it. I'm keeping that on for flavor

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.480
purposes. You can cut if off if you want.
But there is a lot of flavor in the neck so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.489
we're just going to keep it in at least as
far as I'm concerned. So, let's take our margarine

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.660
here, and one other thing I wanted to show
you real quick. When you take your garlic,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.790
before you even put your garlic inside the
chicken we're going to season our garlic with

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.391
some salt and some pepper. That is going to
be, that's going to help season the inside

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.151
of your chicken, a lot easier than trying
to actually get salt and pepper inside of

00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:29.320
there which could, could prove difficult.
So, take your margarine whole just like this.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.430
This is the easy part. Now you want to push
it this way inside the chicken because if

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.310
you push it this way it's going to push the
leaves back. So go in the direction of the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.350
growth of the herb, and just.. The same thing
with our garlic. I like to take the garlic,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:56.410
just a few pieces at a time and really, really
work them up inside there. Let's take some

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.790
more of that seasoned garlic here, and what's
going to happen here is this isn't going to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.900
be all the seasoning this chicken's going
to get, but it's going to be a lot of it.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.500
And we're going to get, it's going to steam
the inside and it's going to steam from the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.920
inside out and that garlic and the salt and
pepper and the margarine is going to permeate

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.840
from the inside out of the chicken. It's going
to be a really really beautiful result. Tie

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:34.200
it around one foot, or foot, leg.
And we're just going to truss up the feet

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.980
just like that. What that does is that helps
keep first of all the shape of the chicken.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.980
But second of all that also helps keep all
the herbs inside when we go to brown it off.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.170
So, and you can also truss the wings to the
body if you really want to. I don't see a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.760
reason to. So that's it for our chicken. I'm
also going to season the outside here in a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.170
second, but we'll get to that in a moment.
